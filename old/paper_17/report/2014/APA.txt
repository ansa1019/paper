item 1a.   risk factors

our business activities and the value of our securities are subject to significant hazards and risks, including those described below. if any of such events should occur, our business, financial condition, liquidity, and/or results of operations could be materially harmed, and holders and purchasers of our securities could lose part or all of their investments. additional risks relating to our securities may be included in the prospectuses for securities we issue in the future.
crude oil and natural gas price volatility, including the recent decline in prices for oil and natural gas, could adversely affect our operating results and the price of our common stock.
our revenues, operating results, and future rate of growth depend highly upon the prices we receive for our crude oil and natural gas production. historically, the markets for crude oil and natural gas have been volatile and are likely to continue to be volatile in the future. for example, the nymex daily settlement price for the prompt month oil contract in 2014 ranged from a high of $107.26 per barrel to a low of $53.27 per barrel. the nymex daily settlement price for the prompt month natural gas contract in 2014 ranged from a high of $6.15 per mmbtu to a low of $2.89 per mmbtu. the market prices for crude oil and natural gas depend on factors beyond our control. these factors include demand for crude oil and natural gas, which fluctuates with changes in market and economic conditions, and other factors, including:
   worldwide and domestic supplies of crude oil and natural gas;

   actions taken by foreign oil and gas producing nations;

   political conditions and events (including instability, changes in governments, or armed conflict) in crude oil or natural gas producing regions;

   the level of global crude oil and natural gas inventories;

   the price and level of imported foreign crude oil and natural gas;

   the price and availability of alternative fuels, including coal and biofuels;

   the availability of pipeline capacity and infrastructure;

   the availability of crude oil transportation and refining capacity;

   weather conditions;

   domestic and foreign governmental regulations and taxes; and

   the overall economic environment.

our results of operations, as well as the carrying value of our oil and gas properties, are substantially dependent upon the prices of oil and natural gas, which have declined significantly since june 2014. lower crude oil and natural gas prices for an extended period may have the following effects on our business:
   limiting our financial condition, liquidity, and/or ability to fund planned capital expenditures and operations;

   reducing the amount of crude oil and natural gas that we can produce economically;

   causing us to delay or postpone some of our capital projects;

   reducing our revenues, operating income, and cash flows;

   limiting our access to sources of capital, such as equity and long-term debt;

   reducing the carrying value of our crude oil and natural gas properties resulting in additional non-cash write-downs; or

   reducing the carrying value of goodwill.

18
our ability to sell natural gas or oil and/or receive market prices for our natural gas or oil may be adversely affected by pipeline and gathering system capacity constraints and various transportation interruptions.
a portion of our natural gas and oil production in any region may be interrupted, limited, or shut in, from time to time for numerous reasons, including as a result of weather conditions, accidents, loss of pipeline or gathering system access, field labor issues or strikes, or capital constraints that limit the ability of third parties to construct gathering systems, processing facilities, or interstate pipelines to transport our production, or we might voluntarily curtail production in response to market conditions. if a substantial amount of our production is interrupted at the same time, it could temporarily adversely affect our cash flows.
future economic conditions in the u.s. and certain international markets may materially adversely impact our operating results.
current global market conditions, and uncertainty, including economic instability in europe and certain emerging markets, is likely to have significant long-term effects. global economic growth drives demand for energy from all sources, including fossil fuels. a lower future economic growth rate could result in decreased demand growth for our crude oil and natural gas production as well as lower commodity prices, which would reduce our cash flows from operations and our profitability.
weather and climate may have a significant adverse impact on our revenues and productivity.
demand for oil and natural gas are, to a degree, dependent on weather and climate, which impact the price we receive for the commodities we produce. in addition, our exploration and development activities and equipment can be adversely affected by severe weather, such as freezing temperatures, hurricanes in the gulf of mexico, storms in the north sea, or cyclones offshore australia, which may cause a loss of production from temporary cessation of activity or lost or damaged equipment. our planning for normal climatic variation, insurance programs, and emergency recovery plans may inadequately mitigate the effects of such weather conditions, and not all such effects can be predicted, eliminated, or insured against.
our operations involve a high degree of operational risk, particularly risk of personal injury, damage, or loss of equipment, and environmental accidents.
our operations are subject to hazards and risks inherent in the drilling, production, and transportation of crude oil and natural gas, including:
   well blowouts, explosions, and cratering;

   pipeline or other facility ruptures and spills;

   fires;

   formations with abnormal pressures;

   equipment malfunctions;

   hurricanes, storms, and/or cyclones, which could affect our operations in areas such as on- and offshore the gulf coast, north sea, and australia, and other natural disasters and weather conditions; and

   surface spillage and surface or ground water contamination from petroleum constituents, saltwater, or hydraulic fracturing chemical additives.

failure or loss of equipment as the result of equipment malfunctions, cyber attacks, or natural disasters such as hurricanes, could result in property damages, personal injury, environmental pollution and other damages for which we could be liable. litigation arising from a catastrophic occurrence, such as a well blowout, explosion, or fire at a location where our equipment and services are used, or ground water contamination from hydraulic fracturing chemical additives may result in substantial claims for damages. ineffective containment of a drilling
19
well blowout or pipeline rupture, or surface spillage and surface or ground water contamination from petroleum constituents or hydraulic fracturing chemical additives could result in extensive environmental pollution and substantial remediation expenses. if a significant amount of our production is interrupted, our containment efforts prove to be ineffective or litigation arises as the result of a catastrophic occurrence, our cash flows, and, in turn, our results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.
cyber attacks targeting systems and infrastructure used by the oil and gas industry may adversely impact our operations.
our business has become increasingly dependent on digital technologies to conduct certain exploration, development and production activities. we depend on digital technology to estimate quantities of oil and gas reserves, process and record financial and operating data, analyze seismic and drilling information, communicate with our employees and third party partners, and conduct many of our activities. unauthorized access to our digital technology could lead to operational disruption, data corruption or exposure, communication interruption, loss of intellectual property, loss of confidential and fiduciary data, loss or corruption of reserves or other proprietary information. also, digital technologies control nearly all of the oil and gas distribution and refining systems in the united states and abroad which are necessary to transport and market our production. a cyber attack directed at oil and gas distribution systems could damage critical distribution and storage assets or the environment, delay or prevent delivery of production to markets and make it difficult or impossible to accurately account for production and settle transactions.
while we have experienced cyber attacks, we have not suffered any material losses relating to such attacks; however, there is no assurance that we will not suffer such losses in the future. further, as cyber attacks continue to evolve, we may be required to expend significant additional resources to continue to modify or enhance our protective measures or to investigate and remediate any vulnerabilities to cyber attacks.
the enactment of new or stricter laws and regulations and other related developments in the gulf of mexico as well as our other locations following the deepwater horizon incident could adversely affect apaches business.
in response to the deepwater horizon incident in the u.s. gulf of mexico in april 2010, and as directed by the secretary of the u.s. department of the interior, the bureau of ocean energy management (boem) and the bureau of safety and environmental enforcement (bsee) issued new guidelines and regulations regarding safety, environmental matters, drilling equipment, and decommissioning applicable to drilling in the gulf of mexico. these new regulations imposed additional requirements with respect to development and production activities in the gulf of mexico and delayed the approval of applications to drill in both deepwater and shallow-water areas.
the enactment of new or stricter regulations in the united states and other countries and increased liability for companies operating in this sector could adversely affect apaches operations in the u.s. gulf of mexico as well as in our other locations.
our commodity price risk management and trading activities may prevent us from benefiting fully from price increases and may expose us to other risks.
to the extent that we engage in price risk management activities to protect ourselves from commodity price declines, we may be prevented from realizing the benefits of price increases above the levels of the derivative instruments used to manage price risk. in addition, our hedging arrangements may expose us to the risk of financial loss in certain circumstances, including instances in which:
   our production falls short of the hedged volumes;

   there is a widening of price-basis differentials between delivery points for our production and the delivery point assumed in the hedge arrangement;

20
   the counterparties to our hedging or other price risk management contracts fail to perform under those arrangements; or

   an unexpected event materially impacts oil and natural gas prices.

the credit risk of financial institutions could adversely affect us.
we have exposure to different counterparties, and we have entered into transactions with counterparties in the financial services industry, including commercial banks, investment banks, insurance companies, other investment funds, and other institutions. these transactions expose us to credit risk in the event of default of our counterparty. deterioration in the credit markets may impact the credit ratings of our current and potential counterparties and affect their ability to fulfill their existing obligations to us and their willingness to enter into future transactions with us. we have exposure to financial institutions in the form of derivative transactions in connection with our hedges and insurance companies in the form of claims under our policies. in addition, if any lender under our credit facility is unable to fund its commitment, our liquidity will be reduced by an amount up to the aggregate amount of such lenders commitment under our credit facility.
we are exposed to counterparty credit risk as a result of our receivables.
we are exposed to risk of financial loss from trade, joint venture, joint interest billing, and other receivables. we sell our crude oil, natural gas, and ngls to a variety of purchasers. as operator, we pay expenses and bill our non-operating partners for their respective shares of costs. some of our purchasers and non-operating partners may experience liquidity problems and may not be able to meet their financial obligations. nonperformance by a trade creditor or non-operating partner could result in significant financial losses.
a downgrade in our credit rating could negatively impact our cost of and ability to access capital.
we receive debt ratings from the major credit rating agencies in the united states. factors that may impact our credit ratings include debt levels, planned asset purchases or sales, and near-term and long-term production growth opportunities. liquidity, asset quality, cost structure, product mix, and commodity pricing levels and others are also considered by the rating agencies. we have been placed on negative watch by one rating agency and negative outlook by another rating agency. a ratings downgrade could adversely impact our ability to access debt markets in the future, increase the cost of future debt, and potentially require us to post letters of credit or other forms of collateral for certain obligations.
market conditions may restrict our ability to obtain funds for future development and working capital needs, which may limit our financial flexibility.
the credit markets are subject to fluctuation and are vulnerable to unpredictable shocks. we have a significant development project inventory and an extensive exploration portfolio, which will require substantial future investment. we and/or our partners may need to seek financing in order to fund these or other future activities. our future access to capital, as well as that of our partners and contractors, could be limited if the debt or equity markets are constrained. this could significantly delay development of our property interests.
our ability to declare and pay dividends is subject to limitations.
the payment of future dividends on our capital stock is subject to the discretion of our board of directors, which considers, among other factors, our operating results, overall financial condition, credit-risk considerations, and capital requirements, as well as general business and market conditions. our board of directors is not required to declare dividends on our common stock and may decide not to declare dividends.
any indentures and other financing agreements that we enter into in the future may limit our ability to pay cash dividends on our capital stock, including common stock. in addition, under delaware law, dividends on capital stock may only be paid from surplus, which is defined as the amount by which our total assets exceeds
21
the sum of our total liabilities, including contingent liabilities, and the amount of our capital; if there is no surplus, cash dividends on capital stock may only be paid from our net profits for the then current and/or the preceding fiscal year. further, even if we are permitted under our contractual obligations and delaware law to pay cash dividends on common stock, we may not have sufficient cash to pay dividends in cash on our common stock.
discoveries or acquisitions of additional reserves are needed to avoid a material decline in reserves and production.
the production rate from oil and gas properties generally declines as reserves are depleted, while related per-unit production costs generally increase as a result of decreasing reservoir pressures and other factors. therefore, unless we add reserves through exploration and development activities or, through engineering studies, identify additional behind-pipe zones, secondary recovery reserves, or tertiary recovery reserves, or acquire additional properties containing proved reserves, our estimated proved reserves will decline materially as reserves are produced. future oil and gas production is, therefore, highly dependent upon our level of success in acquiring or finding additional reserves on an economic basis. furthermore, if oil or gas prices increase, our cost for additional reserves could also increase.
we may not realize an adequate return on wells that we drill.
drilling for oil and gas involves numerous risks, including the risk that we will not encounter commercially productive oil or gas reservoirs. the wells we drill or participate in may not be productive, and we may not recover all or any portion of our investment in those wells. the seismic data and other technologies we use do not allow us to know conclusively prior to drilling a well that crude or natural gas is present or may be produced economically. the costs of drilling, completing, and operating wells are often uncertain, and drilling operations may be curtailed, delayed, or canceled as a result of a variety of factors including, but not limited to:
   unexpected drilling conditions;

   pressure or irregularities in formations;

   equipment failures or accidents;

   fires, explosions, blowouts, and surface cratering;

   marine risks such as capsizing, collisions, and hurricanes;

   other adverse weather conditions; and

   increases in the cost of, or shortages or delays in the availability of, drilling rigs and equipment.

future drilling activities may not be successful, and, if unsuccessful, this failure could have an adverse effect on our future results of operations and financial condition. while all drilling, whether developmental or exploratory, involves these risks, exploratory drilling involves greater risks of dry holes or failure to find commercial quantities of hydrocarbons.
material differences between the estimated and actual timing of critical events or costs may affect the completion and commencement of production from development projects.
we are involved in several large development projects and the completion of these projects may be delayed beyond our anticipated completion dates. our projects may be delayed by project approvals from joint venture partners, timely issuances of permits and licenses by governmental agencies, weather conditions, manufacturing and delivery schedules of critical equipment, and other unforeseen events. delays and differences between estimated and actual timing of critical events may adversely affect our large development projects and our ability to participate in large-scale development projects in the future. in addition, our estimates of future development costs are based on current expectation of prices and other costs of equipment and personell we will need to
22
implement such projects. our actual future development costs may be significantly higher than we currently estimate. if costs become too high, our development projects may become uneconomic to us and we may be forced to abandon such development projects.
we may fail to fully identify potential problems related to acquired reserves or to properly estimate those reserves.
although we perform a review of properties that we acquire that we believe is consistent with industry practices, such reviews are inherently incomplete. it generally is not feasible to review in-depth every individual property involved in each acquisition. ordinarily, we will focus our review efforts on the higher-value properties and will sample the remainder. however, even a detailed review of records and properties may not necessarily reveal existing or potential problems, nor will it permit us as a buyer to become sufficiently familiar with the properties to assess fully and accurately their deficiencies and potential. inspections may not always be performed on every well, and environmental problems, such as groundwater contamination, are not necessarily observable even when an inspection is undertaken. even when problems are identified, we often assume certain environmental and other risks and liabilities in connection with acquired properties. there are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of proved oil and gas reserves and future production rates and costs with respect to acquired properties, and actual results may vary substantially from those assumed in the estimates. in addition, there can be no assurance that acquisitions will not have an adverse effect upon our operating results, particularly during the periods in which the operations of acquired businesses are being integrated into our ongoing operations.
the bp acquisition and/or our liabilities could be adversely affected in the event one or more of the bp entities become the subject of a bankruptcy case.
in the event that one or more of the bp entities were to become the subject of a case or proceeding under title 11 of the united states code or any other relevant insolvency law or similar law (which we collectively refer to as insolvency laws), a court may find that the three definitive purchase and sale agreements (the bp purchase agreements) we entered into in connection with our 2010 acquisition of properties from bp (the bp properties) are executory contracts, in which case such bp entities may, subject to relevant insolvency laws, have the right to reject the agreements and refuse to perform their future obligations under them. in this event, our ability to enforce our rights under the bp purchase agreements could be adversely affected.
additionally, in a case or proceeding under relevant insolvency laws, a court may find that the sale of the bp properties constitutes a constructive fraudulent conveyance that should be set aside. while the tests for determining whether a transfer of assets constitutes a constructive fraudulent conveyance vary among jurisdictions, such a determination generally requires that the seller received less than a reasonably equivalent value in exchange for such transfer or obligation and the seller was insolvent at the time of the transaction, or was rendered insolvent or left with unreasonably small capital to meet its anticipated business needs as a result of the transaction. the applicable time periods for such a finding also vary among jurisdictions, but generally range from two to six years. if a court were to make such a determination in a proceeding under relevant insolvency laws, our rights under the bp purchase agreements, and our rights to the bp properties, could be adversely affected.
crude oil and natural gas reserves are estimates, and actual recoveries may vary significantly.
there are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating crude oil and natural gas reserves and their value. reservoir engineering is a subjective process of estimating underground accumulations of crude oil and natural gas that cannot be measured in an exact manner. because of the high degree of judgment involved, the accuracy of any reserve estimate is inherently imprecise, and a function of the quality of available data and the engineering and geological interpretation. our reserves estimates are based on 12-month average prices, except where contractual arrangements exist; therefore, reserves quantities will change when actual prices increase or decrease.
23
in addition, results of drilling, testing, and production may substantially change the reserve estimates for a given reservoir over time. the estimates of our proved reserves and estimated future net revenues also depend on a number of factors and assumptions that may vary considerably from actual results, including:
   historical production from the area compared with production from other areas;

   the effects of regulations by governmental agencies, including changes to severance and excise taxes;

   future operating costs and capital expenditures; and

   workover and remediation costs.

for these reasons, estimates of the economically recoverable quantities of crude oil and natural gas attributable to any particular group of properties, classifications of those reserves and estimates of the future net cash flows expected from them prepared by different engineers or by the same engineers but at different times may vary substantially. accordingly, reserves estimates may be subject to upward or downward adjustment, and actual production, revenue and expenditures with respect to our reserves likely will vary, possibly materially, from estimates.
additionally, because some of our reserves estimates are calculated using volumetric analysis, those estimates are less reliable than the estimates based on a lengthy production history. volumetric analysis involves estimating the volume of a reservoir based on the net feet of pay of the structure and an estimation of the area covered by the structure. in addition, realization or recognition of proved undeveloped reserves will depend on our development schedule and plans. a change in future development plans for proved undeveloped reserves could cause the discontinuation of the classification of these reserves as proved.
certain of our undeveloped leasehold acreage is subject to leases that will expire over the next several years unless production is established on units containing the acreage.
a sizeable portion of our acreage is currently undeveloped. unless production in paying quantities is established on units containing certain of these leases during their terms, the leases will expire. if our leases expire, we will lose our right to develop the related properties. our drilling plans for these areas are subject to change based upon various factors, including drilling results, oil and natural gas prices, the availability and cost of capital, drilling, and production costs, availability of drilling services and equipment, gathering system and pipeline transportation constraints, and regulatory approvals.
we may incur significant costs related to environmental matters.
as an owner or lessee and operator of oil and gas properties, we are subject to various federal, provincial, state, local, and foreign country laws and regulations relating to discharge of materials into, and protection of, the environment. these laws and regulations may, among other things, impose liability on the lessee under an oil and gas lease for the cost of pollution clean-up and other remediation activities resulting from operations, subject the lessee to liability for pollution and other damages, limit or constrain operations in affected areas, and require suspension or cessation of operations in affected areas. our efforts to limit our exposure to such liability and cost may prove inadequate and result in significant adverse effects to our results of operations. in addition, it is possible that the increasingly strict requirements imposed by environmental laws and enforcement policies could require us to make significant capital expenditures. such capital expenditures could adversely impact our cash flows and our financial condition.
our north american operations are subject to governmental risks that may impact our operations.
our north american operations have been, and at times in the future may be, affected by political developments and by federal, state, provincial, and local laws and regulations such as restrictions on production, changes in taxes, royalties and other amounts payable to governments or governmental agencies, price or
24
gathering rate controls, and environmental protection laws and regulations. new political developments, laws, and regulations may adversely impact our results of operations.
pending regulations related to emissions and the impact of any changes in climate could adversely impact our business.
certain countries where we operate, including canada and the united kingdom, either tax or assess some form of greenhouse gas (ghg) related fees on our operations. exposure has not been material to date, although a change in existing regulations could adversely affect our cash flows and results of operations.
in the event the predictions for rising temperatures and sea levels suggested by reports of the united nations intergovernmental panel on climate change do transpire, we do not believe those events by themselves are likely to impact our assets or operations. however, any increase in severe weather could have a material adverse effect on our assets and operations.
the proposed u.s. federal budget for fiscal year 2016 includes certain provisions that, if passed as originally submitted, will have an adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations, and cash flows.
on february 2, 2015, the office of management and budget released a summary of the proposed u.s. federal budget for fiscal year 2016. the proposed budget repeals many tax incentives and deductions that are currently used by u.s. oil and gas companies. these provisions include elimination of the ability to fully deduct intangible drilling costs in the year incurred; increases in the taxation of foreign source income; repeal of the manufacturing tax deduction for oil and natural gas companies; and an increase in the geological and geophysical amortization period for independent producers. should some or all of these provisions become law, our taxes will increase, potentially significantly, which would have a negative impact on our net income and cash flows. this could also cause us to reduce our drilling activities in the u.s. since none of these proposals have yet to be voted on or become law, we do not know the ultimate impact these proposed changes may have on our business.
derivatives regulation included in current or proposed financial legislation and rulemaking could impede our ability to manage business and financial risks by impacting our use of derivative instruments as hedges against fluctuating commodity prices.
the dodd-frank act, which was signed into law in july 2010, contains significant derivatives regulation. the act provides for a potential exception from these clearing and collateral requirements for commercial end-users and it includes a number of defined terms that will be used in determining how this exception applies to particular derivative transactions and the parties to those transactions. we expect to qualify as a commercial end-user. as required by the dodd-frank act, the commodities futures and trading commission (cftc) has promulgated numerous rules to define these terms. the cftc, in conjunction with prudential regulators, have proposed rules for financial counterparties entering into swap transactions with end-users that do not mandate margin. further, a recent piece of legislation, the terrorism risk insurance program reauthorization act of 2015, amended the dodd-frank act such that neither the cftc nor the prudential regulators can enact rules requiring mandatory margin from entities that qualify as commercial end-users. however, the cftc is expected to issue rules regarding capital requirements for swap dealers later this year. these rules could cause swap dealers subject to them, to seek to require collateral from their counterparties to avoid reserving balance sheet against exposures.
from time to time, we use derivative instruments with respect to a portion of our expected crude oil and natural gas production in order to reduce the impact of commodity price fluctuations and enhance the stability of cash flows to support our capital investment programs and acquisitions. given our current investment grade status, we would not anticipate that our derivative contracts should require the posting of margin regardless of the size of our liability positions. however, depending on the rules and definitions adopted by the cftc, our counterparties may be subject to regulation that could cause them to seek that we post significant amounts of
25
collateral with our dealer counterparties for derivative transactions to avoid capital charges by their regulator. requirements to post cash collateral could result in negative impacts on our liquidity and financial flexibility and also cause us to incur additional debt and/or reduce capital investment.
proposed federal, state, or local regulation regarding hydraulic fracturing could increase our operating and capital costs.
several proposals are before the u.s. congress that, if implemented, would either prohibit or restrict the practice of hydraulic fracturing or subject the process to regulation under the safe drinking water act. several states are considering legislation to regulate hydraulic fracturing practices that could impose more stringent permitting, transparency, and well construction requirements on hydraulic-fracturing operations or otherwise seek to ban fracturing activities altogether. hydraulic fracturing of wells and subsurface water disposal are also under public and governmental scrutiny due to potential environmental and physical impacts, including possible contamination of groundwater and drinking water and possible links to earthquakes. in addition, some municipalities have significantly limited or prohibited drilling activities and/or hydraulic fracturing, or are considering doing so. we routinely use fracturing techniques in the u.s. and other regions to expand the available space for natural gas and oil to migrate toward the wellbore. it is typically done at substantial depths in very tight formations.
although it is not possible at this time to predict the final outcome of the legislation regarding hydraulic fracturing, any new federal, state, or local restrictions on hydraulic fracturing that may be imposed in areas in which we conduct business could result in increased compliance costs or additional operating restrictions in the u.s.
a deterioration of conditions in egypt or changes in the economic and political environment in egypt could have an adverse impact on our business.
deterioration in the political, economic, and social conditions or other relevant policies of the egyptian government, such as changes in laws or regulations, export restrictions, expropriation of our assets or resource nationalization, and/or forced renegotiation or modification of our existing contracts with egpc, or threats or acts of terrorism by groups such as isis, could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. our operations in egypt contributed 23 percent of our 2014 production and accounted for 12 percent of our year-end estimated proved reserves. at year-end 2014, 18 percent of our estimated discounted future net cash flows and 9 percent of our net capitalized oil and gas property was attributable to egypt. these totals reflect our consolidated interests in egypt including sinopecs one-third noncontrolling interest.
international operations have uncertain political, economic, and other risks.
our operations outside north america are based primarily in egypt, australia, and the united kingdom. on a barrel equivalent basis, approximately 43 percent of our 2014 production was outside north america, and approximately 31 percent of our estimated proved oil and gas reserves on december 31, 2014, were located outside north america. as a result, a significant portion of our production and resources are subject to the increased political and economic risks and other factors associated with international operations including, but not limited to:
   general strikes and civil unrest;

   the risk of war, acts of terrorism, expropriation and resource nationalization, forced renegotiation or modification of existing contracts;

   import and export regulations;

   taxation policies, including royalty and tax increases and retroactive tax claims, and investment restrictions;

26
   price control;

   transportation regulations and tariffs;

   constrained natural gas markets dependent on demand in a single or limited geographical area;

   exchange controls, currency fluctuations, devaluation, or other activities that limit or disrupt markets and restrict payments or the movement of funds;

   laws and policies of the united states affecting foreign trade, including trade sanctions;

   the possibility of being subject to exclusive jurisdiction of foreign courts in connection with legal disputes relating to licenses to operate and concession rights in countries where we currently operate;

   the possible inability to subject foreign persons, especially foreign oil ministries and national oil companies, to the jurisdiction of courts in the united states; and

   difficulties in enforcing our rights against a governmental agency because of the doctrine of sovereign immunity and foreign sovereignty over international operations.

foreign countries have occasionally asserted rights to oil and gas properties through border disputes. if a country claims superior rights to oil and gas leases or concessions granted to us by another country, our interests could decrease in value or be lost. even our smaller international assets may affect our overall business and results of operations by distracting managements attention from our more significant assets. certain regions of the world in which we operate have a history of political and economic instability. this instability could result in new governments or the adoption of new policies that might result in a substantially more hostile attitude toward foreign investments such as ours. in an extreme case, such a change could result in termination of contract rights and expropriation of our assets. this could adversely affect our interests and our future profitability.
the impact that future terrorist attacks by groups such as isis or regional hostilities as have occurred in egypt and libya may have on the oil and gas industry in general, and on our operations in particular, is not known at this time. uncertainty surrounding military strikes or a sustained military campaign may affect operations in unpredictable ways, including disruptions of fuel supplies and markets, particularly oil, and the possibility that infrastructure facilities, including pipelines, production facilities, processing plants, and refineries, could be direct targets of, or indirect casualties of, an act of terror or war. we may be required to incur significant costs in the future to safeguard our assets against terrorist activities.
our operations are sensitive to currency rate fluctuations.
our operations are sensitive to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, particularly between the u.s. dollar and the canadian dollar, the australian dollar, and the british pound. our financial statements, presented in u.s. dollars, may be affected by foreign currency fluctuations through both translation risk and transaction risk. volatility in exchange rates may adversely affect our results of operations, particularly through the weakening of the u.s. dollar relative to other currencies.
we face strong industry competition that may have a significant negative impact on our results of operations.
strong competition exists in all sectors of the oil and gas exploration and production industry. we compete with major integrated and other independent oil and gas companies for acquisition of oil and gas leases, properties, and reserves, equipment, and labor required to explore, develop, and operate those properties, and marketing of oil and natural gas production. crude oil and natural gas prices impact the costs of properties available for acquisition and the number of companies with the financial resources to pursue acquisition opportunities. many of our competitors have financial and other resources substantially larger than we possess and have established strategic long-term positions and maintain strong governmental relationships in countries in
27
which we may seek new entry. as a consequence, we may be at a competitive disadvantage in bidding for drilling rights. in addition, many of our larger competitors may have a competitive advantage when responding to factors that affect demand for oil and natural gas production, such as fluctuating worldwide commodity prices and levels of production, the cost and availability of alternative fuels, and the application of government regulations. we also compete in attracting and retaining personnel, including geologists, geophysicists, engineers, and other specialists. these competitive pressures may have a significant negative impact on our results of operations.
our insurance policies do not cover all of the risks we face, which could result in significant financial exposure.
exploration for and production of crude oil and natural gas can be hazardous, involving natural disasters and other events such as blowouts, cratering, fire and explosion and loss of well control, which can result in damage to or destruction of wells or production facilities, injury to persons, loss of life, or damage to property and the environment. our international operations are also subject to political risk. the insurance coverage that we maintain against certain losses or liabilities arising from our operations may be inadequate to cover any such resulting liability; moreover, insurance is not available to us against all operational risks.
item 7.   managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations

apache corporation, a delaware corporation formed in 1954, is an independent energy company that explores for, develops, and produces natural gas, crude oil, and natural gas liquids. we currently have exploration and production interests in five countries: the u.s., canada, egypt, australia, and the u.k. north sea. apache also pursues exploration interests in other countries that may over time result in reportable discoveries and development opportunities.
the following discussion should be read together with the consolidated financial statements and the notes to consolidated financial statements set forth in part iv, item 15 of this form 10-k, and the risk factors and related information set forth in part i, item 1a and part ii, item 7a of this form 10-k.
executive overview strategy apaches mission is to grow a profitable global exploration and production company in a safe and environmentally responsible manner for the long-term benefit of our shareholders. our growth strategy focuses on economic growth through exploration and development drilling, supplemented by occasional strategic acquisitions and portfolio high-grading through asset divestitures.
the companys foundation for future growth is driven by our significant producing asset base and large undeveloped acreage positions. this allows for growth through sustainable lower-risk drilling opportunities, balanced by higher-risk, higher-reward exploration. we closely monitor drilling and acquisition cost trends in each of our core areas relative to product prices and, when appropriate, adjust our capital budgets accordingly and allocate funds to projects based on expected value. we do this through a disciplined and focused process that includes analyzing current economic conditions, projected rate of return on internally generated drilling inventories, and opportunities for tactical acquisitions or leasehold purchases that add substantial drilling prospects or, occasionally, provide access to new core areas that could enhance our portfolio.
over the last five years, apache has increasingly focused on its north american onshore resource base. recent drilling successes and acquisitions of acreage positions across north america have built a robust drilling inventory for our permian, gulf coast, and other onshore regions. we believe that this area is capable of driving our growth and performance over the next several years. as part of this strategy, we conducted a company-wide review of our portfolio and our operations in an effort to best position apache for the long-term benefit of our shareholders. this has resulted in several key divestitures during the last eighteen months and the recent announcement and agreed sale of our kitimat and wheatstone lng projects. we believe our efforts will ultimately position the company with an established base portfolio of assets that allows for flexibility in capital allocation and provides a platform for sustainable growth. this is especially important given the volatility in oil and gas commodities.
throughout the cycles of our industry, our focus on having a portfolio of core assets and a conservative capital structure has underpinned our long-term strategic decisions and we remain steadfast to the business principles that have guided apaches progress since our inception. a strong sense of urgency, empowerment of our employees, effective incentive systems, and an independent mindset are at the heart of how we build value.
2015 outlook the rapid decline in the price of oil at the end of 2014 and into the first quarter of 2015 has been dramatic; however, we believe this environment will provide future growth opportunities for companies that have moved aggressively in response to the price drop. as we cannot predict the length or depth of this oil price correction, or the timing and extent of any potential rebound, we have moved quickly and decisively regarding what we can

control: the timing and levels of capital spending and our cost structure. specifically, during the third quarter of 2014 we were operating 91 rigs onshore in north america, and by the end of february 2015, our rig count was reduced to 27 rigs. we also reduced the number of completion crews and will delay completing some of our wells in backlog until the associated service costs align with the current commodity price environment. in addition to well cost initiatives, we have taken steps to reduce both lease operating and general and administrative expenses and will continue to take proactive measures to reduce them further. these actions were taken with the goal of quickly reducing well costs to a level that will enable us to generate profitable rates of return under todays depressed commodity prices environment.
we have initially set our 2015 capital budget at $3.8 billion, which is approximately 60 percent lower than the prior year, as a result of our response to the changing market conditions, operating cash flow forecasts and divested assets. of this amount, approximately $2.1 billion to $2.3 billion is allocated for projects in north america, with the remaining amount allocated across our international regions. our budgeted amounts exclude expenditures attributable to a one-third non-controlling interest in egypt. while some funds have been committed for certain 2015 exploration wells and development projects, the majority of our capital activity is discretionary and subject to acceleration, deferral, or cancelation as conditions warrant. we closely monitor commodity prices, service cost levels, regulatory impacts, and numerous other industry factors and routinely adjust our budgets in response to changing market conditions and operating cash flow forecasts. with the current capital program, we are projecting our production to be relatively flat compared to 2014, when adjusting for divested assets.
key financial and operating results results for the year ended december 31, 2014 include:
   daily production of oil, natural gas, and natural gas liquids averaged 647 mboe/d during 2014. excluding the impact of the recently divested assets in the gulf of mexico shelf, canada, and south texas, production for the year would have increased 5 percent from 2013.

   liquids production for the year averaged 387 mboe/d, with crude oil representing 83 percent of total liquids production. north american onshore liquids production increased 17 percent, averaging 209 mboe/d in 2014
compared to 179 mboe/d in 2013.

   oil and gas production revenues totaled $13.7 billion, down $2.2 billion from $15.9 billion in 2013, reflecting the impact of divestitures and lower realized prices compared to the prior year.

   net cash provided by continuing operating activities totaled $8.4 billion, a decrease of 13 percent compared to 2013.

                 apache reported a $5.4 billion loss attributable to common stock, or $14.06 per diluted common share, compared to income of $2.2 billion, or $5.50 per share, in 2013. earnings for 2014 reflect the after-tax impact of oil and gas property write-downs totaling $3.1 billion, impairments totaling $2.1 billion, deferred tax adjustments totaling $2.1 billion, and a $517 million loss on discontinued operations in argentina. earnings for 2013 reflect the after-tax impact of oil and gas property write-downs totaling $541 million, deferred tax adjustments totaling $197 million, and a $191 million loss on discontinued operations in argentina.

operational developments exploration, exploitation, and development activities our internally generated exploration and drilling opportunities provide the foundation for our growth. highlights of our 2014 drilling successes, exploration discoveries, and other opportunities for long-term growth are discussed below. the prior-year comparisons include volumes from properties in the gulf of mexico and canada that have since been divested.

north america
   north america onshore liquids averaged 208,769 barrels per day, up 17 percent over prior year production, as a direct result of our active onshore drilling activity during the year. gas production in north america onshore was down 16 percent compared to the prior year, a function of divestiture activity.

   north america onshore liquids production represented 54 percent of our worldwide liquids production and 32 percent of our overall production.

   the permian region averaged 40 operated rigs during the year, drilling 728 gross wells, 549 net wells. drilling activity in the region resulted in a production increase of 25 percent relative to the prior year. over half of the regions production is crude oil and 19 percent is ngls. combined, this represents almost a third of apaches total liquids production for 2014.

   the central region averaged 28 operated rigs during the year, drilling 307 gross wells, 203 net wells, in plays such as the granite wash, marmaton and cleveland. the region has recently shifted its focus to the more prospective prospects in the canyon lime play in the whittenburg basin, where we recently started flow back on our first four-well pad.

   the gulf coast region averaged 9 operated rigs during the year, drilling 77 gross wells, 62 net wells. in the east texas eagle ford play, the region brought on 14 new wells in the reveille area of brazos county where we continue to progress the play and enhance our economics by lowering well costs and refining our geological assessment. liquids production was up 18 percent relative to the prior year.

   the canada region averaged 8 operated rigs during the year, drilling 106 gross wells, 88 net wells. canada further established key plays in the duvernay and montney formations with a focus on reducing drilling and completion costs. in the duvernay, we began drilling our first seven-well pad and expect to see test rates in the third quarter of 2015. our montney drilling has been focused in the wapiti area.

international
   the egypt region continued an active drilling program for the year, averaging 27 rigs and drilling 220 gross wells, 195 net wells. several new field discoveries were announced during the year based on successful drilling and exploration activity. these include ptah and berenice field discoveries in the fourth quarter, which appear to be two of apaches largest oil field discoveries in egypt over the last 15 years.

   the north sea region averaged 5 rigs, drilling 22 gross wells, 19 net wells. during the year, the region was able to achieve record production in the fourth quarter of 80,806 boe/d. just as significant, the region successfully completed the regularly scheduled annual maintenance turnaround across all operated assets ahead of schedule and without incident.

       the australia region announced in august 2014 an oil discovery at the phoenix south 1 exploration well in australias offshore canning basin. early tests have confirmed at least four discrete oil columns in the triassic lower keraudren formation. further drilling and evaluation is planned for 2015. in addition, successful commencement of production from the balnaves oil development occurred late in the third quarter of 2014.

   the australia regions coniston development project is projected for first oil in the first half of 2015 upon completion of required upgrades and capacity expansion on the fpso vessel.

crude oil prices a substantial portion of our oil production is sold at prevailing market prices, which fluctuate in response to many factors that are outside of the companys control. average realized crude oil prices for 2014 were down 10 percent compared to 2013, a direct result of the sharply lower benchmark oil prices in the fourth quarter of 2014.
continued volatility in the commodity price environment reinforces the importance of our asset portfolio. while the market price received for natural gas varies among geographic areas, crude oil tends to trade within a tighter global range. price movements for all types and grades of crude oil generally move in the same direction. crude oil prices realized in 2014 averaged $91.94 per barrel; however, international dated brent crudes and sweet crude from the u.s. gulf coast continue to be priced at a premium to wti-based prices. in 2014 we realized these premium prices on approximately 55 percent of our crude oil production. our egypt, australia, and north sea regions, which collectively comprised 53 percent of our 2014 worldwide oil production, received international dated brent pricing with 2014 oil realizations averaging $96.46 per barrel.
natural gas prices natural gas, which currently has a limited global transportation system, is subject to price variances based on local supply and demand conditions. our primary markets include north america, egypt, australia, and the u.k. an overview of the market conditions in our primary gas-producing regions follows:
   north america has a common market; most of our gas is sold on a monthly or daily basis at either monthly or daily market prices. our north american regions averaged $4.24 per mcf in 2014, up from $3.61 per mcf in 2013.

   in egypt, our gas is sold to egpc, primarily under an industry pricing formula indexed to dated brent crude oil with a maximum gas price of $2.65 per mmbtu, plus an upward adjustment for liquids content. under a legacy oil-indexed contract, which expired at the end of 2012, there was no price cap for our gas up to 100 mmcf/d of gross production. overall, the region averaged $2.96 per mcf in 2014, down 1 percent from the prior year.

   australia has historically had a local market with a limited number of buyers and sellers resulting in mostly long-term, fixed-price contracts that are periodically adjusted for changes in the local consumer price index. during 2014, the region averaged $4.43 per mcf, unchanged from 2013 pricing.

   natural gas from the north sea beryl field is processed through the sage gas plant operated by apache. the gas is sold to a third party at the st. fergus entry point of the national grid on a national balancing point index price basis. the region averaged $8.29 per mcf in 2014, a 21 percent decrease from an average of $10.43 per mcf in 2013.

ngl prices apaches ngl production is sold under contracts with prices at market indices based on local supply and demand conditions, less the costs for transportation and fractionation, or on a weighted-average sales price received by the purchaser.
crude oil revenues
2014 vs. 2013 during 2014 crude oil revenues totaled $10.8 billion, approximately 15 percent lower than the 2013 total of $12.6 billion, driven by a 10 percent decrease in average oil prices and a 5 percent decrease in worldwide production. average daily production in 2014 was 320.4 mb/d, with prices averaging $91.94 per barrel. crude oil represented 78 percent of our 2014 oil and gas production revenues and 50 percent of our equivalent production, compared to 79 and 47 percent, respectively, in the prior year. lower realized prices reduced revenues $1.3 billion, while lower production volumes reduced revenues an additional $565 million.
40
worldwide oil production from continuing operations decreased 16.8 mb/d. however, when excluding production from the gulf of mexico shelf, south texas, and canadian asset divestitures, oil production increased 18.2 mb/d. this increase was driven by production growth of 20.1 mb/d in our permian region as a result of higher drilling and recompletion activity, partially offset by a decrease in production from the north sea on natural decline.
2013 vs. 2012 during 2013 crude oil revenues totaled $12.6 billion, $307 million lower than the 2012 total of $12.9 billion, driven by a 1 percent decrease in worldwide production and average realized prices. average daily production in 2013 was 337.2 mb/d, with prices averaging $102.62 per barrel. crude oil represented 79 percent of our 2013 oil and gas production revenues and 47 percent of our equivalent production, compared to 79 and 47 percent, respectively, in the prior year. lower production volumes reduced revenues $224 million, while slightly lower realized prices reduced revenues an additional $83 million.
worldwide oil production from continuing operations decreased 5.0 mb/d, however, when excluding the gulf of mexico shelf and canadian assets that were sold during 2013, oil production increased 4.0 mb/d, driven by growth of 23.7 mb/d from our north american regions. our permian and central regions increased production by 11.9 mb/d and 8.6 mb/d, respectively, as a result of higher drilling and recompletion activity. production from our remaining property base in canada increased 2.1 mb/d, or 14 percent, as a result of our continued focus on liquids-rich drilling targets. these increases were partially offset by a 19.7 mb/d decrease in production from our international regions. oil production from egypt decreased 10.2 mb/d, of which 7.8 mb/d was related production used to pay taxes and, under the terms of our production sharing contracts, has no economic impact to apache. australias production decreased 9.6 mb/d as a result of natural decline from our pyrenees and van gogh fields.
natural gas revenues
2014 vs. 2013 natural gas revenues of $2.3 billion for 2014 were $298 million lower than 2013, the result of a 19 percent decrease in production volumes offset by a 9 percent increase in realized prices. worldwide production decreased 355.4 mmcf/d, lowering revenues by $533 million. realized prices in 2014 averaged $4.11 per mcf, an increase of $0.34 per mcf compared to 2013, which increased revenues by $235 million.
worldwide gas production from continuing operations decreased 19 percent. however, excluding production from the gulf of mexico shelf, south texas, and canadian asset divestitures, gas production increased 4.7 mmcf/d. this increase was driven by production growth of 28.0 mmcf/d in the permian region as a result of higher drilling and recompletion activity. egypts net production increased 13.8 mmcf/d as a result of our successful drilling program with new wells coming on-line during 2014, and production from the north sea increased 5 mmcf/d on stronger than expected well performance. offsetting this increase were production decreases of 20 mmcf/d from our remaining properties in canada, a result of a shift in our drilling and recompletion activity from dry gas to liquids-rich gas properties and 9.5 mmcf/d in australia as a result of lower customer takes under existing contractual arrangements.
2013 vs. 2012 natural gas revenues of $2.6 billion for 2013 were $342 million lower than 2012, the result of a 8 percent decrease in production volumes and a 3 percent decrease in realized prices. worldwide production decreased 170.3 mmcf/d, lowering revenues by $242 million. realized prices in 2013 averaged $3.77 per mcf, a decrease of $0.13 per mcf from 2012, which reduced revenues by an additional $100 million.
worldwide gas production from continuing operations decreased 8 percent; however, excluding production from the gulf of mexico shelf and canadian assets sold during 2013, gas production declined only 2 percent, or 34 mmcf/d. production declined 66 mmcf/d from our remaining properties in canada, a result of a shift in our drilling and recompletion activity from dry gas to liquids-rich gas properties. production from our u.s. deepwater region decreased 26 mmcf/d on natural decline. these decreases were partially offset by production increases of 52.6 mmcf/d in our u.s. onshore regions resulting from drilling activity focusing on liquids-rich targets, 9.4 mmcf/d in australia on volumes from our macedon field discovery, which commenced operations in the third quarter, and 2.7 mmcf/d in egypt.

ngl revenues
2014 vs. 2013 ngl revenues totaled $668 million in 2014, an increase of $16 million from 2013, the result of a 7 percent increase in production volumes partially offset by a 4 percent decrease in realized prices. worldwide production from continuing operations rose 4.5 mb/d, adding $45 million to revenues. this increase was primarily driven by drilling and recompletion activity in the u.s. permian region. realized prices in 2014 averaged $27.28 per mcf barrel, a decrease of $1.28 per barrel, which reduced revenues by $29 million.
2013 vs. 2012 ngl revenues totaled $652 million in 2013, an increase of $132 million from 2012, the result of a 51 percent increase in production volumes partially offset by a 17 percent decrease in realized prices. worldwide production from continuing operations rose 21.1 mb/d, adding $219 million to revenues. this increase was primarily driven by drilling and recompletion activity in the u.s. central and permian regions. realized prices in 2013 averaged $28.56 per mcf barrel, a decrease of $5.75 per barrel, which reduced revenues by $87 million.
operating expenses the table below presents a comparison of our expenses on an absolute dollar basis and an equivalent unit of production (boe) basis. our discussion may reference expenses on a boe basis, on an absolute dollar basis or both, depending on context. all 2014 and 2013 operating expenses include costs attributable to a noncontrolling interest in egypt. operating expenses for all periods exclude discontinued operations in argentina.

2014 vs. 2013 recurring full-cost depletion expense decreased $147 million on an absolute dollar basis: $414 million on lower volumes partially offset by an increase of $267 million from a higher average cost rate per boe. our full-cost depletion rate increased $1.44 to $20.11 per boe reflecting increased cost for exploration and development activity over the past several years.
2013 vs. 2012 recurring full-cost depletion expense increased $301 million on an absolute dollar basis: $358 million on rate partially offset by a decrease of $57 million from lower volumes. our full-cost depletion rate increased $1.49 to $18.67 per boe reflecting acquisition and drilling costs that exceed our historical levels.
additional dd&a under the full-cost method of accounting, the company is required to review the carrying value of its proved oil and gas properties each quarter on a country-by-country basis. under these rules, capitalized costs of oil and gas properties, net of accumulated dd&a and deferred income taxes, may not exceed the present value of estimated future net cash flows from proved oil and gas reserves, net of related tax effects and discounted 10 percent per annum and adjusted for cash flow hedges. estimated future net cash flows are calculated using end-of-period costs and an unweighted arithmetic average of commodity prices in effect on the first day of each of the previous 12 months, held flat for the life of the production, except where prices are defined by contractual arrangements.
during 2014, we recorded $4.4 billion ($2.8 billion net of tax) and $589 million ($224 million net of tax) in non-cash write-downs of the carrying value of the companys u.s. and north sea proved oil and gas properties, respectively. if oil prices do not recover significantly from the current futures market price indication, the company expects further write-downs of the carrying value of its oil and gas properties, which may be material to the companys consolidated financial statements, throughout the remainder of 2015.
in 2013 we recorded non-cash write-downs of the carrying value of the companys proved oil and gas properties totaling $995 million. the after-tax impact of these write-downs was $356 million in the u.s. and $139 million in the north sea. during the year, the company also exited operations in kenya and recorded $46 million net of tax to additional dd&a related to the impairment of the carrying value of the kenyan oil and gas property leases.
in 2012 we recorded a non-cash write-down on the carrying value of our proved oil and gas property balances in canada of $1.9 billion ($1.4 billion net of tax). the company also recorded $28 million of additional dd&a related to the write-off of the carrying value of our oil and gas properties in new zealand upon exiting the country and $15 million of seismic costs incurred in countries where apache is pursuing exploration opportunities but has not yet established a presence.
lease operating expenses lease operating expenses (loe) include several key components, such as direct operating costs, repair and maintenance, and workover costs.
direct operating costs generally trend with commodity prices and are impacted by the type of commodity produced and the location of properties (i.e., offshore, onshore, remote locations, etc.). fluctuations in commodity prices impact operating cost elements both directly and indirectly. they directly impact costs such as power, fuel, and chemicals, which are commodity price based. commodity prices also affect industry activity and demand, thus indirectly impacting the cost of items such as rig rates, labor, boats, helicopters, materials, and supplies. oil, which contributed nearly half of our 2014 production, is inherently more expensive to produce than natural gas. repair and maintenance costs are typically higher on offshore properties.

gathering and transportation we generally sell oil and natural gas under two common types of agreements, both of which include a transportation charge. one is a netback arrangement, under which we sell oil or natural gas at the wellhead and collect a lower relative price to reflect transportation costs to be incurred by the purchaser. in this case, we record sales at the netback price received from the purchaser. alternatively, we sell oil or natural gas at a specific delivery point, pay our own transportation to a third-party carrier, and receive a price with no transportation deduction. in this case, we record the separate transportation cost as gathering and transportation costs.
in the u.s. and canada we sell oil and natural gas under both types of arrangements. in the north sea, we pay transportation charges to a third-party carrier. in australia, oil and natural gas are sold under netback arrangements. in egypt, our oil and natural gas production is primarily sold to egpc under netback arrangements; however, we also export crude oil under both types of arrangements.
the following table presents gathering and transportation costs we paid directly to third-party carriers for each of the periods presented:

2014 vs. 2013 gathering and transportation costs decreased $15 million from 2013. canadas 2014 costs decreased $32 million from a decline in production primarily associated with divestitures. the u.s. costs for 2014 increased $9 million as compared to 2013 primarily as a result of increased production in the central and permian regions from increased drilling activity partially offset by a decrease from the gulf of mexico asset sales. egypt costs were down $2 million from decreases in the world scale freight rates. north sea costs increased $10 million on increased ngl activity and oil transportation tariffs.
44
2013 vs. 2012 gathering and transportation costs decreased $7 million from 2012. the u.s. costs for 2013 increased $15 million as compared to 2012 primarily as a result of increased production in the permian and central region from increased drilling activity. egypt costs were up $3 million from increases in the world scale freight rates. north sea costs decreased $17 million. canadas costs decreased $8 million from a decline in activity.
taxes other than income taxes other than income primarily consist of u.k. petroleum revenue tax (prt), australian petroleum resource rent tax (prrt), severance taxes on properties onshore and in state or provincial waters off the coast of the u.s. and australia, and ad valorem taxes on properties in the u.s. and canada. severance taxes are generally based on a percentage of oil and gas production revenues, while the u.k. prt is assessed on net receipts from qualifying fields in the u.k. north sea. australian prrt expense is a levy assessed on the sale of hydrocarbons derived from specific developmental areas in australia. we are subject to a variety of other taxes including u.s. franchise taxes and various canadian taxes, including the freehold mineral tax and saskatchewan resources surtax. the table below presents a comparison of these expenses:

2014 vs. 2013 taxes other than income were $107 million lower than 2013. australian prrt and u.k. prt decreased $109 million over the comparable 2013 period based on a decrease in production revenues in the north sea from qualifying fields during the year partially offset by $96 million australian prrt accrued during 2014. prior periods reflect no australian prrt expense as sales subject to prrt were fully offset by credits derived from exploration and development expenditures. severance tax increased $12 million with increased production from the permian region offset by higher tax credits and decreased oil prices. ad valorem taxes decreased $9 million as a result of property divestitures during 2014.
2013 vs. 2012 taxes other than income were $33 million lower than 2012. u.k. prt decreased $69 million over the comparable 2012 period based on a decrease in production revenues from qualifying fields during the year. prior-year property acquisitions and higher drilling activity resulted in increases of $34 million and $10 million to severance and ad valorem tax expense, respectively.
impairments during the fourth quarter of 2014, the company recorded asset impairments totaling $2.4 billion, including $1.3 billion for the impairment of goodwill, $1.0 billion for the impairment of assets held for sale, and other asset impairments. for detailed information regarding impairments, please refer to note 1summary of significant accounting policies and note 2acquisitions and divestitures in the notes to consolidated financial statements set forth in part iv, item 15 of this form 10-k.
general and administrative expenses
2014 vs. 2013 general and administrative (g&a) expenses decreased $48 million, or 10 percent, from 2013. on a per-unit basis, g&a expenses stayed flat compared to prior year as a result of lower costs offset by lower production from recent divestitures. expenses for 2014 included a $25 million benefit from nonrecurring third party cost reimbursements in australia.
45
2013 vs. 2012 general and administrative (g&a) expenses decreased $33 million, or 6 percent, from 2012. on a per-unit basis, g&a expenses were down $0.08 to $1.84 per boe, with the benefit of lower costs partially offset by the impact of lower production.
acquisition, divestiture and separation costs apache recorded $67 million and $33 million of expenses during 2014 and 2013, respectively, primarily related to separation costs, investment banking fees and other costs associated with recent divestitures. in 2012, the company recorded $31 million of expenses reflecting costs related to our acquisition of mobil north sea and our acquisition of cordillera.
financing costs, net financing costs incurred during the period comprised the following:

2014 vs. 2013 net financing costs decreased $47 million from 2013. the decrease is primarily related to a $61 million decrease in interest expense as a result of lower average debt balances during 2014.
2013 vs. 2012 net financing costs increased $5 million from 2012. the increase is primarily related to a $59 million increase in interest expense from debt issuances during 2012, partially offset by a $41 million increase in capitalized interest resulting from additional unproved property balances in the central and permian regions. additionally, apache realized a gain of $16 million related to debt extinguished during 2013.
provision for income taxes in 2014, apache evaluated its permanent reinvestment position and determined that undistributed earnings from certain subsidiaries located in apaches australia, egypt, and north sea regions will no longer be permanently reinvested. as a result of this change in position, the company recorded $1.7 billion of u.s. deferred income tax expense on the undistributed earnings that were previously considered permanently reinvested. in addition, the company recorded $311 million of u.s. deferred income tax expense on foreign earnings that were distributed to the u.s. in 2014.
the 2014 provision for income taxes totaled $1.6 billion. the 2014 effective rate reflects the tax benefit from the $5.0 billion non-cash write-down in the u.s. and north sea. the companys rate is also impacted by the $1.7 billion of deferred income tax expense recorded in 2014 for changing our position on unremitted earnings on foreign subsidiaries and $311 million of deferred income tax expense on distributed foreign earnings. in addition, the company had approximately $2.1 billion of impairments related to non-cash write-downs of goodwill and assets held for sale. excluding these items and certain other adjustments, the 2014 effective tax rate would have been 41 percent.
the 2013 provision for income taxes totaled $1.9 billion. the 2013 effective rate reflects the tax benefit from the $995 million non-cash write-downs in the u.s., north sea, and kenya, impacts from foreign currency fluctuations and a $225 million charge related to distributed foreign earnings and other adjustments. excluding these items, the 2013 effective tax rate would have been 42 percent.

for additional information regarding income taxes, please refer to note 7income taxes in the notes to consolidated financial statements set forth in part iv, item 15 of this form 10-k.
capital resources and liquidity operating cash flows are the companys primary source of liquidity. we may also elect to utilize available committed borrowing capacity, access to both debt and equity capital markets, or proceeds from the sale of nonstrategic assets for all other liquidity and capital resource needs.
apaches operating cash flows, both in the short-term and the long-term, are impacted by highly volatile oil and natural gas prices. significant deterioration in commodity prices negatively impacts our revenues, earnings and cash flows, and potentially our liquidity if spending does not trend downward as well. sales volumes and costs also impact cash flows; however, these historically have not been as volatile and have less impact than commodity prices in the short-term.
apaches long-term operating cash flows are dependent on reserve replacement and the level of costs required for ongoing operations. cash investments are required to fund activity necessary to offset the inherent declines in production and proved crude oil and natural gas reserves. future success in maintaining and growing reserves and production is highly dependent on the success of our drilling program and our ability to add reserves at reasonable costs.
we have initially set our 2015 capital budget at $3.8 billion, which is approximately 60 percent lower than the prior year as a result of our response to the changing market conditions and operating cash flow forecasts. this budget covers planned expenditures for drilling, completions, recompletion projects, equipment upgrades, expansion of existing facilities and equipment, plugging and abandonment, seismic studies, and leasing additional acreage. we closely monitor commodity prices, service cost levels, regulatory impacts, and numerous other industry factors and routinely adjust our budgets in response to changing market conditions and operating cash flow forecasts. with the current capital program, we are projecting our production to be relatively flat compared to 2014, when adjusting for divested assets.
we believe the liquidity and capital resource alternatives available to apache, combined with proactive measures to adjust our capital budget to reflect lower oil prices and anticipated operating cash flows, will be adequate to fund short-term and long-term operations, including our capital spending program, repayment of debt maturities, and any amount that may ultimately be paid in connection with commitments and contingencies.

(1)   the table presents capital expenditures on a cash basis; therefore, the amounts differ from those discussed elsewhere in this document, which include accruals.

net cash provided by continuing operating activities operating cash flows are our primary source of capital and liquidity and are impacted, both in the short-term and the long-term, by volatile oil and natural gas prices. the factors that determine operating cash flows are largely the same as those that affect net earnings, with the exception of non-cash expenses such as dd&a, asset retirement obligation (aro) accretion, and deferred income tax expense, which affect earnings but do not affect cash flows.
net cash provided by continuing operating activities for 2014 totaled $8.4 billion, down $1.2 billion from 2013. the decrease reflects comparative changes in working capital during the periods.
for a detailed discussion of commodity prices, production, and expenses, please see results of operations in this item 7. for additional detail on the changes in operating assets and liabilities and the non-cash expenses which do not impact net cash provided by operating activities, please see the statement of consolidated cash flows in the consolidated financial statements set forth in part iv, item 15 of this form 10-k.

argentina discontinued operations during 2014, apache completed the sale of our argentina operations and properties to ypf sociedad anónima for cash proceeds of $786 million. the results of operations related to argentina have been classified as discontinued operations in all periods presented in this annual report on form 10-k. net cash provided by argentina discontinued operations for the first quarter of 2014 was $2 million.
asset divestitures during 2014, apache completed the sale of non-core anadarko basin and southern louisiana oil and gas assets for $1.3 billion. in addition, apache completed the sale of non-operated interests in the lucius and heidelberg development projects and 11 primary term deepwater exploration blocks in the gulf of mexico for $1.4 billion. the effective dates of these transactions were october 1, 2014 and may 1, 2014, respectively. proceeds from the sale of other oil and gas properties totaled $470 million during the year.
during 2013, apache completed the sale of gulf of mexico shelf operations and properties for $3.7 billion. in addition, apache completed a transaction with chevron canada under which each company became a 50 percent owner of the kitimat lng plant, the ptp, and 644,000 gross undeveloped acres in the horn river and liard basins. the proceeds from this transaction were $396 million. proceeds from the sale of other oil and gas properties totaled $306 million during the year.
for information regarding our acquisitions and divestitures, please see note 2acquisitions and divestitures in the notes to consolidated financial statements set forth in part iv, item 15 of this form 10-k.
egypt noncontrolling interest during 2013, apache completed the sale of a one-third minority participation in its egypt oil and gas business to sinopec for $2.95 billion. apache made cash distributions totaling $140 million to sinopec in 2014.
capital expenditures during 2014, capital spending for e&d activities totaled $9.7 billion compared to $9.6 billion in the prior year period. apaches e&d capital spending was primarily focused on our north american onshore assets. in the permian region we averaged 40 operated drilling rigs during the year. in our gulf coast region, during 2014 we increased activity on our eagle ford acreage in texas.
apache also completed leasehold and property acquisitions totaling $1.5 billion during 2014, compared with $419 million in 2013. our 2014 acquisition investments focused on adding new leasehold positions to our north american onshore portfolio.
apaches investment in gas gathering, transmission, and processing facilities totaled $1.2 billion during each of 2014 and 2013. apaches 2014 gtp capital expenditures were primarily for the wheatstone and kitimat lng facilities. in december of 2014, apache announced an agreement to sell its interest in the two lng projects. apache will be reimbursed for its net expenditure in the projects between june 30, 2014, and closing, which is estimated to be approximately $1 billion. the transaction is expected to close in the first quarter of 2015. for more information, please see note 2acquisitions and divestitures in the notes to the consolidated financial statements set forth in part iv, item 15 of this form 10-k.
shares repurchased apaches board of directors has authorized the purchase of up to 40 million shares of the companys common stock. shares may be purchased either in the open market or through privately held negotiated transactions. the company initiated the buyback program on june 10, 2013, and since the inception of the
49
program has repurchased a total of 32.2 million shares at an average price of $88.96. during 2014, 21.0 million shares were repurchased at an average price of $89.00. the company is not obligated to acquire any specific number of shares.
dividends the company has paid cash dividends on its common stock for 50 consecutive years through 2014. future dividend payments will depend on the companys level of earnings, financial requirements, and other relevant factors. common stock dividends paid during 2014 totaled $365 million, compared with $303 million in 2013 and $256 million in 2012. the company paid dividends on its series d preferred stock totaling $57 million and $76 million in 2013 and 2012, respectively. the preferred stock was converted to common stock in august 2013.
in the first quarter of 2014 the board of directors approved a 25 percent increase to $0.25 per share for the regular quarterly cash dividend on the companys common shares. this increase first applied to the dividend on common shares payable on may 22, 2014, to stockholders of record on april 22, 2014, and subsequent dividends paid.

cash and cash equivalents at december 31, 2014, we had $769 million in cash and cash equivalents, of which $498 million of cash was held by foreign subsidiaries, and approximately $271 million was held by apache corporation and u.s. subsidiaries. the cash held by foreign subsidiaries is subject to additional u.s. income taxes if repatriated. the majority of the cash is invested in highly liquid, investment-grade securities with maturities of three months or less at the time of purchase.
debt at december 31, 2014, outstanding debt, which consisted of notes, debentures, and commercial paper, totaled $11.2 billion. we have $900 million of debt maturing in 2017, $2.1 billion maturing in 2018, and the remaining $8.2 billion maturing in years 2019 through 2096. at december 31, 2014, we had no current debt outstanding.
available credit facilities as of december 31, 2014, the company had unsecured committed revolving syndicated bank credit facilities totaling $5.3 billion, of which $2.0 billion matures in december 2015, $1.0 billion matures in august 2016 and $2.3 billion matures in june 2018 pursuant to a one-year extension approved in may 2014 under the terms of the $2.3 billion facilities. in december 2014, the company entered into a $2.0 billion 364-day revolving credit facility which matures in december 2015. at maturity, the 364-day credit facility allows the company to convert the outstanding revolving loans into one-year term loans by paying a term-out fee of 1 percent. proceeds from borrowings may be used for general corporate purposes. apaches available borrowing capacity under this
50
facility and its other committed credit facilities support its commercial paper program, which was increased from $3.0 billion to $5.0 billion in december 2014. the facilities consist of the $2.0 billion 364-day credit facility, a $1.7 billion facility and a $1.0 billion facility in the u.s., a $300 million facility in australia, and a $300 million facility in canada. as of december 31, 2014, aggregate available borrowing capacity under the companys credit facilities was $3.7 billion.
at the companys option, the interest rate for the facilities is based on a base rate, as defined, or the london inter-bank offered rate (libor) plus a margin determined by the companys senior long-term debt rating. the $1.7 billion credit facility also allows the company to borrow under competitive auctions.
at december 31, 2014, the margin over libor for committed loans was 0.925 percent on the $2.0 billion 364-day credit facility, 0.875 percent on the $1.0 billion u.s. credit facility, and 0.90 percent on each of the $1.7 billion u.s. credit facility, the $300 million australian credit facility, and the $300 million canadian credit facility. the company also pays quarterly facility fees of 0.075 percent on the total amount of the $2.0 billion 364-day credit facility, 0.125 percent on the total amount of the $1.0 billion facility, and 0.10 percent on the total amount of the other three facilities. the margin over libor and the facility fees vary based upon the companys senior long-term debt rating.
the financial covenants of the credit facilities require the company to maintain a debt-to-capitalization ratio of not greater than 60 percent at the end of any fiscal quarter. at december 31, 2014, the companys debt-to-capitalization ratio was 29 percent.
the negative covenants include restrictions on the companys ability to create liens and security interests on its assets, with exceptions for liens typically arising in the oil and gas industry, purchase money liens, and liens arising as a matter of law, such as tax and mechanics liens. the company may incur liens on assets located in the u.s. and canada of up to 5 percent of the companys consolidated assets, or approximately $2.8 billion as of december 31, 2014. there are no restrictions on incurring liens in countries other than the u.s. and canada. there are also restrictions on apaches ability to merge with another entity, unless the company is the surviving entity, and a restriction on its ability to guarantee debt of entities not within its consolidated group.
there are no clauses in the facilities that permit the lenders to accelerate payments or refuse to lend based on unspecified material adverse changes. the credit facility agreements do not have drawdown restrictions or prepayment obligations in the event of a decline in credit ratings. however, the agreements allow the lenders to accelerate payments and terminate lending commitments if apache corporation, or any of its u.s. or canadian subsidiaries, defaults on any direct payment obligation in excess of the stated thresholds noted in the agreements or has any unpaid, non-appealable judgment against it in excess of the stated thresholds noted in the agreements. the company was in compliance with the terms of the credit facilities as of december 31, 2014.
there is no assurance that the financial condition of banks with lending commitments to the company will not deteriorate. we closely monitor the ratings of the 25 banks in our bank group. having a large bank group allows the company to mitigate the potential impact of any banks failure to honor its lending commitment.
commercial paper program in december 2014, the company increased its commercial paper program from $3.0 billion to $5.0 billion. the commercial paper program generally enables apache to borrow funds for up to 270 days at competitive interest rates. the commercial paper program is fully supported by available borrowing capacity under committed credit facilities. our 2014 weighted-average interest rate for commercial paper was 0.31 percent. if the company is unable to issue commercial paper following a significant credit downgrade or dislocation in the market, the companys committed credit facilities, which expire in 2015, 2016, and 2018, are available as a 100 percent backstop. as of december 31, 2014, the company had $1.6 billion in commercial paper outstanding. at december 31, 2013, the company had no commercial paper outstanding.
51
letter of credit collateral apache assumed abandonment obligations in conjunction with various north sea acquisitions. although not currently required, to ensure apaches payment of these costs, apache agreed to deliver a letter of credit to the applicable seller if the rating of apaches senior unsecured debt is lowered by both moodys and standard and poors to ratings specified in the agreement with such seller. apache has made arrangements with members of its bank group to provide letters of credit to cover certain abandonment obligations, if needed.
total debt-to-capitalization the companys debt-to-capitalization ratio as of december 31, 2014, was 29 percent as compared to 22 percent at december 31, 2013. the increase in our debt-to-capitalization ratio is directly related to the draw on commercial paper during 2014 and the current year non-cash earnings charges for oil and gas property write-downs and asset impairments.
off-balance sheet arrangements apache enters into customary agreements in the oil and gas industry for drilling rig commitments, firm transportation agreements, and other obligations as described below in contractual obligations in this item 7. other than the off-balance sheet arrangements described herein, apache does not have any off-balance sheet arrangements with unconsolidated entities that are reasonably likely to materially affect our liquidity or capital resource positions.
contractual obligations the following table summarizes the companys contractual obligations as of december 31, 2014. for additional information regarding these obligations, please see note 6debt and note 8commitments and contingencies in the notes to consolidated financial statements set forth in part iv, item 15 of this form 10-k.

(1)   this table does not include the companys liability for dismantlement, abandonment, and restoration costs of oil and gas properties or pension or postretirement benefit obligations. for additional information regarding these liabilities, please see notes 5 and 9, respectively, in the notes to consolidated financial statements set forth in part iv, item 15 of this form 10-k.

(2)               this represents minimum future expenditures for drilling rig services. apaches expenditures for drilling rig services will exceed such minimum amounts to the extent apache utilizes the drilling rigs subject to a particular contractual commitment for a period greater than the period set forth in the governing contract. drilling rig commitments will be reduced by $79 million upon the completion of the sale of apaches interest in the kitimat and wheatstone lng projects.

(3)   purchase obligations represent agreements to purchase goods or services that are enforceable, are legally binding, and specify all significant terms, including fixed and minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed,

52
minimum or variable price provisions; and the appropriate timing of the transaction. these include minimum commitments associated with take-or-pay contracts, ngl processing agreements, obtaining and processing seismic data, and contractual obligations to buy or build oil and gas plants and facilities, including lng facilities. of the total purchase obligations, $651 million will be relinquished upon completion of the sale of apaches interest in the kitimat and wheatstone lng projects.

(4)   firm transportation commitments will be reduced by $51 million upon completion of the sale of apaches interest in the kitimat and wheatstone lng projects.

(5)   other operating lease obligations pertain to other long-term exploration, development, and production activities. the company has work-related commitments for oil and gas operations equipment, acreage maintenance commitments, and fpsos, among other things. other operating lease commitments will be reduced by $291 million upon the completion of the sale of apaches interest in the kitimat and wheatstone lng projects.

apache is also subject to various contingent obligations that become payable only if certain events or rulings were to occur. the inherent uncertainty surrounding the timing of and monetary impact associated with these events or rulings prevents any meaningful accurate measurement, which is necessary to assess settlements resulting from litigation. apaches management feels that it has adequately reserved for its contingent obligations, including approximately $67 million for environmental remediation and approximately $8 million for various contingent legal liabilities. for a detailed discussion of the companys environmental and legal contingencies, please see note 8commitments and contingencies in the notes to consolidated financial statements set forth in part iv, item 15 of this form 10-k.
the company also had approximately $52 million accrued as of december 31, 2014, for an insurance contingency as a member of oil insurance limited (oil). this insurance co-op insures specific property, pollution liability, and other catastrophic risks of the company. as part of its membership, the company is contractually committed to pay a withdrawal premium if we elect to withdraw from oil. apache does not anticipate withdrawal from the insurance pool; however, the potential withdrawal premium is calculated annually based on past losses and the nature of our asset base.
insurance program we maintain insurance policies that include coverage for physical damage to our assets, third party liability, workers compensation, employers liability, sudden and accidental pollution, and other risks. our insurance coverage includes deductibles or retentions that must be met prior to recovery. additionally, our insurance is subject to exclusions and limitations, and there is no assurance that such coverage will adequately protect us against liability from all potential consequences and damages.
our current insurance policies covering physical damage to our assets provide $1 billion in coverage per occurrence. these policies also provide sudden and accidental pollution coverage. coverage for damage to our u.s. gulf of mexico assets specifically resulting from a named windstorm, however, is subject to a maximum of $250 million per named windstorm, which includes a self-insured retention of 40 percent of the losses above a $100 million deductible and is limited to an annual aggregate of $300 million.
our current insurance policies covering general liabilities provide coverage of $660 million subject to apaches interest. this coverage is in excess of existing policies, including, but not limited to, aircraft liability, employers liability, and automobile liability. our service agreements, including drilling contracts, generally indemnify apache for injuries and death of the service providers employees as well as subcontractors hired by the service provider.
future insurance coverage for our industry could increase in cost and may include higher deductibles or retentions. in addition, some forms of insurance may become unavailable.
53
apache purchases multi-year political risk insurance from the overseas private investment corporation (opic) and other highly rated international insurers covering its investments in egypt. in the aggregate, these insurance policies, subject to the policy terms and conditions, provide approximately $1 billion of coverage to apache for losses arising from confiscation, nationalization, and expropriation risks, with a $237.5 million sub-limit for currency inconvertibility.
in addition, the company has a separate policy with opic, which, subject to policy terms and conditions, provides $300 million of coverage for losses arising from (1) non-payment by egpc of arbitral awards covering amounts owed apache on past due invoices and (2) expropriation of exportable petroleum in the event that actions taken by the government of egypt prevent apache from exporting our share of production. in october 2012, the multilateral investment guarantee agency (miga), a member of the world bank group, announced that it was providing $150 million in reinsurance to opic for the remainder of the policy term. this provision of long-term reinsurance to opic will allow apache to maintain the $300 million of insurance coverage through 2024.
critical accounting policies and estimates apache prepares its financial statements and the accompanying notes in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america, which require management to make estimates and assumptions about future events that affect the reported amounts in the financial statements and the accompanying notes. apache identifies certain accounting policies as critical based on, among other things, their impact on the portrayal of apaches financial condition, results of operations, or liquidity and the degree of difficulty, subjectivity, and complexity in their deployment. critical accounting policies cover accounting matters that are inherently uncertain because the future resolution of such matters is unknown. management routinely discusses the development, selection, and disclosure of each of the critical accounting policies. the following is a discussion of apaches most critical accounting policies.
reserves estimates proved oil and gas reserves are the estimated quantities of natural gas, crude oil, condensate, and ngls that geological and engineering data demonstrate with reasonable certainty to be recoverable in future years from known reservoirs under existing conditions, operating conditions, and government regulations.
proved undeveloped reserves include those reserves that are expected to be recovered from new wells on undrilled acreage, or from existing wells where a relatively major expenditure is required for recompletion. undeveloped reserves may be classified as proved reserves on undrilled acreage directly offsetting development areas that are reasonably certain of production when drilled, or where reliable technology provides reasonable certainty of economic producibility. undrilled locations may be classified as having undeveloped reserves only if a development plan has been adopted indicating that they are scheduled to be drilled within five years, unless specific circumstances justify a longer time.
despite the inherent imprecision in these engineering estimates, our reserves are used throughout our financial statements. for example, since we use the units-of-production method to amortize our oil and gas properties, the quantity of reserves could significantly impact our dd&a expense. our oil and gas properties are also subject to a ceiling limitation based in part on the quantity of our proved reserves. finally, these reserves are the basis for our supplemental oil and gas disclosures.
reserves are calculated using an unweighted arithmetic average of commodity prices in effect on the first day of each of the previous 12 months, held flat for the life of the production, except where prices are defined by contractual arrangements.
apache has elected not to disclose probable and possible reserves or reserve estimates in this filing.
54
asset retirement obligation (aro)
the company has significant obligations to remove tangible equipment and restore land or seabed at the end of oil and gas production operations. apaches removal and restoration obligations are primarily associated with plugging and abandoning wells and removing and disposing of offshore oil and gas platforms in the north sea and australia. estimating the future restoration and removal costs is difficult and requires management to make estimates and judgments. asset removal technologies and costs are constantly changing, as are regulatory, political, environmental, safety, and public relations considerations.
aro associated with retiring tangible long-lived assets is recognized as a liability in the period in which the legal obligation is incurred and becomes determinable. the liability is offset by a corresponding increase in the underlying asset. the aro liability reflects the estimated present value of the amount of dismantlement, removal, site reclamation, and similar activities associated with apaches oil and gas properties. the company utilizes current retirement costs to estimate the expected cash outflows for retirement obligations. inherent in the present value calculation are numerous assumptions and judgments including the ultimate settlement amounts, inflation factors, credit-adjusted discount rates, timing of settlement, and changes in the legal, regulatory, environmental, and political environments. to the extent future revisions to these assumptions impact the present value of the existing aro liability, a corresponding adjustment is made to the oil and gas property balance. accretion expense is recognized over time as the discounted liability is accreted to its expected settlement value.
income taxes our oil and gas exploration and production operations are subject to taxation on income in numerous jurisdictions worldwide. we record deferred tax assets and liabilities to account for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements and our tax returns. we routinely assess the realizability of our deferred tax assets. if we conclude that it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized under accounting standards, the tax asset would be reduced by a valuation allowance. numerous judgments and assumptions are inherent in the determination of future taxable income, including factors such as future operating conditions (particularly as related to prevailing oil and gas prices).
the company regularly assesses and, if required, establishes accruals for tax contingencies that could result from assessments of additional tax by taxing jurisdictions in countries where the company operates. tax reserves have been established and include any related interest, despite the belief by the company that certain tax positions meet certain legislative, judicial, and regulatory requirements. these reserves are subject to a significant amount of judgment and are reviewed and adjusted on a periodic basis in light of changing facts and circumstances considering the progress of ongoing tax audits, case law, and any new legislation. the company believes that the reserves established are adequate in relation to the potential for any additional tax assessments.
purchase price allocation accounting for the acquisition of a business requires the allocation of the purchase price to the various assets and liabilities of the acquired business and recording deferred taxes for any differences between the allocated values and tax basis of assets and liabilities. any excess of the purchase price over the amounts assigned to assets and liabilities is recorded as goodwill.
the purchase price allocation is accomplished by recording each asset and liability at its estimated fair value. estimated deferred taxes are based on available information concerning the tax basis of the acquired companys assets and liabilities and tax-related carryforwards at the merger date, although such estimates may change in the future as additional information becomes known. the amount of goodwill recorded in any particular business combination can vary significantly depending upon the values attributed to assets acquired and liabilities assumed relative to the total acquisition cost.

in estimating the fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed, we made various assumptions. the most significant assumptions relate to the estimated fair values assigned to proved and unproved crude oil and natural gas properties. to estimate the fair values of these properties, we prepared estimates of crude oil and natural gas reserves as described above in reserve estimates of this item 7. estimated fair values assigned to assets acquired can have a significant effect on results of operations in the future.
goodwill as of december 31, 2014, the companys consolidated balance sheet included $87 million of goodwill, all of which has been assigned to the egypt reporting unit. goodwill is assessed at least annually for impairment at the reporting unit level. we conduct a qualitative goodwill impairment assessment as of july 1st of each year by examining relevant events and circumstances which could have a negative impact on our goodwill such as macroeconomic conditions, industry and market conditions, cost factors that have a negative effect on earnings and cash flows, overall financial performance, acquisitions and divestitures, and other relevant entity-specific events.
the first step of the impairment test requires management to make estimates regarding the fair value of each reporting unit to which goodwill has been assigned. if it is necessary to determine the fair value of the reporting unit, we use a combination of the income approach and the market approach.
under the income approach, the fair value of each reporting unit is estimated based on the present value of expected future cash flows. the income approach is dependent on a number of factors including estimates of forecasted revenue and operating costs, proved reserves, the success of future exploration for and development of unproved reserves, discount rates, and other variables. negative revisions of estimated reserves quantities, increases in future cost estimates, divestiture of a significant component of the reporting unit, or sustained decreases in crude oil or natural gas prices could lead to a reduction in expected future cash flows and possibly an impairment of all or a portion of goodwill in future periods.
key assumptions used in the discounted cash flow model described above include estimated quantities of crude oil and natural gas reserves, including both proved reserves and risk-adjusted unproved reserves; estimates of market prices considering forward commodity price curves as of the measurement date; and estimates of operating, administrative, and capital costs adjusted for inflation. we discount the resulting future cash flows using discount rates similar to those used by the company in the valuation of acquisitions and divestitures.
to assess the reasonableness of our fair value estimate, we use a market approach to compare the fair value to similar businesses whose securities are actively traded in the public market. this requires management to make certain judgments about the selection of comparable companies, recent comparable asset transactions, and transaction premiums. associated market multiples are applied to various financial metrics of the reporting unit to estimate fair value.
although we base the fair value estimate of each reporting unit on assumptions we believe to be reasonable, those assumptions are inherently unpredictable and uncertain, and actual results could differ from the estimate. in the event of a prolonged global recession, commodity prices may stay depressed or decline further, thereby causing the fair value of the reporting unit to decline, which could result in an impairment of goodwill.
during the fourth quarter of 2014, the company recognized non-cash impairments of the entire amount of recorded goodwill in the u.s., north sea, and canada reporting units of $1.0 billion, $163 million, and $103 million, respectively.

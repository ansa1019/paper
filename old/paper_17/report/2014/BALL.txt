item 1a.  risk factors any of the following risks could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.
risks related to the proposed acquisition of rexam the announced, proposed acquisition of rexam is subject to various closing conditions, including governmental, regulatory, and shareholder approvals, as well as other uncertainties, and there can be no assurances as to whether and when it may be completed.  failure to consummate the proposed acquisition could negatively impact our stock price and our future business and financial results.
the consummation of the announced, proposed acquisition of rexam is subject to certain customary conditions. a number of the conditions are not within the companys or rexams control, and it is possible that such conditions may prevent, delay or otherwise materially adversely affect the completion of the acquisition. these conditions include, among other things: (i) approval of the issuance of shares of company common stock in connection with the offer to the shareholders of rexam by the holders of at least a majority of the shares of the companys common stock present at a shareholder meeting, (ii) approval of a court-sanctioned scheme of arrangement under part 26 of the uk companies act by the holders of at least a majority in number representing at least 75 percent of the issued share capital of rexam present at a shareholder meeting, approval of related resolutions by at least a 75 percent majority of the issued capital of rexam present at a further shareholder meeting (excluding shares held by the company, if any) and the sanction of the high court of england and wales, (iii) the expiration or termination of the applicable waiting period under the hart-scott-rodino antitrust improvements act of 1976, as amended, as well as the expiration or termination of the applicable waiting periods under the antitrust laws of several other jurisdictions, including the european union, brazil and associated approvals and clearances and (iv) the absence of a material adverse effect on rexam and certain other actions related to rexam as described in the offer announcement. the company cannot predict with certainty whether and when any of the required conditions will be satisfied or if another uncertainty may arise. if the proposed acquisition does not receive, or timely receive, the required regulatory approvals and clearances, or if another event occurs that delays or prevents the acquisition, such delay or failure to complete the acquisition and the acquisition process may cause uncertainty or other negative consequences that may materially and adversely affect the companys business, financial condition and results of operations and, to the extent that the current price of the companys common stock reflects an assumption that the acquisition will be completed, the price per share for the companys common stock could be negatively impacted.

we may not realize all of the anticipated benefits of the proposed acquisition, or those benefits may take longer to realize than expected.  we may also encounter significant unexpected difficulties in integrating the two businesses.
our ability to realize the anticipated benefits of the proposed acquisition of rexam will depend, to a large extent, on our ability to integrate our business with rexams business. combining two independent businesses is a complex, costly and time-consuming process. as a result, we will be required to devote significant management attention and resources to integrating the business practices and operations of the company and rexam. the integration process may disrupt the combined business and, if implemented ineffectively, could preclude the realization of the full benefits of the acquisition currently expected. our failure to meet the challenges involved in integrating the two businesses to realize the anticipated benefits of the proposed acquisition could cause an interruption of, or a loss of momentum in, the activities of the company and could adversely affect the companys results of operations. in addition, the overall integration of the businesses may result in material unanticipated problems, expenses, liabilities, competitive responses, loss of customer relationships, and diversion of certain managements attention. the difficulties of combining the operations of the companies include, among others:
·                  the diversion of certain managements attention to integration matters;
·                  difficulties in achieving anticipated cost savings, synergies, business opportunities and growth prospects from combining our business with that of rexam;
·                  difficulties in integrating operations, business practices and systems;
·                  difficulties in assimilating employees;
·                  difficulties in managing the expanded operations of a significantly larger and more complex company;
·                  challenges in retaining existing customers and suppliers;
·                  challenges in obtaining new customers and suppliers;
·                  potential unknown liabilities and unforeseen increased expenses associated with the proposed acquisition; and
·                  challenges in retaining and attracting key personnel.
many of these factors will be outside of our control and any one of them could result in increased costs, decreases in the amount of expected revenues and diversion of managements time and energy, which could materially impact the business, financial condition and results of operations of the company. in addition, even if the operations of the businesses of the company and rexam are integrated successfully, we may not realize the full benefits of the transaction, including the synergies, cost savings or sales or growth opportunities that we expect, or the full benefits may not be achieved within the anticipated time frame, or at all. additional unanticipated costs may be incurred in the integration of the businesses of the company and rexam. all of these factors could cause dilution to the earnings of the company, decrease or delay the expected accretive effect of the proposed acquisition, or negatively impact the price of the companys common stock. as a result, we cannot assure that the combination of the company and rexams businesses will result in the realization of the full benefits anticipated from the proposed acquisition.
in order to close the proposed acquisition, we will need to incur a significant level of debt that could have important consequences for our business and any investment in our securities.
on february 19, 2015, the company entered into a £3.3 billion unsecured bridge loan agreement, pursuant to which lending institutions have agreed, subject to limited conditions, to provide financing necessary to pay the cash portion of the consideration payable to rexam shareholders upon consummation of the proposed acquisition of rexam and related fees and expenses. if the company borrows under the bridge loan agreement, such indebtedness could have significant consequences for our business and any investment in our securities, including:
·                  increasing our vulnerability to adverse economic, industry or competitive developments;
·                  requiring a substantial portion of our cash flows from operations to be dedicated to the payment of principal and interest on our indebtedness, therefore reducing our ability to use our cash flow to fund our operations, capital expenditures and future business opportunities and returning cash to our shareholders;
·                  restricting us from making strategic acquisitions or causing us to make non-strategic divestitures;
·                  limiting our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures, product development, debt service requirements, acquisitions and general corporate or other purposes; and
·                  limiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business or market conditions and placing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors who are less highly leveraged and who, therefore, may be able to take advantage of opportunities that our leverage prevents us from exploiting.
issuances of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in connection with the proposed acquisition may adversely affect the market price of our common stock.
a portion of the funding for the proposed acquisition of rexam is through the issuance of shares of our common stock. . issuance of shares of our common stock in the proposed acquisition of rexam will dilute the interests of our then-existing shareholders and may adversely affect the market price of our common stock.
7
if the proposed acquisition of rexam is not completed, we may, under certain circumstances, be obligated to pay a break payment to rexam in the range of 1 percent to 7 percent of the total consideration contemplated to be paid in connection with the proposed acquisition.
if the proposed acquisition of rexam is not consummated by august 19, 2016, unless extended by mutual agreement, because certain regulatory approvals that are conditions to the acquisition have not been obtained (or waived by us) or the company has changed its recommendation that its shareholders vote in favor of the issuance of shares of its common stock in connection with the proposed acquisition of rexam citing as a reason the regulatory approvals, the company would be required to pay rexam a break payment of 7 percent of the total consideration contemplated to be paid in connection with the proposed acquisition. in addition, if within six months of the offer announcement, the company has otherwise changed its recommendation that its shareholders vote in favor of the issuance of shares of its common stock in connection with the proposed acquisition of rexam or has not held a shareholder meeting to vote on such issuance, the company would be required to pay rexam a break payment of 3 percent of the total consideration contemplated to be paid in connection with the proposed acquisition. further, if within six months of the offer announcement, the company has held a shareholder meeting for the purpose of holding a vote on the issuance of shares of its common stock in connection with the proposed acquisition of rexam but the shareholders have not approved such issuance, the company would be required to pay rexam a break payment of 1 percent of the total consideration contemplated to be paid in connection with the proposed acquisition. any break payment that the company may be required to pay may require the company to use available cash that would have otherwise been available for general corporate purposes and other matters. for these and other reasons, a failed acquisition could materially and adversely affect the companys business, financial condition and results of operations and the price per share of the companys common stock.
in order to obtain regulatory clearance for the proposed acquisition of rexam, we may be required to commit to significant divestitures which could negatively impact our ability to realize the anticipated benefits of the proposed acquisition of rexam or otherwise have a material adverse effect on us.
in connection with obtaining the expiration or termination of the applicable waiting periods under the hart-scott-rodino antitrust improvements act of 1976, as amended, as well as satisfying requirements under the antitrust laws of several other jurisdictions, including the european union, brazil and associated approvals and clearances, we may be required to commit to significant divestitures. the terms of the recommended offer as set forth in the offer announcement and the co-operation agreement require us to consummate the proposed acquisition of rexam even if certain regulators require significant divestitures that would not be accepted as sufficiently material to the company in the context of the proposed acquisition of rexam to permit the transaction to lapse. if we are required to commit to undertake any such significant divestitures to complete the proposed acquisition of rexam, we may not realize the anticipated benefit of the proposed acquisition, including anticipated synergies, and the company may otherwise suffer other negative consequences that may materially and adversely affect the companys business, financial condition and results of operations and, to the extent that the current price of the companys common stock reflects an assumption that the anticipated benefits of the proposed acquisition will be realized, the price per share for the companys common stock could be negatively impacted.
our business, operating results and financial condition are subject to particular risks in certain regions of the world.
we may experience an operating loss in one or more regions of the world for one or more periods, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results or financial condition. moreover, overcapacity, which often leads to lower prices, exists in a number of the regions in which we operate and may persist even if demand grows. our ability to manage such operational fluctuations and to maintain adequate long-term strategies in the face of such developments will be critical to our continued growth and profitability.
there can be no assurance that the companys business acquisitions will be successfully integrated into the acquiring company. (see note 4 and note 23 to the consolidated financial statements within item 8 of this annual report for details.)
while we have what we believe to be well designed integration plans, if we cannot successfully integrate the acquired operations with those of ball, we may experience material negative consequences to our business, financial condition or results of operations. the integration of companies that have previously been operated separately involves a number of risks, including, but not limited to:
·                  demands on management related to the increase in our size after the acquisition;
·                  the diversion of managements attention from the management of existing operations to the integration of the acquired operations;
·                  difficulties in the assimilation and retention of employees;
·                  difficulties in the integration of departments, systems, including financial systems, technologies, books and records and procedures, as well as in maintaining uniform standards, controls (including internal accounting controls), procedures and policies;
·                  expenses related to any undisclosed or potential liabilities; and
·                  retention of major customers and suppliers.
8
we may not be able to achieve potential synergies or maintain the levels of revenue, earnings or operating efficiency that each business had achieved or might achieve separately. the successful integration of the acquired operations will depend on our ability to manage those operations, realize revenue opportunities and, to some degree, eliminate redundant and excess costs.
the loss of a key customer, or a reduction in its requirements, could have a significant negative impact on our sales.
we sell a majority of our packaging products to relatively few major beverage, packaged food, personal care and household product companies, some of which operate in north america, south america, europe and asia.
although the majority of our customer contracts are long-term, these contracts, unless they are renewed, expire in accordance with their respective terms and are terminable under certain circumstances, such as our failure to meet quality, volume or market pricing requirements. because we depend on relatively few major customers, our business, financial condition or results of operations could be adversely affected by the loss of any of these customers, a reduction in the purchasing levels of these customers, a strike or work stoppage by a significant number of these customers employees or an adverse change in the terms of the supply agreements with these customers.
the primary customers for our aerospace segment are u.s. government agencies or their prime contractors. our contracts with these customers are subject to several risks, including funding cuts and delays, technical uncertainties, budget changes, competitive activity and changes in scope.
we face competitive risks from many sources that may negatively impact our profitability.
competition within the packaging and aerospace industries is intense. increases in productivity, combined with existing or potential surplus capacity in the industry, have maintained competitive pricing pressures. the principal methods of competition in the general packaging industry are price, innovation, sustainability, service and quality. in the aerospace industry they are technical capability, cost and schedule. some of our competitors may have greater financial, technical and marketing resources, and some may currently have significant excess capacity. our current or potential competitors may offer products at a lower price or products that are deemed superior to ours. the global economic environment has resulted in reductions in demand for our products in some instances, which, in turn, could increase these competitive pressures.
we are subject to competition from alternative products, which could result in lower profits and reduced cash flows.
our metal packaging products are subject to significant competition from substitute products, particularly plastic carbonated soft drink bottles made from pet, single serve beer bottles and other food and beverage containers made of glass, cardboard or other materials. competition from plastic carbonated soft drink bottles is particularly intense in the u.s., europe and the prc. certain of our aerospace products are also subject to competition from alternative products and solutions. there can be no assurance that our products will successfully compete against alternative products, which could result in a reduction in our profits or cash flow.
our packaging businesses have a narrow product range, and our business would suffer if usage of our products decreased or if decreases occur in the demand for the beverages, food and other goods filled in our products.
for the year ended december 31, 2014, 72 percent of our consolidated net sales were from the sale of metal beverage containers, and we expect to derive a significant portion of our future revenues and cash flows from the sale of metal beverage containers. our business would suffer if the use of metal beverage containers decreased. accordingly, broad acceptance by consumers of aluminum and steel containers for a wide variety of beverages is critical to our future success. if demand for glass and pet bottles increases relative to metal containers, the demand for aluminum and steel containers does not develop as expected or declines in consumption of carbonated soft drinks in north america continue, our business, financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected.
changes in laws and governmental regulations may adversely affect our business and operations.
we and our customers and suppliers are subject to various federal, state, provincial and local laws and regulations, which are increasing in number and complexity. each of our, and their, facilities is subject to federal, state, provincial and local licensing and regulation by health, environmental, workplace safety and other agencies in multiple jurisdictions. requirements of worldwide governmental authorities with respect to manufacturing, manufacturing facility locations within the jurisdiction, product content and safety, climate change, workplace safety and health, environmental, expropriation of assets and other standards could adversely affect our ability to manufacture or sell our products, and the ability of our customers and suppliers to manufacture and sell their products. in addition, we face risks arising from compliance with and enforcement of increasingly numerous and complex federal, state, provincial and local laws and regulations.
9
enacted regulatory developments regarding the reporting and use of conflict minerals mined from the democratic republic of the congo and adjoining countries could affect the sourcing, availability and price of minerals used in the manufacture of certain of our products. as a result, there may only be a limited pool of suppliers who provide conflict-free materials, and we cannot give assurance that we will be able to obtain such products in sufficient quantities or at competitive prices. also, because our supply chains are complex, we may face reputational challenges with our customers and other stakeholders if we are unable to sufficiently verify the origins of all materials used in the products that we sell. the compliance and reporting aspects of these regulations may result in incremental costs to the company.
while deposit systems and other container-related legislation have been adopted in some jurisdictions, similar legislation has been defeated in public referenda and legislative bodies in many others. we anticipate that continuing efforts will be made to consider and adopt such legislation in the future. the packages we produce are widely used and perform well in u.s. states, canadian provinces and european countries that have deposit systems, as well as in other countries worldwide.
significant environmental, employment-related and other legislation and regulatory requirements exist and are also evolving. the compliance costs associated with current and proposed laws and potential regulations could be substantial, and any failure or alleged failure to comply with these laws or regulations could lead to litigation or governmental action, all of which could adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations.
our business, financial condition and results of operations are subject to risks resulting from broader geographic operations.
we derived approximately 41 percent of our consolidated net sales from outside of the u.s. for the year ended december 31, 2014. the sizeable scope of operations outside of the u.s. may lead to more volatile financial results and make it more difficult for us to manage our business. reasons for this include, but are not limited to, the following:
·                  political and economic instability;
·                  governments restrictive trade policies;
·                  the imposition or rescission of duties, taxes or government royalties;
·                  exchange rate risks;
·                  difficulties in enforcement of contractual obligations and intellectual property rights; and
·                  the geographic, language and cultural differences between personnel in different areas of the world.
any of these factors, many of which are also present in the u.s., could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.
we are exposed to exchange rate fluctuations.
our reporting currency is the u.s. dollar. a portion of balls operations, including assets and liabilities and revenues and expenses, have been denominated in various transaction currencies other than the u.s. dollar, and we expect such operations will continue to be so denominated. as a result, the u.s. dollar value of these operations has varied, and will continue to vary, with exchange rate fluctuations. a decrease in the value of the various currencies compared to the u.s. dollar could reduce our profits from these operations and the value of their net assets when reported in u.s. dollars in our financial statements. this could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations as reported in u.s. dollars. in addition, fluctuations in currencies relative to currencies in which the earnings are generated may make it more difficult to perform period-to-period comparisons of our reported results of operations.
we manage our exposure to currency fluctuations, particularly our exposure to fluctuations in the euro to u.s. dollar exchange rate to attempt to mitigate the effect of cash flow and earnings volatility associated with exchange rate changes. we primarily use forward contracts and options to manage our currency exposures and, as a result, we experience gains and losses on these derivative positions offset, in part, by the impact of currency fluctuations on existing assets and liabilities. our inability to properly manage our exposure to currency fluctuations could materially impact our results.
if we fail to retain key management and personnel, we may be unable to implement our key objectives.
we believe that our future success depends, in part, on our experienced management team. unforeseen losses of key members of our management team without appropriate succession and/or compensation planning could make it difficult for us to manage our business and meet our objectives.
10
decreases in our ability to apply new technology and know-how may affect our competitiveness.
our success depends partially on our ability to improve production processes and services. we must also introduce new products and services to meet changing customer needs. if we are unable to implement better production processes or to develop new products through research and development or licensing of new technology, we may not be able to remain competitive with other manufacturers. as a result, our business, financial condition or results of operations could be adversely affected.
adverse weather and climate changes may result in lower sales.
we manufacture packaging products primarily for beverages and foods. unseasonably cool weather can reduce demand for certain beverages packaged in our containers. in addition, poor weather conditions or changes in climate that reduce crop yields of fruits and vegetables can adversely affect demand for our food containers. climate change could have various effects on the demand for our products in different regions around the world.
we are vulnerable to fluctuations in the supply and price of raw materials.
we purchase aluminum, steel and other raw materials and packaging supplies from several sources. while all such materials are available from independent suppliers, raw materials are subject to fluctuations in price and availability attributable to a number of factors, including general economic conditions, commodity price fluctuations (particularly aluminum on the london metal exchange), the demand by other industries for the same raw materials and the availability of complementary and substitute materials. although we enter into commodities purchase agreements from time to time and sometimes use derivative instruments to seek to manage our risk, we cannot ensure that our current suppliers of raw materials will be able to supply us with sufficient quantities at reasonable prices. economic and financial factors could impact our suppliers, thereby causing supply shortages. increases in raw material costs could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. in the americas, europe and asia, some contracts do not allow us to pass along increased raw material costs and we generally use derivative agreements to seek to manage this risk. our hedging procedures may be insufficient and our results could be materially impacted if costs of materials increase. due to the fixed price contracts and derivative activities, while increasing raw material costs may not impact our near-term profitability, increased prices could decrease our sales volume over time.
prolonged work stoppages at facilities with union employees could jeopardize our financial position.
as of december 31, 2014, approximately 35 percent of our north american packaging facility employees and approximately 73 percent of our european employees were covered by collective bargaining agreements. these collective bargaining agreements have staggered expirations during the next several years. although we consider our employee relations to be generally good, a prolonged work stoppage or strike at any facility with union employees could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. in addition, we cannot ensure that upon the expiration of existing collective bargaining agreements, new agreements will be reached without union action or that any such new agreements will be on terms satisfactory to us.
our aerospace and technologies segment is subject to certain risks specific to that business.
in our aerospace business, u.s. government contracts are subject to reduction or modification in the event of changes in requirements, and the government may also terminate contracts at its convenience pursuant to standard termination provisions. in such instances, ball may be entitled to reimbursement for allowable costs and profits on authorized work that has been performed through the date of termination.
in addition, budgetary constraints may result in further reductions to projected spending levels by the u.s. government. in particular, government expenditures are subject to the potential for automatic reductions, generally referred to as sequestration. sequestration may occur in any given year, resulting in significant additional reductions to spending by various u.s government defense and aerospace agencies on both existing and new contracts, as well as the disruption of ongoing programs. even if sequestration does not occur, we expect that budgetary constraints and ongoing concerns regarding the u.s. national debt will continue to place downward pressure on agency spending levels.  due to these and other factors, overall spending on various programs could decline, which could result in significant reductions to revenue, cash flows, net earnings and backlog primarily in our aerospace and technologies segment.
11
we use estimates in accounting for many of our programs in our aerospace business, and changes in our estimates could adversely affect our future financial results.
we account for sales and profits on some long-term contracts in our aerospace business in accordance with the percentage-of-completion method of accounting, using the cumulative catch-up method to account for updates in estimates. the percentage-of-completion method of accounting involves the use of various estimating techniques to project revenues and costs at completion and various assumptions and projections relative to the outcome of future events, including the quantity and timing of product deliveries, future labor performance and rates, and material and overhead costs. these assumptions involve various levels of expected performance improvements. under the cumulative catch-up method, the impact of updates in our estimates related to units shipped to date is recognized immediately.
because of the significance of the judgments and estimates described above, it is likely that we could record materially different amounts if we used different assumptions or if the underlying circumstances or estimates were to change. accordingly, updates in underlying assumptions, circumstances or estimates may materially affect our future financial performance.
our backlog includes both cost-type and fixed-price contracts. cost-type contracts generally have lower profit margins than fixed-price contracts. our earnings and margins may vary depending on the types of government contracts undertaken, the nature of the work performed under those contracts, the costs incurred in performing the work, the achievement of other performance objectives and their impact on our ability to receive fees.
as a u.s. government contractor, we could be adversely affected by changes in regulations or any negative findings from a u.s. government audit or investigation.
our aerospace business operates in a highly regulated environment and is routinely audited and reviewed by the u.s. government and its agencies, such as the defense contract audit agency (dcaa) and defense contract management agency (dcma). these agencies review performance under our contracts, our cost structure and our compliance with applicable laws, regulations and standards, as well as the adequacy of, and our compliance with, our internal control systems and policies. business systems that are subject to review under the dod federal acquisition regulation supplement (dfars) are accounting, purchasing, estimating, material management and accounting systems, as well as property and earned value management. any costs ultimately found to be unallowable or improperly allocated to a specific contract will not be reimbursed or must be refunded if already reimbursed. if an audit uncovers improper or illegal activities, we may be subject to civil and criminal penalties, sanctions or suspension or debarment from doing business with the u.s. government. whether or not illegal activities are alleged, the u.s. government also has the ability to decrease or withhold certain payments when it deems systems subject to its review to be inadequate. if such actions were to result in suspension or debarment, this could have a material adverse effect on our business.
our business is subject to substantial environmental remediation and compliance costs.
our operations are subject to federal, state, provincial and local laws and regulations in multiple jurisdictions relating to environmental hazards, such as emissions to air, discharges to water, the handling and disposal of hazardous and solid wastes and the cleanup of hazardous substances. we have been designated, along with numerous other companies, as a potentially responsible party for the cleanup of several hazardous waste sites. based on available information, we do not believe that any costs incurred in connection with such sites will have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, capital expenditures or competitive position. there is increased focus on the regulation of greenhouse gas emissions and other environmental issues worldwide.
our business faces the potential of increased regulation on some of the raw materials utilized in our packaging operations.
our operations are subject to federal, state, provincial and local laws and regulations in multiple jurisdictions relating to some of the raw materials, such as epoxy-based coatings utilized in our container making process. epoxy-based coatings may contain bisphenol-a (bpa). scientific evidence evaluated by regulatory agencies in the united states, canada, europe, japan, australia and new zealand has consistently shown these coatings to be safe for food contact at current levels, and these regulatory agencies have stated that human exposure to bpa from epoxy-based container coatings is well below safe exposure limits set by government bodies worldwide. a significant change in these regulatory agency statements, adverse information concerning bpa, or rulings made within certain federal, state, provincial and local jurisdictions could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. ball recognizes that significant interest exists in non epoxy-based coatings, and we have been proactively working with coatings suppliers and our customers to evaluate alternatives to current coatings.
12
net earnings and net worth could be materially affected by an impairment of goodwill.
we have a significant amount of goodwill recorded on the consolidated balance sheet as of december 31, 2014. we are required at least annually to test the recoverability of goodwill. the recoverability test of goodwill is based on the current fair value of our identified reporting units. fair value measurement requires assumptions and estimates of many critical factors, including revenue and market growth, operating cash flows and discount rates. if general market conditions deteriorate in portions of our business, we could experience a significant decline in the fair value of reporting units. this decline could lead to an impairment of all or a significant portion of the goodwill balance, which could materially affect our u.s. gaap net earnings and net worth.
if the investments in balls pension plans, or in the multi-employer pension plans in which ball participates, do not perform as expected, we may have to contribute additional amounts to the plans, which would otherwise be available to cover operating expenses and fund growth opportunities.
ball maintains defined benefit pension plans covering substantially all of its north american and united kingdom employees, which are funded based on certain actuarial assumptions. the plans assets consist primarily of common stocks, fixed income securities and, in the u.s., alternative investments. market declines, longevity increases or legislative changes, such as the pension protection act in the u.s., could result in a prospective decrease in our available cash flow and net earnings over time, and the recognition of an increase in our pension obligations could result in a reduction to our shareholders equity. additional risks exist related to the companys participation in multi-employer pension plans. assets contributed to a multi-employer pension plan by one employer may be used to provide benefits to employees of other participating employers. if a participating employer in a multi-employer pension plan stops contributing to the plan, the unfunded obligations of the plan may be borne by the remaining participants. this could result in increases to our contributions to the plans as well as pension expense.
restricted access to capital markets could adversely affect our short-term liquidity and prevent us from fulfilling our obligations under the notes issued pursuant to our bond indentures.
a reduction in global market liquidity could:
·                  restrict our ability to fund working capital, capital expenditures, research and development expenditures and other business activities;
·                  increase our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions, including the credit risks stemming from the economic environment;
·                  limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our businesses and the industries in which we operate;
·                  restrict us from making strategic acquisitions or exploiting business opportunities; and
·                  limit, along with the financial and other restrictive covenants in our debt, among other things, our ability to borrow additional funds, dispose of assets, pay cash dividends or refinance debt maturities.
if market interest rates increase, our variable-rate debt will create higher debt service requirements, which would adversely affect our cash flow. while we sometimes enter into agreements limiting our exposure, any such agreements may not offer complete protection from this risk.
the global credit, financial and economic environment could have a negative impact on our results of operations, financial position or cash flows.
the overall credit, financial and economic environment could have significant negative effects on our operations, including:
·                  the creditworthiness of customers, suppliers and counterparties could deteriorate resulting in a financial loss or a disruption in our supply of raw materials;
·                  volatile market performance could affect the fair value of our pension assets, potentially requiring us to make significant additional contributions to our defined benefit plans to maintain prescribed funding levels;
·                  a significant weakening of our financial position or operating results could result in noncompliance with our debt covenants; and
·                  reduced cash flow from our operations could adversely affect our ability to execute our long-term strategy to increase liquidity, reduce debt, repurchase our stock and invest in our businesses.
13
changes in u.s. generally accepted accounting principles (u.s. gaap) and securities and exchange commission (sec) rules and regulations could materially impact our reported results.
u.s. gaap and sec accounting and reporting changes are common and have become more frequent and significant over the past several years. furthermore, the u.s. and international accounting standard setters are in the process of jointly converging several key accounting standards. these changes could have significant effects on our reported results when compared to prior periods and other companies and may even require us to retrospectively adjust prior periods. additionally, material changes to the presentation of transactions in the consolidated financial statements could impact key ratios that analysts and credit rating agencies use to rate ball and ultimately our ability to access the credit markets in an efficient manner.
increased information technology (it) security threats and more sophisticated and targeted computer crime could pose a risk to our systems, networks, products, solutions and services.
increased global it security threats and more sophisticated and targeted computer crime pose a risk to the security of our systems and networks and the confidentiality, availability and integrity of our data. while we attempt to mitigate these risks by employing a number of measures, including employee training, comprehensive monitoring of our networks and systems, and maintenance of backup and protective systems, our systems, networks, products, solutions and services remain potentially vulnerable to advanced persistent threats. depending on their nature and scope, such threats could potentially lead to the compromise of confidential information, improper use of our systems and networks, manipulation and destruction of data, defective products, production downtimes and operational disruptions, which in turn could adversely affect our reputation, competitiveness and results of operations.
item 7.   managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations managements discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes included in item 8 of this annual report on form 10-k, which include additional information about our accounting policies, practices and the transactions underlying our financial results. the preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america (u.s. gaap) requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts in our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes including various claims and contingencies related to lawsuits, taxes, environmental and other matters arising during the normal course of business. we apply our best judgment, our knowledge of existing facts and circumstances and actions that we may undertake in the future in determining the estimates that affect our consolidated financial statements. we evaluate our estimates on an ongoing basis using our historical experience, as well as other factors we believe appropriate under the circumstances, such as current economic conditions, and adjust or revise our estimates as circumstances change. as future events and their effects cannot be determined with precision, actual results may differ from these estimates. ball corporation and its subsidiaries are referred to collectively as ball corporation, ball, the company or we or our in the following discussion and analysis.
overview business overview and industry trends ball corporation is one of the worlds leading suppliers of metal packaging to the beverage, food, personal care and household products industries. our packaging products are produced for a variety of end uses, are manufactured in facilities around the world and are competitive with other substrates, such as plastics and glass. in the rigid packaging industry, sales and earnings can be increased by reducing costs, increasing prices, developing new products, expanding volumes and making strategic acquisitions. we also provide aerospace and other technologies and services to governmental and commercial customers.
we sell our packaging products mainly to large, multinational beverage, food, personal care and household products companies with which we have developed long-term customer relationships. this is evidenced by our high customer retention and our large number of long-term supply contracts. while we have a diversified customer base, we sell a majority of our packaging products to relatively few major companies in north america, europe, asia and south america, as do our equity joint ventures in the u.s. and vietnam. the overall metal container industry is growing globally and is expected to continue to grow in the medium to long term despite the north american industry seeing a continued decline in standard-sized aluminum beverage packaging for the carbonated soft drink market. the primary customers for the products and services provided by our aerospace and technologies segment are u.s. government agencies or their prime contractors.
we purchase our raw materials from relatively few suppliers. we also have exposure to inflation, in particular the rising costs of raw materials, as well as other direct cost inputs. we mitigate our exposure to the changes in the costs of metal through the inclusion of provisions in contracts covering the majority of our volumes to pass through metal price changes, as well as through the use of derivative instruments. the pass-through provisions generally result in proportional increases or decreases in sales and costs with a greatly reduced impact, if any, on net earnings. because of our customer and supplier concentration, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected by the loss, insolvency or bankruptcy of a major customer or supplier or a change in a supply agreement with a major customer or supplier, although our contract provisions generally mitigate the risk of customer loss, and our long-term relationships represent a known, stable customer base.
we recognize sales under long-term contracts in the aerospace and technologies segment using percentage-of-completion under the cost-to-cost method of accounting. throughout the period of contract performance, we regularly reevaluate and, if necessary, revise our estimates of aerospace and technologies total contract revenue, total contract cost and progress toward completion. because of contract payment schedules, limitations on funding and other contract terms, our sales and accounts receivable for this segment include amounts that have been earned but not yet billed.

corporate strategy our drive for 10 vision encompasses five strategic levers that are key to growing our business and achieving long-term success. since launching drive for 10 in 2011, we made progress on each of the levers as follows:
·                  maximizing value in our existing businesses by rationalizing standard beverage container and end capacity in north america and expanding specialty container production to meet current demand; leveraging plant floor systems in our metal beverage facilities to improve efficiencies and reduce costs; consolidating and/or closing multiple metal beverage and metal food and aerosol packaging facilities; relocating our european headquarters to zurich, switzerland, to gain business, customer and supplier efficiencies; and implementing cost-out and value-in initiatives across all of our businesses;
·                  expanding further into new products and capabilities by expanding into extruded aluminum aerosol manufacturing with our mexican acquisition in december 2012 and the installation of a new extruded aluminum aerosol line in our deforest, wisconsin, facility during 2014; and successfully commercializing extruded aluminum aerosol packaging that utilizes a significant amount of recycled material;
·                  aligning ourselves with the right customers and markets by investing capital to meet double-digit volume growth for specialty beverage containers throughout our global network, which now represent over 27 percent of our global beverage packaging mix, and the introduction of next generation aluminum bottle-shaping technology in north america for a customer under a long term arrangement that is scheduled to start up at the end of the first quarter 2015;
·                  broadening our geographic reach with new investments in a metal beverage manufacturing facility in myanmar, as well as an extruded aluminum aerosol manufacturing facility in india, and the award of a south korean environmental instrument in our aerospace business; and
·                  leveraging our technological expertise in packaging innovation, including the introduction of next-generation aluminum bottle-shaping technologies, the introduction of a new steel aerosol manufacturing technology starting up in mid-2015 and a joint effort between our aerospace business, nasa and the japan aerospace exploration agency to collect science data on the earths rain and snowfall via the global precipitation measurement (gpm) microwave imager, as well as other technologies to maintain our competitive advantage today and in the future.
these ongoing business developments help us stay close to our customers while expanding and/or sustaining our industry positions with major beverage, food, personal care, household products and aerospace customers.

the increase in net sales in 2014 compared to 2013 was due primarily to higher metal beverage container sales volumes and higher aerospace program revenues, partially offset by lower north american food and household product volumes. net earnings were favorably impacted by higher metal beverage container sales volumes, lower cost of sales as a percentage of net sales, lower depreciation expense, lower interest expense and a lower tax rate in 2014, partially offset by lower north american food and household product volumes, unfavorable tinplate service center manufacturing performance in the u.s., higher debt refinancing costs and higher selling, general and administrative costs in 2014.
the decrease in net sales in 2013 compared to 2012 was driven largely by lower demand for standard 12-ounce aluminum beverage containers in the u.s., partially offset by specialty can growth in the americas and higher sales volumes in europe, brazil and the prc. earnings were flat compared to 2012 with lower standard 12-ounce volumes in the u.s. and higher selling, general and administrative expenses being offset by higher specialty can volumes in the americas and improved cost management in our global packaging operations.

cost of sales (excluding depreciation and amortization)
cost of sales, excluding depreciation and amortization, was $6,903.5 million in 2014 compared to $6,875.4 million in 2013 and $7,174.0 million in 2012. these amounts represented 80.6 percent, 81.2 percent and 82.1 percent of consolidated net sales for those three years, respectively.
depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization expense was $280.9 million in 2014 compared to $299.9 million in 2013 and $282.9 million in 2012. these amounts represented 3.3 percent, 3.5 percent and 3.2 percent of consolidated net sales for those three years, respectively. lower expense in 2014 compared to 2013 was largely due to the completion of depreciation for certain acquired european assets. the higher expense in 2013 compared to 2012 was primarily due to capital spending in excess of historical levels and changes in currency exchange rates.
selling, general and administrative selling, general and administrative (sg&a) expenses were $466.5 million in 2014 compared to $418.6 million in 2013 and $385.5 million in 2012. these amounts represented 5.4 percent, 4.9 percent and 4.4 percent of consolidated net sales for those three years, respectively. the increase in sg&a in 2014 compared to 2013 was primarily due to higher incentive compensation and employee benefit costs and other individually insignificant higher costs. the higher expenses in 2013 compared to 2012 were largely related to the reassessment of certain expenses in europe from cost of sales to sg&a in light of the relocation of the european headquarters.
interest expense consolidated interest expense was $193.0 million in 2014 compared to $211.8 million in 2013 and $194.9 million in 2012. excluding debt refinancing costs, interest expense in 2014 was lower than in 2013 due primarily to lower average debt levels and lower average borrowing rates. excluding debt refinancing costs, interest expense in 2013 was higher than in 2012 due to higher average debt levels and the timing difference of the issuance of $1 billion senior notes due in 2023 versus the tender and call of the 2016 senior notes, partially offset by lower average borrowing rates.  interest expense, excluding the effect of debt refinancing costs, as a percentage of average monthly borrowings was 4.8 percent in 2014, 5.1 percent in 2013 and 5.5 percent in 2012.
interest expense in 2014 included $33.1 million for the call premium and the write off of unamortized financing costs and issuance premiums related to the tender of balls 7.375 percent senior notes due september 2019. interest expense in 2013 included $28.0 million for the tender and call premiums, as well as the write off of unamortized financing costs and issuance discounts related to the tender of our 7.125 percent senior notes due in september 2016, the repayment of the term a loan and the amendment and extension of the senior credit facilities.
tax provision the effective income tax rate for earnings from continuing operations was 23.2 percent in 2014 compared to 25.6 percent in 2013 and 28.9 percent in 2012. the lower tax rate in 2014 was primarily the result of a higher foreign tax rate differential, lower u.s. taxes on foreign earnings, and the 2014 releases of uncertain tax positions which exceeded those occurring in 2013. the lower tax rate in 2013 compared to 2012 was primarily the result of the retroactive extension of the u.s. research and development credit, a lower state effective tax rate and a higher foreign tax rate differential, partially offset by higher u.s. taxes on foreign earnings and the 2012 releases of uncertain tax positions which exceeded those occurring in 2013.

the metal beverage packaging, americas and asia, segment consists of operations located in the u.s., canada, brazil and the prc, which manufacture aluminum containers used in beverage packaging.
during february 2015, we announced the introduction of a next-generation aluminum bottle-shaping technology in our conroe, texas, facility, which is expected to begin production at the end of the first quarter 2015. additionally, in may 2014, we announced the expansion of our asian operations with the construction of a new one-line beverage can manufacturing facility in myanmar, which is expected to begin production in early 2016.
segment sales in 2014 were $53.4 million higher compared to 2013 due primarily to $101 million higher sales volumes, offset by a reduction in the pass through price of aluminum.
segment sales in 2013 were $348.3 million lower compared to 2012 due to $320 million for the combination of lower sales volumes, principally related to lower standard 12-ounce container sales volumes in north america, and a reduction in the pass through price of aluminum, partially offset by higher specialty container sales volumes.
segment earnings in 2014 were $22.4 million higher than in 2013 due to $36 million from higher sales volumes, partially offset by higher incentive compensation and other individually insignificant costs.
segment earnings in 2013 were $10.5 million lower than in 2012 due to a total of $109 million from unfavorable net pricing in the prc and lower variable margin contribution attributable to the aforementioned lower standard 12-ounce container sales volumes, net of higher specialty container sales volumes. the volume and pricing variances were largely offset by $104 million of improved manufacturing performance, reduced fixed costs and other reduced costs.

the aerospace and technologies segment consists of the manufacture and sale of aerospace and other related products and services provided for the defense, civil space and commercial space industries.
segment sales in 2014 increased $37.7 million compared to 2013 due to higher sales for civil space contracts and u.s. national defense contracts. segment earnings in 2014 increased $13.5 million primarily as a result of favorable program execution and increased recovery of pension costs.
segment sales in 2013 increased $20.3 million compared to 2012 due to higher sales from u.s. national defense contracts. segment earnings in 2013 decreased $6.5 million due to higher amounts of net favorable contract adjustments in 2012.
sales to the u.s. government, either directly as a prime contractor or indirectly as a subcontractor, represented 95 percent of segment sales in 2014, 94 percent in 2013 and 90 percent in 2012. the aerospace and technologies contract mix in 2014 consisted of 62 percent cost-type contracts, which are billed at our costs plus an agreed upon and/or earned profit component, and 38 percent fixed-price contracts.
contracted backlog for the aerospace and technologies segment at december 31, 2014 and 2013, was $765 million and $938 million, respectively. the year-over-year decline reflects the successful completion of several multi-year contracts including satellite launches completed in 2014. the segment has numerous outstanding bids for future contract awards. comparisons of backlog are not necessarily indicative of the trend of future operations due to the nature of varying delivery and milestone schedules on contracts, funding of programs and the uncertainty of timing of future contract awards.

on february 19, 2015, the company entered into a £3.3 billion unsecured bridge loan agreement, pursuant to which lending institutions have agreed, subject to limited conditions, to provide financing necessary to pay the cash portion of the consideration payable to rexam shareholders upon consummation of the proposed acquisition of rexam and related fees and expenses.
on february 19, 2015, the company entered into a new $3 billion revolving credit facility to replace the existing approximate $1.1 billion bank credit facility, redeem the 2020 and 2021 senior notes and provide ongoing liquidity for the company.
in addition, on february 19, 2015, the company announced the redemption of all of the outstanding 6.75 percent senior notes due in september 2020 and all of the 5.75 percent senior notes due in may 2021, each in the amount of $500 million. the redemption of these bonds will result in a pre-tax charge in interest expense of approximately $56.3 million ($36.9 million after tax), composed of the redemption premiums and the write-offs of related debt financing costs.
financial condition, liquidity and capital resources cash flows and capital expenditures our primary sources of liquidity are cash provided by operating activities and external committed borrowings. we believe that cash flows from operations and cash provided by short-term, long-term and committed revolver borrowings, when necessary, will be sufficient to meet our ongoing operating requirements, scheduled principal and interest payments on debt, dividend payments, proposed acquisitions, including the announced, proposed acquisition of rexam, and anticipated capital expenditures. the following summarizes our cash flows:

cash flows from operations in 2014 improved compared to 2013 due to higher net earnings and favorable working capital changes. the favorable working capital changes were primarily related to lower days sales outstanding, lower inventory days on hand and higher days payable outstanding. days sales outstanding decreased from 36 days to 34 days, inventory days on hand decreased from 53 days to 52 days and days payable outstanding increased from 51 days to 69 days.
working capital changes in 2013 compared to 2012 were primarily related to higher days payable outstanding and lower days sales outstanding, partially offset by higher inventory days on hand. days payable outstanding increased from 47 days to 51 days, days sales outstanding decreased from 37 days to 36 days and inventory days on hand increased from 51 days to 53 days.
we have entered into several regional uncommitted accounts receivable factoring programs with various financial institutions for certain accounts receivables of the company. the programs are accounted for as true sales of the receivables, without recourse to ball, and had combined limits of approximately $293 million at december 31, 2014. a total of $197.6 million and $137.5 million were sold under these programs as of december 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. in addition, latapack-ball has non-recourse uncommitted accounts receivable factoring programs with a combined limit of approximately $8 million at december 31, 2014. there were no accounts receivable sold as of december 31, 2014, and $6.0 million was sold as of december 31, 2013.
annual cash dividends paid on common stock were 52 cents per share in both 2014 and 2013 and 40 cents per share in 2012. total dividends paid were $72.7 million in 2014, $75.2 million in 2013 and $61.8 million in 2012. we also paid dividends to noncontrolling interests of $12.2 million in 2014, $12.9 million in 2013 and $7.6 million in 2012.
share repurchases the companys share repurchases, net of issuances, totaled $360.1 million in 2014, $398.8 million in 2013 and $494.1 million in 2012. the repurchases were completed using cash on hand and available borrowings and included accelerated share repurchase agreements and other purchases under our ongoing share repurchase program. additional details about our share repurchase activities are provided in note 15 accompanying the consolidated financial statements within item 8 of this annual report.

debt facilities and refinancing given our cash flow projections and unused credit facilities that are available until june 2018, our liquidity is strong and is expected to meet our ongoing cash and debt service requirements. total interest-bearing debt was $3.2 billion at december 31, 2014, compared to $3.6 billion at december 31, 2013.
on december 9, 2013, we announced the redemption of our outstanding 7.375 percent senior notes due in september 2019 in the amount of $315.4 million. the redemption occurred on january 10, 2014, at a price per note of 108.01 percent of the outstanding principal amount plus accrued interest. the redemption of the bonds resulted in a pretax charge in the first quarter of 2014 of $33.1 million for the call premium and the write off of unamortized financing costs and premiums.
in may 2013, we: (1) issued $1 billion of 4.00 percent senior notes due in november 2023; (2) tendered for the redemption of our 7.125 percent senior notes originally due in september 2016 in the amount of $375 million, at a redemption price per note of 105.322 percent of the outstanding principal amount plus accrued interest; and (3) repaid the $125 million term a loan, which was a component of the senior credit facilities. the redemption of the senior notes and the early repayment of the term a loan resulted in charges of $26.5 million for the tender and call premiums, as well as the write off of unamortized financing costs and issuance discounts. these charges are included as a component of interest expense in the consolidated statement of earnings.
in june 2013, we amended the senior credit facilities and extended the term from december 2015 to june 2018. in connection with the amendment, we recorded a charge of $0.4 million for the write off of unamortized financing costs. the charge is included as a component of interest expense in the consolidated statement of earnings.
on march 9, 2012, we issued $750 million of 5.00 percent senior notes due in march 2022. on the same date, we tendered for the redemption of our 6.625 percent senior notes originally due in march 2018 in the amount of $450 million, at a redemption price per note of 102.583 percent of the outstanding principal amount plus accrued interest. the redemption of the bonds resulted in a charge of $15.1 million for the call premium and the write off of unamortized financing costs and premiums. the charge is included as a component of interest expense in the consolidated statement of earnings.
short-term debt and current portion of long-term debt on the balance sheet includes the companys borrowings under its existing accounts receivable securitization agreement, totaling $110 million at december 31, 2014. this agreement, which has been amended and extended from time to time, is scheduled to mature in june 2017 and allows the company to borrow against a maximum amount of accounts receivable that varies between $85 million and $175 million depending on the seasonal accounts receivable balances in the companys north american packaging businesses.
at december 31, 2014, taking into account outstanding letters of credit and excluding availability under the accounts receivable securitization program, approximately $984 million was available under the companys long-term, multi-currency committed revolving credit facilities. in addition to these facilities, the company had approximately $790 million of short-term uncommitted credit facilities available at the end of 2014, of which $10.1 million was outstanding and due on demand.
while ongoing financial and economic conditions raise concerns about credit risk with counterparties to derivative transactions, the company mitigates its exposure by spreading the risk among various counterparties and limiting exposure to any one party. we also monitor the credit ratings of our suppliers, customers, lenders and counterparties on a regular basis.
on february 19, 2015, the company entered into a £3.3 billion unsecured bridge loan agreement, pursuant to which lending institutions have agreed, subject to limited conditions, to provide financing necessary to pay the cash portion of the consideration payable to rexam shareholders upon consummation of the proposed acquisition of rexam and related fees and expenses.
on february 19, 2015, the company entered into a new $3 billion revolving credit facility to replace the existing approximate $1.1 billion bank credit facility, redeem the 2020 and 2021 senior notes and provide ongoing liquidity for the company.
in addition, on february 19, 2015, the company announced the redemption of all of the outstanding 6.75 percent senior notes due in september 2020 and all of the 5.75 percent senior notes due in may 2021, each in the amount of $500 million. the redemption of these bonds will result in a pre-tax charge in interest expense of approximately $56.3 million ($36.9 million after tax), composed of the redemption premiums and the write-offs of related debt financing costs.
we were in compliance with all loan agreements at december 31, 2014, and all prior years presented, and have met all debt payment obligations. the u.s. note agreements and bank credit agreement contain certain restrictions relating to dividends, investments, financial ratios, guarantees and the incurrence of additional indebtedness. additional details about our debt and receivables sales agreements are available in note 12, accompanying the consolidated financial statements within item 8 of this annual report.

other liquidity measures management performance measures management internally uses various measures to evaluate company performance such as return on average invested capital (net operating earnings after tax over the relevant performance period divided by average invested capital over the same period); economic value added (eva®) dollars (net operating earnings after tax less a capital charge on average invested capital employed); earnings before interest and taxes (ebit); earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (ebitda); diluted earnings per share; cash flow from operating activities and free cash flow (generally defined by the company as cash flow from operating activities less capital expenditures). we believe this information is also useful to investors as it provides insight into the earnings and cash flow criteria management uses to make strategic decisions. these financial measures may be adjusted at times for items that affect comparability between periods such as business consolidation costs and gains or losses on acquisitions and dispositions.
nonfinancial measures in the packaging businesses include production efficiency and spoilage rates; quality control figures; environmental, health and safety statistics; production and sales volumes; asset utilization rates; and measures of sustainability. additional measures used to evaluate financial performance in the aerospace and technologies segment include contract revenue realization, award and incentive fees realized, proposal win rates and backlog (including awarded, contracted and funded backlog).
the following financial measurements are on a non-u.s. gaap basis and should be considered in connection with the consolidated financial statements within item 8 of this annual report. non-u.s. gaap measures should not be considered in isolation and should not be considered superior to, or a substitute for, financial measures calculated in accordance with u.s. gaap. a presentation of earnings in accordance with u.s. gaap is available in item 8 of this annual report.

free cash flow management internally uses a free cash flow measure: (1) to evaluate the companys operating results, (2) to evaluate strategic investments, (3) to plan stock buyback and dividend levels and (4) to evaluate the companys ability to incur and service debt. free cash flow is not a defined term under u.s. gaap, and it should not be inferred that the entire free cash flow amount is available for discretionary expenditures. the company defines free cash flow as cash flow from operating activities less capital expenditures. free cash flow is typically derived directly from the companys consolidated statement of cash flows; however, it may be adjusted for items that affect comparability between periods.
based on the above definition, our consolidated free cash flow is summarized as follows:

based on information currently available, we estimate cash flows from operating activities for 2015 to be in the range of $1 billion, capital expenditures to be approximately $400 million and free cash flow to be in the range of $600 million. in 2015, we intend to utilize our operating cash flow to fund our stock repurchases, dividend payments, growth capital projects and, to the extent available, acquisitions that meet our various criteria. of the total 2015 estimated capital expenditures, approximately $170 million was contractually committed as of december 31, 2014.

(b)         for variable rate facilities, amounts are based on interest rates in effect at year end and do not contemplate the effects of any hedging instruments utilized by the company.
(c)          the companys purchase obligations include contracted amounts for aluminum, steel and other direct materials. also included are commitments for purchases of natural gas and electricity, expenses related to aerospace and technologies contracts and other less significant items. in cases where variable prices and/or usage are involved, managements best estimates have been used. depending on the circumstances, early termination of the contracts may or may not result in penalties and, therefore, actual payments could vary significantly.
the table above does not include $65.5 million of uncertain tax positions, the timing of which is unknown at this time.
contributions to the companys defined benefit pension plans, not including the unfunded german plans, are expected to be insignificant in 2015. this estimate may change based on changes in the pension protection act and actual plan asset performance and available company cash flow, among other factors. benefit payments related to these plans are expected to be $91.6 million, $94.9 million, $98.8 million, $102.1 million and $106.0 million for the years ending december 31, 2015 through 2019, respectively, and a total of $572.8 million for the years 2020 through 2024. payments to participants in the unfunded german plans are expected to be between $18 million and $20 million in each of the years 2015 through 2019 and a total of $87 million for the years 2020 through 2024.
based on changes in return on asset and discount rate assumptions, as well as revisions based on plan experience studies, total pension expense in 2015 is anticipated to be approximately $7 million higher than in 2014, excluding curtailment expenses. a reduction of the expected return on pension assets assumption by one quarter of a percentage point would result in an estimated $3.6 million increase in the 2015 pension expense, while a quarter of a percentage point reduction in the discount rate applied to the pension liability would result in an estimated $5.4 million of additional pension expense in 2015. additional information regarding the companys pension plans is provided in note 14 accompanying the consolidated financial statements within item 8 of this annual report.
due to the u.s. tax status of certain of balls subsidiaries in canada and the prc, the company annually provides u.s. taxes on foreign earnings in those subsidiaries, net of any estimated foreign tax credits. the company also provides deferred taxes on the undistributed earnings in its brazil investment related to its 10 percent indirectly held investment. current taxes are also provided on certain other undistributed earnings that are currently taxed in the u.s. net u.s. taxes provided for brazil, canada and prc earnings in 2014, 2013 and 2012 were $11.8 million, $26.4 million and $14.5 million, respectively. managements intention is to indefinitely reinvest undistributed earnings of balls remaining foreign investments and, as a result, no u.s. income or federal withholding tax provision has been made. the indefinite reinvestment assertion is supported by both long-term and short-term forecasts and u.s. financial requirements, including, but not limited to, operating cash flows, capital expenditures, debt maturities and dividends. the company has not provided deferred taxes on earnings in certain non-u.s. subsidiaries because such earnings are intended to be indefinitely reinvested in its international operations. retained earnings in non-u.s. subsidiaries was $1,799.4 million as of december 31, 2014. it is not practical to estimate the additional taxes that may become payable upon the eventual remittance of these foreign earnings to the u.s.; however, repatriation of these earnings could result in a material increase in the companys effective tax rate or if the intention to indefinitely reinvest is discontinued.

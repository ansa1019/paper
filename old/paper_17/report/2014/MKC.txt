item 1a. risk factors the following are certain risk factors that could affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. these risk factors should be considered in connection with evaluating the forward-looking statements contained in this annual report on form 10-k because these factors could cause the actual results and conditions to differ materially from those projected in forward-looking statements. before you buy our common stock or common stock non-voting, you should know that making such an investment involves risks, including the risks described below. additional risks and uncertainties that are not presently known to the company or are currently deemed to be immaterial also may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, or results of operations in the future. if any of the risks actually occur, our business, financial condition or results of operations could be negatively affected. in that case, the trading price of our securities could decline, and you may lose part or all of your investment.
damage to our reputation or brand name, loss of brand relevance, increase in use of private label or other competitive brands by customers or consumers, or product quality or safety concerns could negatively impact our business, financial condition or results of operations.
we have many iconic brands with long-standing consumer recognition. our success depends on our ability to maintain our brand image for our existing products, extend our brands to new platforms, and expand our brand image with new product offerings.
we continually make efforts to maintain and improve relationships with our customers and consumers and to increase awareness and relevance of our brands through effective marketing and other measures. from time to time, our customers evaluate their mix of product offerings, and consumers have the option to purchase private label or other competitive products instead of our branded products. if a significant portion of our branded business was switched to private label or competitive products, it could have a material negative impact on our consumer business.
our reputation for manufacturing high-quality products is widely recognized. in order to safeguard that reputation, we have adopted rigorous quality assurance and quality control procedures which are designed to ensure the safety of our products. a serious breach of our quality assurance or quality control procedures, deterioration of our quality image, impairment of our customer or consumer relationships or failure to adequately protect the relevance of our brands may lead to litigation, customers purchasing from our competitors or consumers purchasing other brands or private label items that may or may not be manufactured by us, any of which could have a material negative impact on our business, financial condition or results of operations.
the food industry generally is subject to risks posed by food spoilage and contamination, product tampering, product recall, import alerts and consumer product liability claims. for instance, we may be required to recall certain of our products should they be mislabeled, contaminated or damaged, and certain of our raw materials could be blocked from entering the country if they were subject to import alerts. we also may become involved in lawsuits and legal proceedings if it is alleged that the consumption of any of our products could cause injury or illness, are mislabeled or fail to meet applicable legal requirements (even if the allegation is untrue). a product recall, import alert or an adverse result in any such litigation, or negative perceptions regarding food products and ingredients, could result in our having to pay fines or damages, incur additional costs or cause customers and consumers in our principal markets to lose confidence in the safety and quality of certain products or ingredients, any of which could have a negative effect on our business or financial results and, depending upon the significance of the affected product, that negative effect could be material to our business or financial results. negative publicity about these concerns, whether or not valid, may discourage customers and consumers from buying our products or cause disruptions in production or distribution of our products and adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.
the rising popularity of social networking and other consumer-oriented technologies has increased the speed and accessibility of information dissemination (whether or not accurate), and, as a result, negative, inaccurate, or misleading posts or comments on websites may generate adverse publicity that could damage our reputation or brands.
customer consolidation, and competitive, economic and other pressures facing our customers, may put pressure on our operating margins and profitability.
a number of our customers, such as supermarkets, warehouse clubs and food distributors, have consolidated in recent years and consolidation could continue. such consolidation could present a challenge to margin growth and profitability in that it has produced large, sophisticated customers with increased buying power who are more capable of operating with reduced inventories; resisting price increases; demanding lower pricing, increased promotional programs and specifically tailored products; and shifting shelf space currently used for our products to private label products. the economic and competitive landscape for our customers is constantly changing, and their response to those changes could impact our business. our industrial business may be impacted if the reputation or perception of the customers of our industrial business declines. these factors and others could have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition or results of operations.
the inability to maintain mutually beneficial relationships with large customers could adversely affect our business.
we have a number of major customers, including two large customers that, in the aggregate, constituted approximately 22% of our consolidated sales in 2014. the loss of either of these large customers or a material negative change in our relationship with these large customers or other major customers could have an adverse effect on our business.
disruption of our supply chain and issues regarding procurement of raw materials may negatively impact us.
our purchases of raw materials are subject to fluctuations in market price and availability caused by weather, growing and harvesting conditions, market conditions, governmental actions and other factors beyond our control. the most significant raw materials used by us in our business are pepper, dairy products, rice, capsicums (red pepper and paprika), onion, garlic and wheat flour. while future price movements of raw material costs are uncertain, we seek to mitigate the market price risk in a number of ways, including strategic raw material purchases, purchases of raw material for future delivery, customer price adjustments and cost savings from our comprehensive continuous improvement program. we generally have not used derivatives to manage the volatility related to this risk. to the extent that we have used derivatives for this purpose, it has not been material to our business. any actions we take in response to market price fluctuations may not effectively limit or eliminate our exposure to changes in raw material prices. therefore, we cannot provide assurance that future raw material price fluctuations will not have a negative impact on our business, financial condition or operating results.
in addition, we may have very little opportunity to mitigate the risk of availability of certain raw materials due to the effect of weather on crop yield, government actions, political unrest in producing countries, action or inaction by suppliers in response to laws and regulations, changes in agricultural programs and other factors beyond our control. therefore, we cannot provide assurance that future raw material availability will not have a negative impact on our business, financial condition or operating results.
political, socio-economic and cultural conditions, as well as disruptions caused by terrorist activities or otherwise, could also create additional risks for regulatory compliance. although we have adopted rigorous quality assurance and quality control procedures which are designed to ensure the safety of our imported products, we cannot provide assurance that such events will not have a negative impact on our business, financial condition or operating results.
our profitability may suffer as a result of competition in our markets.
the food industry is intensely competitive. competition in our product categories is based on price, product innovation, product quality, brand recognition and loyalty, effectiveness of marketing and promotional activity, and the ability to identify and satisfy consumer preferences. from time to time, we may need to reduce the prices for some of our products to respond to competitive and customer pressures, which may adversely affect our profitability. such pressures could reduce our ability to take appropriate remedial action to address commodity and other cost increases.
laws and regulations could adversely affect our business.
food products are extensively regulated in most of the countries in which we sell our products. we are subject to numerous laws and regulations relating to the growing, sourcing, manufacture, storage, labeling, marketing, advertising and distribution of food products, as well as laws and regulations relating to financial reporting requirements, the environment, competition, anti-corruption, privacy, relations with distributors and retailers, foreign supplier verification, the import and export of products and product ingredients, employment, health and safety, and trade practices. enforcement of existing laws and regulations, changes in legal requirements, and/or evolving interpretations of existing regulatory requirements may result in increased compliance costs and create other obligations, financial or otherwise, that could adversely affect our business, financial condition or operating results. increased regulatory scrutiny of, and increased litigation involving, product claims and concerns regarding the attributes of food products and ingredients may increase compliance costs and create other obligations that could adversely affect our business, financial condition or operating results. governments may also impose requirements and restrictions that impact our business, such as labeling disclosures pertaining to ingredients. for example, "proposition 65, the safe drinking water and toxic enforcement act of 1986," in california exposes all food companies to the possibility of having to provide warnings on their products in that state. if we were required to add warning labels to any of our products or place warnings in locations where our products are sold in order to comply with proposition 65, the sales of those products and other products of our company could suffer, not only in those locations but elsewhere. these factors and others could have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition or results of operations.
our operations may be impaired as a result of disasters, business interruptions or similar events.
we could have an interruption in our business, loss of inventory or data, or be rendered unable to accept and fulfill customer orders as a result of a natural disaster, catastrophic event, epidemic or computer system failure. natural disasters could include an earthquake, fire, flood, tornado or severe storm. a catastrophic event could include a terrorist attack. an epidemic could affect our operations, major facilities or employees' and consumers' health. in addition, some of our inventory and production facilities are located in areas that are susceptible to harsh weather; a major storm, heavy snowfall or other similar event could prevent us from delivering products in a timely manner. production of certain of our products is concentrated in a single manufacturing site.
we cannot provide assurance that our disaster recovery plan will address all of the issues we may encounter in the event of a disaster or other unanticipated issue, and our business interruption insurance may not adequately compensate us for losses that may occur from any of the foregoing. in the event that a natural disaster, terrorist attack or other catastrophic event were to destroy any part of our facilities or interrupt our operations for any extended period of time, or if harsh weather or health conditions prevent us from delivering products in a timely manner, our business, financial condition or operating results could be adversely affected.
we may not be able to successfully consummate and manage ongoing acquisition, joint venture and divestiture activities which could have an impact on our results.
from time to time, we may acquire other businesses and, based on an evaluation of our business portfolio, divest existing businesses. these acquisitions, joint ventures and divestitures may present financial, managerial and operational challenges, including diversion of management attention from existing businesses, difficulty with integrating or separating personnel and financial and other systems, increased expenses and raw material costs, assumption of unknown liabilities and indemnities, and potential disputes with the buyers or sellers. in addition, we may be required to incur asset impairment charges (including charges related to goodwill and other intangible assets) in connection with acquired businesses which may reduce our profitability. if we are unable to consummate such transactions, or successfully integrate and grow acquisitions and achieve contemplated revenue synergies and cost savings, our financial results could be adversely affected. additionally, joint ventures inherently involve a lesser degree of control over business operations, thereby potentially increasing the financial, legal, operational and/or compliance risks.
our foreign operations are subject to additional risks.
we operate our business and market our products internationally. in fiscal year 2014, approximately 45% of our sales were generated in foreign countries. our foreign operations are subject to additional risks, including fluctuations in currency values, foreign currency exchange controls, discriminatory fiscal policies, compliance with u.s. and foreign laws, enforcement of remedies in foreign jurisdictions and other economic or political uncertainties. beginning in 2011, several countries within the european union experienced sovereign debt and credit issues. this has caused more volatility in the economic environment throughout the european union. additionally, international sales are subject to risks related to imposition of tariffs, quotas, trade barriers and other similar restrictions. all of these risks could result in increased costs or decreased revenues, which could adversely affect our profitability.
fluctuations in foreign currency markets may negatively impact us.
we are exposed to fluctuations in foreign currency in the following main areas: cash flows related to raw material purchases; the translation of foreign currency earnings to u.s. dollars; the value of foreign currency investments in subsidiaries and unconsolidated affiliates and cash flows related to repatriation of these investments. primary exposures include the u.s. dollar versus the euro, british pound sterling, canadian dollar, polish zloty, australian dollar, mexican peso, chinese renminbi, indian rupee, thai baht and swiss franc, as well as the british pound sterling versus the euro. we routinely enter into foreign currency exchange contracts to facilitate managing certain of these foreign currency risks. however, these contracts may not effectively limit or eliminate our exposure to a decline in operating results due to foreign currency exchange changes. therefore, we cannot provide assurance that future exchange rate fluctuations will not have a negative impact on our business, financial position or operating results.
increases in interest rates may negatively impact us.
we had total outstanding short-term borrowings of $270 million at an average interest rate of approximately 1.3% on november 30, 2014. our policy is to manage our interest rate risk by entering into both fixed and variable rate debt arrangements. we also use interest rate swaps to minimize worldwide financing cost and to achieve a desired mix of fixed and variable rate debt. we utilize derivative financial instruments to enhance our ability to manage risk, including interest rate exposures that exist as part of our ongoing business operations. we do not enter into contracts for trading purposes, nor are we a party to any leveraged derivative instruments. our use of derivative financial instruments is monitored through regular communication with senior management and the utilization of written guidelines. however, our use of these instruments may not effectively limit or eliminate our exposure to changes in interest rates. therefore, we cannot provide assurance that future interest rate changes will not have a material negative impact on our business, financial position or operating results.
the deterioration of credit and capital markets may adversely affect our access to sources of funding.
we rely on our revolving credit facilities, or borrowings backed by these facilities, to fund a portion of our seasonal working capital needs and other general corporate purposes. if any of the banks in the syndicates backing these facilities were unable to perform on its commitments, our liquidity could be impacted, which could adversely affect funding of seasonal working capital requirements. we engage in regular communication with all of the banks participating in our revolving credit facilities. during these communications none of the banks have indicated that they may be unable to perform on their commitments. in addition, we periodically review our banking and financing relationships, considering the stability of the institutions, pricing we receive on services and other aspects of the relationships. based on these communications and our monitoring activities, we believe the likelihood of one of our banks not performing on its commitment is remote.
in addition, global capital markets have experienced volatility in the past that has tightened access to capital markets and other sources of funding, and such volatility and tightened access could reoccur in the future. in the event we need to access the capital markets or other sources of financing, there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain financing on acceptable terms or within an acceptable time. our inability to obtain financing on acceptable terms or within an acceptable time period could have an adverse impact on our operations, financial condition and liquidity.
we face risks associated with certain pension assets and obligations.
we hold investments in equity and debt securities in our qualified defined benefit pension plans and in a rabbi trust for our u.s. non-qualified pension plan. deterioration in the value of plan assets resulting from a general financial downturn or otherwise, or an increase in the actuarial valuation of the plans' liability due to a low interest rate environment, could cause (or increase) an underfunded status of our defined benefit pension plans, thereby increasing our obligation to make contributions to the plans. an obligation to make contributions to pension plans could reduce the cash available for working capital and other corporate uses, and may have an adverse impact on our operations, financial condition and liquidity.
the global financial downturn exposes us to credit risks from customers and counterparties.
consolidations in some of the industries in which our customers operate have created larger customers, some of which are highly leveraged. in addition, competition has increased with the growth in alternative channels through our customer base. these factors have caused some customers to be less profitable and increased our exposure to credit risk. current credit markets are volatile, and some of our customers and counterparties are highly leveraged. a significant adverse change in the financial and/or credit position of a customer or counterparty could require us to assume greater credit risk relating to that customer or counterparty and could limit our ability to collect receivables. this could have an adverse impact on our financial condition and liquidity.
our operations may be impaired if our information technology systems fail to perform adequately or if we are the subject of a data breach or cyber attack.
our information technology systems are critically important to operating our business efficiently. we rely on our information technology systems to manage our business data, communications, supply chain, order entry and fulfillment, and other business processes. the failure of our information technology systems to perform as we anticipate could disrupt our business and could result in transaction errors, processing inefficiencies and the loss of sales and customers, causing our business and results of operations to suffer.
furthermore, our information technology systems may be vulnerable to security breaches beyond our control. we invest in security technology to protect our data and business processes against risk of data security breaches and cyber attacks. while we believe these measures provide some protection against security breaches and mitigate cybersecurity risks, there can be no assurance that security breaches and cyber attacks will not occur. a breach or successful attack could have a negative impact on our operations or business reputation.
the global nature of our business and the resolution of tax disputes create volatility in our effective tax rate.
as a global business, our tax rate from period to period can be affected by many factors, including changes in tax legislation, our global mix of earnings, the tax characteristics of our income, the timing and recognition of goodwill impairments, acquisitions and dispositions, adjustments to our reserves related to uncertain tax positions, changes in valuation allowances and the portion of the income of foreign subsidiaries that we expect to remit to the u.s. and that will be taxable.
in addition, significant judgment is required in determining our effective tax rate and in evaluating our tax positions. we establish accruals for certain tax contingencies when, despite the belief that our tax return positions are appropriately supported, the positions are uncertain. the tax contingency accruals are adjusted in light of changing facts and circumstances, such as the progress of tax audits, case law and emerging legislation. our effective tax rate includes the impact of tax contingency accruals and changes to the accruals, including related interest and penalties, as considered appropriate by management. when particular matters arise, a number of years may elapse before such matters are audited and finally resolved. favorable resolution of such matters could be recognized as a reduction to our effective tax rate in the year of resolution. unfavorable resolution of any particular issue could increase the effective tax rate and may require the use of cash in the year of resolution.
climate change may negatively affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
unseasonable or unusual weather or long-term climate changes may negatively impact the price or availability of spices, herbs and other raw materials. there is concern that greenhouse gases in the atmosphere may have an adverse impact on global temperatures, weather patterns and the frequency and severity of extreme weather and natural disasters. in the event that such climate change has a negative effect on agricultural productivity or practices, we may be subject to decreased availability or less favorable pricing for certain commodities that are necessary for our products.
our intellectual property rights, and those of our customers, could be infringed, challenged or impaired, and reduce the value of our products and brands or our business with customers.
we possess intellectual property rights that are important to our business, and we are provided access by certain customers to particular intellectual property rights belonging to such customers. these intellectual property rights include ingredient formulas, trademarks, copyrights, patents, business processes and other trade secrets which are important to our business and relate to some of our products, our packaging, the processes for their production, and the design and operation of equipment used in our businesses. we protect our intellectual property rights, and those of certain customers, globally through a variety of means, including trademarks, copyrights, patents and trade secrets, third-party assignments and nondisclosure agreements, and monitoring of third-party misuses of intellectual property. if we fail to obtain or adequately protect our intellectual property (and the intellectual property of customers to which we have been given access), the value of our products and brands could be reduced and there could be an adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
litigation, legal or administrative proceedings could have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations, and damage our reputation.
we are party to a variety of legal claims and proceedings in the ordinary course of business. since litigation is inherently uncertain, there is no guarantee that we will be successful in defending ourselves against such claims or proceedings, or that management's assessment of the materiality or immateriality of these matters, including any reserves taken in connection with such matters, will be consistent with the ultimate outcome of such claims or proceedings. in the event that management's assessment of the materiality or immateriality of current claims and proceedings proves inaccurate, or litigation that is material arises in the future, there may be a material adverse effect on our financial condition. any adverse publicity resulting from allegations made in litigation claims or legal or administrative proceedings (even if untrue) may also adversely affect our reputation. these factors and others could have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition or results of operations.
streamlining actions to reduce fixed costs, simplify or improve processes, and improve our competitiveness may have a negative effect on employee relations.
during 2014 and 2013, we evaluated changes to our organization structure to enable us to reduce fixed costs, simplify or improve processes, and improve our competitiveness, and we expect to continue such actions in the future. as a result of such fixed cost reductions and process simplifications or improvements, we may, from time to time, transfer production from one manufacturing facility to another or eliminate certain manufacturing, selling and administrative positions. these actions may result in a deterioration of employee relations at the impacted locations or elsewhere in mccormick.
if we are unable to fully realize the benefits from our comprehensive continuous improvement (cci) program, our financial results could be negatively affected.
our future success depends in part on our ability to be an efficient producer in a highly competitive industry. any failure by us to achieve our planned cost savings and efficiencies under our cci program, or other similar programs, could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial position.
item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview the following management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations (md&a) is intended to help the reader understand mccormick & company, incorporated, our operations and our present business environment. md&a is provided as a supplement to, and should be read in conjunction with, our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes thereto contained in item 8 of this report. we use certain non-gaap information that we believe is important for purposes of comparison to prior periods and development of future projections and earnings growth prospects. this information is also used by management to measure the profitability of our ongoing operations and analyze our business performance and trends. the dollar and share information in the charts and tables in the md&a are in millions, except per share data.
mccormick is a global leader in flavor. the company manufactures, markets and distributes spices, seasoning mixes, condiments and other flavorful products to the entire food industry-retail outlets, food manufacturers and foodservice businesses. we manage our business in two operating segments, consumer and industrial, as described in item 1 of this report.
our long-term annual growth objectives are to increase sales 4% to 6%, increase operating income 7% to 9% and increase earnings per share 9% to 11%. over time, we expect to grow sales with similar contributions from: 1) our base business-driven by brand marketing support, customer intimacy and category growth; 2) product innovation; and 3) acquisitions. we are fueling our investment in growth with cost savings from our comprehensive continuous improvement (cci) program, an ongoing initiative to improve productivity and reduce costs throughout the organization. in addition to funding brand marketing support, product innovation and other growth initiatives, our cci program helps offset higher material costs and is contributing to higher operating income and earnings per share.
our business generates strong cash flow, and we have a balanced use of cash. we are using our cash to fund shareholder dividends, with annual increases in each of the past 29 years, and to fund capital expenditures, acquisitions and share repurchases. each year, we expect a combination of acquisitions and share repurchases to add about 2% to earnings per share growth.
in 2014, we grew net sales 3% with increases in both our consumer and industrial business. this rate of growth was below our long-term goal as a result of challenging conditions in certain parts of our business. in the u.s., our consumer business was impacted by smaller competitors that have gained retail distribution. we are addressing this competition through accelerated innovation, increased brand marketing and the sharing of our analytics with retail customers to help optimize their sales and profitability while simultaneously increasing our sales to those customers. in china, our industrial business was impacted by weak demand from quick service restaurants that related to a product quality issue from a protein supplier. we expect this situation to improve in 2015 as these quick service restaurants have addressed this issue and continue to invest in new restaurant locations in china. operating income was $603.0 million in 2014. excluding special charges and in 2013, a loss on a voluntary pension settlement, adjusted operating income rose to $608.2 million from $590.8 million in 2013. this was an increase of 3% and below our long-term objective due in part to a significant increase in brand marketing support and a less favorable mix of business. diluted earnings per share was $3.34 in 2014. excluding the effect of the aforementioned special charges and the 2013 loss on voluntary pension settlement, adjusted diluted earnings per share was $3.37 in 2014, an increase of approximately 8% over adjusted diluted earnings per share of $3.13 in 2013. this increase was mainly driven by higher adjusted operating income, higher income from unconsolidated operations and our share repurchases.
mccormick continues to generate strong cash flow. net cash provided by operating activities reached $503.6 million in 2014, an increase from $465.2 million in 2013. we continued to have a balanced use of cash for capital expenditures, acquisitions and the return of cash to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. in 2014, that return of cash to our shareholders was a record $436.7 million.

sales for the fiscal year 2014 rose 2.9% from 2013, with growth in both the consumer and industrial segments. pricing actions, taken in response to increased raw material and packaging costs, added 1.9% to sales. the incremental impact of the wuhan asia pacific condiments (wapc) acquisition, completed in mid-2013, accounted for a 1.8% increase to sales, while volume and product mix in the base business reduced sales 0.2%. the impact of foreign exchange rates was unfavorable in 2014, reducing sales by 0.6%.
in 2015, we expect to grow sales in local currency by 4% to 6% from 2014, to include the impact of higher volume and pricing. we expect this range to be significantly reduced as a result of unfavorable foreign currency exchange rates.
2014                                               2013

gross profit margin          40.8   %          40.4   %
in 2014, gross profit increased 3.9% while gross profit margin rose 40 basis points over the 2013 level to 40.8%. we offset a low single-digit increase in raw material and packaging costs with our pricing actions and cci cost savings. our cci program generated cost savings of $65 million in 2014, of which $54 million lowered cost of goods sold. in 2015, we expect a favorable impact from pricing actions and cost savings, largely offset by a mid-single digit increase in raw material and packaging costs.
2014                                                                                    2013

selling, general and administrative expenses were $1,122.0 million in 2014 compared to $1,075.0 million in 2013, an increase of $47.0 million or 40 basis points as a percentage of net sales. that 40 basis point increase was driven by an $18.8 million increase in our brand marketing support from the 2013 level to $226.6 million in 2014, with 40% of that increase related to digital marketing, which is one of our highest return investments in brand marketing support. in addition, compared to 2013, lower pension and other postretirement benefit expenses in 2014 were partially offset by increased employee incentive compensation expenses in 2014.
2014                                                        2013
special charges                           $5.2         $25.0
loss on voluntary pension settlement         -          15.3
we are evaluating changes to our organization structure to enable us to reduce fixed costs, simplify or improve processes, and improve our competitiveness. special charges of $5.2 million were recorded in 2014 to enable us to implement these changes. of the $5.2 million of special charges recorded in 2014, which were principally related to employee severance, $2.1 million related to actions undertaken with respect to the emea reorganization announced in late 2013, $1.3 million related to the realignment of certain manufacturing activities in the u.s. industrial business, $1.1 million related to the elimination of certain administrative positions in the u.s. consumer and industrial businesses, and $0.7 million related to the elimination of certain administrative and manufacturing positions in the australian consumer business.
in late 2013, we announced several reorganization activities in the emea region to further improve emea's profitability and process standardization while supporting its competitiveness and long-term growth. at that time, we indicated our expectation that we would recognize approximately $27 million of cash and non-cash charges related to this plan, of which $25.0 million in special charges was recognized in 2013, with $15.9 million related to employee severance, $6.4 million for asset write-downs and $2.7 million for other exit costs. total cash expenditures to implement this emea reorganization plan were $10.7 million in 2014. we expect to complete the implementation of this plan in 2015, spending an additional $10 million in cash in that year. see note 3 of the financial statements for further information with respect to special charges recorded in 2014 and 2013.
in addition to the special charges outlined above, we recorded a loss on voluntary pension settlement of $15.3 million in 2013 for the settlement of a portion of our u.s. defined benefit obligation, which reduced the size of our pension obligation and should reduce potential pension volatility in the future. the settlement charge relates to a lump sum distribution elected by certain former u.s. employees in exchange for their deferred vested pension plan benefits. this lump sum payout program was completed in 2013. see note 10 of the financial statements for additional information.

interest expense for 2014 was lower than the prior year, primarily due to the refinancing of long-term debt in the second half of 2013. in august 2013, we issued $250 million of 3.50% notes (at an effective interest rate of 3.30%), the net cash proceeds of which, plus cash on hand, were used to pay off $250 million of 5.25% notes (at an effective interest rate of 5.54%) that matured in september 2013.
2014                                                                               2013

effective tax rate                                             26.3   %        26.8   %
the effective tax rate declined 50 basis points to 26.3% in 2014 from 26.8% in 2013, primarily as a result of the following factors: discrete tax benefits were $10.8 million in 2014 compared to $3.9 million in 2013. that increase in 2014 is primarily due to the reversal of previously established reserves for unrecognized tax benefits, net of additional taxes provided, upon the following tax settlements reached during 2014: (1) a settlement with respect to the french taxing authority's audits of the 2007-2013 tax years; and (2) a settlement with respect to the internal revenue service (irs) examination of our u.s. federal income tax return for the 2007 and 2008 tax years. discrete tax benefits in 2013 of $3.9 million resulted from the 2013 recognition of a 2012 u.s. research tax credit and reversal of valuation allowances for two subsidiaries originally established against net operating losses. during 2013, a new law was enacted that retroactively granted the research tax credit in 2012 and allowed for a research tax credit in 2013. no research tax credit was recognized in 2014 as the tax law which retroactively granted the research tax credit for 2014 was not enacted until after the company's 2014 fiscal year end. see note 12 of the financial statements for a reconciliation of the u.s. federal tax rate with the effective tax rate.
in november 2012, we deposited $18.8 million with the irs to stop any potential interest on proposed adjustments associated with the irs examination of our u.s. federal income tax returns for the 2007 and 2008 tax years. in november 2014, $14.9 million of that deposit was refunded to us upon our settlement with the irs.
we expect the effective tax rate in 2015 to range from 27% to 28%.
2014                                                         2013
income from unconsolidated operations     $29.4         $23.2
income from unconsolidated operations rose $6.2 million in 2014 compared to 2013, which was a 26.7% increase. this increase is attributable to our largest joint venture, mccormick de mexico, which benefited in 2014 from its transition to a more efficient manufacturing facility and from lower commodity costs.
in 2014, our 50% interest in the mccormick de mexico joint venture represented 64% of the sales and 91% of the net income of our unconsolidated joint ventures. we own 50% of most of our other unconsolidated joint ventures.

we grew sales in the consumer business 3.4% in 2014 from 2013. this growth rate included a 2.9% increase due to the mid-2013 acquisition of wapc and a 2.0% increase due to higher price, offset in part by a 1.1% decline in volume and product mix and 0.4% decline from unfavorable foreign exchange rates in 2014 from 2013.
in the americas, consumer business sales declined 0.7%. although higher pricing added 1.6%, a decline in volume and product mix reduced sales 1.6% and unfavorable foreign exchange rates reduced sales 0.7%. in the latter part of 2013, our sales growth was hampered as smaller competitors gained category share. this competitive activity persisted in 2014. throughout 2014, we had actions underway to regain momentum with this part of our business that included additional brand marketing support, accelerated innovation and working with our retail customers to optimize their spices and seasonings and their recipe mix categories while simultaneously increasing sales of our products to these customers. we are making progress and have gained category share in 2014 in recipe mixes, driven in part by new grilling products, gluten-free products and liquid skillet sauces. in 2014, our category share of spices and seasonings had a further decline, although we expect better results in 2015 as we continue with our actions to improve the performance of our consumer business in the americas.
in emea, consumer business sales increased 3.3%, with 2.0% added by pricing and 1.5% added by favorable foreign currency exchange rates. volume and product mix declined slightly, reducing sales by 0.2%. while we had success with new product introductions, increased brand marketing and distribution gains, economic conditions across the region remained challenging. our innovation activity in 2014 included the roll-out of flavour shots in the u.k., dessert items in france and additional recipe mixes in poland. in this region, higher brand marketing support was devoted to building awareness and trial of new products, as well as digital marketing.
in the asia/pacific region, sales rose 31.2%. our mid-2013 acquisition of wapc added 28.2% to net sales, pricing actions added 4.0%, and base business volume and product mix added 2.2%, while unfavorable foreign currency exchange rates lowered sales 3.2%. we achieved a double-digit increase in our base business volume and product mix in china. however, crop shortages of basmati rice led to another year of steep increases in cost and pricing of basmati rice in india during 2014, and a subsequent decline in our sales volume as consumers turned toward lower cost rice varieties.
consumer business operating income, excluding special charges and, for 2013, loss on voluntary pension settlement, rose 0.4% to $474.3 million from $472.3 million in 2013. higher sales and cci cost savings contributed to this profit growth, but were largely offset by higher material costs and a $16.8 million increase in brand marketing support. operating income margin, excluding the impact of special charges and the 2013 loss on voluntary pension settlement, was 18.1% in 2014 compared to 18.6% in 2013. this reduction was due, in part, to the higher brand marketing support and the mix of business across regions, as sales in international markets grew at a faster rate than in the u.s., where our profit margin is higher due to larger scale and less complexity.

we grew sales for the industrial business 2.0% in 2014. pricing actions taken to offset the impact of higher material costs added 1.8% and volume and product mix added 0.9%. unfavorable foreign exchange rates decreased sales 0.7%. the growth in volume and product mix was led by sales of snack seasonings in the americas and sales to quick service restaurants in our emea region.
in the americas, industrial business sales rose 0.4%. pricing added 1.0% and volume and product mix added 0.3% to sales, offset in part by unfavorable foreign currency exchange rates that lowered sales 0.9%. innovation and category growth drove increased sales of seasonings for snack products and we also grew sales of branded foodservice items in 2014. however, demand from quick service restaurants was weak in the u.s. in 2014. this weakness is likely to extend into the first part of 2015.
in emea, we grew industrial business sales 9.3%, with a 5.0% increase from pricing actions, a 3.2% increase in volume and product mix, and a 1.1% increase from favorable foreign exchange rates. demand from quick service restaurants remained robust, and we met this demand with products that we supply from our facilities in the u.k., turkey and south africa.
in the asia/pacific region, industrial business sales declined by 0.5%. while pricing actions added 1.0% and higher volume and product mix added 0.9%, unfavorable foreign exchange rates reduced sales 2.4%. sales to quick service restaurants in china were adversely impacted by consumer concerns regarding quality issues from a supplier of protein in 2014 and regarding avian flu in 2013. in 2015, we expect demand from these quick service restaurant customers to improve in china as they address these issues and continue to expand the number of restaurant locations.
industrial business operating income, excluding special charges and, for 2013, loss on voluntary pension settlement, was $133.9 million compared to $118.5 million in 2013. higher sales, the benefit of cci cost savings and a more favorable mix of business, more than offset increased material costs and a $2.0 million increase in marketing support for branded foodservice items. industrial business operating income margin, excluding the impact of special charges and the 2013 loss on voluntary pension settlement, was 8.3% in 2014 compared to 7.5% in 2013.

sales for the fiscal year 2013 rose 2.7% from 2012, with growth in the consumer segment partially offset by a decline in the industrial segment. pricing actions, taken in response to increased raw material and packaging costs, added 1.5% to sales. the incremental impact of the wapc acquisition, completed in mid-2013, accounted for a 1.5% increase to sales, and increased volume and product mix in the base business added 0.1% to sales. the impact of foreign exchange rates was unfavorable in 2013, reducing sales by 0.4%.

in 2013, gross profit increased 3.0% while gross profit margin rose 10 basis points. we were able to offset the dollar impact of 3% inflation in raw material and packaging costs with our pricing actions and cci cost savings. in 2013, cci cost savings totaled $63 million, of which $48 million lowered cost of goods sold.

selling, general and administrative expenses were $1,075.0 million in 2013 compared to $1,039.5 million in 2012, an increase of $35.5 million or 20 basis points as a percentage of net sales. retirement benefit expense increased $20.0 million in 2013 largely as a result of a lower interest rate environment at the november 30, 2012 pension measurement date which negatively impacted 2013 expense. of the increase in retirement benefit expense, approximately 60% impacted selling, general and administrative expenses. in addition, we increased our brand marketing support by $9.6 million to $207.8 million in 2013, with about half of the increase in digital marketing, which is one of our highest return investments in brand marketing support.
2013
special charges                          $25.0
loss on voluntary pension settlement      15.3
in 2013, we announced several reorganization activities in the emea region and our expectation that we would record approximately $27 million of cash and non-cash charges related to this plan. for 2013, we recorded $25.0 million of special charges, with $15.9 million related to employee severance, $6.4 million for asset write-downs and $2.7 million for other exit costs. we expect to complete the implementation of this plan in 2015. see note 3 of the financial statements for additional information.
in addition to the $25.0 million in special charges outlined above, we recorded a loss on voluntary pension settlement of $15.3 million in 2013 for the settlement of a portion of our u.s. defined benefit obligation, which reduced the size of our pension obligation and should reduce potential pension volatility in the future. the settlement charge relates to a lump sum distribution elected by certain former u.s. employees in exchange for their deferred vested pension plan benefits. this lump sum payout program was completed in 2013. see note 10 of the financial statements for additional information.

other income, net       2.2           2.4
interest expense for 2013 was lower than the prior year. most of this decrease is due to the impact of lower average debt balances for 2013 compared to 2012, and was partially aided by slightly lower average interest rates in 2013. the higher average debt balances in 2012 were due to the acquisitions completed late in 2011.
2013                                                                               2012

discrete tax benefits in 2013 were $3.9 million compared to $2.0 million in 2012. the increase in 2013 was due to the 2013 recognition of a 2012 u.s. research tax credit and reversal of valuation allowances for two subsidiaries originally established against net operating losses. a new law was enacted in 2013 that retroactively granted the research tax credit in 2012.
tax expense for 2012 benefited from u.s. foreign tax credits that reduced tax expense by $9.7 million due to the repatriation of $70 million of cash from foreign subsidiaries. while no such benefit or repatriation occurred in 2013, tax expense in 2013 as a percentage of pre-tax income approximated the 2012 level due primarily to certain favorable items in 2013, which included the utilization of non-u.s. operating losses, lower state and local income taxes, and the inclusion of the u.s. research tax credit for 2013, as well as the increase in discrete tax benefits described above.
in addition, see note 12 of the financial statements for a reconciliation of the u.s. federal statutory tax rate with the effective tax rate.

income from unconsolidated operations     $23.2         $21.5
income from unconsolidated operations increased $1.7 million in 2013 compared to 2012. most of this increase was attributable to our largest joint venture, mccormick de mexico, through strong sales growth, along with improved performance by our eastern condiments joint venture in india.
in 2013, our mccormick de mexico joint venture represented 63% of the sales and 78% of the net income of our unconsolidated joint ventures.

we grew sales in the consumer business 5.1% in 2013 from 2012, which included a 2.5% increase due to the mid-2013 acquisition of wapc, a 1.7% increase due to higher price, and a 1.0% increase from higher volumes and improved product mix. the effect of foreign exchange rates in 2013 from 2012 was slightly unfavorable, reducing sales by 0.1%.
in the americas, consumer business sales rose 2.4%, with volume and product mix adding 1.7%, higher pricing adding 0.9% and unfavorable foreign exchange rates lowering sales by 0.2%. higher volume and product mix was the result of new product introductions and increased brand marketing. in 2013, our new product launches included grilling items, premium recipe mixes, authentic hispanic rice mixes and new varieties of lawry's, zatarain's and simply asia brand products in the u.s. in canada, we had particular success with gluten-free gravy mixes, introduced new grilling items and imported products from our business in china and affiliate in the philippines. across the americas region, a portion of our incremental brand marketing support was in support of our new products and seasonal events. we also increased our digital marketing activity, which offers a more personalized way to interact with consumers. while we made good progress with these growth initiatives which contributed to strong consumer demand for spices and seasonings throughout 2013, our u.s. sales slowed in the second half of the year. during this period, private label and smaller competitors gained category share. in 2014, we had actions underway to regain momentum with this part of our business that include a significant increase in brand marketing support, accelerated innovation and improved agility in the marketplace.
in emea, consumer business sales increased 3.3%, with pricing and favorable foreign currency exchange rates each adding 1.3%, and higher volume and product mix adding 0.7%. while we had success with new product introductions, increased brand marketing and distribution gains, economic conditions across the region remained challenging. our innovation in 2013 included the development and introduction of recipe mixes in france and poland, the launch of grilling items in a number of markets, and new varieties of vahiné brand dessert items. as in the americas, higher brand marketing support was devoted to building awareness and trial of new products and towards digital marketing.
in the asia/pacific region, sales rose 32.6%. the impact of our 2013 acquisition of wapc added 30.6% to net sales, pricing added 10.0%, base business volume and product mix declined 4.7% and unfavorable foreign currency exchange rates lowered sales by 3.3%. we achieved a double-digit increase in our base business volume and product mix in china. however, crop shortages of basmati rice led to a steep increase in cost and pricing of basmati rice in india during 2013, and a subsequent decline in our sales volume as consumers turned toward lower cost rice varieties.
consumer business operating income, excluding special charges and loss on voluntary pension settlement, rose to $472.3 million from $456.1 million in 2012, a 3.6% increase. the growth in operating income was the result of higher sales and cci savings, offset, in part, by higher retirement benefit expense, a $6.9 million increase in brand marketing support, $4.3 million of transaction costs related to the acquisition of wapc and higher material costs. operating income margin, excluding the impact of special charges and loss on voluntary pension settlement, was 18.6% in 2013 compared to 18.9% in 2012. this reduction was due, in part, to the mix of business across regions, as sales in international markets grew at a faster rate than in the u.s., where our profit margin is higher due to larger scale and less complexity.

sales for the industrial business declined 0.8% in 2013. pricing actions taken to offset the impact of higher material costs added 1.2%, while volume and product mix lowered sales by 1.2% and unfavorable foreign exchange rates decreased sales 0.8%. the decline in volume and product mix was largely attributable to weak demand from quick service restaurants in the u.s. and china. in the u.s., sales to quick service restaurants were impacted by lower restaurant traffic and customer emphasis on menu items for which mccormick is not a leading supplier. in china, consumer concerns, including avian flu, led to reduced demand for poultry throughout most of 2013. as a leading supplier of coatings and seasonings for chicken, this adversely impacted our sales in 2013.
in the americas, industrial business sales declined 1.7%. while pricing added 1.2% to sales and favorable foreign currency exchange rates added 0.1%, lower volume and product mix reduced sales 3.0%. innovation and category growth drove increased sales of seasonings for snack products and sales of branded foodservice items were steady in 2013. however, as indicated, demand from quick service restaurants was weak in the u.s. in 2013.
in emea, industrial business sales rose 1.4%, with a 3.9% increase in volume and product mix as well as a 2.0% increase from pricing actions. these increases were partially offset by unfavorable foreign exchange rates that reduced sales by 4.5%. demand from quick service restaurants remained robust, and we met this demand with products that we supply from our facilities in the u.k., turkey and south africa.
industrial business sales in the asia/pacific region rose slightly, increasing by 0.2%. higher volume and product mix added 0.6% and was largely offset by lower pricing of 0.1% and unfavorable foreign exchange rates of 0.3%. product innovation in other parts of the region largely offset the weaker demand from quick service restaurants in china that was previously described. by the end of our fiscal year 2013, the situation in china had improved.
industrial business operating income, excluding special charges and loss on voluntary pension settlement, was $118.5 million compared to $122.2 million in 2012. the benefit of cci cost savings was more than offset by higher retirement benefit expense, increased material costs and a $2.7 million increase in marketing support for branded foodservice items. industrial business operating income margin, excluding the impact of special charges and loss on voluntary pension settlement, was 7.5% in 2013 compared to 7.6% in 2012.
non-gaap financial measures the tables below include financial measures of adjusted operating income, adjusted net income and adjusted diluted earnings per share, each excluding the impact of special charges in 2014 and 2013, and loss on voluntary pension settlement in 2013. there were no adjustments to 2012 financial results. these represent non-gaap financial measures, which are prepared as a complement to our financial results prepared in accordance with united states generally accepted accounting principles. we believe this non-gaap information is important for purposes of comparison to prior periods and development of future projections and earnings growth prospects. this information is also used by management to measure the profitability of our ongoing operations and analyze our business performance and trends.
special charges of $5.2 million were recorded in 2014 to enable us to implement changes to our organization structure in order to reduce fixed costs, simplify or improve processes, and improve our competitiveness. of the $5.2 million of special charges recorded in 2014, $2.1 million related to actions undertaken with respect to the emea reorganization announced in 2013, $1.3 million related to the realignment of manufacturing activities in the u.s. industrial business, and $1.1 million and $0.7 million related to the elimination of administrative and/or manufacturing positions in the consumer and industrial businesses in the u.s. and australia, respectively.
in 2013, we recorded $25.0 million of special charges related to reorganization activities in the emea region and $15.3 million of loss on voluntary pension settlement related to our u.s. pension plan for a lump sum distribution to former employees in exchange for their deferred vested pension plan benefits.
we are treating these special charges and loss on voluntary pension settlement as adjustments to our operating income, net income and diluted earnings per share. we are providing non-gaap results that exclude the impact of these special charges and loss on voluntary pension settlement as it allows for a better comparison of 2014 financial results to 2013 and 2012. see notes 3 and 10 of the financial statements for additional information on the special charges and the loss on voluntary pension settlement, respectively.
these non-gaap measures may be considered in addition to results prepared in accordance with gaap, but they should not be considered a substitute for, or superior to, gaap results. we intend to continue to provide these non-gaap financial measures as part of our future earnings discussions and, therefore, the inclusion of these non-gaap financial measures will provide consistency in our financial reporting. a reconciliation of these non-gaap measures to gaap financial results is provided below.

in addition to the above non-gaap measures, we use total debt to adjusted earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization (adjusted ebitda) as a measure of leverage. we define adjusted ebitda as net income plus expenses of interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization, special charges and loss on voluntary pension settlement. adjusted ebitda and the ratio of total debt to adjusted ebitda are both non-gaap financial measures. this ratio measures our ability to repay outstanding debt obligations. our target for total debt to adjusted ebitda, excluding the temporary impact from acquisition activity, is 1.5 to 1.8. we believe that total debt to adjusted ebitda is a meaningful metric to investors in evaluating our financial leverage and may be different than the method used by other companies to calculate total debt to adjusted ebitda.
the following table reconciles our adjusted ebitda to our net income:

we generate strong cash flow from operations which enables us to fund operating projects and investments that are designed to meet our growth objectives, increase our dividend, fund capital projects and make share repurchases when appropriate. in 2015, we expect to continue our share repurchase activity and fund all or a portion of possible future acquisitions with cash flow from operations.
in the cash flow statement, the changes in operating assets and liabilities are presented excluding the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, as these do not reflect actual cash flows. accordingly, the amounts in the cash flow statement do not agree with changes in the operating assets and liabilities that are presented in the balance sheet.
the reported values of our assets and liabilities held in our non-u.s. subsidiaries and affiliates can be significantly affected by fluctuations in foreign exchange rates between periods. at november 30, 2014, the exchange rate for the euro, british pound sterling, canadian dollar, polish zloty and australian dollar were lower versus the u.s. dollar than at november 30, 2013.
operating cash flow - operating cash flow was $503.6 million in 2014, $465.2 million in 2013 and $455.0 million in 2012. the variability between years is due in part to changes in pension contributions, which were $16.8 million in 2014, $42.7 million in 2013 and $104.3 million in 2012. these contributions include payments to unfunded plans. we did not make any contribution to our major u.s. pension plan in 2014 as the plan was already funded within our company funding guidelines. the change in inventory also had an impact on the variability in cash flow from operations, as it was a use of cash in 2014 and 2013 and a modest source of cash in 2012. higher adjusted net income, which excludes the impact of special charges in 2014 and 2013 and the loss on voluntary pension settlement in 2013, in 2014 compared to 2013 and in 2013 compared to 2012 was also a factor in the increased cash flow from operations in 2014 and in 2013, respectively.
in addition to operating cash flow, we also use cash conversion cycle (ccc) to measure our working capital management. this metric is different than operating cash flow in that it uses average balances instead of specific point in time measures. ccc is a calculation of the number of days, on average, that it takes us to convert a cash outlay for resources, such as raw materials, to a cash inflow from collection of accounts receivable. our goal is to lower our ccc over time. we calculate ccc as follows:
days sales outstanding (average trade accounts receivable divided by average daily net sales) plus days in inventory (average inventory divided by average daily cost of goods sold) less days payable outstanding (average trade accounts payable divided by average daily cost of goods sold plus the average daily change in inventory).
the following table outlines our cash conversion cycle (in days) over the last three years:
2014                                   2013      2012
cash conversion cycle   91.4      84.8      82.1
the increase in ccc from 2013 to 2014 is mainly due to an increase in our days in inventory as a result of increased strategic raw material inventory. in the future we expect to reduce ccc by decreasing our days in inventory. the increase in ccc from 2012 to 2013 is due to an increase in our days sales outstanding and a decrease in our days payable outstanding. the increase in days sales outstanding was due in part to a greater customer response in 2013 to our u.s. holiday display program, which includes extended terms, than in 2012.
investing cash flow - net cash used in investing activities was $131.6 million in 2014, $239.7 million in 2013 and $109.0 million in 2012. the variability between years is principally a result of cash usage related to our acquisitions of businesses and joint venture interests, which amounted to $142.3 million in 2013. we did not make any acquisitions in either 2014 or 2012. see note 2 of the financial statements for further details related to the 2013 acquisition. capital expenditures were $132.7 million in 2014, $99.9 million in 2013 and $110.3 million in 2012. we expect 2015 capital expenditures to range between $130 million and $140 million.
financing cash flow - net cash used in financing activities was $348.9 million in 2014, $245.9 million in 2013 and $324.3 million in 2012. the variability between years is principally a result of share repurchase and dividend activity, described below, and of changes in our net borrowing activity. in 2014 and 2013, our net borrowing activity provided cash of $56.1 million and $66.7 million, respectively. in 2013, we received net cash proceeds of $246.2 million from our issuance of $250 million of 3.50% notes due 2023. we used these net proceeds, together with cash on hand, to repay $250 million of maturing 5.25% notes and $1.4 million of other long-term debt, and we increased our net short-term borrowings by $71.9 million in 2013. in 2012, our net borrowing activity used cash of $80.5 million, due principally to a $76.6 million net reduction in short-term borrowings.
the following table outlines the activity in our share repurchase programs (in millions):
2014                                                        2013            2012

as of november 30, 2014, $116 million remained of a $400 million share repurchase program that was authorized by our board of directors in april 2013. during the fourth quarter of 2013, we completed a previous $400 million share repurchase program that had been authorized in june 2010.

total debt/adjusted ebitda   1.73      1.71      1.66
for 2014, our total debt has increased slightly over the prior year to bring the ratio of total debt to adjusted ebitda to 1.73. the increase was due to higher short-term borrowings to fund strategic purchases of inventory.
the changes in our total debt to adjusted ebitda from 2012 to 2013 are mainly due to changes in our debt in conjunction with acquisition activity and the subsequent reduction of that debt. in 2011, we increased our debt levels to help fund our kohinoor, kamis and kitchen basics® acquisitions. during 2012, the debt associated with these acquisitions was reduced to bring our total debt to adjusted ebitda within our target range of 1.5 to 1.8. for 2013, our ebitda is lower due to the impact of the special charges and loss on voluntary pension settlement. excluding the impact of special charges and loss on voluntary pension settlement, adjusted ebitda for 2013 was $722.2 million and the ratio of total debt to adjusted ebitda was 1.71.
most of our cash is in our foreign subsidiaries. we manage our worldwide cash requirements by considering available funds among the many subsidiaries through which we conduct our business and the cost effectiveness with which those funds can be accessed. the permanent repatriation of cash balances from certain of our subsidiaries could have adverse tax consequences; however, those balances are generally available without legal restrictions to fund ordinary business operations, capital projects and future acquisitions. at november 30, 2014, we temporarily used $201.4 million of cash from our foreign subsidiaries to pay down short-term debt in the u.s. the average short-term borrowings outstanding for the years ended november 30, 2014 and 2013 were $423.7 million and $390.7 million, respectively. the total average debt outstanding for the years ended november 30, 2014 and 2013 was $1,428.7 million and $1,395.7 million, respectively.
in november 2012 and in april and august 2013, we entered into a total of $175 million of forward-starting interest rate swap and treasury rate lock agreements to manage our interest rate risk associated with the anticipated issuance of fixed rate notes in august 2013. we cash settled all of these agreements, which were designated as cash flow hedges, for a gain of $9.0 million simultaneous with the issuance of the notes at an all-in effective fixed rate of 3.30% on the full $250 million of debt. the gain on these agreements is deferred in accumulated other comprehensive income and will be amortized to reduce interest expense over the life of the notes. hedge ineffectiveness of these agreements was not material.
see notes 6 and 7 of the financial statements for further details of these transactions.
credit and capital markets - global credit and capital markets continued to improve in 2014. the following summarizes the more significant impacts of credit and capital markets on our business:
credit facilities - cash flows from operating activities are our primary source of liquidity for funding growth, share repurchases, dividends and capital expenditures. we also rely on our revolving credit facility, or borrowings backed by this facility, to fund seasonal working capital needs and other general corporate requirements.
our major revolving credit facility has a total committed capacity of $600 million, which expires in 2016. we generally use this facility to support our issuance of commercial paper. if the commercial paper market is not available or viable, we could borrow directly under our revolving credit facility. the facility is made available by a syndicate of banks, with various commitments per bank. if any of the banks in this syndicate are unable to perform on their commitments, our liquidity could be impacted, which could reduce our ability to grow through funding of seasonal working capital. in addition to our committed revolving credit facility, we have uncommitted credit facilities for $125.4 million as of november 30, 2014 that will expire in 2015. we engage in regular communication with all of the banks participating in our credit facilities. during these communications, none of the banks have indicated that they may be unable to perform on their commitments. in addition, we periodically review our banking and financing relationships, considering the stability of the institutions and other aspects of the relationships. based on these communications and our monitoring activities, we believe our banks will perform on their commitments. see also note 6 of the financial statements for more details on our financing arrangements. we believe that our internally generated funds and the existing sources of liquidity under our credit facilities are sufficient to fund ongoing operations.
pension assets and other investments - we hold investments in equity and debt securities in both our qualified defined benefit pension plans and through a rabbi trust for our nonqualified defined benefit pension plan. cash payments to pension plans, including unfunded plans, were $16.8 million in 2014, $42.7 million in 2013 and $104.3 million in 2012. our cash contributions in 2012 included a $35 million contribution made late in the fiscal year to bring the pension plan's funding status within our company guidelines. it is expected that the 2015 total pension plan contributions will be approximately $16 million primarily for international plans. future increases or decreases in pension liabilities and required cash contributions are highly dependent on changes in interest rates and the actual return on plan assets. we base our investment of plan assets, in part, on the duration of each plan's liabilities. across all of our qualified defined benefit pension plans, approximately 66% of assets are invested in equities, 25% in fixed income investments and 9% in other investments. assets in the rabbi trust are primarily invested in corporate-owned life insurance, the value of which approximates an investment mix of approximately 50% in equities and 50% in fixed income investments. see also note 10 of the financial statements, which provides details on our pension funding.
customers and counterparties - see the subsequent section of this discussion under market risk sensitivity-credit risk.
acquisitions acquisitions are part of our strategy to increase sales and profits. we have a particular interest in emerging markets.
in 2013, we purchased the assets of wuhan asia-pacific condiments co. ltd. (wapc), a privately held company based in china, for $144.8 million, which included $142.3 million of cash paid, net of closing adjustments, and the assumption of $2.5 million of liabilities. the acquisition was financed with a combination of cash and debt. wapc, included in our consumer business segment, manufactures and markets daqiao and chushile® brand bouillon products, which have a leading position in the central region of china.
see note 2 of the financial statements for further details of this acquisition.
performance graph-shareholder return below is a line graph comparing the yearly change in mccormick's cumulative total shareholder return (stock price appreciation plus reinvestment of dividends) on mccormick's non-voting common stock with (1) the cumulative total return of the standard & poor's 500 stock price index, assuming reinvestment of dividends, and (2) the cumulative total return of the standard & poor's packaged foods & meats index, assuming reinvestment of dividends.
market risk sensitivity we utilize derivative financial instruments to enhance our ability to manage risk, including foreign exchange and interest rate exposures, which exist as part of our ongoing business operations. we do not enter into contracts for trading purposes, nor are we a party to any leveraged derivative instrument. the use of derivative financial instruments is monitored through regular communication with senior management and the utilization of written guidelines. the information presented below should be read in conjunction with notes 6 and 7 of the financial statements.
foreign exchange risk - we are exposed to fluctuations in foreign currency in the following main areas: cash flows related to raw material purchases; the translation of foreign currency earnings to u.s. dollars; the value of foreign currency investments in subsidiaries and unconsolidated affiliates and cash flows related to repatriation of these investments. primary exposures include the u.s. dollar versus the euro, british pound sterling, canadian dollar, polish zloty, australian dollar, mexican peso, chinese renminbi, indian rupee, thai baht and swiss franc, as well as the british pound sterling versus the euro. we routinely enter into foreign currency exchange contracts to manage certain of these foreign currency risks.
during 2014, the foreign currency translation component in other comprehensive income was principally related to the impact of exchange rate fluctuations on our net investments in france, the u.k., poland, canada and australia. we did not hedge our net investments in subsidiaries and unconsolidated affiliates.
the following table summarizes the foreign currency exchange contracts held at november 30, 2014. all contracts are valued in u.s. dollars using year-end 2014 exchange rates and have been designated as hedges of foreign currency transactional exposures, firm commitments or anticipated transactions.

we have a number of smaller contracts with an aggregate notional value of $12.7 million to purchase or sell other currencies, such as the swiss franc and the thai baht, as of november 30, 2014. the aggregate fair value of these contracts was $0.4 million at november 30, 2014.
included in the table above are $127.1 million notional value of contracts that have durations of less than seven days that are used to hedge short-term cash flow funding. remaining contracts have durations of one to 12 months.
at november 30, 2013, we had foreign currency exchange contracts for the euro, british pound sterling, canadian dollar, australian dollar and polish zloty with a notional value of $204.9 million, all of which matured in 2014. the aggregate fair value of these contracts was $(0.5) million at november 30, 2013.
interest rate risk - our policy is to manage interest rate risk by entering into both fixed and variable rate debt arrangements. we also use interest rate swaps to minimize worldwide financing costs and to achieve a desired mix of fixed and variable rate debt. the table that follows provides principal cash flows and related interest rates, excluding the effect of interest rate swaps and the amortization of any discounts or fees, by fiscal year of maturity at november 30, 2014. for foreign currency-denominated debt, the information is presented in u.s. dollar equivalents. variable interest rates are based on the weighted-average rates of the portfolio at the end of the year presented.

the table above displays the debt by the terms of the original debt instrument without consideration of fair value, interest rate swaps and any loan discounts or origination fees. interest rate swaps have the following effects. the fixed interest rate on $100 million of the 5.20% notes due in december 2015 is effectively converted to a variable rate by interest rate swaps through 2015. net interest payments are based on 3 month libor minus 0.05% during this period. we issued $250 million of 5.75% notes due in december 2017 in december 2007. forward treasury lock agreements of $150 million were settled upon the issuance of these notes and effectively fixed the interest rate on the full $250 million of notes at a weighted-average fixed rate of 6.25%. we issued $250 million of 3.90% notes due in 2021 in july 2011. forward treasury lock agreements of $200 million were settled upon the issuance of these notes and effectively fixed the interest rate on the full $250 million of notes at a weighted-average fixed rate of 4.01%. we issued $250 million of 3.50% notes due in 2023 in august 2013. forward treasury lock agreements of $175 million were settled upon the issuance of these notes and effectively fixed the interest rate on the full $250 million of notes at a weighted-average fixed rate of 3.30%.
commodity risk - we purchase certain raw materials which are subject to price volatility caused by weather, market conditions, growing and harvesting conditions, governmental actions and other factors beyond our control. in 2014, our most significant raw materials were pepper, dairy products, rice, capsicums (red peppers and paprika), onion, garlic and wheat flour. while future movements of raw material costs are uncertain, we respond to this volatility in a number of ways, including strategic raw material purchases, purchases of raw material for future delivery and customer price adjustments. we generally have not used derivatives to manage the volatility related to this risk. to the extent that we have used derivatives for this purpose, it has not been material to our business.
credit risk - the customers of our consumer business are predominantly food retailers and food wholesalers. consolidations in these industries have created larger customers. in addition, competition has increased with the growth in alternative channels including mass merchandisers, dollar stores, warehouse clubs and discount chains. this has caused some customers to be less profitable and increased our exposure to credit risk. some of our customers and counterparties are highly leveraged. we continue to closely monitor the credit worthiness of our customers and counterparties. we feel that the allowance for doubtful accounts properly recognizes trade receivables at realizable value. we consider nonperformance credit risk for other financial instruments to be insignificant.

recently issued accounting pronouncements new accounting pronouncements are issued periodically that affect our current and future operations. see note 1 of the financial statements for further details of these impacts.
critical accounting estimates and assumptions in preparing the financial statements, we are required to make estimates and assumptions that have an impact on the assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses reported. these estimates can also affect supplemental information disclosed by us, including information about contingencies, risk and financial condition. we believe, given current facts and circumstances, our estimates and assumptions are reasonable, adhere to u.s. gaap and are consistently applied. inherent in the nature of an estimate or assumption is the fact that actual results may differ from estimates, and estimates may vary as new facts and circumstances arise. in preparing the financial statements, we make routine estimates and judgments in determining the net realizable value of accounts receivable, inventory, fixed assets and prepaid allowances. our most critical accounting estimates and assumptions are in the following areas:
customer contracts in several of our major geographic markets, the consumer business sells our products by entering into annual or multi-year customer contracts. these contracts include provisions for items such as sales discounts, marketing allowances and performance incentives. these items are recognized based on certain estimated criteria such as sales volume of indirect customers, customers reaching anticipated volume thresholds and marketing spending. we routinely review these criteria and make adjustments as facts and circumstances change.
goodwill and intangible asset valuation we review the carrying value of goodwill and non-amortizable intangible assets and conduct tests of impairment on an annual basis as described below. we also test for impairment if events or circumstances indicate it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is below its carrying amount. we test indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired.
determining the fair value of a reporting unit or an indefinite-lived purchased intangible asset is judgmental in nature and involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions. these estimates and assumptions include revenue growth rates and operating margins used to calculate projected future cash flows, risk-adjusted discount rates, assumed royalty rates, future economic and market conditions and determination of appropriate market comparables. we base our fair value estimates on assumptions we believe to be reasonable but that are inherently uncertain. actual future results may differ from those estimates.
goodwill impairment our reporting units are the same as our operating segments. we calculate fair value of a reporting unit by using a discounted cash flow model. our discounted cash flow model calculates fair value by present valuing future expected cash flows of our reporting units using our internal cost of capital as the discount rate. we then compare this fair value to the carrying amount of the reporting unit, including intangible assets and goodwill. if the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds the calculated fair value, then we would determine the implied fair value of the reporting unit's goodwill. an impairment charge would be recognized to the extent the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds the implied fair value. as of november 30, 2014, we had $1,722.2 million of goodwill recorded in our balance sheet ($1,581.1 million in the consumer segment and $141.1 million in the industrial segment). our testing indicates that the current fair values of our reporting units are significantly in excess of carrying values. accordingly we believe that only significant changes in the cash flow assumptions would result in an impairment of goodwill.
indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment our indefinite-lived intangible assets consist of brand names and trademarks. we calculate fair value by using a relief-from-royalty method or discounted cash flow model and then compare that to the carrying amount of the indefinite-lived intangible asset. as of november 30, 2014, we had $270.8 million of brand name assets and trademarks recorded in our balance sheet and none of the balances exceed their calculated fair values. at november 30, 2014, the percentage excess of calculated fair value over book value of our major brand names and trademarks ranges from a low of 8% to a high of over 70%. while we believe that it is reasonably possible that, in the event of an increase in discount rates and/or a decline in forecasted revenues, a non-cash impairment charge may be required, we do not believe that the amount of such an impairment charge would be significant. at november 30, 2014, a hypothetical 15% reduction in the calculated fair values of our major brand names and trademarks would result in an impairment charge for only one of our major brand names and trademarks and that impairment charge would be approximately $1.5 million. we intend to continue to support our brand names and trademarks.
below is a table which outlines the book value of our major brand names and trademarks as of november 30, 2014:
zatarain's                    $106.4
lawry's                         48.0
kamis                           37.5
daqiao/chushile                 28.4
kohinoor                        18.8
simply asia/thai kitchen        18.6
other                           13.1
total                         $270.8
income taxes we estimate income taxes and file tax returns in each of the taxing jurisdictions in which we operate and are required to file a tax return. at the end of each year, an estimate for income taxes is recorded in the financial statements. tax returns are generally filed in the third or fourth quarter of the subsequent year. a reconciliation of the estimate to the final tax return is done at that time which will result in changes to the original estimate. we believe that our tax return positions are appropriately supported, but tax authorities may challenge certain positions. we evaluate our uncertain tax positions in accordance with the u.s. gaap guidance for uncertainty in income taxes. we believe that our reserve for uncertain tax positions, including related interest, is adequate. the amounts ultimately paid upon resolution of audits could be materially different from the amounts previously included in our income tax expense and, therefore, could have a material impact on our tax provision, net income and cash flows. we have recorded valuation allowances to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized. in doing so, we have considered future taxable income and tax planning strategies in assessing the need for a valuation allowance. both future taxable income and tax planning strategies include a number of estimates.
pension and postretirement benefits pension and other postretirement plans' costs require the use of assumptions for discount rates, investment returns, projected salary increases, mortality rates and health care cost trend rates. the actuarial assumptions used in our pension and postretirement benefit reporting are reviewed annually and compared with external benchmarks to ensure that they appropriately account for our future pension and postretirement benefit obligations. while we believe that the assumptions used are appropriate, differences between assumed and actual experience may affect our operating results. a 1% increase or decrease in the actuarial assumption for the discount rate would impact 2015 pension and postretirement benefit expense by approximately $17 million. a 1% increase or decrease in the expected return on plan assets would impact 2015 pension expense by approximately $8 million.
assumptions as to mortality of the participants in our pension plan is a key estimate in measuring the expected payments a participant may receive over their lifetime and therefore the amount of expense we will recognize. during 2014, the society of actuaries released a series of updated mortality tables resulting from recent studies conducted by them measuring mortality rates for various groups of individuals. the updated mortality tables released in 2014 reflect improved trends in longevity and therefore have the effect of increasing the estimate of benefits to be received by plan participants.
in determining the most appropriate mortality assumptions for our u.s. defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans at november 30, 2014, we considered the updated mortality tables issued by the society of actuaries, coupled with other mortality information available from the social security administration and our consulting actuaries that we believe is more closely aligned with our industry and participant mix to develop assumptions that we believe are most representative of the various characteristics of our participant populations.
the use of these updated mortality assumptions increased the benefit obligation for our u.s. defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans by approximately $18 million at november 30, 2014 and will have the effect of increasing related expense by approximately $2 million in 2015. we will continue to evaluate the appropriateness of mortality and other assumptions used in the measurement of our pension obligations. in addition, see the preceding sections of md&a and note 10 of the financial statements for a discussion of these assumptions and the effects on the financial statements.
stock-based compensation we estimate the fair value of our stock-based compensation using fair value pricing models which require the use of significant assumptions for expected volatility of stock, dividend yield and risk-free interest rate. our valuation methodology and significant assumptions used are disclosed in note 11 of the financial statements.

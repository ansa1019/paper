item 1a.   risk factors

as referenced, this annual report on form 10-k includes certain forward-looking statements regarding various matters. the ultimate correctness of those forward-looking statements is dependent upon a number of known and unknown risks and events, and is subject to various uncertainties and other factors that may cause our actual results, performance or achievements to be different from those expressed or implied by those statements. undue reliance should not be placed on those forward-looking statements. the following important factors, among others, as well as those factors set forth in our other securities and exchange commission (sec) filings from time to time, could affect future results and events, causing results and events to differ materially from those expressed or implied in our forward-looking statements.
our operating results may fluctuate due to a number of factors, many of which are beyond our control.
our annual and quarterly operating results are affected by a number of factors, including:
   adverse changes in current macro-economic conditions, both in the u.s. and internationally;

   how well we execute on our strategy and operating plans, and the impact of changes in our business model;

   the level and timing of customer orders;

11
   the level of capacity utilization of our manufacturing facilities and associated fixed costs, including instances where we maintain manufacturing facilities and associated fixed costs in anticipation of future customer orders and the actual orders never occur, are at lower than anticipated levels and/or occur later than expected;

   the composition of the costs of revenue between materials, labor and manufacturing overhead;

   price competition;

   changes in demand for our products or services, as well as the volatility of these changes;

   changes in demand in our customers end markets, as well as the volatility of these changes;

   our exposure to financially troubled customers;

   any potential future termination, or substantial winding down, of significant customer relationships;

   our level of experience in manufacturing particular products;

   the degree of automation used in our assembly process;

   the efficiencies achieved in managing inventories and property, plant and equipment;

   significant costs incurred in acquisitions and other transactions that are immediately expensed in the quarter in which they occur;

   fluctuations in materials costs and availability of materials;

   adverse changes in political conditions, both in the u.s. and internationally, including among other things, adverse changes in tax laws and rates (and government interpretations thereof), adverse changes in trade policies and adverse changes in fiscal and monetary policies;

   seasonality in customers product demand;

   the timing of expenditures in anticipation of increased sales, customer product delivery requirements and shortages of components or labor

   changes in stock-based compensation expense due to changes in the expected vesting of performance-based equity awards comprising a portion of such stock-based compensation expense; and

   failure to comply with foreign laws, which could result in increased costs and/or taxes.

the volume and timing of orders placed by our customers vary due to variation in demand for our customers products; our customers attempts to manage their inventory; electronic design changes; changes in our customers manufacturing strategies; and acquisitions of or consolidations among our customers. in addition, our sales associated with consumer related products are subject to seasonal influences. we may realize greater revenue during our first fiscal quarter due to higher demand for consumer related products during the holiday selling season. in the past, changes in customer orders that reduce net revenue have had a significant effect on our results of operations as a result of our overhead remaining relatively fixed while our net revenue decreased. any one or a combination of these factors could adversely affect our annual and quarterly results of operations in the future. see managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  results of operations.
because we depend on a limited number of customers, a reduction in sales to any one of our customers could cause a significant decline in our revenue.
during the fiscal year ended august 31, 2014, our five largest customers accounted for approximately 45% of our net revenue and 71 customers accounted for approximately 90% of our net revenue. in some instances, particular manufacturing services we provide for such customers represent a significant portion of the overall revenue we receive from that customer. we currently depend, and expect to continue to depend, upon a relatively small number of customers for a significant percentage of our net revenue and upon their growth, viability and financial stability. in addition, given the relatively large size of certain of our customers and the business we currently do with those customers and may do in the future for those customers, this dependence is very likely to increase in the future. if any of those customers experience a decline in the demand (anticipated or unanticipated) for one or more of their products due to economic or other forces, they may reduce their purchases from us or terminate their relationship with us. our customers industries have experienced rapid technological change, shortening of product life cycles, consolidation, and pricing and margin pressures. consolidation among our customers may further reduce the number of customers that generate a significant percentage of our net revenue and exposes us to increased risks relating to dependence on a small number of customers. a significant reduction in sales to any of our customers or a customer exerting significant pricing and margin pressures on us, which have occurred in certain instances in the past and which are exacerbated for larger customers, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.
12
in the past, we have incurred certain inventory write-offs and equipment write-offs and some of our customers have terminated their manufacturing arrangements with us or have significantly reduced or delayed the volume of design, production or product management services ordered from us, including moving a portion of their manufacturing from us in order to more fully utilize their excess internal manufacturing capacity, which could again happen in the future. in other cases, we have terminated customer manufacturing arrangements. a terminated customer manufacturing arrangement (whether terminated by the customer or by us) can result in one or more of the following adverse effects: a decline in revenue; less revenue to absorb fixed costs and overhead; charges for bad debts, inventory write-offs, equipment write-offs and lease write-offs; other potential disengagement costs; a decrease in inventory turns; an increase in days in inventory and an increase in days in accounts receivable. we often, however, have an indemnification remedy which can mitigate some of these adverse effects if the customer has sufficient funds to satisfy any such indemnification liability. some of the risks described above may not only exist with respect to a particular customer, but also with respect to manufacturing services with respect to a particular customer product for larger customers where a significant portion of the overall revenue we receive from such customer relates to such services for such product. accordingly, if any of our customers products experience a decline in demand (anticipated or unanticipated), the applicable customer may reduce their purchases from us or terminate their relationship with us. this could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.
during past economic cycles, our revenue declined as consumers and businesses postponed spending in response to tighter credit, negative financial news, declines in income or asset values or general uncertainty about global economic conditions. these economic conditions had a negative impact on our results of operations and similar conditions may exist in the future. we cannot assure you that present or future customers will not terminate their design, production and product management services arrangements with us or significantly change, reduce or delay the amount of services ordered from us. if they do, it could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. in addition, if one or more of our customers were to become insolvent or otherwise were unable to pay for the services provided by us on a timely basis, or at all, our operating results and financial condition could be adversely affected. also, our operating results and financial condition could be adversely affected by the potential recovery by the bankruptcy estate of amounts previously paid to us by a customer that later became insolvent that are deemed a preference under bankruptcy law. such adverse effects could include one or more of the following: a decline in revenue, less revenue to absorb fixed costs and overhead, a charge for bad debts, a charge for inventory write-offs, a charge for equipment write-offs, a charge for lease write-offs, a decrease in inventory turns, an increase in days in inventory and an increase in days in accounts receivable.
certain of the industries to which we provide services have experienced significant financial difficulty during the recent recession, with some of the participants filing for bankruptcy. such significant financial difficulty has negatively affected our business and, if further experienced by one or more of our customers, may further negatively affect our business due to the decreased demand of these financially distressed customers, the potential inability of these companies to make full payment on amounts owed to us, or both. see managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and risk factors  we face certain risks in collecting our trade accounts receivable.
13
our customers face numerous competitive challenges, such as decreasing demand from their customers, rapid technological change and short life cycles for their products, which may materially adversely affect their business, and also ours.
factors affecting the industries that utilize our services in general, and our customers specifically, could seriously harm our customers and, as a result, us. these factors include:
   recessionary periods in our customers markets, as well as in the global economy in general;

   the inability of our customers to adapt to rapidly changing technology and evolving industry standards, which may contribute to short product life cycles or shifts in our customers strategies;

   the inability of our customers to develop and market their products, some of which are new and untested;

   the potential that our customers products become commoditized or obsolete;

   the failure of our customers products to gain widespread commercial acceptance;

   increased competition among our customers and their respective competitors which may result in a loss of business or a reduction in pricing power for our customers; and

   new product offerings by our customers competitors may prove to be more successful than our customers product offerings.

also, our high velocity systems (hvs) segment, particularly the mobility business and portions of our diversified manufacturing services (dms) segment, are highly dependent on the consumer products industry. this business is very competitive (both for us and our customers) and often subject to shorter product lifecycles, shifting end-user preferences, higher revenue volatility and programs that may be shifted among competitors in our industry. as a result, our exposure to this end market could adversely affect our results of operations.
at times our customers have been, and may be in the future, unsuccessful in addressing these competitive challenges, or any others that they may face, and their business has been, and may be in the future, materially adversely affected. as a result, the demand for our services has at times declined and may decline in the future. even if our customers are successful in responding to these challenges, their responses may have consequences which affect our business relationships with our customers (and possibly our results of operations) by altering our production cycles and inventory management.
the success of our business is dependent on both our ability to independently keep pace with technological changes and competitive conditions in our industry, and also our ability to effectively adapt our services in response to our customers keeping pace with technological changes and competitive conditions in their respective industries.
if we are unable to offer technologically advanced, cost effective, quick response manufacturing services that are differentiated from our competition, demand for our services will decline. in addition, if we are unable to offer services in response to our customers changing requirements, then demand for our services will also decline. a substantial portion of our net revenue is derived from our offering of complete service solutions for our customers. for example, if we fail to maintain high-quality design and engineering services, our net revenue may significantly decline.
consolidation in industries that utilize our services may adversely affect our business.
consolidation in industries that utilize our services may further increase as companies combine to achieve further economies of scale and other synergies, which could result in an increase in excess manufacturing capacity as companies seek to divest manufacturing operations or eliminate duplicative product lines. excess manufacturing capacity may increase pricing and competitive pressures for our industry as a whole and for us in particular. consolidation could also result in an increasing number of very large companies offering products in multiple industries. the significant purchasing power and market power of these large companies could increase pricing and competitive pressures for us. if one of our customers is acquired by another company that does not rely on us to provide services and has its own production facilities or relies on another provider of similar services, we may lose that customers business. such consolidation among our customers may further reduce the number of customers that generate a significant percentage of our net revenue and exposes us to increased risks relating to dependence on a small number of customers. any of the foregoing results of industry consolidation could adversely affect our business.
most of our customers do not commit to long-term production schedules, which makes it difficult for us to schedule production and capital expenditures, and to maximize the efficiency of our manufacturing capacity.
the volume and timing of sales to our customers may vary due to:
   variation in demand for our customers products;

   our customers attempts to manage their inventory;

   electronic design changes;

   changes in our customers manufacturing strategy; and

   acquisitions of or consolidations among customers.

14
due in part to these factors, most of our customers do not commit to firm production schedules for more than one quarter. our inability to forecast the level of customer orders for a customers products with certainty makes it difficult to schedule production and maximize utilization of manufacturing capacity. in the past, we have been required to increase staffing and other expenses in order to meet the anticipated demand of our customers or a customers specific product. anticipated orders from many of our customers have, in the past, failed to materialize, delivery schedules have been deferred or production has unexpectedly decreased, slowed down or stopped as a result of changes in our customers business needs, thereby adversely affecting our results of operations. on other occasions, our customers have required rapid increases in production, which have placed an excessive burden on our resources. such customer order fluctuations and deferrals have had a material adverse effect on us in the past and we may experience such effects in the future. see managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations. in addition to our difficulty in forecasting customer orders, we sometimes experience difficulty forecasting the timing of our receipt of revenue and earnings following commencement of providing manufacturing services for an additional product for new or existing customers. the necessary process to begin this commencement of manufacturing can take from several months to more than a year before production begins. delays in the completion of this process can delay the timing of our sales and related earnings. in addition, because we make capital expenditures during this ramping process and do not typically recognize revenue until after we produce and ship the customers products, any delays or unanticipated costs in the ramping process may have a significant adverse effect on our cash flows and our results of operations, particularly when our contractual or legal remedies are insufficient to avoid or mitigate such unanticipated costs which can be exacerbated with large customers. these difficulties can be exacerbated when providing services for a specific customer product from which we generate a significant amount of our revenue.
our customers may cancel their orders, change production quantities, delay production or change their sourcing strategy.
our industry must provide increasingly rapid product turnaround for its customers. we generally do not obtain firm, long-term purchase commitments from our customers for any of their products and we continue to experience reduced lead-times in customer orders. customers have previously canceled their orders, changed production quantities, delayed production and changed their sourcing strategy for a number of reasons with respect to one or more of their products, and may do one or more of these in the future. such changes, delays and cancellations have led to, and may lead in the future to a decline in our production and our possession of excess or obsolete inventory that we may not be able to sell to customers or third parties. this has resulted in, and could result in future additional, write downs of inventories that have become obsolete or exceed anticipated demand or net realizable value. these risks, although we attempt to negotiate contractual language with our customers to avoid or mitigate them, may be exacerbated when the inventory is for a specific product that represents a significant amount of our revenue.
the success of one or more of our customers products in the market affects our business. cancellations, reductions, delays or changes in sourcing strategy with respect to one or more significant products by a significant customer or by a group of customers have negatively impacted, and could further negatively impact in the future, our operating results by reducing the number of products that we sell, delaying the payment to us for inventory that we purchased and reducing the use of our manufacturing facilities which have associated fixed costs not dependent on our level of revenue.
in addition, we make significant decisions, including determining the levels of business that we will seek and accept, production schedules, component procurement commitments, personnel needs and other resource requirements, based on our estimate of customer requirements for one or more of their products. the following factors, among others, reduce our ability to accurately estimate future customer requirements, forecast operating results and make production planning decisions: the short-term nature of our customers commitments for us to build their products; their uncertainty about, among other things, future economic conditions and other events, such as natural disasters; and the possibility of rapid changes in demand for one or more of their products.
on occasion, customers may require rapid increases in production for one or more of their products, which can stress our resources and reduce operating margins. in addition, because many of our costs and operating expenses are relatively fixed, a reduction in customer demand, particularly a reduction in demand for any particular customer product that represents a significant amount of our revenue, can harm our gross profits and operating results.
we depend on a limited number of suppliers for components that are critical to our manufacturing processes. a shortage of these components or an increase in their price could interrupt our operations and reduce our profits, increase our inventory carrying costs, increase our risk of exposure to inventory obsolescence and cause us to purchase components of a lesser quality.
most of our significant long-term customer contracts permit quarterly or other periodic adjustments to pricing based on decreases and increases in component prices and other factors; however, we typically bear the risk of component price increases that occur between any such re-pricings or, if such re-pricing is not permitted, during the balance of the term of the particular customer contract. accordingly, certain component price increases could adversely affect our gross profit margins.
15
almost all of the products we manufacture require one or more components that are only available from a single source. some of these components are allocated from time to time in response to supply shortages. in some cases, supply shortages will substantially curtail production of all assemblies using a particular component. a supply shortage can also increase our cost of goods sold, as a result of our having to pay higher prices for components in limited supply, and cause us to have to redesign or reconfigure products to accommodate a substitute component. at various times industry-wide shortages of electronic components have occurred, particularly of semiconductor, relay and capacitor products. we believe these past shortages were due to increased economic activity following recessionary conditions. in addition, natural disasters and global events could cause material shortages. in the past, such circumstances have produced insignificant levels of short-term interruption of our operations, but could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations in the future. portions of the dodd-frank act require some companies, including ours, to conduct due diligence, make disclosures and file reports regarding the source of certain minerals that may be contained in their products that are originating from the democratic republic of congo (drc) and adjoining countries. these requirements may decrease the supply of such minerals, increase their cost and/or disrupt our supply chain if we decide, or are instructed by our customers, to obtain components from different suppliers.
our production of a customers product could be negatively impacted by any quality or reliability issues with any of our component suppliers. the financial condition of our suppliers could affect their ability to supply us with components and their ability to satisfy any warranty obligations they may have, which could have a material adverse effect on our operations.
if a component shortage is threatened or we anticipate one, we may purchase such component early to avoid a delay or interruption in our operations. a possible result of such an early purchase is that we may incur additional inventory carrying costs, for which we may not be compensated, and have a heightened risk of exposure to inventory obsolescence, the cost of which may not be recoverable from our customers. such costs would adversely affect our gross profit and net income. a component shortage may also require us to look to second tier vendors or to procure components through brokers with whom we are not familiar. these components may be of lesser quality than those we have historically purchased and could cause us to incur costs to bring such components up to our typical quality levels or to replace defective ones. see managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and business  components procurement.
introducing new business models or programs requiring implementation of new competencies, such as new process technologies and our development of new products or services for customers, could affect our operations and financial results.
the introduction of new business models or programs requiring implementation or development of new competencies, such as new process technology within our operations and our independent development of new products or services for customers, presents challenges in addition to opportunities. the success of new business models or programs depends on a number of factors including, but not limited to, timely and successful product development (by us and/or our customer), market acceptance, our ability to manage the risks associated with new product production ramp-up, the effective management of purchase commitments and inventory levels in line with anticipated product demand, our development or acquisition of appropriate intellectual property, the availability of supplies in adequate quantities and at appropriate costs to meet anticipated demand, and the risk that new products may have quality or other defects in the early stages of introduction. accordingly, we cannot determine in advance the ultimate result of new business models or programs.
as a result, we must make long-term investments, develop or obtain appropriate intellectual property and commit significant resources before knowing whether our assumptions will accurately reflect customer demand for our products and services. after the development of a new business model or program, we must be able to manufacture appropriate volumes quickly and at low costs. to accomplish this, we endeavor to accurately forecast volumes, mixes of products and configurations that meet customer requirements; however, we may not succeed at doing so. any delay in development or production could harm our competitive position. we may not meet our customers expectations or otherwise execute properly, timely, or in a cost-efficient manner, which could damage our customer relationships and result in remedial costs or the loss of our invested capital and anticipated revenues and profits. in addition, the early stages of these types of new business models or programs can be less efficient, and less profitable, than those of mature programs and/or programs developed in collaboration with customers.
while we attempt to negotiate contractual terms to avoid or mitigate some of these potential costs or losses, we are not always successful. also, in certain instances, a customer contract does not exist or its language does not cover a particular situation, so we have to rely on non-contractual legal remedies. in these situations, we must negotiate a manner to address the situation as costs or losses occur with the potential to lose customers and/or revenue. in addition, as we have experienced on occasion, there are risks of market acceptance and product performance that could result in less demand than anticipated and our having excess capacity, which could lead to significant unrecovered costs for us. the failure to ensure that our agreed terms appropriately reflect the anticipated costs, risks, and rewards of such an opportunity could adversely affect our profitability.
16
customer relationships with emerging companies may present more risks than with established companies.
customer relationships with emerging companies, an area of increasing activity for us, present special risks because such companies do not have an extensive product history. as a result, there is less demonstration of market acceptance of their products making it harder for us to anticipate needs and requirements than with established customers. in addition, due to the current economic environment, additional funding for such companies may be more difficult to obtain and these customer relationships may not continue or materialize to the extent we planned or we previously experienced. as a result of many start-up customers lack of prior operations and unproven product markets, our credit risk, especially in trade accounts receivable and inventories, and the risk that these customers will be unable to fulfill their potentially significant obligation to indemnify us from various liabilities are potentially increased. we sometimes offer these customers extended payment terms, loans, services and other support that may increase our financial exposure. these risks are also heightened by the tightening of financing for start-up customers. although we perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers and adjust our allowance for doubtful accounts receivable for all customers, including start-up customers, based on the information available, these allowances may not be adequate. this risk may exist for any new emerging company customers in the future. also, as a result of, among other things, these emerging companies tending to be smaller and less financially secure, we have faced and may face in the future increased litigation risk from these companies.
in addition, we have been investing directly in certain of these emerging company customers which, along with extended payment terms, loans, services and other support we may provide, may exacerbate the risks described in this risk factor. risks related to these investments may also include one or more of the following: substantial selling, general and administrative expenses; substantial capital expenses or investments; losses or impairments that may be reflected in our net income item of our statement of operations; and an inability to recover a partial or full amount of any investments we make in these smaller, emerging companies.
we compete with numerous other electronic manufacturing services and design providers and others, including our current and potential customers who may decide to manufacture some or all of their products internally.
our business is highly competitive. we compete against numerous domestic and foreign electronic manufacturing services and design providers, including benchmark electronics, inc., celestica, inc., flextronics international ltd., hon-hai precision industry co., ltd., plexus corp. and sanmina-sci corporation. in addition, past consolidation in our industry has resulted in larger and more geographically diverse competitors who have significant combined resources with which to compete against us. also, we may in the future encounter competition from other large electronic manufacturers, and manufacturers that are focused solely on design and manufacturing services, that are selling, or may begin to sell electronic manufacturing services. most of our competitors have international operations and significant financial resources and some have substantially greater manufacturing, research and development (r&d) and marketing resources than we have. these competitors may:
   respond more quickly to new or emerging technologies;

   have greater name recognition, critical mass and geographic market presence;

   be better able to take advantage of acquisition opportunities;

   adapt more quickly to changes in customer requirements;

   devote greater resources to the development, promotion and sale of their services;

   be better positioned to compete on price for their services, as a result of any combination of lower labor costs, lower components costs, lower facilities costs, lower operating costs or lower taxes; and

   have excess capacity, and be better able to utilize such excess capacity, which may reduce the cost of their product or service.

we also face competition from the manufacturing operations of our current and potential customers, who are continually evaluating the merits of manufacturing products internally against the advantages of outsourcing. in the past, some of our customers moved a portion of their manufacturing from us in order to more fully utilize their excess internal manufacturing capacity.
we may be operating at a cost disadvantage compared to competitors who (a) have greater direct buying power from component suppliers, distributors and raw material suppliers, (b) have lower cost structures as a result of their geographic location or the services they provide, (c) are willing to make sales or provide services at lower margins than we do (including relationships where our competitors are willing to accept a lower margin from certain of their customers for whom they perform other higher margin business) or (d) have increased their vertical capabilities, thereby potentially providing them greater cost savings. as a result, competitors may procure a competitive advantage and obtain business from our customers. our manufacturing processes are generally not subject to significant proprietary protection. in addition, companies with greater resources or a greater market presence may enter our market or increase their competition with us. we also expect our competitors to continue to improve the performance of their current products or
17
services, to reduce the sales prices of their current products or services and to introduce new products or services that may offer greater performance and improved pricing. any of these developments could cause a decline in our sales, loss of market acceptance of our products or services, compression of our profits or loss of our market share.
the economies of the u.s., europe and certain countries in asia are, or have been, in a recession.
there was an erosion of global consumer confidence amidst concerns over declining asset values, inflation, volatility in energy costs, geopolitical issues, the availability and cost of credit, high unemployment, and the stability and solvency of financial institutions, financial markets, businesses, and sovereign nations. these concerns slowed global economic growth and resulted in recessions in many countries, including in the u.s., europe and certain countries in asia. even though we have seen signs of an overall economic recovery in the u.s. and asia, such recovery may be weak and/or short-lived and recessionary conditions may return, which could significantly affect the u.s. and international debt and capital markets, as well as the demand for the products of certain of our customers.
if any of these potential negative economic conditions occur, a number of negative effects on our business could result, including customers or potential customers reducing or delaying orders, increased pricing pressures, the insolvency of key suppliers, which could result in production delays, the inability of customers to obtain credit, and the insolvency of one or more customers. thus, these economic conditions (1) could negatively impact our ability to (a) forecast customer demand, (b) effectively manage inventory levels, including our ability to limit our possession of excess or obsolete inventory and (c) collect receivables in a timely manner, if at all; (2) could increase our need for cash; and (3) have negatively impacted, and could negatively impact in the future, our net revenue and profitability and the value of certain of our properties and other assets. depending on the length of time that these conditions exist, they may cause future additional negative effects, including some of those listed above.
the financial markets have experienced significant turmoil, which may adversely affect financial arrangements we may need to enter into, refinance or repay.
credit market turmoil effects could negatively impact the counterparties to our forward foreign exchange contracts and trade accounts receivable securitization and sale programs; our lenders under jabil circuit, inc.s (the companys) five year unsecured credit facility amended as of july 25, 2014 (the amended and restated credit facility); and our lenders under various foreign subsidiary credit facilities. these potential negative impacts could potentially limit our ability to borrow under these financing agreements, contracts, facilities and programs. in addition, if we attempt to obtain future additional financing, such as renewing or refinancing our $200.0 million north american asset-backed securitization program expiring on october 20, 2017, our $75.0 million foreign asset-backed securitization program expiring on may 15, 2015, our $350.0 million uncommitted trade accounts receivable sale program expiring on november 28, 2014, our $150.0 million uncommitted trade accounts receivable sale program subject to expiration on august 31, 2015, or our $100.0 million uncommitted trade accounts receivable program expiring on november 1, 2014 (though either party can elect to cancel the agreement by giving prior written notification to the other party of no less than 15 days and the agreement may be automatically extended each year through november 1, 2018), the effects of the credit market turmoil could negatively impact our ability to obtain such financing. finally, the credit market turmoil has negatively impacted certain of our customers and certain of their customers. these impacts could have several consequences which could have a negative effect on our results of operations, including one or more of the following: a negative impact on our liquidity, including potentially insufficient cash flows to support our operations; a decrease in demand for our services; a decrease in demand for our customers products; and bad debt charges or inventory write-offs.
our business could be adversely affected by any delays, or increased costs, resulting from issues that our common carriers are dealing with in transporting our materials, our products, or both.
we rely on a variety of common carriers to transport our materials from our suppliers to us, and to transport our products from us to our customers. problems suffered by any of these common carriers, whether due to a natural disaster, labor problem, increased energy prices, criminal activity or some other issue, could result in shipping delays, increased costs, or other supply chain disruptions, and could therefore have a material adverse effect on our operations.
we derive a majority of our revenue from our international operations, which may be subject to a number of risks and often require more management time and expense to achieve profitability than our domestic operations.
we derived 84.5% of net revenue from international operations during the fiscal year ended august 31, 2014 compared to 86.8% during the fiscal year ended august 31, 2013, respectively. at august 31, 2014, we operate outside the u.s. in vienna, austria; hasselt, belgium; belo horizonte and manaus, brazil; beijing, chengdu, hong kong, huangpu, kunshan, nanjing, shanghai, shenzhen, suzhou, tianjin, wuxi and yantai, china; brest and chartres, france; jena and knittlingen, germany; nagyigmand, szombathely and tiszaujvaros, hungary; mumbai and ranjangaon, india; bray and waterford, ireland; tel aviv, israel; marcianise, italy; gotemba and hachioji, japan; penang, malaysia; chihuahua, guadalajara and tijuana, mexico; venray, the netherlands;
18
kwidzyn, poland; moscow and tver, russia; ayr and livingston, scotland; tampines, singapore; seoul, south korea; changhua, hsinchu, taichung and taipei, taiwan; uzhgorod, ukraine; and ho chi minh city, vietnam. we continually consider additional opportunities to make foreign acquisitions and construct and open new foreign facilities. our international operations are, have been and may be subject to a number of risks, including:
   difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations;

   less flexible employee relationships that can be difficult and expensive to terminate;

   rising labor costs (including the introduction or expansion of certain social programs), in particular within the lower-cost regions in which we operate, due to, among other things, demographic changes and economic development in those regions, which we may be unable to recover in our pricing to our customers;

   labor unrest and dissatisfaction, including potential labor strikes;

                    increased scrutiny by the media and other third parties of labor practices within our industry (including but not limited to working conditions, compliance with employment and labor laws and compensation) which may result in allegations of violations, more stringent and burdensome labor laws and regulations, increased strictness and inconsistency in the enforcement and interpretation of such laws and regulations, higher labor costs, and/or loss of revenues if our customers become dissatisfied with our labor practices and diminish or terminate their relationship with us;

            burdens of complying with a wide variety of foreign laws, including those relating to export and import duties, domestic and foreign import and export controls (including the international traffic in arms regulations and the export administration regulations (ear), regulation by the united states department of commerces bureau of industry and security under the ear), trade barriers (including quotas), environmental policies and privacy issues, and local statutory corporate governance related to conducting business in foreign jurisdictions;

   less favorable, or relatively undefined, intellectual property laws;

   unexpected changes in regulatory requirements and laws or government or judicial interpretations of such regulatory requirements and laws and adverse trade policies, and adverse changes to any of the policies of either the u.s. or any of the foreign jurisdictions in which we operate;

   adverse changes in tax rates and the manner in which the u.s. and other countries tax multinational companies or interpret their tax laws (see risk factors  we are subject to the risk of increased taxes);

   inability to utilize net operating losses incurred by our foreign operations against future income in the same jurisdiction;

   political and economic instability and unsafe working conditions (including acts of terrorism, widespread criminal activities and outbreaks of war);

   risk of governmental expropriation of our property;

   inadequate infrastructure for our operations (e.g., lack of adequate power, water, transportation and raw materials);

   legal or political constraints on our ability to maintain or increase prices;

   governmental restrictions on the transfer of funds to us from our operations outside the u.s.;

   health concerns and related government actions;

   coordinating our communications and logistics across geographic distances and multiple time zones;

   longer customer payment cycles and difficulty collecting trade accounts receivable;

   fluctuations in currency exchange rates, which could affect local payroll and other expenses (see risk factors  we are subject to risks of currency fluctuations and related hedging operations); and

   economies that are emerging or developing or that may be subject to greater currency volatility, negative growth, high inflation, limited availability of foreign exchange and other risks (see risk factors 
the economies of the u.s., europe and certain countries in asia are, or have been, in a recession).

these factors may harm our results of operations. also, any measures that we may implement to reduce risks of our international operations may not be effective and may require significant management time and effort. in our experience, entry into new international markets requires considerable management time as well as start-up expenses for market development, hiring and establishing facilities before any significant revenue is generated. as a result, initial operations in a new market may operate at low margins or may be unprofitable.
another significant legal risk resulting from our international operations is the risk of non-compliance with the u.s. foreign corrupt practices act (fcpa) and the united kingdom bribery act (act). in many foreign countries, particularly in those with developing economies, it may be a local custom that businesses operating in such countries engage in business practices that are
19
prohibited by the fcpa, the act or other u.s. or foreign laws and regulations. although we have implemented policies and procedures designed to cause compliance with the fcpa, the act and similar laws, there can be no assurance that all of our employees and agents, as well as those companies to which we outsource certain of our business operations, will not take actions in violation of our policies. any such violation, even if prohibited by our policies, could have a material adverse effect on our operations.
if we do not manage our growth effectively, our profitability could decline.
areas of our business at times experience periods of rapid growth which can place considerable additional demands upon our management team and our operational, financial and management information systems. our ability to manage growth effectively requires us to continue to implement and improve these systems; avoid cost overruns; maintain customer, supplier and other favorable business relationships during possible transition periods; acquire or construct additional facilities; occasionally transfer operations to different facilities; acquire equipment in anticipation of demand; continue to develop the management skills of our managers and supervisors; adapt relatively quickly to new markets or technologies and continue to train, motivate and manage our employees. our failure to effectively manage growth could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. see managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations.
we have on occasion not achieved, and may not in the future achieve, expected profitability from our acquisitions; and some divestitures may adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.
we cannot assure you that we will be able to successfully integrate the operations and management of our recent acquisitions. similarly, we cannot assure you that we will be able to (1) identify future strategic acquisitions and adequately conduct due diligence, (2) consummate these potential acquisitions on favorable terms, if at all, or (3) if consummated, successfully integrate the operations and management of future acquisitions. acquisitions involve significant risks, which could have a material adverse effect on us including:
                        financial risks, such as (1) the payment of a purchase price that exceeds the future value that we may realize from the acquired operations and businesses; (2) an increase in our expenses and working capital requirements, which could reduce our return on invested capital; (3) potential known and unknown liabilities of the acquired businesses, as well as contractually-based time and monetary limitations on a sellers obligation to indemnify us for such liabilities; (4) costs associated with integrating acquired operations and businesses; (5) the dilutive effect of the issuance of any additional equity securities we issue as consideration for, or to finance, the acquisition;
(6) the incurrence of additional debt; (7) the financial impact of incorrectly valuing goodwill and other intangible assets involved in any acquisitions, potential future impairment write-downs of goodwill and indefinite life intangibles and the amortization of other intangible assets; (8) possible adverse tax and accounting effects; and (9) the risk that we spend substantial amounts purchasing these manufacturing facilities and assume significant contractual and other obligations with no guaranteed levels of revenue or that we may have to close or sell acquired facilities at our cost, which may include substantial employee severance costs and asset write-offs, which have resulted, and may result, in our incurring significant losses.

                   operating risks, such as (1) the diversion of managements attention to the assimilation of the acquired businesses; (2) the risk that the acquired businesses will fail to maintain the quality of services that we have historically provided; (3) the need to implement financial and other systems and add management resources; (4) the need to maintain customer, supplier or other favorable business relationships of acquired operations and restructure or terminate unfavorable relationships; (5) the potential for deficiencies in internal controls of the acquired operations; (6) the inability to attract and retain the employees necessary to support the acquired businesses;
(7) potential inexperience in a line of business that is either new to us or that has become materially more significant to us as a result of the transaction; (8) unforeseen difficulties (including any unanticipated liabilities) in the acquired operations; and (9) the impact on us of any unionized work force we may acquire or any labor disruptions that might occur.

in addition, divestitures involve significant risks (some of which are present in our recent sale of our aftermarket services (ams) business, which could have a material adverse effect on us including: we may not be able to identify acceptable buyers; we may divest a business at a price or on terms that are different than anticipated; we may lose key employees; divestitures could adversely affect our profitability and, under certain circumstances, require us to record impairment charges or a loss as a result of the transaction; completing divestitures requires expenses and management effort; we may become subject to indemnity obligations and/or remain liable or contingently liable for obligations related to the divested business or operations; a delay or failure to close for any reason, including a failure to obtain the necessary third party consents and regulatory approvals; the retention of certain continuing liabilities under contracts; financing for the transaction not occurring as anticipated; equity consideration proving to have a value substantially less than the stated or expected value or not being transferable to a third party on attractive terms; covenants not to compete (such as we recently entered into in connection with our recent sale of our ams business) could impair our ability to attract and retain customers; business arrangements with the buyers could negatively impact our business with common customers; and we may face difficulties in the separation of the divested operations, services, products and personnel.
20
most of our acquisitions involve operations outside of the u.s. which are subject to various risks including those described in risk factors  we derive a majority of our revenue from our international operations, which may be subject to a number of risks and often require more management time and expense to achieve profitability than our domestic operations.
we have acquired and may continue to pursue the acquisition of manufacturing and supply chain management operations from our customers (or potential customers). in these acquisitions, the divesting company will typically enter into a supply arrangement with the acquirer. therefore, our competitors often also pursue these acquisitions. in addition, certain divesting companies may choose not to offer to sell their operations to us because of our current supply arrangements with other companies or may require terms and conditions that may impact our profitability. if we are unable to attract and consummate some of these acquisition opportunities at favorable terms, our growth and profitability could be adversely impacted.
in addition to those risks listed above, arrangements entered into with these divesting companies typically involve certain other risks, including the following:
   the integration into our business of the acquired assets and facilities may be time-consuming and costly;

   we, rather than the divesting company, may bear the risk of excess capacity;

   we may not achieve anticipated cost reductions and efficiencies;

   we may be unable to meet the expectations of the divesting company as to volume, product quality, timeliness, pricing requirements and cost reductions; and

   if demand for the divesting companys products declines, it may reduce its volume of purchases and we may not be able to sufficiently reduce the expenses of operating the facility we acquired from it or use such facility to provide services to other customers.

in addition, when acquiring manufacturing operations, we may receive limited commitments to firm production schedules. accordingly, in these circumstances, we may spend substantial amounts purchasing these manufacturing facilities and assume significant contractual and other obligations with no or insufficient guaranteed levels of revenue. we may also not achieve expected profitability from these arrangements. as a result of these and other risks, these outsourcing opportunities may not be profitable.
we have expanded the primary scope of our acquisitions strategy beyond focusing on acquisition opportunities presented by companies divesting internal manufacturing operations. the more recent trend focuses on pursuing opportunities to acquire smaller electronic manufacturing services competitors who are focused on our key growth areas which include specialized manufacturing, design operations and other acquisition opportunities complementary to our services offerings. the primary goals of our acquisition strategy are to complement our current capabilities, diversify our business into new industry sectors and with new customers and expand the scope of the services we can offer to our customers. the amount and scope of the risks associated with acquisitions of this type extend beyond those that we have traditionally faced in making acquisitions. these extended risks include greater uncertainties in the financial benefits and potential liabilities associated with this expanded base of acquisitions.
we face risks arising from the restructuring of our operations.
over the past few years, we have undertaken initiatives to restructure our business operations with the intention of improving utilization and realizing cost savings in the future. these initiatives have included changing the number and location of our production facilities, largely to align our capacity and infrastructure with current and anticipated customer demand. this alignment includes transferring programs from higher cost geographies to lower cost geographies. the process of restructuring entails, among other activities, moving production between facilities, closing facilities, reducing the level of staff, realigning our business processes and reorganizing our management.
we continuously evaluate our operations and cost structure relative to general economic conditions, market and customer demands, tax rates, cost competitiveness and our geographic footprint as it relates to our customers production requirements. as a result of this ongoing evaluation, we have initiated restructuring plans approved by our board of directors in fiscal year 2014 (the 2014 restructuring plan) and in fiscal year 2013 (the 2013 restructuring plan). see managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  results of operations  fiscal year ended august 31, 2014 compared to the fiscal year ended august 31, 2013 and note 14  restructuring and related charges to the consolidated financial statements for further details. in addition, we could initiate future restructuring plans. if we incur restructuring charges related to the 2014 restructuring plan or the 2013 restructuring plan, or in connection with any potential future restructuring program, in addition to those charges that we currently expect to incur, our financial condition and results of operations may suffer.
restructurings present significant potential risks of events occurring that could adversely affect us, including a decrease in employee morale, delays encountered in finalizing the scope of, and implementing, the restructurings (including extensive
21
consultations concerning potential workforce reductions and obtaining agreements from our affected customers for the relocation of our facilities in certain instances), the failure to achieve targeted cost savings, the failure to meet operational targets and customer requirements due to the loss of employees and any work stoppages that might occur and the strain placed on our financial and management control systems and resources. these risks are further complicated by our extensive international operations, which subject us to different legal and regulatory requirements that govern the extent and speed of our ability to reduce our manufacturing capacity and workforce. in addition, the current global economic conditions may change how governments regulate restructuring as the recent global recession has impacted local economies. finally, we may have to obtain agreements from our affected customers for the relocation of our facilities in certain instances. obtaining these agreements, along with the volatility in our customers demand, can further delay restructuring activities.
we may not be able to maintain our engineering, technological and manufacturing process expertise.
the markets for our manufacturing and engineering services are characterized by rapidly changing technology and evolving process development. the continued success of our business will depend upon our ability to:
   hire, retain and expand our qualified engineering and technical personnel;

   maintain our technological expertise;

   develop and market manufacturing services that meet changing customer needs; and

   successfully anticipate or respond to technological changes in manufacturing processes on a cost-effective and timely basis.

although we believe that our operations use the assembly and testing technologies, equipment and processes that are currently required by our customers, we cannot be certain that we will develop the capabilities required by our customers in the future. the emergence of new technology, industry standards or customer requirements may render our equipment, inventory or processes obsolete or noncompetitive. in addition, we may have to acquire new assembly and testing technologies and equipment to remain competitive. the acquisition and implementation of new technologies and equipment may require significant expense or capital investment, which could reduce our operating margins and our operating results. in facilities that we establish or acquire, we may not be able to establish and maintain our engineering, technological and manufacturing process expertise. our failure to anticipate and adapt to our customers changing technological needs and requirements or to hire and retain a sufficient number of engineers and maintain our engineering, technological and manufacturing expertise could have a material adverse effect on our operations.
if our manufacturing sites, processes and services do not comply with applicable statutory and regulatory requirements, or if we manufacture products containing design or manufacturing defects, demand for our services may decline and we may be subject to liability claims.
we manufacture and design products to our customers specifications, and, in some cases, our manufacturing processes and facilities may need to comply with applicable statutory and regulatory requirements as well as certain customer-driven standards. for example, medical devices that we manufacture or design, as well as the facilities and manufacturing processes that we use to produce them, are regulated by the u.s. food and drug administration (fda) and non-u.s. counterparts of this agency. similarly, items we manufacture for customers in the defense and aerospace industries, as well as the processes we use to produce them, are regulated by the department of defense and the federal aviation authority. also, we may be subject to standards established by certain customers, industry groups or other third party organizations (e.g., certain standards relating to labor practices). in addition, our customers products and the manufacturing processes and design services that we use to produce them often are highly complex. as a result, products that we manufacture or design may at times contain manufacturing or design defects, and our processes may be subject to errors or not be in compliance with applicable statutory and regulatory requirements. defects in the products we manufacture or design, whether caused by a design, manufacturing or component failure or error, or deficiencies in our manufacturing processes, may result in delayed shipments to customers or reduced or canceled customer orders. if these defects or deficiencies are significant, our business reputation may also be damaged. the failure of the products that we manufacture or of our manufacturing processes and facilities to comply with applicable statutory and regulatory requirements may subject us to regulatory enforcement, legal fines or penalties and, in some cases, require us to shut down, temporarily halt operations or incur considerable expense to correct a manufacturing process or facility. in addition, these defects may result in liability claims against us, expose us to liability to pay for the recall or remanufacture of a product or adversely affect product sales or our reputation. the magnitude of such claims may increase as we expand our medical and aerospace and defense manufacturing services, as defects in medical devices and aerospace and defense systems could cause death or seriously harm users of these products and others. even if our customers are responsible for the defects or defective specifications, they may not, or may not have resources to, assume responsibility for any costs or liabilities arising from these defects, which could expose us to additional liability claims.
22
we may face heightened liability risks specific to our medical device business as a result of additional healthcare regulatory related compliance requirements and the potential severe consequences that could result from manufacturing defects or malfunctions (e.g., death or serious injury) of the medical devices we manufacture or design.
as a manufacturer and designer of medical devices for our customers, we have compliance requirements in addition to those relating to other areas of our business. we are required to register with the fda and are subject to periodic inspection by the fda for compliance with the fdas quality system regulation (qsr) and current good manufacturing practices (cgmp) requirements, which require manufacturers of medical devices to adhere to certain regulations and to implement design and process manufacturing controls, quality control, labeling, handling and documentation procedures. the fda, through periodic inspections and product field monitoring, continually reviews and rigorously monitors compliance with these qsr requirements and other applicable regulatory requirements. if any fda inspection reveals noncompliance, and we do not address the fdas concerns to its satisfaction, the fda may take action against us, including issuing a form noting the fdas inspection observations, a notice of violation or a warning letter, imposing fines, bringing an action against the company and its officers, requiring a recall of the products we manufactured for our customers, issuing an import detention on products entering the u.s. from an offshore facility or temporarily halting operations at or shutting down a manufacturing facility. beyond fda, our medical device business is subject to additional state and foreign regulatory requirements which may also impact our ability to continue operations if these entities were to allege noncompliance and take action against us. if any of these were to occur, our reputation and business could suffer.
in addition, any defects or malfunctions in medical devices we manufacture or in our manufacturing processes and facilities may result in liability claims against us, expose us to liability to pay for the recall or remanufacture of a product, or otherwise adversely affect product sales or our reputation. the magnitude of such claims could be particularly severe as defects in medical devices could cause severe harm or injuries, including death, to users of these products and others.
our regular manufacturing processes and services may result in exposure to intellectual property infringement and other claims.
providing manufacturing services can expose us to potential claims that products, design or manufacturing processes we use infringe third party intellectual property rights. even though many of our manufacturing services contracts generally require our customers to indemnify us for infringement claims relating to their products, including associated product specifications and designs, a particular customer may not, or may not have the resources to, assume responsibility for such claims. in addition, we may be responsible for claims that our manufacturing processes or components used in manufacturing infringe third party intellectual property rights. infringement claims could subject us to significant liability for damages, potential injunctive action, or hamper our normal operations such as by interfering with the availability of components and, regardless of merits, could be time-consuming and expensive to resolve. the risks described in this risk factor may be heightened in connection with our customer relationships with emerging companies.
our design services and turnkey solutions offerings may result in additional exposure to product liability, intellectual property infringement and other claims, in addition to the business risk of being unable to produce the revenues necessary to profit from these services.
we continue our efforts to offer certain design services, primarily those relating to products that we manufacture for our customers, and we also continue to offer design services related to collaborative design manufacturing. we also offer turnkey solutions that include the design and manufacture of end-user products, and product components, as well as related services. providing such turnkey solutions or other design solutions can expose us to different or greater potential liabilities than those we face when providing just manufacturing services, including an increase in exposure to potential product liability claims resulting from injuries caused by defects in products we design, as well as potential claims that products we design or supply, or materials or components we use, infringe third party intellectual property rights. such claims could subject us to significant liability for damages, subject the infringing portion of our business to injunction and, regardless of their merits, could be time-consuming and expensive to resolve. we also may have greater potential exposure from warranty claims and from product recalls due to problems caused by product design. costs associated with possible product liability claims, intellectual property infringement claims and product recalls could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. when providing turnkey solutions or other design solutions, we may not be guaranteed revenue needed to recoup or profit from the investment in the resources necessary to design and develop products or provide services. no revenue may be generated from these efforts, particularly if our customers do not approve the designs in a timely manner or at all, or if they do not then purchase anticipated levels of products. furthermore, contracts may allow the customer to delay or cancel deliveries and may not obligate the customer to any volume of purchases, or may provide for penalties or cancellation of orders if we are late in delivering designs or products. we may also have the responsibility to ensure that products we design or offer satisfy safety and regulatory standards and to obtain any necessary certifications. failure to timely obtain the necessary approvals or certifications could prevent us from selling these products, which in turn could harm our sales, profitability and reputation.
23
in our contracts with turnkey solutions customers, we generally provide them with a warranty against defects in our designs. if a turnkey solutions product or component that we design is found to be defective in its design, this may lead to increased warranty claims. warranty claims may also extend to defects caused by components or materials used in the products but which are provided to us by our suppliers. although we have product liability insurance coverage, it may not be adequate or may not continue to be available on acceptable terms, in sufficient amounts, or at all. a successful product liability claim in excess of our insurance coverage or any material claim for which insurance coverage was denied or limited and for which indemnification was not available could have a material adverse effect on our operations, results of operations and financial position. moreover, even if the claim relates to a defect caused by a supplier, we may not be able to get an adequate remedy from the supplier.
the success of our turnkey solution activities and certain other aspects of our business depends in part on our ability to obtain, protect and leverage intellectual property rights to our designs.
in certain circumstances, we strive to obtain and protect certain intellectual property rights related to our solutions, designs, processes and products that we create. we believe that obtaining a significant level of protected proprietary technology may give us a competitive advantage in marketing our services. however, we cannot be certain that the measures that we employ will result in protected intellectual property rights or will result in the prevention of unauthorized use of our technology. if we are unable to obtain and protect intellectual property rights embodied within our designs, this could reduce or eliminate the competitive advantages of our proprietary technology, which would harm our business.
intellectual property infringement claims against our customers, our suppliers or us could harm our business.
our turnkey solutions, designs, products and services and those of our customers may compete against the products of other companies, many of whom may own the intellectual property rights underlying those products. such products and services may also infringe the intellectual property rights of third parties that may hold key intellectual property rights in areas in which we operate but which such third parties do not actively provide products or services. patent clearance or licensing activities, if any, may be inadequate to anticipate and avoid third party claims. as a result, in addition to the risk that we could become subject to claims of intellectual property infringement, our customers or suppliers could become subject to infringement claims. additionally, customers for our turnkey solutions, or collaborative designs in which we have significant technology contributions, typically require that we indemnify them against the risk of intellectual property infringement. if any claims are brought against our customers, our suppliers or us for such infringement, regardless of their merits, we could be required to expend significant resources in the defense or settlement of such claims, or in the defense or settlement of related indemnification claims from our customers. in the event of a claim, we may be required to spend a significant amount of money to develop non-infringing alternatives or obtain and maintain licenses. we may not be successful in developing such alternatives or obtaining and maintaining such a license on reasonable terms or at all. our customers may be required to or decide to discontinue products which are alleged to be infringing rather than face continued costs of defending the infringement claims, and such discontinuance may result in a significant decrease in our business.
we depend on attracting and retaining officers, managers and skilled personnel and on their compliance with company strategies and confidentiality policies and procedures.
our success depends to a large extent upon the continued services of our officers, managers and skilled personnel. generally our employees are not bound by employment or non-competition agreements, and we cannot assure you that we will retain our officers, managers and skilled personnel. we could be seriously harmed by the loss of any of our executive officers. to aid in managing our growth, we will need to internally develop, recruit and retain additional skilled management personnel. if we are not able to do so, our business and our ability to continue to grow could be harmed.
we establish strategic goals and ethical conduct policies. we are subject to risks if our officers and managers act inconsistently with our strategic goals or violate such ethical conduct policies. we are also subject to the risk that current and former officers, managers and skilled personnel could violate the terms of our confidentiality policies and procedures or proprietary information agreements with us which require them to keep confidential and not to use for their benefit information obtained in the course of their employment with us. should a key current or former employee use or disclose such information, including information concerning our customers, pricing, capabilities or strategy, our ability to obtain new customers and to compete could be adversely impacted.
any delay in the implementation of our information systems could disrupt our operations and cause unanticipated increases in our costs.
we have completed the installation of an enterprise resource planning system in most of our manufacturing sites and in our corporate location. we are currently in the process of installing this system in certain of our remaining facilities which will replace the existing planning and financial information systems. any delay in the implementation of these information systems could result in material adverse consequences, including disruption of operations, loss of information and unanticipated increases in costs.
24
disruptions to our information systems, including security breaches, losses of data or outages, and other security issues, could adversely affect our operations.
we rely on information systems, some of which are owned and operated by third parties, to store, process and transmit confidential information, including financial reporting, inventory management, procurement, invoicing and electronic communications, belonging to our customers, our suppliers, our employees and/or us. although we attempt to monitor and mitigate our exposure and modify our systems when warranted, these systems are vulnerable to, and at times have suffered from, among other things, damage from power loss or natural disasters, computer system and network failures, loss of telecommunication services, physical and electronic loss of data, terrorist attacks, security breaches and computer viruses. the increased use of mobile technologies can heighten these and other operational risks. if we, or the third parties who own and operate certain of our information systems, are unable to prevent such breaches, losses of data and outages, our operations could be disrupted. in addition, any production inefficiencies or delays could negatively affect our ability to fill customer orders, resulting in a delay or reduction in our revenues. also, the time and funds spent on monitoring and mitigating our exposure and responding to breaches, including the training of employees, the purchase of protective technologies and the hiring of additional employees and consultants to assist in these efforts could adversely affect our financial results. finally, any theft or misuse of information resulting from a security breach could result in, among other things, loss of significant and/or sensitive information, litigation by affected parties, financial obligations resulting from such theft or misuse, higher insurance premiums, governmental investigations, negative reactions from current and potential future customers (including potential negative financial ramifications under certain customer contract provisions) and poor publicity and any of these could adversely affect our financial results.
compliance or the failure to comply with current and future environmental, health and safety, product stewardship and producer responsibility laws or regulations could cause us significant expense.
we are subject to a variety of federal, state, local and foreign environmental, health and safety, product stewardship and producer responsibility laws and regulations, including those relating to the use, storage, discharge and disposal of hazardous chemicals used during our manufacturing process, those governing worker health and safety, those requiring design changes, supply chain investigation or conformity assessments or those relating to the recycling or reuse of products we manufacture. if we fail to comply with any present or future regulations, we could become subject to liabilities, and we could face fines or penalties, the suspension of production, or prohibitions on sales of products we manufacture. in addition, such regulations could restrict our ability to expand our facilities or could require us to acquire costly equipment, or to incur other significant expenses, including expenses associated with the recall of any non-compliant product or with changes in our operational, procurement and inventory management activities.
certain environmental laws impose liability for the costs of investigation, removal and remediation of hazardous or toxic substances on an owner, occupier or operator of real estate, or on parties who arranged for hazardous substance treatment or disposal, even if such person or company was unaware of or not responsible for contamination at the affected site. soil and groundwater contamination may have occurred at, near or arising from some of our facilities. from time to time we investigate, remediate and monitor soil and groundwater contamination at certain of our operating sites. in certain instances where contamination existed prior to our ownership or occupation of a site, landlords or former owners have retained some contractual responsibility for contamination and remediation. however, failure of such persons to perform those obligations could result in us being required to address such contamination. as a result, we may incur clean-up costs in such potential removal or remediation efforts. in other instances, we may be responsible for clean-up costs and other liabilities, including the possibility of claims due to health risks by both employees and non-employees, as well as other third-party claims in connection with contaminated sites.
from time to time new regulations are enacted, or existing requirements are changed, and it is difficult to anticipate how such regulations and changes will be implemented and enforced. we continue to evaluate the necessary steps for compliance with regulations as they are enacted.
as an example, under the dodd-frank act, some companies, including ours, are subject to new due diligence, disclosure and reporting requirements for manufacturing products that include components containing certain minerals originating from the drc or adjoining countries. these regulations may result in a decrease in the supply of such minerals, an increase in their cost and/or a disruption to our supply chain. in addition, if our due diligence process to verify the origin of minerals contained in components of our customers products or from our suppliers is not completed timely or results in findings that such minerals are sourced from restricted countries, our reputation may be adversely affected, which in turn may adversely affect our operations and financial results. compliance with the applicable sec requirements has been both relatively time consuming and costly.
our failure to comply with any applicable regulatory requirements or with related contractual obligations could result in our being directly or indirectly liable for costs (including product recall and/or replacement costs), fines or penalties and third party claims, and could jeopardize our ability to conduct business in the jurisdictions implementing them.
25
in addition, there is an increasing governmental focus around the world on global warming and environmental impact issues, which may result in new environmental, health and safety regulations that may affect us, our suppliers and our customers. this could cause us to incur additional direct costs for compliance, as well as increased indirect costs resulting from our customers, suppliers or both incurring additional compliance costs that get passed on to us. these costs may adversely impact our operations and financial condition.
we and our customers are increasingly concerned with environmental issues, such as waste management (including recycling) and climate change (including reducing carbon outputs). we expect these concerns to grow and require increased investments of time and resources.
we are subject to the risk of increased taxes.
we base our tax position upon the anticipated nature and conduct of our business and upon our understanding of the tax laws of the various countries in which we have assets or conduct activities. our tax position, however, is subject to review and possible challenge by taxing authorities and to possible changes in law (including adverse changes to the manner in which the u.s. and other countries tax multinational companies or interpret their tax laws). we cannot determine in advance the extent to which some jurisdictions may assess additional tax or interest and penalties on such additional taxes. in addition, our effective tax rate may be increased by the generation of higher income in countries with higher tax rates, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, changes in our cash management strategies, changes in local tax rates or countries adopting more aggressive interpretations of tax laws.
several countries in which we are located allow for tax incentives to attract and retain business. we have obtained incentives where available and practicable. our taxes could increase if certain tax incentives are retracted (such as occurred with our calendar year 2011 shanghai tax incentive), which could occur if we are unable to satisfy the conditions on which such incentives are based, if they are not renewed upon expiration, or if tax rates applicable to us in such jurisdictions otherwise increase. it is not anticipated that any tax incentives will expire within the next year. however, due to the possibility of changes in existing tax law and our operations, we are unable to predict how any expirations will impact us in the future. in addition, acquisitions may cause our effective tax rate to increase, depending on the jurisdictions in which the acquired operations are located.
certain of our subsidiaries provide financing, products and services to, and may from time-to-time undertake certain significant transactions with, other subsidiaries in different jurisdictions. moreover, several jurisdictions in which we operate have tax laws with detailed transfer pricing rules which require that all transactions with non-resident related parties be priced using arms length pricing principles, and that contemporaneous documentation must exist to support such pricing. there is a risk that the taxing authorities may not deem our transfer pricing documentation acceptable.
our credit rating may be downgraded.
our credit is rated by credit rating agencies. our 7.750% senior notes, our 8.250% senior notes, our 5.625% senior notes and our 4.700% senior notes are currently rated bbb- by fitch ratings (fitch) and standard and poors ratings service (s&p) and ba1 by moodys investors service (moodys), and are considered to be below investment grade debt by moodys and investment grade debt by fitch and s&p. any potential future negative change in our credit rating may make it more expensive for us to raise additional capital in the future on terms that are acceptable to us, if at all; negatively impact the price of our common stock; increase our interest payments under existing debt agreements; and have other negative implications on our business, many of which are beyond our control. in addition, the interest rate payable on the 8.250% senior notes and under the amended and restated credit facility is subject to adjustment from time to time if our credit ratings change. thus, any potential future negative change in our credit rating may increase the interest rate payable on the 8.250% senior notes, the amended and restated credit facility and certain of our other borrowings.
our amount of debt could significantly increase in the future.
as of august 31, 2014, our debt obligations consisted of $400.0 million under our 8.250% senior notes, $312.0 million under our 7.750% senior notes, $400.0 million under our 5.625% senior notes and $500.0 million under our 4.700% senior notes. as of august 31, 2014, there was $70.8 million outstanding under various bank loans to certain of our foreign subsidiaries and under various other debt obligations. refer to managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  liquidity and capital resources and note 8  notes payable, long-term debt and capital lease obligations to the consolidated financial statements for further details.
we have the ability to borrow up to $1.5 billion under the amended and restated credit facility. in addition, the amended and restated credit facility contemplates a potential increase of up to an additional $500.0 million, if we and the lenders later agree to such increase. we could incur additional indebtedness in the future in the form of bank loans, notes or convertible securities.
26
should we desire to consummate significant additional acquisition opportunities, undertake significant additional expansion activities or make substantial investments in our infrastructure, our capital needs would increase and could possibly result in our need to increase available borrowings under our revolving credit facilities or access public or private debt and equity markets. there can be no assurance, however, that we would be successful in raising additional debt or equity on terms that we would consider acceptable. an increase in the level of our indebtedness, among other things, could:
   make it difficult for us to obtain any necessary financing in the future for other acquisitions, working capital, capital expenditures, debt service requirements or other purposes;

   limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to changes in, our business;

   make us more vulnerable in the event of a downturn in our business; and

   impact certain financial covenants that we are subject to in connection with our debt and asset-backed securitization programs, including, among others, the maximum ratio of debt to consolidated ebitda (as defined in our debt agreements and securitization programs).

there can be no assurance that we will be able to meet future debt service obligations.
we are subject to risks of currency fluctuations and related hedging operations.
more than an insignificant portion of our business is conducted in currencies other than the u.s. dollar. changes in exchange rates among other currencies and the u.s. dollar will affect our cost of sales, operating margins and net revenue. we cannot predict the impact of future exchange rate fluctuations. we use financial instruments, primarily forward contracts, to economically hedge u.s. dollar and other currency commitments arising from trade accounts receivable, trade accounts payable, fixed purchase obligations and other foreign currency obligations. based on our calculations and current forecasts, we believe that our hedging activities enable us to largely protect ourselves from future exchange rate fluctuations. if, however, these hedging activities are not successful or if we change or reduce these hedging activities in the future, we may experience significant unexpected expenses from fluctuations in exchange rates.
an adverse change in the interest rates for our borrowings could adversely affect our financial condition.
we pay interest on outstanding borrowings under our revolving credit facilities and certain other long term debt obligations at interest rates that fluctuate based upon changes in various base interest rates. an adverse change in the base rates upon which our interest rates are determined could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows. if the u.s. government defaults on any of its debt obligations, its credit rating declines, or certain other economic or fiscal issues occur, interest rates could rise which would increase our interest costs and reduce our net income. also, increased interest rates could make any future, fixed interest rate debt obligations more expensive.
we face certain risks in collecting our trade accounts receivable.
most of our customer sales are paid for after the goods and services have been delivered. if any of our customers has any liquidity issues (the risk of which could be relatively high, relative to historical conditions, due to current economic conditions), then we could encounter delays or defaults in payments owed to us which could have a significant adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations. while these risks can be exacerbated in connection with emerging companies, the amount of potential loss can be greater in connection with larger customers.
our stock price may be volatile.
our common stock is traded on the new york stock exchange (the nyse). the market price of our common stock has fluctuated substantially in the past and could fluctuate substantially in the future, based on a variety of factors, including future announcements covering us or our key customers or competitors, government regulations, litigation, changes in earnings estimates by analysts, fluctuations in quarterly operating results, or general conditions in our industry and the aerospace, automotive, computing, defense, digital home, energy, healthcare, industrial, instrumentation, lifestyles, mobility, mold, networking, packaging, peripherals, storage, telecommunications and wearable technology industries. furthermore, stock prices for many companies and high technology companies in particular, fluctuate widely for reasons that may be unrelated to their operating results. those fluctuations and general economic, political and market conditions, such as recessions or international currency fluctuations and demand for our services, may adversely affect the market price of our common stock.
27
provisions in our charter documents and state law may make it harder for others to obtain control of us even though some shareholders might consider such a development to be favorable.
provisions in our amended certificate of incorporation, bylaws and the delaware general corporation law from time to time may delay, inhibit or prevent someone from gaining control of us through a tender offer, business combination, proxy contest or some other method. these provisions may adversely impact our shareholders because they may decrease the possibility of a transaction in which our shareholders receive an amount of consideration in exchange for their shares that is at a significant premium to the then current market price of our shares. these provisions include:
   a restriction in our bylaws on the ability of shareholders to take action by less than unanimous written consent; and

   a statutory restriction on business combinations with some types of interested shareholders.

in addition, for ten years we had a poison pill shareholder rights plan that our board of directors allowed to expire in october 2011 without extension. in doing that, our board considered various relevant issues, including the fact that if needed and appropriate it can, under the delaware general corporation law, implement a new shareholders rights plan reasonably quickly and without stockholder approval. our board regularly considers this topic, even in the absence of specific circumstances or takeover proposals, to facilitate its ability in the future to act expeditiously and appropriately should the need arise.
changes in the securities laws and regulations have increased, and may continue to increase, our costs; and any future changes would likely increase our costs.
the sarbanes-oxley act of 2002, as well as related rules promulgated by the sec (including the dodd-frank act) and the nyse, required changes in some of our corporate governance, securities disclosure and compliance practices. compliance with these rules increased our legal and financial accounting costs for several years following the announcement and effectiveness of these new rules. while these costs are no longer increasing, they may in fact increase in the future. in addition, given the relatively recent turmoil in the securities and credit markets, as well as the global economy, many u.s. and international governmental, regulatory and supervisory authorities including, but not limited to, the sec and the nyse, have enacted additional changes in their laws, regulations and rules and may be contemplating additional changes. these changes, and any such future changes, may cause our legal and financial accounting costs to increase.
due to inherent limitations, there can be no assurance that our system of disclosure and internal controls and procedures will be successful in preventing all errors, theft and fraud, or in informing management of all material information in a timely manner.
our board management, including our ceo and cfo, do not expect that our disclosure controls and internal controls and procedures will prevent all errors, theft and fraud. a control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. further, the design of a control system reflects that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within the company have been or will be detected. these inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur simply because of error or mistake. additionally, controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people, or by management override of the control.
the design of any system of controls also is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions; over time, a control may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. because of the inherent limitations in a cost-effective control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and may not be detected.
if we receive other than an unqualified opinion on the adequacy of our internal control over financial reporting as of august 31, 2015 or any future year-ends, investors could lose confidence in the reliability of our financial statements, which could result in a decrease in the value of your shares.
pursuant to section 404 of the sarbanes-oxley act of 2002, larger public companies like us are required to include an annual report on internal control over financial reporting in their annual reports on form 10-k that contains an assessment by management of the effectiveness of the companys internal control over financial reporting. our independent registered certified public accounting firm, ernst & young llp, issued an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of august 31, 2014. while we continuously conduct a rigorous review of our internal control over financial reporting in order to try to assure compliance with the section 404 requirements, if our independent registered certified public accounting firm interprets the section 404 requirements and the related rules and regulations differently from us or if our independent registered certified public accounting firm is not satisfied with our internal control over financial reporting or with the level at which it is documented, operated or reviewed, they may issue an adverse opinion. an adverse opinion could result in an adverse reaction in the financial markets due to a loss of confidence in the reliability of our consolidated financial statements. in addition, we have spent a significant amount of resources, and will likely continue to for the foreseeable future, in complying with section 404s requirements, particularly given the changes recently introduced by the committee of sponsoring organizations (coso) to the manner in which internal controls over financial reporting must be administered.
28
there are inherent uncertainties involved in estimates, judgments and assumptions used in the preparation of financial statements in accordance with u.s. generally accepted accounting principles (u.s. gaap). any changes in u.s. gaap or in estimates, judgments and assumptions could have a material adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations.
the consolidated financial statements included in the periodic reports we file with the sec are prepared in accordance with u.s. gaap. the preparation of financial statements in accordance with u.s. gaap involves making estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect reported amounts of assets, liabilities and related reserves, revenues, expenses and income. estimates, judgments and assumptions are inherently subject to change in the future, and any such changes could result in corresponding changes to the amounts of assets, liabilities and related reserves, revenues, expenses and income. any such changes could have a material adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations. in addition, the principles of u.s. gaap are subject to interpretation by the financial accounting standards board, the american institute of certified public accountants, the sec and various bodies formed to create appropriate accounting policies, and interpret such policies. a change in those policies can have a significant effect on our accounting methods. for example, although not yet currently required, the sec could require us to adopt the international financial reporting standards in the next few years, which could have a significant effect on certain of our accounting methods. as another example, significant changes to the revenue recognition rules have been enacted and will apply to us beginning in fiscal year 2018.
we are subject to risks associated with natural disasters, climate change and global events.
our operations and those of our suppliers may be subject to natural disasters, climate change related events, or other business disruptions, which could seriously harm our results of operation and increase our costs and expenses. we are susceptible to losses and interruptions caused by hurricanes (including in florida, where our headquarters are located), earthquakes, power shortages, telecommunications failures, water or other natural resource shortages, tsunamis, floods, typhoons, drought, fire, extreme weather conditions, rising sea level, geopolitical events such as terrorist acts or widespread criminal activities and other natural or manmade disasters. our insurance coverage with respect to natural disasters is limited and is subject to deductibles and coverage limits. such coverage may not be adequate, or may not continue to be available at commercially reasonable rates and terms.
energy price increases may negatively impact our results of operations.
certain of the components that we use in our manufacturing activities are petroleum-based. in addition, we, along with our suppliers and customers, rely on various energy sources (including oil) in our facilities and transportation activities. an increase in energy prices, which have been volatile over the past few years, could cause an increase to our raw material costs and transportation costs. in addition, increased transportation costs of certain of our suppliers and customers could be passed along to us. we may not be able to increase our product prices enough to offset these increased costs. in addition, any increase in our product prices may reduce our future customer orders and profitability.
item 7.   managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations

overview we are one of the leading providers of worldwide electronic manufacturing services and solutions. we provide comprehensive electronics design, production and product management services to companies in the aerospace, automotive, computing, defense, digital home, energy, healthcare, industrial, instrumentation, lifestyles, mobility, mold, networking, packaging, peripherals, storage, telecommunications and wearable technology industries.
the industry in which we operate is composed of companies that provide a range of design and manufacturing services to companies that utilize electronics components. the industry experienced rapid change and growth through the 1990s as an increasing number of companies chose to outsource an increasing portion, and, in some cases, all of their manufacturing requirements. in mid-2001, the industrys revenue declined as a result of significant cut-backs in customer production requirements, which was consistent with the overall downturn in the technology sector at the time. in response to this downturn in the technology sector, we implemented restructuring programs to reduce our cost structure and further align our manufacturing capacity with the geographic production demands of our customers. industry revenues generally began to stabilize in 2003 and companies began to turn more to outsourcing versus internal manufacturing. in addition, the number of industries serviced, as well as the market penetration in certain industries, by electronic manufacturing service providers has increased over the past several years. in mid-2008, the industrys revenue declined when a deteriorating macro-economic environment resulted in illiquidity in global credit markets and a significant economic downturn in the north american, european and asian markets. in response to this downturn, and the termination of our business relationship with blackberry limited, we implemented additional restructuring programs, including the restructuring plans that were approved by our board of directors in the first quarter of fiscal year 2014 (the 2014 restructuring plan) and in fiscal year 2013 (the 2013 restructuring plan), to reduce our cost structure and further align our manufacturing capacity with the geographic production demands of our customers.
we continue to monitor the current economic environment and its potential impact on both the customers that we serve as well as our end-markets and closely manage our costs and capital resources so that we can respond appropriately as circumstances continue to change.
at august 31, 2014, our reportable operating segments consisted of three segments: diversified manufacturing services (dms), enterprise & infrastructure (e&i) and high velocity systems (hvs). as of september 1, 2014, we will report our business in the following two segments: electronics manufacturing services (ems) and dms. our ems segment is focused around leveraging it, supply chain design and engineering, technologies largely centered on core electronics, sharing of our large scale manufacturing infrastructure and the ability to serve a broad range of end markets. our ems segment includes customers primarily in the automotive, computing, digital home, energy, industrial, networking, printing, storage and telecommunications industries. our dms segment is focused on providing engineering solutions, heavy participation in consumer markets, access to higher growth markets and a focus on material sciences and technologies. our dms segment includes customers primarily in the consumer lifestyles, healthcare, mobility and packaging industries.
we derive revenue principally from manufacturing services related to electronic equipment built to customer specifications. we also derive revenue to a lesser extent from design services and excess inventory sales. revenue from manufacturing services and excess inventory sales is generally recognized, net of estimated product return costs, when goods are shipped; title and risk of ownership have passed; the price to the buyer is fixed or determinable; and collectability is reasonably assured. design service related revenue is generally recognized upon completion and acceptance by the respective customer. we generally assume no significant obligations after product shipment.
36
our cost of revenue includes the cost of electronic components and other materials that comprise the products we manufacture; the cost of labor and manufacturing overhead; and adjustments for excess and obsolete inventory. as a provider of turnkey manufacturing services, we are responsible for procuring components and other materials. this requires us to commit significant working capital to our operations and to manage the purchasing, receiving, inspecting and stocking of materials. although we bear the risk of fluctuations in the cost of materials and excess scrap, we periodically negotiate cost of materials adjustments with our customers. net revenue from each product that we manufacture consists of an element based on the costs of materials in that product and an element based on the labor and manufacturing overhead costs allocated to that product. we refer to the portion of the sales price of a product that is based on materials costs as material-based revenue, and to the portion of the sales price of a product that is based on labor and manufacturing overhead costs as manufacturing-based revenue. our gross margin for any product depends on the mix between the cost of materials in the product and the cost of labor and manufacturing overhead allocated to the product. we typically realize higher gross margins on manufacturing-based revenue than we do on materials-based revenue. as we gain experience in manufacturing a product, we usually achieve increased efficiencies, which may result in lower labor and manufacturing overhead costs for that product.
our operating results are impacted by the level of capacity utilization of manufacturing facilities; indirect labor costs; and selling, general and administrative expenses. operating income margins have generally improved during periods of high production volume and high capacity utilization. during periods of low production volume, we generally have idle capacity and reduced operating income margins.
we have consistently utilized advanced circuit design, production design and manufacturing technologies to meet the needs of our customers. to support this effort, our engineering staff focuses on developing and refining design and manufacturing technologies to meet specific needs of specific customers. most of the expenses associated with these customer-specific efforts are reflected in our cost of revenue. in addition, our engineers engage in research and development (r&d) of new technologies that apply generally to our operations. the expenses of these r&d activities are reflected in the research and development line item within our consolidated statement of operations.
an important element of our strategy is the expansion of our global production facilities. the majority of our revenue and materials costs worldwide are denominated in u.s. dollars, while our labor and utility costs in operations outside the u.s. are denominated in local currencies. we economically hedge certain of these local currency costs, based on our evaluation of the potential exposure as compared to the cost of the hedge, through the purchase of foreign currency exchange contracts. changes in the fair market value of such hedging instruments are reflected within the consolidated statement of operations and the consolidated statement of comprehensive income. see risk factors  we are subject to risks of currency fluctuations and related hedging operations.
we currently depend, and expect to continue to depend, upon a relatively small number of customers for a significant percentage of our net revenue and upon their growth, viability and financial stability. a significant reduction in sales to any of our customers, a customer exerting significant pricing and margin pressures on us or the termination or substantial winding down of our business relationship with one of our customers could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. in the past, some of our customers have terminated their manufacturing arrangements with us or have significantly reduced or delayed the volume of design, production or product management services ordered from us, including moving a portion of their manufacturing from us in order to more fully utilize their excess internal manufacturing capacity. there can be no assurance that present or future customers will not terminate their manufacturing arrangements with us or significantly reduce or delay the volume of design, production or product management services ordered from us, or move a portion of their manufacturing from us in order to more fully utilize their excess internal manufacturing capacity. we could in the future terminate, or substantially wind down, significant customer relationships. any such termination or substantial winding down of a customer or manufacturing relationship or change, reduction or delay in orders could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition. see risk factors  because we depend on a limited number of customers, a reduction in sales to any one of our customers could cause a significant decline in our revenue, risk factors  most of our customers do not commit to long-term production schedules, which makes it difficult for us to schedule production and capital expenditures, and to maximize the efficiency of our manufacturing capacity, risk factors  our customers may cancel their orders, change production quantities, delay production or change their sourcing strategy and note 12  concentration of risk and segment data to the consolidated financial statements.
37
summary of results net revenues for fiscal year 2014 decreased approximately 8.6% to $15.8 billion compared to $17.2 billion for fiscal year 2013 largely due to decreased revenue as a result of our disengagement with blackberry limited and decreased revenue from certain existing customers, partially offset by increased revenue from new customers principally related to the nypro acquisition.
the following table sets forth, for the fiscal year ended august 31, certain key operating results and other financial information (in thousands, except per share data).

during the three months ended august 31, 2014, days in inventory increased one day to 48 days as compared to the prior sequential quarter largely to support expected revenue levels in the first quarter of fiscal year 2015. during the three months ended may 31, 2014, days in inventory decreased two days to 47 days as compared to the prior sequential quarter due to continued focus on inventory management. during the three months ended february 28, 2014, days in inventory increased four days to 49 days as compared to the prior sequential quarter due to decreased sales levels. during the three months ended november 30, 2013, days in inventory decreased one day to 45 days as compared to the prior sequential quarter due to a continued focus on inventory management. during the three months ended august 31, 2014, inventory turns, on an annualized basis, remained constant at eight turns as compared to the prior sequential quarter. during the three months ended may 31, 2014, inventory turns, on an annualized basis, increased one turn to eight turns as compared to the prior sequential quarter due to a continued focus on inventory management. during the three months ended february 28, 2014, inventory turns, on an annualized basis, decreased one turn to seven turns as compared to the prior sequential quarter due to decreased sales levels, and during the three months ended november 30, 2013, inventory turns, on an annualized basis, remained constant at eight turns as compared to the prior sequential quarter.
38
during the three months ended august 31, 2014, may 31, 2014, february 28, 2014 and november 30, 2013, days in accounts payable increased five days to 73 days, increased two days to 68 days, decreased three days to 66 days and increased one day to 69 days, respectively, from the prior sequential quarter primarily due to the timing of purchases and cash payments for purchases during the respective quarters.
the sales cycle was two days during the three months ended august 31, 2014, three days during the three months ended may 31, 2014, seven days during the three months ended february 28, 2014 and three days during the three months ended november 30, 2013. the changes in the sales cycle are due to the changes in accounts receivable, accounts payable and inventory that are discussed above.
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with u.s. generally accepted accounting principles (u.s. gaap) requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect our reported amounts of assets and liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. on an on-going basis, we evaluate our estimates and assumptions based upon historical experience and various other factors and circumstances. management believes that our estimates and assumptions are reasonable under the circumstances; however, actual results may vary from these estimates and assumptions under different future circumstances. we have identified the following critical accounting policies that affect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements. for further discussion of our significant accounting policies, refer to note 1  description of business and summary of significant accounting policies to the consolidated financial statements.
revenue recognition we derive revenue principally from manufacturing services related to electronic equipment built to customer specifications. we also derive revenue to a lesser extent from design services and excess inventory sales. revenue from manufacturing services and excess inventory sales is generally recognized, net of estimated product return costs, when goods are shipped; title and risk of ownership have passed; the price to the buyer is fixed or determinable; and collectability is reasonably assured. design service related revenue is generally recognized upon completion and acceptance by the respective customer. we generally assume no significant obligations after product shipment.
allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts related to receivables not expected to be collected from our customers. this allowance is based on managements assessment of specific customer balances, considering the age of receivables and financial stability of the customer. if there is an adverse change in the financial condition and circumstances of our customers, or if actual defaults are higher than provided for, an addition to the allowance may be necessary.
inventory valuation we purchase inventory based on forecasted demand and record inventory at the lower of cost or market. management regularly assesses inventory valuation based on current and forecasted usage, customer inventory-related contractual obligations and other lower of cost or market considerations. if actual market conditions or our customers product demands are less favorable than those projected, additional valuation adjustments may be necessary.
long-lived assets we review property, plant and equipment and amortizable intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. recoverability of property, plant and equipment is measured by comparing its carrying value to the undiscounted projected cash flows that the asset(s) or asset group(s) are expected to generate. if the carrying amount of an asset or an asset group is not recoverable, we recognize an impairment loss based on the excess of the carrying amount of the long-lived asset or asset group over its respective fair value, which is generally determined as either the present value of estimated future cash flows or the appraised value. the impairment analysis is based on significant assumptions of future results made by management, including revenue and cash flow projections. circumstances that may lead to impairment of property, plant and equipment include unforeseen decreases in future performance or industry demand and the restructuring of our operations resulting from a change in our business strategy or adverse economic conditions. for further discussion of our current restructuring program, refer to managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  results of operations  restructuring and related charges.
39
we have recorded intangible assets, including goodwill, in connection with business acquisitions. estimated useful lives of amortizable intangible assets are determined by management based on an assessment of the period over which the asset is expected to contribute to future cash flows. the fair value of acquired amortizable intangible assets impacts the amounts recorded as goodwill.
we perform a goodwill impairment analysis using the two-step method on an annual basis and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. the recoverability of goodwill is measured at the reporting unit level by comparing the reporting units carrying amount, including goodwill, to the fair value of the reporting unit. we determine the fair value of our reporting units based on an average weighting of both projected discounted future results and the use of comparative market multiples. if the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value, goodwill is considered impaired and a second test is performed to measure the amount of loss, if any.
we perform an indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment analysis on an annual basis and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. the recoverability of indefinite-lived intangible assets is measured by comparing the carrying amount to the fair value. we determine the fair value of our indefinite-lived intangible assets principally based on a variation of the income approach, known as the relief from royalty method. if the carrying amount of the indefinite-lived intangible asset exceeds its fair value, the indefinite-lived intangible asset is considered impaired.
we completed our annual impairment test for goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2014 and determined that the fair values of our reporting units and the indefinite-lived intangible assets are substantially in excess of the carrying values and that no impairment existed as of the date of the impairment test.
retirement benefits we have pension and postretirement benefit costs and liabilities in certain foreign locations that are developed from actuarial valuations. actuarial valuations require management to make certain judgments and estimates of discount rates, compensation rate increases and return on plan assets. we evaluate these assumptions on a regular basis taking into consideration current market conditions and historical market data. the discount rate is used to state expected future cash flows at a present value on the measurement date. this rate represents the market rate for high-quality fixed income investments. a lower discount rate increases the present value of benefit obligations and increases pension expense. when considering the expected long-term rate of return on pension plan assets, we take into account current and expected asset allocations, as well as historical and expected returns on plan assets. other assumptions include demographic factors such as retirement, mortality and turnover. for further discussion of our pension and postretirement benefits, refer to note 9  postretirement and other employee benefits to the consolidated financial statements.
income taxes we estimate our income tax provision in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate, a process that includes estimating exposures related to examinations by taxing authorities. we must also make judgments regarding the ability to realize the deferred tax assets. the carrying value of our net deferred tax assets is based on our belief that it is more likely than not that we will generate sufficient future taxable income in certain jurisdictions to realize these deferred tax assets. a valuation allowance has been established for deferred tax assets that we do not believe meet the more likely than not criteria. we assess whether an uncertain tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return meets the threshold for recognition and measurement in the consolidated financial statements. our judgments regarding future taxable income as well as tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return may change due to changes in market conditions, changes in tax laws or other factors. if our assumptions and consequently our estimates change in the future, the valuation allowances and/or tax reserves established may be increased or decreased, resulting in a respective increase or decrease in income tax expense.

fiscal year ended august 31, 2014 compared to fiscal year ended august 31, 2013
net revenue. our net revenue decreased 8.6% to $15.8 billion for fiscal year 2014, compared to $17.2 billion for fiscal year 2013. specific decreases include a 24% decrease in the sale of hvs products due principally to reductions in the sale of mobility handsets as a result of our disengagement with blackberry limited, a 4% decrease in the sale of e&i products due to the continued decline in enterprise and infrastructure spending, which was partially offset by strength in our telecommunications business, and a 2% decrease in the sale of dms products as a result of reduced production levels due to weakened end user product demand within specialized services, which was partially offset by both increased revenue from new customers as a result of the nypro acquisition and increased revenue from our instrumentation business.
generally, we assess revenue on a global customer basis regardless of whether the growth is associated with organic growth or as a result of an acquisition. accordingly, we do not differentiate or report separately revenue increases generated by acquisitions as opposed to existing business. in addition, the added cost structures associated with our acquisitions have historically been relatively insignificant when compared to our overall cost structure.
the distribution of revenue across our sectors has fluctuated, and will continue to fluctuate, as a result of numerous factors, including but not limited to the following: fluctuations in customer demand as a result of recessionary conditions; efforts to de-emphasize the economic performance of certain sectors; seasonality in our business; business growth from new and existing customers; specific product performance; and the termination of our business relationship with blackberry limited and any other potential future termination, or substantial winding down, of other significant customer relationships.
on april 1, 2014, we completed the sale of the ams business (except for the malaysian operations due to certain regulatory approvals that are still pending in that jurisdiction), which was included in the dms segment. accordingly, for all periods presented, the results of operations of this business are classified as discontinued operations. see note 2  discontinued operations to the consolidated financial statements for further details.

the following table sets forth, for the periods indicated, revenue by segment expressed as a percentage of net revenue:
fiscal year ended august 31,
2014               2013                2012
dms                44   %              41   %              40   %
e&amp;i            34   %              32   %              32   %
hvs                22   %              27   %              28   %
total             100   %             100   %             100   %
foreign source revenue represented 84.5% of our net revenue for fiscal year 2014 and 86.8% of net revenue for fiscal year 2013. we currently expect our foreign source revenue to increase as compared to current levels over the course of the next 12 months.
gross profit. gross profit decreased to $1.0 billion (6.5% of net revenue) for fiscal year 2014 compared to $1.2 billion (7.0% of net revenue) for fiscal year 2013. the decrease in gross profit is due to our revenues from existing customers decreasing at a higher rate than certain of our fixed costs, which is partially offset by increased revenue from new customers.
selling, general and administrative. selling, general and administrative expenses increased to $675.7 million (4.3% of net revenue) for fiscal year 2014 compared to $614.3 million (3.6% of net revenue) for fiscal year 2013. selling, general and administrative expense increased as compared to fiscal year 2013 primarily as a result of an increase to incremental selling, general and administrative expense resulting from the acquisition of nypro during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2013, which tends to generate a higher amount of selling, general and administrative expenses on a relative basis than our other operations, and an increase due to the increased investment in our strategic development sector. the increase was partially offset by a decrease to selling, general and administrative expense resulting from a $45.8 million reversal to stock-based compensation expense during fiscal year 2014 due to decreased expectations for the vesting of certain restricted stock awards.
research and development. r&d expenses remained relatively consistent over the prior period at $28.6 million (0.2% of net revenue) for fiscal year ended 2014 compared to $28.4 million (0.2% of net revenue) for fiscal year 2013.
amortization of intangibles. we recorded $23.9 million of amortization of intangibles in fiscal year 2014 as compared to $11.0 million in fiscal year 2013. the increase is primarily attributable to amortization expense associated with the finite-lived intangible assets acquired in connection with the acquisition of nypro, partially offset by a decrease to certain intangible assets that became fully amortized since august 31, 2013. for additional information regarding purchased intangibles, see acquisitions and expansion below, note 1(f)  description of business and summary of significant accounting policies  goodwill and other intangible assets, note 7  goodwill and other intangible assets and note 16  business acquisitions to the consolidated financial statements.
restructuring and related charges.
a. 2014 restructuring plan in conjunction with the 2014 restructuring plan, we charged $49.9 million of restructuring and related charges to the consolidated statement of operations during the fiscal year ended august 31, 2014. the 2014 restructuring plan is intended to address the termination of our business relationship with blackberry limited. the restructuring and related charges during the fiscal year ended august 31, 2014 include cash costs of $16.2 million related to employee severance and benefit costs, $1.7 million related to lease costs and $1.7 million of other related costs, as well as non-cash costs of $30.3 million related to asset write off costs. we have substantially completed our restructuring activities under this plan and do not expect to incur any additional costs under the 2014 restructuring plan.
during the fiscal year ended august 31, 2014, $19.1 million was paid relating to the 2014 restructuring plan. at august 31, 2014, accrued liabilities of approximately $0.5 million related to the 2014 restructuring plan are expected to be paid over the next twelve months.
the 2014 restructuring plan is expected to yield annualized cost savings of approximately $12.0 million on a net basis after taking into account potential future blackberry limited revenues that will not be earned due to the termination of our business relationship. the majority of these annual cost savings are expected to be reflected as a reduction in cost of revenue. we began to realize a portion of these cost savings in the second quarter of fiscal year 2014.
42
b. 2013 restructuring plan in conjunction with the 2013 restructuring plan, we charged $35.4 million of restructuring and related charges to the consolidated statement of operations during the fiscal year ended august 31, 2014 compared to $80.5 million during the fiscal year ended august 31, 2013. the 2013 restructuring plan is intended to better align our manufacturing capacity in certain geographies and to reduce our worldwide workforce in order to reduce operating expenses. these restructuring activities are intended to address current market conditions and customer requirements. the restructuring and related charges for the fiscal years ended august 31, 2014 and 2013 include cash costs of $25.0 million and $74.3 million related to employee severance and benefit costs, respectively, $0.5 million and $0.2 million related to lease costs, respectively, and $1.3 million and $0.0 million related to other related costs, respectively, as well as non-cash costs of $8.6 million and $6.0 million related to asset write-off costs, respectively.
during the fiscal year ended august 31, 2014, $36.9 million was paid related to the 2013 restructuring plan. at august 31, 2014, accrued liabilities of approximately $44.1 million related to the 2013 restructuring plan are expected to be paid over the next twelve months. we currently expect to recognize approximately $179.0 million, excluding the restructuring and related charges previously incurred for the ams discontinued operations, in pre-tax restructuring and other related costs over the course of fiscal years 2013, 2014 and 2015 under the 2013 restructuring plan. while we expect the total amount of pre-tax restructuring and other related costs will be $179.0 million, we can only provide estimate ranges for certain of the major types of costs associated with the action: $123.0 million to $143.0 million of employee severance and benefit costs; $28.0 million to $48.0 million of asset write-off costs; $3.0 million of contract termination costs and $5.0 million of other related costs. since the inception of the 2013 restructuring plan, a total of $115.9 million of restructuring and related costs have been recognized. a majority of the total restructuring costs are expected to be related to employee severance and benefit arrangements. the charges related to the 2013 restructuring plan, excluding asset write off costs, are currently expected to result in cash expenditures in a range of $131.0 million to $151.0 million that will be payable primarily over the course of our fiscal years 2013, 2014 and 2015. the exact amount and timing of these charges and cash outflows, as well as the estimated cost ranges by category type, have not been finalized. much of the 2013 restructuring plan as discussed reflects our intention only and restructuring decisions, and the timing of such decisions, at certain plants are still subject to the finalization of timetables for the transition of functions and consultation with our employees and their representatives.
upon its completion, the 2013 restructuring plan is expected to yield annualized cost savings of approximately $65.9 million. the expected avoided annual costs consist of a reduction in employee related expenses of $64.4 million, a reduction in depreciation expense associated with asset disposals of $1.1 million, and a reduction in rent expense associated with leased buildings that have been vacated of approximately $0.4 million. the majority of these annual cost savings are expected to be reflected as a reduction in cost of revenue as well as a reduction of selling, general and administrative expense. these annual costs savings are expected to be partially offset by decreased revenues and incremental costs expected to be incurred by those plants to which certain production will be shifted. after considering these partial cost savings offsets, we expect to realize annual cost savings of approximately $65.0 million.
loss on disposal of subsidiaries. during the fiscal year ended august 31, 2014, we recorded a loss of approximately $8.0 million related to the sale of our controlling financial interests in two nypro subsidiaries.
impairment of notes receivable and related charges. during the fiscal year ended august 31, 2013, we recorded a loss of approximately $25.6 million related to notes receivable and related charges. such a charge was recorded following the determination that it was probable that we would be unable to collect the amounts due from a former customer.
other expense. other expense did not change significantly for fiscal year 2014 at $7.6 million compared to $6.1 million for fiscal year 2013.
interest income. we recorded interest income of $3.7 million for fiscal year 2014 compared to $1.8 million for fiscal year 2013. the increase was primarily due to dividends (which are treated as interest income) on the senior non-convertible cumulative preferred stock received in connection with the sale of the ams business on april 1, 2014.
interest expense. we recorded $128.1 million of interest expense in fiscal year 2014 as compared to $121.0 million in fiscal year 2013. the increase was primarily due to incremental interest associated with increased borrowings associated with our five year unsecured credit facility amended as of july 25, 2014 (the amended and restated credit facility).
income tax expense. income tax expense reflects an effective tax rate of 102.2% for fiscal year 2014, as compared to an effective tax rate of 2.3% for fiscal year 2013.
the effective tax rate for the fiscal year ended august 31, 2014 increased from the effective tax rate for the fiscal year ended august 31, 2013 primarily due to the decrease in income from continuing operations during fiscal year 2014 in low tax-rate jurisdictions that had minimal related tax benefit and the release of existing valuation allowances during fiscal year 2013. this effective tax rate increase was partially offset by a tax benefit from revaluing deferred tax assets related to the enactment of the mexico 2014 tax reform and the decrease in stock-based compensation expense with minimal related tax benefit.
43
for the fiscal year ended august 31, 2014, we recorded out-of-period adjustments that increased net income from continuing operations by approximately $17.1 million, which related to fiscal year 2013 income tax benefit adjustments that were recorded in fiscal year 2014. we assessed and concluded that these adjustments are not material to either the consolidated quarterly or annual financial statements for all impacted periods.
fiscal year ended august 31, 2013 compared to fiscal year ended august 31, 2012
net revenue. our net revenue increased 6.9% to $17.2 billion for fiscal year 2013, up from $16.1 billion in fiscal year 2012. specific increases included a 10% increase in the sale of dms products; a 9% increase in the sale of e&i products; and a 1% increase in the sale of hvs products. the increases were primarily due to increased revenue from certain of our existing customers, most notably in dms and e&i, including new program wins with these customers.
foreign source revenue represented 86.8% of our net revenue for fiscal year 2013 and 86.1% of net revenue for fiscal year 2012.
for further discussion of our net revenues, refer to managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  results of operations  fiscal year ended august 31, 2014 compared to fiscal year ended august 31, 2013  net revenue.
gross profit. gross profit for fiscal year 2013 ($1.2 billion or 7.0% of net revenue) remained relatively consistent as compared to fiscal year 2012 ($1.2 billion or 7.2% of net revenue).
selling, general and administrative. selling, general and administrative expenses increased to $614.3 million (3.6% of net revenue) for fiscal year 2013 compared to $572.6 million (3.6% of net revenue) for fiscal year 2012. the increase in selling, general and administrative expenses on a gross basis was due to additional salary and salary related expenses associated with increased headcount to support the continued growth of our business; additional selling, general and administrative expenses associated with acquisitions, including nypro during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2013; and $13.5 million in professional fees in fiscal year 2013 associated with the due diligence and other acquisition related activities associated with the nypro acquisition.
research and development. r&d expenses for fiscal year 2013 increased to $28.4 million (0.2% of net revenue) from $25.8 million (0.2% of net revenue) for fiscal year 2012. the increase was primarily due to new projects in targeted growth sectors, such as the emerging growth sector within dms.
amortization of intangibles. we recorded $11.0 million of amortization of intangibles in fiscal year 2013 as compared to $12.9 million in fiscal year 2012. the decrease was primarily attributable to certain intangible assets that became fully amortized since august 31, 2012, partially offset by an increase to amortization expense associated with the finite-lived intangible assets acquired in connection with the acquisition of nypro. for additional information regarding purchased intangibles, see acquisitions and expansion below, note 1(f)  description of business and summary of significant accounting policies  goodwill and other intangible assets, note 7  goodwill and other intangible assets and note 16  business acquisitions to the consolidated financial statements.
restructuring and related charges.
during fiscal year 2013, we recorded $80.5 million of restructuring and related charges related to the 2013 restructuring plan.
for further discussion of restructuring and related charges, refer to managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  results of operations  fiscal year ended august 31, 2014 compared to fiscal year ended august 31, 2013  restructuring and related charges.
other expense. other expense decreased to $6.1 million for fiscal year 2013 compared to $8.9 million for fiscal year 2012. the decrease was primarily due to $3.4 million of expense recognized during fiscal year 2012 related to fair value adjustments associated with customer warrants.
interest income. interest income remained relatively constant at $1.8 million for fiscal year 2013 compared to $2.0 million for fiscal year 2012.
interest expense. we recorded $121.0 million of interest expense in fiscal year 2013 as compared to $106.1 million in fiscal year 2012. the increase was primarily due to incremental interest associated with the issuance of the 4.700% senior notes during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2012 and increased borrowings associated with the amended and restated credit facility.
income tax expense. income tax expense reflects an effective tax rate of 2.3% for fiscal year 2013, as compared to an effective tax rate of 23.6% for fiscal year 2012. the effective tax rate decreased from the previous period primarily due to a $104.0 million partial release of the u.s. valuation allowance related to the u.s. deferred tax liabilities from the nypro acquisition, which represent future sources of taxable income to support the realization of the deferred tax assets. the u.s. deferred tax liabilities from
44
the nypro acquisition primarily relate to undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries and non-deductible intangible assets. the effective tax rate also decreased due to the release of a non-u.s. valuation allowance. the fiscal year 2013 effective tax rate decreases were partially offset by restructuring costs with minimal related tax benefit in fiscal year 2013, a release of tax reserves related to a non-u.s. governmental tax audit in fiscal year 2012, and the mix of income or losses within the tax jurisdictions in which we operate.
the effective tax rate differed from the u.s. federal statutory rate of 35.0% during these periods primarily due to: (a) a partial release of the u.s. valuation allowance related to the u.s. deferred tax liabilities from the nypro acquisition; (b) the release of a non-u.s. valuation allowance; (c) income in tax jurisdictions with lower statutory tax rates than the u.s.; (d) tax incentives granted to sites in brazil, malaysia, poland, singapore, and vietnam and (e) income and losses in tax jurisdictions with existing valuation allowances. the majority of the tax incentive benefits expire at various dates through 2020. such tax incentives are subject to conditions with which we expect to continue to comply. see managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  critical accounting policies and estimates  income taxes, risk factors  we are subject to the risk of increased taxes and note 5  income taxes to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion.
non-u.s. gaap core financial measures the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations include certain non-u.s. gaap financial measures as identified in the reconciliation below. the non-u.s. gaap financial measures disclosed herein do not have standard meaning and may vary from the non-u.s. gaap financial measures used by other companies or how we may calculate those measures in other instances from time to time. non-u.s. gaap financial measures should not be considered a substitute for, or superior to, measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with u.s. gaap. also, our core financial measures should not be construed as an inference by us that our future results will be unaffected by those items which are excluded from our core financial measures.
management believes that the non-u.s. gaap core financial measures set forth below are useful to facilitate evaluating the past and future performance of our ongoing manufacturing operations over multiple periods on a comparable basis by excluding the effects of the amortization of intangibles, stock-based compensation expense and related charges, restructuring and related charges, distressed customer charges, acquisition costs and certain purchase accounting adjustments, loss on disposal of subsidiaries, settlement of receivables and related charges, impairment of notes receivable and related charges, goodwill impairment charges, income (loss) from discontinued operations, gain on sale of discontinued operations and certain other expenses, net of tax and certain deferred tax valuation allowance charges. among other uses, management uses non-u.s. gaap core financial measures as a factor in determining certain employee performance when determining incentive compensation.
we are reporting core operating income and core earnings to provide investors with an additional method for assessing operating income and earnings, by presenting what we believe are our core manufacturing operations. a significant portion (based on the respective values) of the items that are excluded for purposes of calculating core operating income and core earnings also impacted certain balance sheet assets, resulting in a portion of an asset being written off without a corresponding recovery of cash we may have previously spent with respect to the asset. in the case of restructuring and related charges, we may be making associated cash payments in the future. in addition, although, for purposes of calculating core operating income and core earnings, we exclude stock-based compensation expense (which we anticipate continuing to incur in the future) because it is a non-cash expense, the associated stock issued may result in an increase in our outstanding shares of stock, which may result in the dilution of our stockholders ownership interest. we encourage you to evaluate these items and the limitations for purposes of analysis in excluding them.

acquisitions and expansion as discussed in note 16  business acquisitions to the consolidated financial statements, we completed our acquisition of nypro during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2013. acquisitions are accounted for using the acquisition method of accounting. our consolidated financial statements include the operating results of each business from the date of acquisition. see risk factors  we have on occasion not achieved, and may not in the future achieve, expected profitability from our acquisitions; and some divestitures may adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.
liquidity and capital resources at august 31, 2014, we had cash and cash equivalent balances totaling $1.0 billion, total notes payable, long-term debt and capital lease obligations of $1.7 billion, $1.8 billion in available liquidity under our revolving credit facilities and up to $275.1 million in available liquidity under our trade accounts receivable securitization and uncommitted sale programs. we can offer no assurance under the uncommitted sales programs that if we attempt to draw on such programs in the future that we will receive funding from the associated banks which would require us to utilize other available sources of liquidity, including our revolving credit facilities.

net cash provided by operating activities for fiscal year 2014 was approximately $498.9 million. this resulted primarily from net income of $242.3 million, $487.3 million in non-cash depreciation and amortization expense, a $160.8 million decrease in inventories, a $83.1 million decrease in prepaid expenses and other current assets and $42.5 million in non-cash restructuring and related charges; which were partially offset by $230.9 million in non-cash gain on sale of discontinued operations, a $177.6 million decrease in accounts payable and accrued expenses and a $116.5 million increase in accounts receivable. the decrease in inventories was primarily a result of a continued focus on inventory management coupled with lower sales levels. the decrease in prepaid expenses and other current assets was primarily due to decreases in the deferred purchase price receivable under our asset-backed securitization programs due to lower levels of sales and the timing of cash funding provided by the unaffiliated conduits and financial institutions as well as decreases in advance deposits. the decrease in accounts payable and accrued expenses was primarily driven by the timing of purchases and cash payments as well as decreased salary and salary related expenses associated with headcount reductions. the increase in accounts receivable was primarily driven by the timing of sales and collections activity.
net cash provided by investing activities for fiscal year 2014 was $60.7 million. this consisted primarily of $531.2 million in proceeds from the sale of ams and the sale of our controlling financial interests in two nypro subsidiaries and $161.1 million in proceeds from the sale of property, plant and equipment, which included a one-time sale of approximately $121.9 million of equipment to a customer who allowed the equipment to remain on our premises on consignment; which were partially offset by capital expenditures of $624.1 million principally for machinery and equipment for new business within our dms segment, maintenance levels of machinery and equipment and information technology infrastructure upgrades.
net cash used in financing activities for fiscal year 2014 was $576.8 million. this resulted from our receipt of approximately $6.2 billion of proceeds from borrowings under existing debt agreements, which primarily included $6.1 billion of borrowings under the amended and restated credit facility and $100.8 million of borrowings under various credit facilities with foreign subsidiaries. this was offset by repayments in an aggregate amount of approximately $6.4 billion during fiscal year 2014, which primarily included an aggregate of $6.3 billion of repayments under the amended and restated credit facility and approximately $99.9 million of repayments under various credit facilities with foreign subsidiaries. in addition, we paid $260.3 million, including commissions, to repurchase 13,680,382 of our common shares, $68.2 million in dividends to stockholders and $34.3 million (or 1,569,059 of our common shares) to the irs on behalf of certain employees to satisfy minimum tax obligations related to the vesting of certain restricted stock awards (as consideration for these payments to the irs, we withheld $34.3 million of employee-owned common stock related to this vesting) during the fiscal year ended august 31, 2014.
sources we may need to finance day-to-day working capital needs, as well as future growth and any corresponding working capital needs, with additional borrowings under our amended and restated credit facility (which is further discussed in the following paragraphs) and our other revolving credit facilities described below, as well as additional public and private offerings of our debt and equity. currently, we have a shelf registration statement with the sec registering the potential sale of an indeterminate amount of debt and equity securities in the future, from time-to-time over the three years following the registration, to augment our liquidity and capital resources. the current shelf registration statement will expire in the first quarter of fiscal year 2015 at which time we currently anticipate filing a new shelf registration statement. any future sale or issuance of equity or convertible debt securities could result in dilution to current or future shareholders. further, we may issue debt securities that have rights and privileges senior to those of holders of ordinary shares, and the terms of this debt could impose restrictions on operations, increase debt service obligations, limit our flexibility as a result of debt service requirements and restrictive covenants, potentially negatively affect our credit ratings, and limit our ability to access additional capital or execute our business strategy. we continue to assess our capital structure and evaluate the merits of redeploying available cash to reduce existing debt or repurchase common shares.
we regularly sell designated pools of trade accounts receivable under two asset-backed securitization programs, a factoring agreement and three uncommitted trade accounts receivable sale programs (collectively referred to herein as the programs). transfers of the receivables under the programs are accounted for as sales and, accordingly, net receivables sold under the programs are excluded from accounts receivable on the consolidated balance sheets and are reflected as cash provided by operating activities on the consolidated statements of cash flows. discussion of each of the programs is included in the following paragraphs. in addition, refer to note 3  trade accounts receivable securitization and sale programs to the consolidated financial statements for further details on the programs.
also, as described in note 2  discontinued operations to the consolidated financial statements, on april 1, 2014, we completed the sale of our ams business (except for the malaysian operations due to certain regulatory approvals that are still pending in that jurisdiction) for consideration of $725.0 million, which consisted of $675.0 million in cash and an aggregate liquidation preference value of $50.0 million in senior non-convertible cumulative preferred stock of iqor that accretes dividends at an annual rate of 8 percent and is redeemable in nine years or upon a change in control. as a result of the sale, we have additional funds to finance certain of our needs.

a.   asset-backed securitization programs

we continuously sell designated pools of trade accounts receivable under our asset-backed securitization programs to special purpose entities, which in turn sell 100% of the receivables to conduits administered by unaffiliated financial institutions (for the north american asset-backed securitization program) and an unaffiliated financial institution (for the foreign asset-backed securitization program). any portion of the purchase price for the receivables which is not paid in cash upon the sale taking place is recorded as a deferred purchase price receivable, which is paid from available cash as payments on the receivables are collected. net cash proceeds up to a maximum of $200.0 million for the north american asset-backed securitization program are available at any one time. we decreased our north american asset-backed securitization programs facility limit from $300.0 million to $200.0 million during the first quarter of fiscal year 2014. the north american asset-backed securitization program was renewed on october 21, 2014 and is scheduled to expire on october 20, 2017. net cash proceeds up to a maximum of $75.0 million for the foreign asset-backed securitization program, currently scheduled to expire on may 15, 2015, are available at any one time. we decreased our foreign asset-backed securitization programs facility limit from $200.0 million to $75.0 million during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2014.
in connection with our asset-backed securitization programs, at august 31, 2014, we had sold $715.1 million of eligible trade accounts receivable, which represents the face amount of total sold outstanding receivables at that date. in exchange, we received cash proceeds of $202.1 million, and a deferred purchase price receivable. at august 31, 2014, the deferred purchase price receivable in connection with the asset-backed securitization programs totaled $513.0 million. the deferred purchase price receivable was recorded initially at fair value as prepaid expenses and other current assets on the consolidated balance sheets.
b.   trade accounts receivable factoring agreement

in connection with a factoring agreement, we transfer ownership of eligible trade accounts receivable of a foreign subsidiary without recourse to a third party purchaser in exchange for cash. proceeds from the transfer reflect the face value of the account less a discount. in april 2014, the factoring agreement was extended through september 30, 2014, at which time it was automatically renewed for an additional six-month period.
during the fiscal year ended august 31, 2014, we sold $1.1 million of trade accounts receivable and received cash proceeds of $1.1 million.
c.   trade accounts receivable sale programs

in connection with three separate trade accounts receivable sale agreements with unaffiliated financial institutions, we may elect to sell, at a discount, on an ongoing basis, up to a maximum of $350.0 million, $150.0 million and $100.0 million, respectively, of specific trade accounts receivable at any one time. the $350.0 million trade accounts receivable sale agreement is an uncommitted facility that was renewed during the first quarter of fiscal year 2014 and is scheduled to expire on november 28, 2014 (during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2014, we increased our uncommitted capacity from $150.0 million to $350.0 million). the $150.0 million trade accounts receivable sale agreement is an uncommitted facility that was entered into during the second quarter of fiscal year 2014 and is subject to expiration on august 31, 2015 as it was extended during the fourth quarter. the $100.0 million trade accounts receivable sale agreement is an uncommitted facility that was entered into during the first quarter of fiscal year 2014 and is scheduled to expire on november 1, 2014, although any party may elect to terminate the agreement upon 15 days prior notice. the agreement will be automatically extended each year for additional 365 day periods until november 1, 2018, unless any party gives no less than 30 days prior notice that the agreement should not be extended. a $200.0 million committed trade accounts receivable sale agreement was amended during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2014 to decrease the committed capacity from $200.0 million to $0.0 million. a $40.0 million uncommitted trade accounts receivable sale agreement, which we were previously party to, was terminated effective march 19, 2014.
during the fiscal year ended august 31, 2014, we sold $1.9 billion of trade accounts receivable under these programs and we received cash proceeds of $1.9 billion.

(a)         during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2009, we issued $312.0 million of seven-year, publicly-registered 7.750% notes (the 7.750% senior notes) at 96.1% of par, resulting in net proceeds of approximately
$300.0 million. the 7.750% senior notes mature on july 15, 2016 and pay interest semiannually on january 15 and july 15. also, the 7.750% senior notes are our senior unsecured obligations and rank equally with all other existing and future senior unsecured debt obligations.

(b)              during the second and third quarters of fiscal year 2008, we issued $250.0 million and $150.0 million, respectively, of ten-year, unregistered 8.250% notes at 99.965% of par and 97.5% of par, respectively, resulting in net proceeds of approximately $245.7 million and $148.5 million, respectively. on july 18, 2008, we completed an exchange whereby all of the outstanding unregistered 8.250% notes were exchanged for registered 8.250% notes (collectively the
8.250% senior notes) that are substantially identical to the unregistered notes except that the 8.250% senior notes are registered under the securities act and do not have any transfer restrictions, registration rights or rights to additional special interest.

the 8.250% senior notes mature on march 15, 2018 and pay interest semiannually on march 15 and september 15. the interest rate payable on the 8.250% senior notes is subject to adjustment from time to time if the credit ratings assigned to the 8.250% senior notes increase or decrease, as provided in the 8.250% senior notes. the 8.250% senior notes are our senior unsecured obligations and rank equally with all other existing and future senior unsecured debt obligations.
(c)              during the first quarter of fiscal year 2011, we issued $400.0 million of ten-year publicly registered 5.625% notes (the 5.625% senior notes) at par. the net proceeds from the offering of $400.0 million were used to fully repay the term portion of the credit facility dated as of july 19, 2007 (the old credit facility) and partially repay amounts outstanding under our foreign asset-backed securitization program. the 5.625% senior notes mature on december 15, 2020. interest on the 5.625% senior notes is payable semiannually on june 15 and december 15 of each year, beginning on june 15, 2011. the 5.625% senior notes are our senior unsecured obligations and rank equally with all other existing and future senior unsecured debt obligations.

(d)                  during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2012, we issued $500.0 million of ten-year publicly registered 4.700% notes (the 4.700% senior notes) at 99.992% of par. the net proceeds from the offering of $500.0
million were used to repay outstanding borrowings under our revolving amended and restated credit facility and for general corporate purposes. the 4.700% senior notes mature on september 15, 2022 and pay interest semiannually on march 15
and september 15 of each year, beginning on march 15, 2013. the 4.700% senior notes are our senior unsecured obligations and rank equally with all other existing and future senior unsecured debt obligations.

(e)        as of august 31, 2014, eight of our foreign subsidiaries have credit facilities that finance their future growth and any corresponding working capital needs. five of the credit facilities are denominated in u.s.
dollars, one is denominated in brazilian reais, one is denominated in russian rubles and one is denominated in taiwan new dollar. the credit facilities incur interest at fixed and variable rates ranging from 0.8% to 19.0%.

on july 25, 2014, we entered into the amended and restated credit facility which provides for a revolving credit facility in the initial amount of $1.5 billion. the amended and restated credit facility may, subject to lenders discretion, potentially be increased up to $2.0 billion and terminates on july 25, 2019. interest and fees on the amended and restated credit facility advances are based on our non-credit enhanced long-term senior unsecured debt rating as determined by standard & poors ratings service and moodys investors service, and interest at our current rating level is subject to a permanent reduction if we meet a certain total debt to ebitda ratio, all as more fully described in the amended and restated credit facility agreement. interest is charged at a rate equal to either 0.000% to 0.650% above the base rate or 1.000% to 1.650% above the eurocurrency rate, where the base rate represents the greatest of citibank, n.a.s base rate, 0.50% above the federal funds rate, and 1.0% above one-month libor, but not less than zero, and the eurocurrency rate represents adjusted libor or adjusted cdor, as applicable, for the applicable interest period, but not less than zero, each as more fully described in the amended and restated credit facility agreement. fees include a facility fee based on the revolving credit commitments of the lenders and a letter of
52
credit fee based on the amount of outstanding letters of credit. we, along with our subsidiaries, are subject to the following financial covenants: (1) a maximum debt to ebitda ratio (as defined in the amended and restated credit facility agreement) and (2) a minimum ratio of (a) consolidated ebitda to (b) interest payable on, and amortization of debt discount in respect of, all debt (as defined in the amended and restated credit facility agreement) and loss on sale of accounts receivable. in addition, we are subject to other covenants, such as: limitation upon liens; limitation upon mergers, etc.; limitation upon accounting changes; limitation upon subsidiary debt; limitation upon sales, etc. of assets; limitation upon changes in nature of business; payment restrictions affecting subsidiaries; limitation upon use of proceeds; compliance with laws, etc.; payment of taxes, etc.; maintenance of insurance; preservation of corporate existence, etc.; visitation rights; keeping of books; maintenance of properties, etc.; transactions with affiliates; and reporting requirements.
during fiscal year 2014, we borrowed $6.1 billion against the amended and restated credit facility under multiple draws and repaid $6.3 billion under multiple payments. in addition, during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2014, we borrowed $1.0 billion against the amended and restated credit facility under multiple draws and repaid $1.0 billion under multiple payments.
during the second quarter of fiscal year 2014, a foreign subsidiary of the company entered into an uncommitted credit facility to finance its growth and any corresponding working capital needs. the credit facility provides for a revolving credit facility in the amount of up to $100.0 million with interest charged at a rate of libor plus 1.7%.
(f)                           during the third quarter of fiscal year 2012, we entered into a master lease agreement with a variable interest entity (the vie) whereby we sell to and subsequently lease back from the vie up to $60.0
million in certain machinery and equipment for a period of up to five years. in connection with this transaction, we hold a variable interest in the vie, which was designed to hold debt obligations payable to third-party creditors. the proceeds from such debt obligations are utilized to finance the purchase of the machinery and equipment that is then leased by us. we are the primary beneficiary of the vie as we have both the power to direct the activities of the vie that most significantly impact the vies economic performance and the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits that could potentially be significant to the vie. therefore, we consolidate the financial statements of the vie and eliminate all intercompany transactions. at august 31, 2014, the vie had approximately $37.7 million of total assets, of which approximately $36.9 million was comprised of a note receivable due from us, and approximately $37.0 million of total liabilities, of which approximately $36.9 million were debt obligations to the third-party creditors (as the vie has utilized approximately $36.9 million of the $60.0 million debt obligation capacity). the third-party creditors have recourse to our general credit only in the event that we default on our obligations under the terms of the master lease agreement. in addition, the assets held by the vie can be used only to settle the obligations of the vie.

in addition to the loans described above, at august 31, 2014, we have borrowings outstanding to fund working capital needs. these additional loans total approximately $1.3 million, of which $0.9 million are denominated in russian rubles and $0.4 million are denominated in u.s. dollars.
(g)   during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2013, we acquired various capital lease obligations in connection with the acquisition of nypro.

(h)   this amount represents the fair value hedge accounting adjustment related to the 7.750% senior notes. for further discussion of our fair value hedges, see note 13 - derivative financial instruments and hedging activities to the consolidated financial statements

under our 7.750%, 8.250%, 5.625% and 4.700% senior notes, we are subject to covenants such as limitations on our and/or our subsidiaries ability to: consolidate or merge with, or convey, transfer or lease all or substantially all of our assets to, another person; create certain liens; enter into sale and leaseback transactions; create, incur, issue, assume or guarantee funded debt (which only applies to our restricted subsidiaries); and guarantee any of our indebtedness (which only applies to our subsidiaries). we are also subject to a covenant requiring our repurchase of our 7.750%, 8.250%, 5.625% or 4.700% senior notes upon a change of control repurchase event.
the asset-backed securitization programs require compliance with several covenants. the north american asset-backed securitization program covenants include compliance with the interest coverage ratio and debt to ebitda ratio of the amended and restated credit facility. the foreign asset-backed securitization program covenants include limitations on certain corporate actions such as mergers and consolidations. at august 31, 2014 and 2013, we were in compliance with all covenants under the amended and restated credit facility, respectively and our securitization programs.
uses on october 17, 2013, january 22, 2014, april 17, 2014, and july 23, 2014, our board of directors approved payment of a quarterly dividend of $0.08 per share to shareholders of record as of november 15, 2013, february 14, 2014, may 15, 2014, and august 15, 2014, respectively. of the total cash dividend declared on october 17, 2013 of $17.2 million, $16.5 million was paid on december 2, 2013. of the total cash dividend declared on january 22, 2014 of $17.0 million, $16.3 million was paid on march 3, 2014. of the total cash dividend declared on april 17, 2014 of $16.7 million, $16.0 million was paid on june 2, 2014. of the total cash
53
dividend declared on july 23, 2014 of $16.3 million, $15.6 million was paid on september 2, 2014. the remaining $0.7 million that was not paid during each quarter is related to dividend equivalents on unvested restricted stock units that will be payable at the time the awards vest. we currently expect to continue to declare and pay regular quarterly dividends of an amount similar to our past declarations. however, the declaration and payment of future dividends are discretionary and will be subject to determination by our board of directors each quarter following its review of our financial performance.
in december 2013, our board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to $200.0 million of our common shares during the twelve month period following their authorization. we repurchased 10.7 million shares during the fiscal year ended august 31, 2014, which utilized the entire $200.0 million authorized by the board of directors.
in july 2014, our board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to an additional $100.0 million of our common shares during the twelve month period following their authorization. we repurchased 3.0 million shares during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2014, which utilized approximately $60.0 million of the $100.0 million authorized by our board of directors. in addition, following the end of fiscal year 2014, we repurchased 2.0 million shares for approximately $40.0 million, which utilized the remaining amount outstanding of the $100.0 million authorized by our board of directors.
our working capital requirements and capital expenditures could continue to increase in order to support future expansions of our operations through construction of greenfield operations or acquisitions. it is possible that future expansions may be significant and may require the payment of cash. future liquidity needs will also depend on fluctuations in levels of inventory and shipments, changes in customer order volumes and timing of expenditures for new equipment.
at august 31, 2014, we had approximately $1.0 billion in cash and cash equivalents. as our growth remains predominantly outside of the united states, a significant portion of such cash and cash equivalents are held by our foreign subsidiaries. we estimate that approximately $808.8 million of the cash and cash equivalents held by our foreign subsidiaries could not be repatriated to the united states without potential income tax consequences.
we intend to repatriate the nypro pre-acquisition undistributed foreign earnings of approximately $221.2 million to our u.s. operations. therefore, we recorded a deferred tax liability of approximately $77.8 million based on the anticipated u.s. income taxes of the repatriation. we intend to indefinitely reinvest the remaining earnings from our foreign subsidiaries.
for discussion of our cash management and risk management policies see quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk.
we currently anticipate that during the next 12 months, our capital expenditures will be in the range of $350.0 million to $450.0 million, principally for maintenance levels of machinery and equipment, information technology infrastructure upgrades and investments to support ongoing growth in our dms operations. we believe that our level of resources, which include cash on hand, (recently increased due to our receipt of proceeds from the sale of our ams business on april 1, 2014), available borrowings under our revolving credit facilities, additional proceeds available under our trade accounts receivable securitization programs and potentially available under our uncommitted trade accounts receivable sale programs and funds provided by operations, will be adequate to fund these capital expenditures, the payment of any declared quarterly dividends, any potential acquisitions and our working capital requirements for the next 12 months.
our $200.0 million north american asset-backed securitization program was renewed on october 21, 2014 and is scheduled to expire on october 20, 2017 and our $75.0 million foreign asset-backed securitization program is scheduled to expire on may 15, 2015. we may be unable to renew either of these programs. the $350.0 million trade accounts receivable sale agreement is an uncommitted facility that was renewed during the first quarter of fiscal year 2014 and is scheduled to expire on november 28, 2014. the $150.0 million trade accounts receivable sale agreement is an uncommitted facility that was entered into during the second quarter of fiscal year 2014 and is subject to expiration on august 31, 2015 as it was extended during the fourth quarter. the $100.0 million trade accounts receivable sale agreement is an uncommitted facility that was entered into during the first quarter of fiscal year 2014 and is scheduled to expire on november 1, 2014, although any party may elect to terminate the agreement upon 15 days prior notice. the agreement will be automatically extended each year for additional 365 day periods until november 1, 2018, unless any party gives no less than 30 days prior notice that the agreement should not be extended. a $40.0 million uncommitted trade accounts receivable sale agreement, which we were previously party to, was terminated effective march 19, 2014. we can offer no assurance under the uncommitted sales programs that if we attempt to sell receivables under such programs in the future that we will receive funding from the associated banks which would require us to utilize other available sources of liquidity, including our revolving credit facilities.
should we desire to consummate significant additional acquisition opportunities or undertake significant additional expansion activities, our capital needs would increase and could possibly result in our need to increase available borrowings under our revolving credit facilities or access public or private debt and equity markets. there can be no assurance, however, that we would be successful in raising additional debt or equity on terms that we would consider acceptable. see risk factors  our amount of debt could significantly increase in the future.

contractual obligations our contractual obligations for short and long-term debt arrangements and capital lease obligations; future interest on notes payable, long-term debt and capital lease obligations; future minimum lease payments under non-cancelable operating lease arrangements; non-cancelable purchase order obligations for property, plant and equipment; pension and postretirement contributions and payments and capital commitments as of august 31, 2014 are summarized below. while, as disclosed below, we have certain non-cancelable purchase order obligations for property, plant and equipment, we generally do not enter into non-cancelable purchase orders for materials until we receive a corresponding purchase commitment from our customer. non-cancelable purchase orders do not typically extend beyond the normal lead time of several weeks at most. purchase orders beyond this time frame are typically cancelable.

(a)   the above table excludes a $4.5 million fair value adjustment related to the former interest rate swap on the 7.750% senior notes.

(b)   certain of our notes payable, long-term debt and capital lease obligations pay interest at variable rates. in the contractual obligations table above, we have elected to apply estimated interest rates to determine the value of these future interest payments.

(c)   consists of purchase commitments entered into as of august 31, 2014 for property, plant and equipment pursuant to legally enforceable and binding agreements.

(d)   includes the estimated company contributions to funded pension plans during fiscal year 2015 and the expected benefit payments for unfunded pension and postretirement plans from fiscal years 2015 through 2024. these future payments are not recorded on the consolidated balance sheets but will be recorded as incurred.

(e)   during the first quarter of fiscal year 2009, we committed $10.0 million to an independent private equity limited partnership which invests in companies that address resource limits in energy, water and materials
(commonly referred to as the cleantech sector). of that amount, we have invested $9.1 million as of august 31, 2014.

(f)   at august 31, 2014, we have $1.3 million and $87.6 million recorded as a current and a long-term liability, respectively, for uncertain tax positions. we are not able to reasonably estimate the timing of payments, or the amount by which our liability for these uncertain tax positions will increase or decrease over time, and accordingly, this liability has been excluded from the above table.

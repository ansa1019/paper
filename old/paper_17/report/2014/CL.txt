item 1a.    risk factors set forth below is a summary of the material risks to an investment in our securities.  these risks are not the only ones we face. additional risks not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also have an adverse effect on us. if any of the below risks actually occur, our business, results of operations, cash flows or financial condition could be materially and adversely impacted, which might cause the value of our securities to decline.
we face risks associated with significant international operations, including exposure to foreign currency fluctuations.
we operate on a global basis with approximately 80% of our net sales originating in markets outside the u.s. while geographic diversity helps to reduce our exposure to risks in any one country or part of the world, it also means that we are subject to the full range of risks associated with significant international operations, including, but not limited to:
▪   changes in exchange rates for foreign currencies, which may reduce the u.s. dollar value of revenues, profits and cash flows we receive from non-u.s. markets or increase our supply costs, as measured in u.s. dollars, in those markets,
▪   exchange controls and other limits on our ability to import raw materials or finished product or to repatriate earnings from overseas,
▪   political or economic instability, social or labor unrest or changing macroeconomic conditions in our markets, including as a result of volatile commodity prices, including the price of oil,
▪   lack of well-established or reliable legal systems in certain countries where we operate,
▪   foreign ownership restrictions and the potential for nationalization or expropriation of property or other resources, and
▪   other foreign or domestic legal and regulatory requirements, including those resulting in potentially adverse tax consequences or the imposition of onerous trade restrictions, price controls, labor laws, profit controls or other government controls.
these risks could have a significant impact on our ability to sell our products on a competitive basis in international markets and may adversely affect our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.
in an effort to minimize the impact on earnings of foreign currency rate movements, we engage in a combination of selling price increases, where permitted, sourcing strategies, cost-containment measures and selective hedging of foreign currency transactions. however, these measures may not succeed in offsetting any negative impact of foreign currency rate movements on our business and results of operations.

for example, the company's ability to manage its venezuelan operations has been and will continue to be negatively impacted by difficult conditions in venezuela, including the significant devaluations of the venezuelan bolivar that occurred in 2010 and in february 2013 and the effective devaluations that occurred in 2014 as a result of the introduction of a multi-tier foreign exchange system in 2014. since april 2012, when price controls affecting most of our venezuelan subsidiary's ("cp venezuela") product portfolio became effective, we have not been able to implement price increases without government approval, which has limited our ability to offset the effects of continuing high inflation and the impact of currency devaluations. in addition, labor laws limit our ability to manage overhead costs and, at times, production at cp venezuela has been negatively impacted by local labor issues. going forward, additional government actions, including in the form of further currency devaluations or effective devaluations or continued or worsening import authorization controls, foreign exchange, price or profit controls or expropriation or other form of government take-over could have further adverse impacts on our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition, as could economic instability resulting from the decline in the price of oil. for additional information regarding these and other risks associated with our operations in venezuela, refer to part ii, item 7 "management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations - executive overview and outlook" and note 14, venezuela to the consolidated financial statements.
significant competition in our industry could adversely affect our business.
we face vigorous competition worldwide, including from local competitors and other large, multinational companies, some of which have greater resources than we do. we face this competition in several aspects of our business, including, but not limited to, the pricing of products, promotional activities, new product introductions and expansion into new geographies. such competition also extends to administrative and legal challenges of product claims and advertising. our ability to compete also depends on the strength of our brands and on our ability to defend our patent, trademark and trade dress rights against legal challenges brought by competitors.
we may be unable to anticipate the timing and scale of such initiatives or challenges by competitors or to successfully counteract them, which could harm our business. in addition, the cost of responding to such initiatives and challenges, including management time, out-of-pocket expenses and price reductions, may affect our performance in the relevant period. a failure to compete effectively could adversely affect our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.
our business is subject to legal and regulatory risks in the u.s. and abroad.
our business is subject to extensive legal and regulatory requirements in the u.s. and abroad. such legal and regulatory requirements apply to most aspects of our products, including their development, ingredients, manufacture, packaging, labeling, storage, transportation, distribution, export, import, advertising and sale. u.s. federal authorities, including the u.s. food and drug administration (the "fda"), the federal trade commission, the consumer product safety commission and the environmental protection agency, regulate different aspects of our business, along with parallel authorities at the state and local levels and comparable authorities overseas. also, our selling practices are regulated by competition law authorities in the u.s. and abroad.
new or more stringent legal or regulatory requirements, or more restrictive interpretations of existing requirements, could adversely impact our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.  for example, from time to time, various regulatory authorities and consumer groups in europe, the u.s. and other countries request or conduct reviews of the use of various ingredients in consumer products. triclosan, an ingredient used by us primarily in colgate total toothpaste and certain other oral care products, is an example of an ingredient that has undergone reviews by various regulatory authorities worldwide. triclosan is currently being evaluated under the european union's regulation for the registration, evaluation, authorization and restriction of chemicals (reach), which requires the registration of all covered chemicals used in the european union by 2018. in the u.s., the fda is evaluating the use of benzalkoniam chloride (an ingredient used in certain of our hand soap products) and triclosan in hand soaps and hand sanitizers. in 2014, a law banning the sale of certain products containing triclosan was passed in minnesota, but the law does not cover colgate total toothpaste. similar legislation has been proposed in iowa, new york and michigan, while legislation seeking to ban the sale of all consumer products containing triclosan has been proposed in chicago, illinois. environment canada, the federal environmental authority in canada, is also conducting a review to assess human and environmental risks of triclosan and is expected to issue its final assessment in march 2015. depending on the findings in the final assessment, it is possible that environment canada will issue voluntary or mandatory risk management measures for triclosan. a decision by a regulatory or governmental authority that triclosan, or any other of our ingredients, should not be used in certain consumer products or should otherwise be newly regulated, could adversely impact our business, as could negative reactions by our consumers, trade customers or non-governmental organizations to our use of such ingredients. additionally, an inability to develop new or reformulated products containing alternative ingredients or to obtain regulatory approval of such products on a timely basis could likewise adversely affect our business.
5
because of our extensive international operations, we could be adversely affected by violations of the u.s. foreign corrupt practices act (the "fcpa") and similar worldwide anti-bribery laws. the fcpa and similar worldwide anti-bribery laws generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to government officials or other third parties for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. while our policies mandate compliance with these anti-bribery laws, we cannot provide assurance that our internal control policies and procedures will always protect us from reckless or criminal acts committed by our employees, joint-venture partners or agents. violations of these laws, or allegations of such violations, could disrupt our business and adversely affect our reputation and our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.
while it is our policy and practice to comply with all legal and regulatory requirements applicable to our business, a finding that we are in violation of, or out of compliance with, applicable laws or regulations could subject us to civil remedies, including fines, damages, injunctions or product recalls, or criminal sanctions, any of which could adversely affect our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. even if a claim is unsuccessful, is without merit or is not fully pursued, the negative publicity surrounding such assertions regarding our products, processes or business practices could adversely affect our reputation and brand image. for information regarding our legal and regulatory matters, see item 3 "legal proceedings" and note 13, commitments and contingencies to the consolidated financial statements.
uncertain global economic conditions and disruptions in the credit markets may adversely affect our business.
uncertain global economic conditions could adversely affect our business. recent global economic trends pose challenges to our business and could result in declining revenues, profitability and cash flows. although we continue to devote significant resources to support our brands, during periods of economic uncertainty consumers may switch to economy brands, which could reduce sales volumes of our products or result in a shift in our product mix from higher margin to lower margin product offerings. additionally, retailers may increase pressure on our selling prices or increase promotional activity for lower-priced or value offerings as they seek to maintain sales volumes and margins.
while we currently generate significant cash flows from ongoing operations and have access to global credit markets through our various financing activities, a disruption in the credit markets could limit the availability of credit. recent and proposed changes in the bank regulatory environment could reduce the ability of financial institutions to extend credit or increase the cost we are charged to receive credit. reduced access to credit or increased costs could adversely affect our liquidity and capital resources or significantly increase our cost of capital. in addition, if any financial institutions that hold our cash or other investments or that are parties to our revolving credit facilities supporting our commercial paper program or other financing arrangements, such as interest rate or foreign exchange hedging instruments, were to declare bankruptcy or become insolvent, they may be unable to perform under their agreements with us. this could leave us with reduced borrowing capacity or unhedged against certain interest rate or foreign currency exposures. in addition, tighter credit markets may lead to business disruptions for certain of our suppliers, contract manufacturers or trade customers which could, in turn, adversely impact our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.
increasing dependence on key retailers in developed markets, changes in the policies of our retail trade customers and the emergence of new sales channels may adversely affect our business.
our products are sold in a highly competitive global marketplace which has experienced increased trade concentration and the growing presence of large-format retailers and discounters. with the growing trend toward retail trade consolidation, we are increasingly dependent on key retailers, and some of these retailers, including large-format retailers, may have greater bargaining strength than we do. they may use this leverage to demand higher trade discounts, allowances or slotting fees, which could lead to reduced sales or profitability.
we may also be negatively affected by changes in the policies of our retail trade customers, such as inventory de-stocking, limitations on access to shelf space, delisting of our products, environmental or sustainability initiatives and other conditions. for example, a determination by a key retailer that any of our ingredients should not be used in certain consumer products could adversely impact our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. in addition, private label products sold by retail trade chains, which are typically sold at lower prices than branded products, are a source of competition for certain of our product lines, including liquid hand soaps and shower gels. the emergence of new sales channels, such as sales via e-commerce, may affect consumer preferences and market dynamics and could also adversely impact our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.

the growth of our business depends on the successful identification, development and launch of innovative new products.
our growth depends on the continued success of existing products as well as the successful identification, development and launch of innovative new products and line extensions. the identification, development and introduction of innovative new products and line extensions involve considerable costs, and any new product or line extension may not generate sufficient customer and consumer interest and sales to become a profitable product or to cover the costs of its development and promotion. our ability to achieve a successful launch of a new product or line extension could be adversely affected by preemptive actions taken by competitors in response to the launch, such as increased promotional activities and advertising. in addition, our ability to create new products and line extensions and to sustain existing products is affected by whether we can successfully:
▪   identify, develop and fund technological innovations,
▪   obtain and maintain necessary patent and trademark protection and avoid infringing intellectual property rights of others,
▪   obtain approvals and registrations of regulated products, including from the fda and other regulatory bodies in the u.s. and abroad, and
▪   anticipate and respond to consumer needs and preferences.
the failure to develop and launch successful new products could hinder the growth of our business and any delay in the development or launch of a new product could result in us not being the first to market, which could compromise our competitive position and adversely affect our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.
if, in the course of identifying or developing new products, we are found to have infringed the trademark, trade secret, copyright, patent or other intellectual property rights of others, directly or indirectly, through the use of third-party ideas or technologies, such a finding could adversely affect our ability to develop innovative new products and adversely affect our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. even if we are not found to infringe on a third party's intellectual property rights, claims of infringement could adversely affect us, including by increasing costs and by delaying the launch of new products.
we may not realize the benefits that we expect from our 2012 restructuring program.
in the fourth quarter of 2012, we commenced a four-year global growth and efficiency program for sustained growth, which was expanded in the fourth quarter of 2014 to take advantage of additional savings opportunities (as expanded, the "2012 restructuring program"). the 2012 restructuring program's initiatives are expected to help us ensure continued and solid worldwide growth in unit volume, organic sales and earnings per share and enhance our global leadership positions in our core businesses. the successful implementation of the remainder of the 2012 restructuring program presents significant organizational challenges and in many cases requires successful negotiations with third parties, including labor organizations, suppliers and other business partners. as a result, we may not be able to continue to realize the anticipated benefits from the 2012 restructuring program. events and circumstances, such as financial or strategic difficulties, delays and unexpected costs may occur that could result in our not realizing all of the anticipated benefits or our not realizing the anticipated benefits on our expected timetable. if we are unable to realize the anticipated savings of the 2012 restructuring program, our ability to fund other initiatives and enhance profitability may be adversely affected. any failure to implement the 2012 restructuring program in accordance with our expectations could adversely affect our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. for additional information regarding the 2012 restructuring program, refer to part ii, item 7 "management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations - executive overview and outlook" and "- restructuring and related implementation charges."

volatility in material and other costs and our increasing dependence on key suppliers could adversely impact our profitability.
raw and packaging material commodities such as resins, pulp, essential oils, tropical oils, tallow, poultry, corn and soybeans are subject to wide price variations. increases in the costs and availability of these commodities and the costs of energy, transportation and other necessary services may adversely affect our profit margins if we are unable to pass along any higher costs in the form of price increases or otherwise achieve cost efficiencies, such as in manufacturing and distribution. in addition, our move to global suppliers for materials and other services in order to achieve cost reductions and simplify our business has resulted in an increasing dependence on key suppliers. for certain key materials, including the triclosan used in colgate total toothpaste, we use single-source suppliers. in addition, for certain materials, new suppliers may have to be qualified under industry, governmental and colgate standards, which can require additional investment and take a significant period of time. while we believe that the supplies of raw materials needed to manufacture our products are adequate, global economic conditions, supplier capacity constraints, climatic events such, as droughts or hurricanes, and other factors could affect the availability of, or prices for, those raw materials, and an interruption in their supply could adversely affect our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.
damage to our reputation could have an adverse effect on our business.
maintaining our strong reputation with consumers and our trade partners globally is critical to selling our branded products. accordingly, we devote significant time and resources to programs designed to protect and preserve our reputation, such as our ethics and compliance, sustainability, brand protection and product safety, regulatory and quality initiatives.
in addition, third parties sell counterfeit versions of our products, which are inferior or may pose safety risks. as a result, consumers of our brands could confuse our products with these counterfeit products, which could cause them to refrain from purchasing our brands in the future and in turn could impair our brand equity and adversely affect our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.
similarly, adverse publicity about us, our brands or our ingredients regarding health concerns, legal or regulatory proceedings, environmental impacts, including packaging, energy and water use and waste management, or other sustainability issues, whether or not deserved, could jeopardize our reputation. in addition, negative posts or comments about us on any social media web site could harm our reputation. damage to our reputation or loss of consumer confidence in our products for these or any other reasons could adversely affect our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition, as well as require resources to rebuild our reputation.
our business is subject to product liability, false advertising and consumer fraud claims.
from time to time, we may be subject to product liability claims alleging, among other things, that our products cause damage to property or persons, provide inadequate instructions or warnings regarding their use or contain design or manufacturing defects or contaminants. in addition, from time to time, we may be subject to claims from competitors and consumers, including consumer class actions, alleging that our product claims are deceptive or that our ingredient or content labeling is defective. regardless of their merit, these claims can require significant time and expense to investigate and defend. for example, as described in item 3 "legal proceedings," we have been named in product liability actions alleging that certain talc products we sold prior to 1996 were contaminated with asbestos, causing harm to consumers. in addition, if one of our products, or a raw material contained in our products, is perceived or found to be defective or unsafe, we may need to recall some of our products. whether or not a product liability, false advertising or consumer fraud claim is successful, or a recall is required, such assertions could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition, and the negative publicity surrounding them could harm our reputation and brand image.

there is no guarantee that our ongoing efforts to reduce costs will be successful.
we develop investments needed to support growth through our continuous, company-wide initiatives to lower costs and increase effective asset utilization, which we refer to as our funding-the-growth initiatives. these initiatives are designed to reduce costs associated with direct materials, indirect expenses and distribution and logistics. the achievement of our funding-the-growth targets depends on our ability to successfully identify and realize additional savings opportunities. events and circumstances, such as financial or strategic difficulties, delays and unexpected costs may occur that could result in our not realizing all of the anticipated benefits or our not realizing the anticipated benefits on our expected timetable. if we are unable to realize the anticipated savings of our funding-the-growth initiatives, our ability to fund other initiatives and enhance profitability may be adversely affected. any failure to implement our funding-the-growth initiatives in accordance with our expectations could adversely affect our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. for additional information regarding our funding-the-growth initiatives, refer to part ii, item 7 "management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations - executive overview and outlook."
our business is subject to the risks inherent in global manufacturing and sourcing activities.
we are engaged in manufacturing and sourcing of products and materials on a global scale. we are subject to the risks inherent in such activities, including, but not limited to:
▪   industrial accidents or other occupational health and safety issues,
▪   environmental events,
▪   strikes and other labor disputes,
▪   disruptions in logistics,
▪   loss or impairment of key manufacturing sites,
▪   raw material and product quality or safety issues,
▪   the impact on our suppliers of tighter credit or capital markets, and
▪   natural disasters, including climatic events and earthquakes, acts of war or terrorism and other external factors over which we have no control.
while we have business continuity and contingency plans in place for key manufacturing sites and the supply of raw materials, significant disruption of manufacturing for any of the above reasons could interrupt product supply and, if not remedied, have an adverse impact on our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.
a breach of information security, a cyber-security incident or a failure of a key information technology system could adversely impact our business or reputation.
we rely extensively on information technology systems, including some which are managed, hosted, provided and/or used by third parties and their vendors, in order to conduct our business.  our uses of these systems include, but are not limited to:
▪   communicating within the company and with other parties,
▪   ordering and managing materials from suppliers,
▪   converting materials to finished products,
▪   receiving and processing orders from and shipping products to our customers,
▪   marketing products to consumers,
9
▪   collecting and storing customer, consumer, employee, investor and other stakeholder information and personal data,
▪   processing transactions, including but not limited to employee payroll and employee benefits,
▪   hosting, processing and sharing confidential and proprietary research, business plans and financial information,
▪   complying with legal, regulatory or tax requirements,
▪   providing data security, and
▪   handling other processes involved in managing our business.
although we have network security measures in place, our information technology systems have been, and will likely continue to be, subject to computer viruses or other malicious codes, unauthorized access attempts, phishing and other cyber-attacks. to date, we have seen no material impact on our business or operations from these attacks; however, we cannot guarantee that our security efforts will prevent breaches or breakdowns of our or our third-party service providers' databases or systems. if we suffer a loss or disclosure of confidential business or stakeholder information as a result of a breach of our information technology systems, including those of third-party service providers with whom we have contracted, we may suffer reputational, competitive, and/or business harm, incur significant costs and be subject to government investigations, civil litigation, fines and/or damages, which may adversely impact our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. furthermore, while we have disaster recovery and business continuity plans in place, if the systems are damaged or cease to function properly for any reason, including the poor performance, failure or cyber-attack of third-party service providers, catastrophic events, power outages, cyber-security breaches, network outages, failed upgrades or other similar events, and if the disaster recovery and business continuity plans do not effectively resolve such issues on a timely basis, we may suffer interruptions in our ability to manage or conduct business as well as reputational harm and litigation, which may adversely impact our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.
our success depends upon our ability to attract and retain key employees and the succession of senior management.
our success largely depends on the performance of our management team and other key employees. if we are unable to attract and retain talented, highly qualified senior management and other key people, our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition could be adversely affected. in addition, if we are unable to effectively provide for the succession of senior management, including our chief executive officer, our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition may be adversely affected. while we follow a disciplined, ongoing succession planning process and have succession plans in place for senior management and other key executives, these do not guarantee that the services of qualified senior executives will continue to be available to us at particular moments in time.
we may acquire or divest brands or businesses, which could adversely impact our results.
we may pursue acquisitions of brands or businesses from third parties. acquisitions involve numerous risks, including difficulties in the integration of the operations, technologies, services and products of the acquired brands or businesses, estimation of and assumption of liabilities and contingencies, personnel turnover and the diversion of management's attention from other business priorities, which may adversely impact our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. in addition, we may be unable to achieve anticipated benefits or cost savings from acquisitions in the timeframe we anticipate, or at all.
moreover, acquisitions could result in substantial additional debt, exposure to contingent liabilities such as litigation or earn-out obligations, the potential impairment of goodwill or other intangible assets, or transaction costs, all of which may adversely impact our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.
we also may periodically divest brands or businesses. these divestitures may adversely impact our results of operations if we are unable to offset the dilutive impacts from the loss of revenue associated with the divested brands or businesses, or otherwise achieve the anticipated benefits or cost savings from the divestitures. in addition, businesses under consideration for or otherwise subject to divestiture may be adversely impacted prior to the divestiture, which could negatively impact our results of operations.
item 7.   management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations executive overview and outlook colgate-palmolive company seeks to deliver strong, consistent business results and superior shareholder returns by providing consumers globally with products that make their lives healthier and more enjoyable.
to this end, the company is tightly focused on two product segments: oral, personal and home care; and pet nutrition. within these segments, the company follows a closely defined business strategy to develop and increase market leadership positions in key product categories. these product categories are prioritized based on their capacity to maximize the use of the organization's core competencies and strong global equities and to deliver sustainable long-term growth.
operationally, the company is organized along geographic lines with management teams having responsibility for the business and financial results in each region. the company competes in more than 200 countries and territories worldwide with established businesses in all regions contributing to the company's sales and profitability. approximately 80% of the company's net sales are generated from markets outside the u.s., with over 50% of the company's net sales coming from emerging markets (which consist of latin america, asia (excluding japan), africa/eurasia and central europe). this geographic diversity and balance help to reduce the company's exposure to business and other risks in any one country or part of the world.
the oral, personal and home care product segment is operated through five reportable operating segments: north america, latin america, europe/south pacific, asia and africa/eurasia, all of which sell to a variety of retail and wholesale customers and distributors. the company, through hill's pet nutrition, also competes on a worldwide basis in the pet nutrition market, selling its products principally through authorized pet supply retailers and veterinarians.
on an ongoing basis, management focuses on a variety of key indicators to monitor business health and performance. these indicators include market share, net sales (including volume, pricing and foreign exchange components), organic sales growth (net sales growth excluding the impact of foreign exchange, acquisitions and divestments), gross profit margin, operating profit, net income and earnings per share, as well as measures used to optimize the management of working capital, capital expenditures, cash flow and return on capital. the monitoring of these indicators and the company's code of conduct and corporate governance practices help to maintain business health and strong internal controls.
to achieve its business and financial objectives, the company focuses the organization on initiatives to drive and fund growth. the company seeks to capture significant opportunities for growth by identifying and meeting consumer needs within its core categories, through its focus on innovation and the deployment of valuable consumer and shopper insights in the development of successful new products regionally, which are then rolled out on a global basis. to enhance these efforts, the company has developed key initiatives to build strong relationships with consumers, dental and veterinary professionals and retail customers. growth opportunities are greater in those areas of the world in which economic development and rising consumer incomes expand the size and number of markets for the company's products.
the investments needed to support growth are developed through continuous, company-wide initiatives to lower costs and increase effective asset utilization. through these initiatives, which are referred to as the company's funding-the-growth initiatives, the company seeks to become even more effective and efficient throughout its businesses. these initiatives are designed to reduce costs associated with direct materials, indirect expenses and distribution and logistics, and encompass a wide range of projects, examples of which include raw material substitution, reduction of packaging materials, consolidating suppliers to leverage volumes and increasing manufacturing efficiency through sku reductions and formulation simplification. the company also continues to prioritize its investments toward its higher margin businesses, specifically oral care, personal care and pet nutrition.

(dollars in millions except per share amounts)
as discussed in part i, item 1a "risk factors," with approximately 80% of its net sales generated outside the united states, the company is exposed to changes in economic conditions and foreign currency exchange rates, as well as political uncertainty in some countries, all of which could impact future operating results. for example, as discussed in detail below, the operating environment in venezuela is challenging, with economic uncertainty fueled by currency devaluations, high inflation and the decline in the price of oil, and governmental restrictions in the form of import authorization controls, currency exchange and payment controls, price and profit controls and the possibility of expropriation of property or other resources. price controls, which became effective in april 2012, affect most products in the portfolio of the company's venezuelan subsidiary ("cp venezuela") and restrict the company's ability to implement price increases without government approval, which has limited the company's ability to offset the effects of continuing high inflation and the impact of currency devaluations. in particular, the company has been and will continue to be impacted as a result of the significant devaluations of the venezuelan bolivar that occurred in 2010 and in february 2013, and the effective devaluations that have occurred in 2014 as a result of the introduction of a multi-tier foreign exchange system implemented during the first quarter of 2014. in addition, the decline in the price of oil may result in a reduced availability of u.s. dollars to fund cp venezuela's imports.
during the first quarter of 2014, the venezuelan government enacted several changes to venezuela's foreign exchange regime, introducing a multi-tier foreign exchange system creating three exchange rate mechanisms available to convert venezuelan bolivares to u.s. dollars. although the official exchange rate, as determined by the national center for foreign commerce ("cencoex"), remained at 6.30 bolivares per dollar, the exchange rate for foreign investments moved to the rate available on the sicad i (supplementary system for the administration of foreign currency) currency market. the venezuelan government also introduced an alternative currency market known as sicad ii. the company remeasures the financial statements of cp venezuela at the end of each month at the rate at which it expects to remit future dividends which, based on the advice of legal counsel, is the sicad i rate.
during the year ended december 31, 2014, the company incurred net pretax losses of $327 ($214 aftertax losses or $0.23 per diluted common share) related to the remeasurement of cp venezuela's local currency-denominated net monetary assets at the quarter-end sicad i rate for each of the first three quarters of 2014. the sicad i rate did not revalue during the fourth quarter of 2014 and remained at 12.00 bolivares per dollar as of december 31, 2014. included in the net remeasurement losses during 2014 were charges related to the devaluation-protected bonds issued by the venezuelan government and held by cp venezuela. because the official exchange rate remained at 6.30 bolivares per dollar, the devaluation-protected bonds did not revalue at the rate available on the sicad i currency market but remained at the official exchange rate which resulted in an impairment in the fair value of the bonds. the net remeasurement losses incurred in 2014 are referred to as the "2014 venezuela remeasurements."
there continue to be ongoing impacts primarily related to the translation of the local financial statements and, to a lesser degree, the import of materials at the sicad i exchange rate as some imports may still qualify for the official rate. because the sicad i market is auction-based and auctions are held periodically during each quarter, the exchange rate available through sicad i may vary throughout the year which would cause additional remeasurements of cp venezuela's local currency-denominated net monetary assets and further impact cp venezuela's ongoing results.
cp venezuela continues to be able to settle certain of its u.s. dollar obligations for imported materials at the official rate of 6.30 bolivares per dollar and records the gains related to such transactions when the funds are authorized by cencoex and the liabilities are paid.
as part of the announcements during the first quarter of 2014, the venezuelan government also issued a new law on fair pricing, establishing a maximum profit margin of 30%. the new law does not apply to products that are subject to price controls, which includes most of the products in cp venezuela's portfolio. during the third quarter of 2014, the venezuelan government approved price increases for the majority of cp venezuela's product portfolio, which were implemented in the fourth quarter of 2014.
18
(dollars in millions except per share amounts)
during the year ended december 31, 2013, the company incurred a pretax loss of $172 ($111 aftertax loss or $0.12 per diluted common share) related to the remeasurement of cp venezuela's local currency-denominated net monetary assets at the date of the devaluation that changed the official exchange rate from 4.30 to 6.30 bolivares per dollar (the "2013 venezuela remeasurement"). the 2014 venezuela remeasurements and the 2013 venezuela remeasurement are referred to together as the "venezuela remeasurements."
cp venezuela funds its requirements for imported goods through a combination of u.s. dollars obtained from cencoex and intercompany borrowings. cp venezuela's supply of u.s. dollars to fund imports has been limited and sporadic. cp venezuela was invited to participate in the sicad i currency market during the second and fourth quarters of 2014 and received less than $1 in each of those quarters at a rate of 10.50 bolivares per dollar and 12.00 bolivares per dollar, respectively. although accessible to the company, the company did not participate in the sicad ii currency market during 2014. cp venezuela's difficulty in accessing u.s. dollars to support its operations has had and is expected to continue to have an adverse effect on the business. additionally, at times, production at cp venezuela has also been negatively impacted by labor issues within the country.
for the year ended december 31, 2014, cp venezuela represented approximately 3% of the company's consolidated net sales and approximately 1% of the company's consolidated operating profit excluding the impacts of the 2014 venezuela remeasurements, charges related to the 2012 restructuring program and certain european competition law matters and the sale of land in mexico (discussed below). at december 31, 2014, cp venezuela's local currency-denominated net monetary asset position, which would be subject to remeasurement in the event of further changes in the sicad i rate, was $549. this amount includes the devaluation-protected bonds issued by the venezuelan government. cp venezuela's local currency-denominated non-monetary assets were $310 at december 31, 2014 and included $235 of fixed assets that could be subject to impairment if cp venezuela is not able to implement further price increases to offset the impacts of continued high inflation or further devaluations, or if it does not have sufficient access to u.s. dollars to fund imports.
in february 2015, the venezuelan government announced changes in venezuela's foreign exchange regime. while the official exchange rate, as determined by cencoex, remains at 6.30 bolivares per dollar and the sicad i market (now known as sicad) is unchanged and the rate currently remains at 12.00 bolivares per dollar, the sicad ii market, discussed above, has been eliminated and a new, alternative currency market, the foreign exchange marginal system ("simadi"), has been created with a floating exchange rate determined by market participants. the simadi market became operational with an initial exchange rate of 170.04 bolivares per dollar. while the company will continue to assess the impact, if any, of these changes as the government of venezuela issues regulations to implement them, if cp venezuela is unable to obtain sufficient u.s. dollars from cencoex or the sicad market to fund its requirements for imported goods and instead needs to access the simadi market, it could significantly impact the company's operations in venezuela.
the company continues to actively manage its investment in and limit its exposure to venezuela. the company's business in venezuela, and the company's ability to repatriate its earnings, continue to be negatively affected by the difficult conditions described above. additional devaluations or the imposition of additional or more stringent controls on foreign currency exchange, pricing, payments, profits or imports or other governmental actions or continued or increased labor unrest would further negatively affect the company's business in venezuela and the company's ability to effectively make key operational decisions in regard to its venezuelan operations, both of which could result in an impairment of the company's investment in cp venezuela. at december 31, 2014, the company's total investment in cp venezuela was $955, which included intercompany payables of cp venezuela.
in the fourth quarter of 2012, the company commenced a four-year global growth and efficiency program for sustained growth. the program's initiatives are expected to help the company ensure continued solid worldwide growth in unit volume, organic sales and earnings per share and enhance its global leadership positions in its core businesses.

on october 23, 2014, the company's board of directors approved an expansion of the global growth and efficiency program (as expanded, the "2012 restructuring program"). the initiatives under the 2012 restructuring program continue to be focused on the following areas:
▪   expanding commercial hubs
▪   extending shared business services and streamlining global functions
▪   optimizing global supply chain and facilities the board authorized the expansion of the 2012 restructuring program to take advantage of additional savings opportunities identified in all three areas.
cumulative pretax charges related to the 2012 restructuring program, once all phases are approved and implemented, are estimated to be $1,285 to $1,435 ($950 to $1,050 aftertax). implementation of the 2012 restructuring program is expected to be substantially completed by december 31, 2016. savings, substantially all of which are expected to increase future cash flows, are projected to be approximately $405 to $475 pretax ($340 to $390 aftertax) annually by the fourth year of the program. in 2014, 2013 and 2012, the company incurred aftertax costs of $208, $278 and $70, respectively, associated with the 2012 restructuring program. for more information regarding the 2012 restructuring program, see "restructuring and related implementation charges" below.
on september 13, 2011, the company's mexican subsidiary entered into an agreement to sell to the united states of america (the "purchaser") the mexico city site on which its commercial operations, technology center and soap production facility were located. the sale price is payable in three installments, with the final installment due upon the transfer of the property, which is subject to the company's satisfaction of certain closing conditions relating to site preparation by march 20, 2015. while these conditions are not expected to be fully satisfied by march 20, 2015, in which case the purchaser has several options under the agreement (including termination and the return to it of the first two installment payments), based on the transaction to date, the company believes that the transfer of the property is likely to occur in 2015. the company has reinvested the first two installments to relocate its soap production to a new state-of-the-art facility at its mission hills, mexico site, to relocate its commercial and technology operations within mexico city and to prepare the existing site for transfer. exit costs incurred during the project primarily relate to staff leaving indemnities, accelerated depreciation and demolition to make the site building-ready.
in 2014, 2013 and 2012, the company incurred aftertax costs of $3, $12 and $18, respectively, related to the sale of land in mexico and, in 2012, the company incurred aftertax costs of $14 associated with various business realignment and other cost-saving initiatives.
looking forward, the company expects global macroeconomic and market conditions to remain highly challenging. while the global marketplace in which the company operates has always been highly competitive, the company continues to experience heightened competitive activity in certain markets from local competitors and other large multinational companies, some of which have greater resources than the company does. such activities have included more aggressive product claims and marketing challenges, as well as increased promotional spending and geographic expansion. additionally, the company continues to experience volatile foreign currency fluctuations and high raw and packaging material costs, driven by foreign exchange transaction costs. while the company has taken, and will continue to take, measures to mitigate the effect of these conditions, should they persist, they could adversely affect the company's future results.
the company believes it is well prepared to meet the challenges ahead due to its strong financial condition, experience operating in challenging environments and continued focus on the company's strategic initiatives: engaging to build our brands; innovation for growth; effectiveness and efficiency; and leading to win. this focus, together with the strength of the company's global brand names, its broad international presence in both mature and emerging markets and initiatives, such as the 2012 restructuring program, should position the company well to increase shareholder value over the long term.

restructuring and related implementation charges
2012 restructuring program in the fourth quarter of 2012, the company commenced the 2012 restructuring program. the program's initiatives are expected to help colgate ensure continued solid worldwide growth in unit volume, organic sales and earnings per share and enhance its global leadership positions in its core businesses.
the 2012 restructuring program is expected to produce significant benefits in the company's long-term business performance. the major objectives of the program include:
▪   becoming even stronger on the ground through the continued evolution and expansion of proven global and regional commercial capabilities, which have already been successfully implemented in a number of the company's operations around the world.
▪   simplifying and standardizing how work gets done by increasing technology-enabled collaboration and taking advantage of global data and analytic capabilities, leading to smarter and faster decisions.
▪   reducing structural costs to continue to increase the company's gross and operating profit.
▪   building on colgate's current position of strength to enhance its leading market share positions worldwide and ensure sustained sales and earnings growth.
on october 23, 2014, the company's board of directors approved an expansion of the 2012 restructuring program. the initiatives under the 2012 restructuring program continue to be focused on the following areas:
▪   expanding commercial hubs - building on the success of this structure already implemented in several divisions, continuing to cluster single-country subsidiaries into more efficient regional hubs, in order to drive smarter and faster decision making, strengthen capabilities available on the ground and improve cost structure.
▪   extending shared business services and streamlining global functions - implementing the company's shared service organizational model, already successful in europe, in all regions of the world. initially focused on finance and accounting, these shared services will be expanded to additional functional areas to streamline global functions.
▪   optimizing global supply chain and facilities - continuing to optimize manufacturing efficiencies, global warehouse networks and office locations for greater efficiency, lower cost and speed to bring innovation to market.
the board authorized the expansion of the 2012 restructuring program to take advantage of additional savings opportunities identified in all three areas.
cumulative pretax charges related to the 2012 restructuring program, once all phases are approved and implemented, are estimated to be $1,285 to $1,435 ($950 to $1,050 aftertax). implementation of the 2012 restructuring program is expected to be substantially completed by december 31, 2016. these pretax charges are currently estimated to be comprised of the following categories: employee-related costs, including severance, pension and other termination benefits (50%); asset-related costs, primarily incremental depreciation and asset impairments (10%); and other charges, which include contract termination costs, consisting primarily of implementation-related charges resulting directly from exit activities (20%) and the implementation of new strategies (20%). anticipated pretax charges for 2015 are expected to amount to approximately $330 to $385 ($245 to $285 aftertax). over the course of the 2012 restructuring program, it is currently estimated that approximately 75% of the charges will result in cash expenditures.

it is expected that the cumulative pretax charges, once all projects are approved and implemented, will relate to initiatives undertaken in north america (15%), europe/south pacific (20%), latin america (5%), asia (5%), africa/eurasia (5%), hill's pet nutrition (10%) and corporate (40%), which includes substantially all of the costs related to the implementation of new strategies, noted above, on a global basis. it is expected that, by the end of 2016, the 2012 restructuring program will contribute a net reduction of approximately 2,000-2,500 positions from the company's global employee workforce.
savings from the 2012 restructuring program, substantially all of which are expected to increase future cash flows, are projected to be in the range of $405 to $475 pretax ($340 to $390 aftertax) annually by the fourth year of the program. savings in 2015 are expected to amount to approximately $80 to $100 pretax ($60 to $75 aftertax).

employee-related costs primarily include severance and other termination benefits and are calculated based on long-standing benefit practices, local statutory requirements and, in certain cases, voluntary termination arrangements. employee-related costs also include pension and other retiree benefit enhancements amounting to $5, $17 and $0 for the years ended december 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively, which are reflected as charges against assets within employee-related costs in the preceding tables, as the corresponding balance sheet amounts are reflected as a reduction of pension assets or an increase in pension and other retiree benefit liabilities (see note 10, retirement plans and other retiree benefits to the consolidated financial statements).
incremental depreciation is recorded to reflect changes in useful lives and estimated residual values for long-lived assets that will be taken out of service prior to the end of their normal service period. asset impairments are recorded to write down assets held for sale or disposal to their fair value based on amounts expected to be realized. charges against assets within asset impairments are net of cash proceeds pertaining to the sale of certain assets.
other charges consist primarily of charges resulting directly from exit activities and the implementation of new strategies as a result of the 2012 restructuring program. these charges for the years ended december 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012 included third-party incremental costs related to the development and implementation of new business and strategic initiatives of $65, $50 and $8, respectively, and contract termination costs and charges resulting directly from exit activities of $40, $34 and $3, respectively, directly related to the 2012 restructuring program. these charges were expensed as incurred. also included in other charges for the years ended december 31, 2014 and 2013 are other exit costs of $82 and $25, respectively, related to the consolidation of facilities. other charges for the year ended december 31, 2013 also included a curtailment charge of $91 related to changes to the company's u.s. defined benefit retirement plans (see note 10, retirement plans and other retiree benefits to the consolidated financial statements).

liquidity and capital resources the company expects cash flow from operations and debt issuances will be sufficient to meet foreseeable business operating and recurring cash needs (including for debt service, dividends, capital expenditures, costs related to the 2012 restructuring program and stock repurchases). the company believes its strong cash generation and financial position should continue to allow it broad access to global credit and capital markets.
cash flow net cash provided by operations was $3,298 in 2014, compared to $3,204 in 2013 and $3,196 in 2012. net cash provided by operations for 2014 increased due to strong operating earnings and a continued tight focus on working capital. the increase in 2013 as compared to 2012 was primarily due to strong operating earnings and a continued tight focus on working capital, partially offset by higher cash spending related to the 2012 restructuring program.
the company defines working capital as the difference between current assets (excluding cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities, the latter of which is reported in other current assets) and current liabilities (excluding short-term debt). the company's working capital as a percentage of net sales was 0.8% and 0.7% in 2014 and 2013, respectively.
approximately 75% of total program charges related to the 2012 restructuring program, estimated to be $1,285 to $1,435 pretax ($950 to $1,050 aftertax), are expected to result in cash expenditures. savings from the 2012 restructuring program are projected to be in the range of $405 to $475 pretax ($340 to $390 aftertax) annually by the fourth year of the program, substantially all of which are expected to increase future cash flows. the anticipated pretax charges for 2015 are expected to amount to approximately $330 to $385 ($245 to $285 aftertax) and savings in 2015 are expected to amount to approximately $80 to $100 pretax ($60 to $75 aftertax). it is anticipated that cash requirements for the 2012 restructuring program will be funded from operating cash flows. approximately 60% of the restructuring accrual at december 31, 2014 is expected to be paid before year end 2015.
investing activities used $859 of cash in 2014, compared to $890 and $865 during 2013 and 2012, respectively. purchases of marketable securities and investments decreased in 2014 to $340 from $505 in 2013 partially due to a decrease in purchases of investments by the company's subsidiary in venezuela of local currency-denominated fixed interest rate bonds issued by the venezuelan government. in 2012, the company acquired the remaining interest in tom's of maine for $18. in 2011, the company's mexican subsidiary entered into an agreement to sell the mexico city site on which its commercial operations, technology center and soap production facility were located. during 2011 and 2012, the company received the first and second installments of $24 and $36, respectively, related to the sale of land in mexico. the final installment of $60 is due upon transfer of the property, which is subject to the company's satisfaction of certain closing conditions relating to site preparation by march 20, 2015. while these conditions are not expected to be fully satisfied by march 20, 2015, in which case the purchaser has several options under the agreement (including termination and the return to it of the first two installment payments), based on the transaction to date, the company believes that the transfer of the property is likely to occur in 2015. capital expenditures were $757, $670 and $565 for 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. the company continues to focus its capital spending on projects that are expected to yield high aftertax returns. capital expenditures for 2015 are expected to remain at an annual rate of approximately 4.5% of net sales, which is higher than the historical rate of approximately 3.5% primarily due to the 2012 restructuring program.
financing activities used $2,170 of cash during 2014 compared to $2,142 and $2,301 during 2013 and 2012, respectively. the increase in cash used in 2014 as compared to 2013 was primarily due to higher principal payments on debt and higher dividends paid, which were partially offset by higher proceeds from the issuances of debt. the decrease in cash used in 2013 as compared to 2012 was primarily due to a lower level of share repurchases, partially offset by higher dividends paid and lower proceeds from exercises of stock options.

long-term debt, including the current portion, increased to $6,132 as of december 31, 2014, as compared to $5,644 as of december 31, 2013 and total debt increased to $6,148 as of december 31, 2014 as compared to $5,657 as of december 31, 2013. the company's debt issuances support its capital structure strategy objectives of funding its business and growth initiatives while minimizing its risk-adjusted cost of capital. during the fourth quarter of 2014, the company issued $134 of forty-year notes at a variable rate. during the first quarter of 2014, the company issued $500 of five-year notes at a fixed rate of 1.75% and $500 of ten-year notes at a fixed rate of 3.25%. during the fourth quarter of 2013, the company issued $300 of five-year notes at a fixed rate of 1.50% and $82 of forty-year notes at a variable rate. during the second quarter of 2013, the company issued $400 of five-year notes at a fixed rate of 0.90% and $400 of ten-year notes at a fixed rate of 2.10%. during the third quarter of 2012, the company issued $500 of ten-year notes at a fixed rate of 1.95% and during the second quarter of 2012, the company issued $500 of ten-year notes at a fixed rate of 2.30%. the debt issuances in 2014, 2013 and 2012 were u.s. dollar denominated and were under the company's shelf registration statement. proceeds from the debt issuances in the first and fourth quarters of 2014 were used for general corporate purposes which included the retirement of commercial paper borrowings. proceeds from the debt issuance in the first quarter of 2014 were also used to repay and retire $250 of u.s. dollar denominated notes and €250 of euro denominated notes, both of which became due in the second quarter of 2014. proceeds from the debt issuances in the second and fourth quarters of 2013 were used for general corporate purposes which included the retirement of commercial paper borrowings. proceeds from the debt issuance in the second quarter of 2013 were also used to repay and retire $250 of notes due in 2013. proceeds from the debt issuances in the second and third quarters of 2012 were used for general corporate purposes which included the retirement of commercial paper borrowings.
at december 31, 2014, the company had access to unused domestic and foreign lines of credit of $3,001 (including under the facilities discussed below) and could also issue medium-term notes pursuant to an effective shelf registration statement. in november 2011, the company entered into a five-year revolving credit facility with a capacity of $1,850 with a syndicate of banks. this facility was extended for an additional year in 2012 and again in 2013. in 2014, the company entered into an amendment of this facility whereby the facility was extended for an additional year to november 2019 and the capacity of the facility was increased to $2,370. the company also has the ability to draw $165 from a revolving credit facility that expires in november 2015. in addition, the company has the ability to draw $20 from a new credit facility entered into during 2014, which expires in december 2015. commitment fees related to the credit facilities are not material.
domestic and foreign commercial paper outstanding was $255 and $0 as of december 31, 2014 and december 31, 2013, respectively. the average daily balances outstanding for commercial paper in 2014 and 2013 were $1,486 and $1,736, respectively. the company classifies commercial paper and certain current maturities of notes payable as long-term debt when it has the intent and ability to refinance such obligations on a long-term basis, including, if necessary, by utilizing its line of credit that expires in november 2019.
the following is a summary of the company's commercial paper and global short-term borrowings as of december 31, 2014 and 2013:

certain of the facilities with respect to the company's bank borrowings contain financial and other covenants as well as cross-default provisions. noncompliance with these requirements could ultimately result in the acceleration of amounts owed. the company is in full compliance with all such requirements and believes the likelihood of noncompliance is remote. see note 6, long-term debt and credit facilities to the consolidated financial statements for further information about the company's long-term debt and credit facilities.
dividend payments in 2014 were $1,446, an increase from $1,382 in 2013 and $1,277 in 2012. dividend payments increased to $1.42 per share in 2014 from $1.33 per share in 2013 and $1.22 per share in 2012. in the first quarter of 2014, the company's board of directors increased the quarterly common stock cash dividend to $0.36 per share from $0.34 per share, effective in the second quarter of 2014.

the company repurchases shares of its common stock in the open market and in private transactions to maintain its targeted capital structure and to fulfill certain requirements of its compensation and benefit plans. the share repurchase program approved by the board of directors on september 8, 2011 (the "2011 program") authorized the repurchase of up to 50 million shares of the company's common stock. the board authorized that the number of shares remaining under the 2011 program as of may 15, 2013 be increased by 100% as a result of the two-for-one stock split of the company's common stock in 2013. the board also has authorized share repurchases on an ongoing basis to fulfill certain requirements of the company's compensation and benefit programs.
on february 19, 2015, the board authorized the repurchase of shares of the company's common stock having an aggregate purchase price of up to $5,000 under a new share repurchase program (the "2015 program"), which replaced the 2011 program. the company will commence repurchase of shares of the company's common stock under the 2015 program after february 19, 2015.
aggregate share repurchases in 2014 consisted of 21.7 million common shares under the 2011 program and 1.5 million common shares to fulfill the requirements of compensation and benefit plans, for a total purchase price of $1,530. aggregate repurchases in 2013 consisted of 24.6 million common shares under the 2011 program and 1.0 million common shares to fulfill the requirements of compensation and benefit plans, for a total purchase price of $1,521. aggregate repurchases in 2012 consisted of 37.6 million common shares under the 2011 program and 1.2 million common shares to fulfill the requirements of compensation and benefit plans, for a total purchase price of $1,943.
cash and cash equivalents increased $127 during 2014 to $1,089 at december 31, 2014, compared to $962 at december 31, 2013, most of which ($1,034 and $865, respectively) were held by the company's foreign subsidiaries. these amounts include $64 and $114 at december 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively, which are subject to currency exchange controls in venezuela, limiting the total amount of cash and cash equivalents held by the company's foreign subsidiaries that can be repatriated at any particular point in time. the company regularly assesses its cash needs and the available sources to fund these needs and, as part of this assessment, the company determines the amount of foreign earnings it intends to repatriate to help fund its domestic cash needs and provides applicable u.s. income and foreign withholding taxes on such earnings.
as of december 31, 2014, the company had approximately $4,900 of undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries for which no u.s. income or foreign withholding taxes have been provided as the company does not currently anticipate a need to repatriate these earnings. these earnings have been and currently are considered to be indefinitely reinvested outside of the u.s. and, therefore, are not subject to such taxes. should these earnings be repatriated in the future, they would be subject to applicable u.s. income and foreign withholding taxes. as the company operates in over 200 countries and territories throughout the world and due to the complexities in the tax laws and the assumptions that would have to be made, it is not practicable to determine the tax liability that would arise if these earnings were repatriated.

_______
(1)   includes the net interest payments on fixed and variable rate debt and associated interest rate swaps. interest payments associated with floating rate instruments are based on management's best estimate of projected interest rates for the remaining term of variable rate debt.
(2)   the company had outstanding contractual obligations with suppliers at the end of 2014 for the purchase of raw, packaging and other materials and services in the normal course of business. these purchase obligation amounts represent only those items which are based on agreements that are legally binding and that specify all significant terms including minimum quantity, price and term and do not represent total anticipated purchases.

long-term liabilities associated with the company's postretirement plans are excluded from the table above due to the uncertainty of the timing of these cash disbursements. the amount and timing of cash funding related to these benefit plans will generally depend on local regulatory requirements, various economic assumptions (the most significant of which are detailed in "critical accounting policies and use of estimates" below) and voluntary company contributions. based on current information, the company is not required to make a mandatory contribution to its qualified u.s. pension plan in 2015. management also does not expect to make a voluntary contribution to the u.s. pension plans for the year ending december 31, 2015. in addition, total benefit payments to be paid to participants for the year ending december 31, 2015 from the company's assets is estimated to be approximately $69.
additionally, liabilities for unrecognized income tax benefits are excluded from the table above as the company is unable to reasonably predict the ultimate amount or timing of a settlement of such liabilities. see note 11, income taxes to the consolidated financial statements for more information.
as more fully described in part i, item 3 "legal proceedings" and note 13, commitments and contingencies to the consolidated financial statements, the company is contingently liable with respect to lawsuits, environmental matters, taxes and other matters arising in the ordinary course of business.
off-balance sheet arrangements the company does not have off-balance sheet financing or unconsolidated special purpose entities.
managing foreign currency, interest rate, commodity price and credit risk exposure the company is exposed to market risk from foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates and commodity price fluctuations. volatility relating to these exposures is managed on a global basis by utilizing a number of techniques, including working capital management, selling price increases, selective borrowings in local currencies and entering into selective derivative instrument transactions, issued with standard features, in accordance with the company's treasury and risk management policies. the company's treasury and risk management policies prohibit the use of derivatives for speculative purposes and leveraged derivatives for any purpose.
the sensitivity of our financial instruments to market fluctuations is discussed below. see note 2, summary of significant accounting policies and note 7, fair value measurements and financial instruments to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of derivatives and hedging policies and fair value measurements.
foreign exchange risk as the company markets its products in over 200 countries and territories, it is exposed to currency fluctuations related to manufacturing and selling its products in currencies other than the u.s. dollar. the company manages its foreign currency exposures through a combination of cost-containment measures, sourcing strategies, selling price increases and the hedging of certain costs in an effort to minimize the impact on earnings of foreign currency rate movements. see the "results of operations" section above for discussion of the foreign exchange impact on net sales in each operating segment.
the assets and liabilities of foreign subsidiaries, other than those operating in highly inflationary environments, are translated into u.s. dollars at year-end exchange rates with resulting translation gains and losses accumulated in a separate component of shareholders' equity. income and expense items are translated into u.s. dollars at average rates of exchange prevailing during the year.
for subsidiaries operating in highly inflationary environments (currently, venezuela), local currency-denominated non-monetary assets including inventories, goodwill and property, plant and equipment are remeasured at their historical exchange rates, while local currency-denominated monetary assets and liabilities are remeasured at year-end exchange rates. remeasurement adjustments for these operations are included in net income attributable to colgate-palmolive company.

the company primarily utilizes foreign currency contracts, including forward and swap contracts, local currency deposits and local currency borrowings to hedge portions of its exposures relating to foreign currency purchases, assets and liabilities created in the normal course of business and the net investment in certain foreign subsidiaries. the duration of foreign currency contracts generally does not exceed 12 months and the contracts are valued using observable market rates.
the company's foreign currency forward contracts that qualify for cash flow hedge accounting resulted in net unrealized gains of $22 and $5 at december 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. changes in the fair value of cash flow hedges are recorded in other comprehensive income (loss) and are reclassified into earnings in the same period or periods during which the underlying hedged transaction is recognized in earnings. at the end of 2014, an unfavorable 10% change in exchange rates would have resulted in a net unrealized loss of $29.
interest rate risk the company manages its mix of fixed and floating rate debt against its target with debt issuances and by entering into interest rate swaps in order to mitigate fluctuations in earnings and cash flows that may result from interest rate volatility. the notional amount, interest payment and maturity date of the swaps generally match the principal, interest payment and maturity date of the related debt, and the swaps are valued using observable benchmark rates.
based on year-end 2014 variable rate debt levels, a 1% increase in interest rates would have increased interest (income) expense, net by $10 in 2014.
commodity price risk the company is exposed to price volatility related to raw materials used in production, such as resins, pulp, essential oils, tropical oils, tallow, poultry, corn and soybeans. the company manages its raw material exposures through a combination of cost containment measures, ongoing productivity initiatives and the limited use of commodity hedging contracts. futures contracts are used on a limited basis, primarily in the hill's pet nutrition segment, to manage volatility related to anticipated raw material inventory purchases of certain traded commodities.
the company's open commodity derivative contracts, which qualify for cash flow hedge accounting, resulted in net unrealized gains of $1 and $0 at december 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. at the end of 2014, an unfavorable 10% change in commodity futures prices would have resulted in a net unrealized loss of $2.
credit risk the company is exposed to the risk of credit loss in the event of nonperformance by counterparties to financial instrument contracts; however, nonperformance is considered unlikely and any nonperformance is unlikely to be material as it is the company's policy to contract with diverse, credit-worthy counterparties based upon both strong credit ratings and other credit considerations.
recent accounting pronouncements on may 28, 2014, the financial accounting standards board ("fasb") and the international accounting standards board ("iasb") issued their final converged standard on revenue recognition. the standard, issued as accounting standards update ("asu") no. 2014-09 "revenue from contracts with customers" by the fasb, provides a single, comprehensive revenue recognition model for all contracts with customers and supersedes current revenue recognition guidance. the revenue standard contains principles that an entity will apply to determine the measurement of revenue and timing of when it is recognized. the underlying principle is that an entity will recognize revenue to depict the transfer of goods or services to customers at an amount that the entity expects to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or services. the new standard also includes enhanced disclosures which are significantly more comprehensive than those in existing revenue standards. this new guidance is effective for the company beginning january 1, 2017, with no early adoption permitted. the standard allows for either "full retrospective" adoption, meaning the standard is applied to all of the periods presented, or "modified retrospective" adoption, meaning the standard is applied only to the most current period presented in the financial statements. while the company is currently assessing the impact of the new standard, it does not expect this new guidance to have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements.

on april 10, 2014, the fasb issued asu no. 2014-08 "reporting discontinued operations and disclosures of disposals of components of an entity." asu no. 2014-08 changes the criteria for reporting discontinued operations and modifies related disclosure requirements. the new guidance is effective for the company on a prospective basis beginning january 1, 2015. this new guidance is not expected to have a material impact on the company's consolidated financial statements.
critical accounting policies and use of estimates the preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to use judgment and make estimates. the level of uncertainty in estimates and assumptions increases with the length of time until the underlying transactions are completed. actual results could ultimately differ from those estimates. the accounting policies that are most critical in the preparation of the company's consolidated financial statements are those that are both important to the presentation of the consolidated financial statements and require significant or complex judgments and estimates on the part of management. the company's critical accounting policies are reviewed periodically with the audit committee of the board of directors.
in certain instances, accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america allow for the selection of alternative accounting methods. the company's significant policies that involve the selection of alternative methods are accounting for shipping and handling costs and inventories.
▪   shipping and handling costs may be reported as either a component of cost of sales or selling, general and administrative expenses. the company reports such costs, primarily related to warehousing and outbound freight, in the consolidated statements of income as a component of selling, general and administrative expenses. accordingly, the company's gross profit margin is not comparable with the gross profit margin of those companies that include shipping and handling charges in cost of sales. if such costs had been included in cost of sales, gross profit margin would have decreased by 770 bps, from 58.5% to 50.8% in 2014 and decreased by 750 bps and 740 bps in 2013 and 2012, respectively, with no impact on reported earnings.
▪   the company accounts for inventories using both the first-in, first-out ("fifo") method (80% of inventories) and the last-in, first-out ("lifo") method (20% of inventories). there would have been no material impact on reported earnings for 2014, 2013 or 2012 had all inventories been accounted for under the fifo method.
the areas of accounting that involve significant or complex judgments and estimates are pensions and other retiree benefit cost assumptions, stock-based compensation, asset impairments, uncertain tax positions, tax valuation allowances and legal and other contingency reserves.
▪   in pension accounting, the most significant actuarial assumptions are the discount rate and the long-term rate of return on plan assets. the discount rate used to measure the benefit obligation for u.s. defined benefit plans was 4.24%, 4.96% and 4.14% as of december 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. the discount rate used to measure the benefit obligation for other u.s. postretirement plans was 4.36%, 5.24% and 4.32% as of december 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. discount rates used for the u.s. and international defined benefit and other postretirement plans are based on a yield curve constructed from a portfolio of high-quality bonds whose projected cash flows approximate the projected benefit payments of the plans. the assumed long-term rate of return on plan assets for u.s. plans was 6.80% as of december 31, 2014, 6.80% as of december 31, 2013 and 7.30% as of december 31, 2012. as the funded status of the u.s. postretirement plans improved in 2013, the company reallocated a portion of the assets of those plans from equity securities to fixed income securities and other investments. in determining the long-term rate of return, the company considers the nature of the plans' investments and the historical rate of return.
44
(dollars in millions except per share amounts)
average annual rates of return for the u.s. plans for the most recent 1-year, 5-year, 10-year, 15-year and 25-year periods were 11%, 10%, 7%, 5%, and 8%, respectively. in addition, the current assumed rate of return for the u.s. plans is based upon the nature of the plans' investments with a target asset allocation of approximately 53% in fixed income securities, 27% in equity securities and 20% in real estate and other investments. a 1% change in the assumed rate of return on plan assets of the u.s. pension plans would impact future net income attributable to colgate-palmolive company by approximately $11. a 1% change in the discount rate for the u.s. pension plans would impact future net income attributable to colgate-palmolive company by approximately $4. a third assumption is the long-term rate of compensation increase, a change in which would partially offset the impact of a change in either the discount rate or the long-term rate of return. this rate was 3.50% as of december 31, 2014, december 31, 2013 and december 31, 2012. refer to note 10, retirement plans and other retiree benefits to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of the company's pension and other postretirement plans.
▪   the assumption requiring the most judgment in accounting for other postretirement benefits is the medical cost trend rate. the company reviews external data and its own historical trends for health care costs to determine the medical cost trend rate. the assumed rate of increase for the u.s. postretirement benefit plans is 7.0% for 2015, declining to 5.0% by 2021 and remaining at 5.0% for the years thereafter. the effect on the total of service and interest cost components of a 1% increase in the assumed long-term medical cost trend rate would decrease net income attributable to colgate-palmolive company by $7.
▪   the company recognizes the cost of employee services received in exchange for awards of equity instruments, such as stock options and restricted stock units, based on the fair value of those awards at the date of grant. the company uses the black-scholes-merton ("black-scholes") option pricing model to determine the fair value of stock option awards. the weighted-average estimated fair value of each stock option award granted in the year ended december 31, 2014 was $7.60. the black-scholes model uses various assumptions to determine the fair value of stock option awards. these assumptions include the expected term of stock option awards, expected volatility rate, risk-free interest rate and expected dividend yield. while these assumptions do not require significant judgment, as the significant inputs are determined from historical experience or independent third-party sources, changes in these inputs could result in significant changes in the fair value of stock option awards. a one-year change in term would result in a change in fair value of approximately 8%. a 1% change in volatility would change fair value by approximately 7%.
▪   goodwill and indefinite life intangible assets, such as the company's global brands, are subject to impairment tests at least annually. the company performs either a quantitative or qualitative assessment to determine the fair value of its reporting units for goodwill and fair value of its indefinite life intangible assets. the asset impairment analysis performed for both goodwill and indefinite life intangible assets requires several estimates, including future cash flows consistent with management's strategic plans, sales growth rates, foreign exchange rates and the selection of a discount rate. qualitative factors, in addition to those quantitative measures discussed above, include assessments of general macroeconomic conditions, industry-specific considerations and historical financial performance.
the estimated fair value of the company's intangible assets substantially exceeds the recorded carrying value, except for the intangible assets acquired in the sanex acquisition in 2011, which were recorded at fair value. the estimated fair value of the company's reporting units also substantially exceeds the recorded carrying value. therefore, it is not reasonably likely that significant changes in these estimates would occur that would result in an impairment charge related to these assets. asset impairment analysis related to certain fixed assets in connection with the 2012 restructuring program requires management's best estimate of net realizable values. asset impairment analysis related to the fixed assets of the company's subsidiary in venezuela requires management's best estimate of future exchange rates between the u.s. dollar and the venezuelan bolivares, the rate of inflation in venezuela, the timing and amount of future selling price increases for products sold in venezuela, whether the company has sufficient access to u.s. dollars to fund imports.

▪   the recognition and measurement of uncertain tax positions involves consideration of the amounts and probabilities of various outcomes that could be realized upon ultimate resolution.
▪   tax valuation allowances are established to reduce deferred tax assets such as tax loss carryforwards, to net realizable value. factors considered in estimating net realizable value include historical results by tax jurisdiction, carryforward periods, income tax strategies and forecasted taxable income.
▪   legal and other contingency reserves are based on management's assessment of the risk of potential loss, which includes consultation with outside legal counsel and other advisors. such assessments are reviewed each period and revised based on current facts and circumstances, if necessary. while it is possible that the company's cash flows and results of operations in a particular quarter or year could be materially affected by the impact of such contingencies, it is the opinion of management that these matters will not have a material impact on the company's financial position, or its ongoing results of operations or cash flows. refer to note 13, commitments and contingencies to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of the company's contingencies.
the company generates revenue through the sale of well-known consumer products to trade customers under established trading terms. while the recognition of revenue and receivables requires the use of estimates, there is a short time frame (typically less than 60 days) between the shipment of product and cash receipt, thereby reducing the level of uncertainty in these estimates. refer to note 2, summary of significant accounting policies to the consolidated financial statements for further description of the company's significant accounting policies.
market share information management uses market share information as a key indicator to monitor business health and performance. references to market share in this annual report on form 10-k are based on a combination of consumption and market share data provided by third-party vendors, primarily nielsen, and internal estimates. all market share references represent the percentage of the dollar value of sales of our products, relative to all product sales in the category in the countries in which the company competes and purchases data.
market share data is subject to limitations on the availability of up-to-date information. we believe that the third-party vendors we use to provide data are reliable, but we have not verified the accuracy or completeness of the data or any assumptions underlying the data. in addition, market share information calculated by the company may be different from market share information calculated by other companies due to differences in category definitions, the use of data from different countries, internal estimates and other factors.

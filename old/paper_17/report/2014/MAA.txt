item 1a. risk factors in addition to the other information contained in this annual report on form 10-k, we have identified the following additional risks and uncertainties that may have a material adverse effect on our business prospects, financial condition or results of operations. investors should carefully consider the risks described below before making an investment decision. our business faces significant risks and the risks described below may not be the only risks we face. additional risks not presently known to us or that we currently believe are immaterial may also significantly impair our business operations. if any of these risks occur, our business prospects, results of operations or financial condition could suffer, the market price of our common stock and the trading price of our debt securities could decline and you could lose all or part of your investment in our common stock or debt securities.
risks related to our real estate investments and our operations continued economic weakness following the economic recession that the u.s. economy most recently experienced may materially and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.
the u.s. economy continues to experience some weakness following a severe recession, including relatively high levels of unemployment and weak consumer spending. in addition, while the federal reserve took policy actions to promote market liquidity and encourage economic growth following the recession, such actions are now being curtailed as signs of improvement in the economy have emerged, and the impact of these monetary policy actions on the economy is uncertain. if the economic recovery slows or stalls, or if the economy experiences another recession, we may experience adverse effects on our occupancy levels, our rental revenues and the value of our properties, any of which could adversely affect our cash flow, financial condition and results of operations. we are also exposed to risks relating to the housing market recovery that has accompanied the economic recovery, to the extent that when demand for single family homes increases, demand for apartments may decline, which could adversely affect our cash flow, financial condition and results of operations.
failure to generate sufficient cash flows could limit our ability to make payments on our debt and to pay distributions to shareholders and unitholders.
our ability to make payments on our debt and to make distributions depends on our ability to generate cash flow in excess of operating costs and capital expenditure requirements and/or to have access to the markets for debt and equity financing. funds from operations and the value of our apartment communities may be insufficient because of factors that are beyond our control. such events or conditions could include:
•   competition from other apartment communities;
•   overbuilding of new apartments or oversupply of available apartments in our markets, which might adversely affect occupancy or rental rates and/or require rent concessions in order to lease apartments;
•   conversion of condominiums and single family houses to rental use or the sale of excess for-sale condominiums and single family homes;
•   weakness in the overall economy which lowers job growth and the associated demand for apartment housing;
•   increases in operating costs (including real estate taxes, utilities and insurance premiums) due to inflation and other factors, which may not be offset by increased rental rates;
•   inability to initially, or subsequently after lease terminations, rent apartments on favorable economic terms;
•   failure of development communities to be completed, if at all, within budget and on a timely basis or to lease up as anticipated;
•   changes in governmental regulations and the related costs of compliance;
•   changes in laws including, but not limited to, tax laws and housing laws including the enactment of rent control laws or other laws regulating multifamily housing;
•   withdrawal of government support of apartment financing through its financial backing of the federal national mortgage association, or the federal home loan mortgage corporation;
•   an uninsured loss, including those resulting from a catastrophic storm, earthquake, or act of terrorism;
•   changes in interest rate levels and the availability of financing, borrower credit standards, and down-payment requirements which could lead renters to purchase homes (if interest rates decrease and home loans are more readily available) or increase our acquisition and operating costs (if interest rates increase and financing is less readily available); and
•   the relative illiquidity of real estate investments.
at times, we have relied on external funding sources to fully fund the payment of distributions to shareholders and our capital investment program, including our existing property developments. while we have sufficient liquidity to permit
13
distributions at current rates through additional borrowings, if necessary, any significant and sustained deterioration in operations could result in our financial resources being insufficient to make payments on our debt and to pay distributions to shareholders at the current rate, in which event we would be required to reduce the distribution rate. any decline in our funds from operations could adversely affect our ability to make distributions to our shareholders or to meet our loan covenants and could have a material adverse effect on our stock price or the trading price of our debt securities.
our operations are concentrated in the southeast and southwest regions of the united states; we are subject to general economic conditions in the regions in which we operate.
approximately 36.7% of our portfolio is centered in our top five markets: atlanta, georgia; charlotte, north carolina; austin, texas; raleigh/durham, north carolina; and dallas, texas. our performance could be adversely affected by economic conditions in, and other factors relating to, these geographic areas, including supply and demand for apartments in these areas, zoning and other regulatory conditions and competition from other communities and alternative forms of housing. in particular our performance is disproportionately influenced by job growth and unemployment. to the extent the aforementioned general economic conditions, job growth and unemployment in any of these markets deteriorate or any of these areas experiences natural disasters, the value of the portfolio, our results of operations and our ability to make distributions to our shareholders and pay amounts due on our debt could be materially adversely affected.
substantial competition among apartment communities and real estate companies may adversely affect our rental revenues and development and acquisition opportunities.
there are numerous other apartment communities and real estate companies, many of which have greater financial and other resources than we have, within the market area of each of our communities that compete with us for residents and development and acquisition opportunities. the number of competitive apartment communities and real estate companies in these areas could have a material effect on (1) our ability to rent our apartments and the rents charged, and (2) development and acquisition opportunities. the activities of these competitors could cause us to pay a higher price for a new property than we otherwise would have paid or may prevent us from purchasing a desired property at all, which could have a material adverse effect on us and our ability to make distributions to our shareholders and pay amounts due on our debt.
we may be unable to retain key employees.
our success will depend in part upon the ability to retain our key employees. there is substantial competition for qualified personnel in the real estate industry and the loss of any of our key personnel could have an adverse effect us.
breaches of our privacy or information security systems could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial conditions and/or reputation.
the protection of customer and employee data and our network systems are critically important to us. our business requires us to use and store personally identifiable information of our customers and employees, which may include names, addresses, phone numbers, email addresses, contact preferences, tax identification numbers, and payment account information. the collection and use of personally identifiable information is governed by federal and state laws and regulations, which continue to evolve and may be inconsistent from one jurisdiction to another.
we devote significant resources to protect our customer and employee data and our network systems. however, the security measures put in place by us cannot provide absolute security and there can be no assurance that we will not suffer a data security incident in the future, that unauthorized parties will not gain access to sensitive data stored on the company's systems, that such access will not, whether temporarily or permanently, impact, interfere with or interrupt our operations, or that any such incident will be discovered in a timely manner. our information technology infrastructure could be compromised as a result of third-party security breaches, employee error, malfeasance, faulty password management, or other irregularity, and result in persons obtaining unauthorized access to company data or accounts. further, privacy and information incidents have generally increased in recent years due to the proliferation of new technologies and the increased sophistication and activities of perpetrators of cyber-attacks. in the future, the company may be required to expend additional resources to continue to enhance the company's information security measures and/or to investigate and remediate any information security vulnerabilities.
any privacy and information incident could compromise our network systems, and the information stored by us could be accessed, misused, publicly disclosed, corrupted, lost, or stolen resulting in fraud or other harm. moreover, if a data security incident or breach affects our systems or results in the unauthorized release of personally identifiable information, we could be
14
materially damaged and we may be exposed to a risk of loss or litigation and possible liability, which could result in a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and/or reputation.
we may not realize the anticipated benefits of past or future acquisitions, and the failure to integrate acquired communities and new personnel successfully could create inefficiencies.
we have selectively acquired in the past, and if presented with attractive opportunities we intend to selectively acquire in the future, apartment communities that meet our investment criteria. our acquisition activities and their success are subject to the following risks:
•   we may be unable to obtain financing for acquisitions on favorable terms or at all;
•   even if we are able to finance the acquisition, cash flow from the acquisition may be insufficient to meet our required principal and interest payments on the acquisition;
•   even if we enter into an acquisition agreement for an apartment community, we may be unable to complete the acquisition after incurring certain acquisition-related costs;
•   we may incur significant costs and divert management attention in connection with the evaluation and negotiation of potential acquisitions, including potential acquisitions that we are subsequently unable to complete;
•   when we acquire an apartment community, we may invest additional amounts in it with the intention of increasing profitability, and these additional investments may not produce the anticipated improvements in profitability; and
•   we may be unable to quickly and efficiently integrate acquired apartment communities and new personnel into our existing operations, and the failure to successfully integrate such apartment communities or personnel will result in inefficiencies that could adversely affect our expected return on our investments and our overall profitability.
we are subject to certain risks associated with selling apartment communities, which could limit our operational and financial flexibility.
we periodically dispose of apartment communities that no longer meet our strategic objectives, but adverse market conditions may make it difficult to sell apartment communities like the ones we own. we cannot predict whether we will be able to sell any property for the price or on the terms we set, or whether any price or other terms offered by a prospective purchaser would be acceptable to us. we also cannot predict the length of time needed to find a willing purchaser and to close the sale of a property. furthermore, we may be required to expend funds to correct defects or to make improvements before a property can be sold. these conditions may limit our ability to dispose of properties and to change our portfolio promptly in order to meet our strategic objectives, which may in turn have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and the market value of our securities. we are also subject to the following risks in connection with sales of our apartment communities:
•   a significant portion of the proceeds from our overall property sales may be held by intermediaries in order for some sales to qualify as like-kind exchanges under section 1031 of the code, so that any related capital gain can be deferred for federal income tax purposes. as a result, we may not have immediate access to all of the cash proceeds generated from our property sales; and
•   federal tax laws limit our ability to profit on the sale of communities that we have owned for less than two years, and this limitation may prevent us from selling communities when market conditions are favorable.
environmental problems are possible and can be costly.
under various federal, state and local laws, ordinances and regulations, a current or previous owner or operator of real estate may be liable for the costs of removal or remediation of certain hazardous or toxic substances in, on, around or under such property. such laws often impose such liability without regard to whether the owner or operator knew of, or was responsible for, the presence of such hazardous or toxic substances. the presence of, or failure to remediate properly, hazardous or toxic substances may adversely affect the owner's or operator's ability to sell or rent the affected property or to borrow using the property as collateral. persons who arrange for the disposal or treatment of hazardous or toxic substances may also be liable for the costs of removal or remediation of hazardous or toxic substances at a disposal or treatment facility, whether or not the facility is owned or operated by the person. certain environmental laws impose liability for release of asbestos-containing materials into the air, and third parties may also seek recovery from owners or operators of real property for personal injury associated with asbestos-containing materials and other hazardous or toxic substances. federal and state laws also regulate the operation and subsequent removal of certain underground storage tanks. in connection with the current or former ownership (direct or indirect), operation, management, development or control of real property, we may be considered an owner or operator of such communities or as having arranged for the disposal or treatment of hazardous or toxic substances and,
15
therefore, may be potentially liable for removal or remediation costs, as well as certain other costs, including governmental fines, and claims for injuries to persons and property.
our current policy is to obtain a phase i environmental study on each property we seek to acquire, which generally does not involve invasive techniques such as soil or ground water sampling, and to proceed accordingly. we cannot assure you, however, that the phase i environmental studies or other environmental studies undertaken with respect to any of our current or future communities will reveal:
•   all or the full extent of potential environmental liabilities;
•   that any prior owner or operator of a property did not create any material environmental condition unknown to us;
•   that a material environmental condition does not otherwise exist as to any one or more of such communities; or
•   that environmental matters will not have a material adverse effect on us and our ability to make distributions to our shareholders and pay amounts due on our debt.
certain environmental laws impose liability on a previous owner of property to the extent that hazardous or toxic substances were present during the prior ownership period. a transfer of the property does not relieve an owner of such liability. thus, we may have liability with respect to communities previously sold by our predecessors or by us.
there have been a number of lawsuits against owners and managers of multifamily communities alleging personal injury and property damage caused by the presence of mold in residential real estate. some of these lawsuits have resulted in substantial monetary judgments or settlements. insurance carriers have reacted to these liability awards by excluding mold related claims from standard policies and pricing mold endorsements separately. we have obtained a separate pollution insurance policy that covers mold-related claims and have adopted programs designed to minimize the existence of mold in any of our communities as well as guidelines for promptly addressing and resolving reports of mold. to the extent not covered by our pollution policy, the presence of mold could expose us to liability from residents and others if property damage, health concerns, or allegations thereof, arise.
losses from catastrophes may exceed our insurance coverage.
we carry comprehensive liability and property insurance on our communities and intend to obtain similar coverage for communities we acquire in the future. some losses, generally of a catastrophic nature, such as losses from floods, hurricanes or earthquakes, are subject to limitations, and thus may be uninsured. we exercise our discretion in determining amounts, coverage limits and deductibility provisions of insurance, with a view to maintaining appropriate insurance on our investments at a reasonable cost and on suitable terms. if we suffer a substantial loss, our insurance coverage may not be sufficient to pay the full current market value or current replacement value of our lost investment. inflation, changes in building codes and ordinances, environmental considerations and other factors also might make it infeasible to use insurance proceeds to replace a property after it has been damaged or destroyed.
increasing real estate taxes, utilities and insurance costs may negatively impact operating results.
as a result of our substantial real estate holdings, the cost of real estate taxes, utilities, and insuring our apartment communities is a significant component of expense. real estate taxes, utilities costs and insurance premiums are subject to significant increases and fluctuations, which can be widely outside of our control. if the costs associated with real estate taxes, utilities, and insurance should rise, our financial condition could be negatively impacted, and our ability to pay our dividends and distributions could be affected.
compliance or failure to comply with laws requiring access to our properties by disabled persons could result in substantial cost.
the americans with disabilities act, the fair housing act of 1988 and other federal, state and local laws generally require that public accommodations be made accessible to disabled persons. noncompliance could result in the imposition of fines by the government or the award of damages to private litigants. these laws may require us to modify our existing communities. these laws may also restrict renovations by requiring improved access to such buildings by disabled persons or may require us to add other structural features that increase our construction costs. legislation or regulations adopted in the future may impose further burdens or restrictions on us with respect to improved access by disabled persons. we cannot ascertain the costs of compliance with these laws, which may be substantial.
16
development and construction risks could impact our profitability.
as of december 31, 2014, we had two development communities under construction totaling 514 units. we have completed 48 units for the development projects as of december 31, 2014.  our development and construction activities are subject to the following risks:
•   we may be unable to obtain, or face delays in obtaining, necessary zoning, land-use, building, occupancy and other required governmental permits and authorizations, which could result in increased development costs, could delay initial occupancy dates for all or a portion of a development community, and could require us to abandon our activities entirely with respect to a project for which we are unable to obtain permits or authorizations;
•   yields may be less than anticipated as a result of delays in completing projects, costs that exceed budget and/or higher than expected concessions for lease up and lower rents than pro forma;
•   bankruptcy of developers in our development projects could impose delays and costs on us with respect to the development of our communities and may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations;
•   we may abandon development opportunities that we have already begun to explore, and we may fail to recover expenses already incurred in connection with exploring such opportunities;
•   we may be unable to complete construction and lease-up of a community on schedule, or incur development or construction costs that exceed our original estimates, and we may be unable to charge rents that would compensate for any increase in such costs;
•   occupancy rates and rents at a newly developed community may fluctuate depending on a number of factors, including market and economic conditions, preventing us from meeting our profitability goals for that community; and
•   when we sell to third parties communities or properties that we developed or renovated, we may be subject to warranty or construction defects that are uninsured or exceed the limit of our insurance.
risks related to our indebtedness and financing activities our substantial indebtedness could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.
as of december 31, 2014, the amount of our total debt was approximately $3.52 billion. we may incur additional indebtedness in the future in connection with, among other things, our acquisition, development and operating activities.
the degree of our leverage creates significant risks, including the following:
•   we may be required to dedicate a substantial portion of our funds from operations to servicing our debt and our cash flow may be insufficient to make required payments of principal and interest;
•   we may be subject to prepayment penalties if we elect to repay our indebtedness prior to the stated maturity date;
•   debt service obligations will reduce funds available for distribution to our shareholders and funds available for acquisitions, development and redevelopment;
•   we may be more vulnerable to economic and industry downturns than our competitors that have less debt;
•   we may be limited in our ability to respond to changing business and economic conditions; and
•   we may default on our indebtedness, which could result in acceleration of those obligations, assignment of rents and leases and loss of properties to foreclosure.
if any one of these events were to occur, our financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.
we may be unable to renew, repay or refinance our outstanding debt.
we are subject to the normal risks associated with debt financing, including the risk that our cash flow will be insufficient to meet required payments of principal and interest, the risk that indebtedness on our communities, or unsecured indebtedness, will not be able to be renewed, repaid or refinanced when due or that the terms of any renewal or refinancing will not be as favorable as the existing terms of such indebtedness. if we were unable to refinance our indebtedness on acceptable terms, or at all, we might be forced to dispose of one or more of our communities on disadvantageous terms, which might result in losses to us. such losses could have a material adverse effect on us and our ability to make distributions to our shareholders and pay amounts due on our debt. furthermore, if a property is mortgaged to secure payment of indebtedness and we are unable to meet mortgage payments, the mortgagee could foreclose upon the property, appoint a receiver and receive an assignment of rents and leases or pursue other remedies, all with a consequent loss of our revenues and asset value. foreclosures could also create taxable income without accompanying cash proceeds, thereby hindering our ability to meet the reit distribution requirements of the code.
17
rising interest rates would increase the cost of our variable rate debt.
we have incurred and expect in the future to incur indebtedness that bears interest at variable rates. accordingly, increases in interest rates would increase our interest costs, which could have a material adverse effect on us and our ability to make distributions to our shareholders and pay amounts due on our debt or cause us to be in default under certain debt instruments. in addition, an increase in market interest rates may lead holders of our shares of common stock to demand a higher yield on their shares from distributions by us, which could adversely affect the market price for our common stock.
we may incur additional debt in the future.
we currently fund the acquisition and development of multifamily apartment communities partially through borrowings (including our revolving credit facility) as well as from other sources such as sales of communities which no longer meet our investment criteria. our organizational documents do not contain any limitation on the amount of indebtedness that we may incur. accordingly, subject to limitations on indebtedness set forth in various loan agreements and the indentures governing our senior notes, we could become more highly leveraged, resulting in an increase in debt service, which could have a material adverse effect on us and our ability to make distributions to our shareholders and pay amounts due on our debt and in an increased risk of default on our obligations.
the restrictive terms of certain of our indebtedness may cause acceleration of debt payments.
at december 31, 2014, we had outstanding borrowings of approximately $3.52 billion. our indebtedness contains financial covenants as to minimum net worth, interest coverage ratios, maximum secured debt, and total debt to capital, among others. in the event that an event of default occurs, our lenders may declare borrowings under the respective loan agreements to be due and payable immediately, which could have a material adverse effect on us and our ability to make distributions to our shareholders and pay amounts due on our debt.
a change in united states government policy with regard to fannie mae and freddie mac could impact our financial condition.
fannie mae and freddie mac are a major source of financing for multifamily real estate in the united states. we utilize loan programs sponsored by these entities as one source of capital to finance our growth and our operations. on february 11, 2011, the obama administration released a report to congress which included options, among others, to gradually shrink and eventually shut down fannie mae and freddie mac. we do not know when or if fannie mae or freddie mac will restrict their support of lending to the multifamily industry or to us in particular. as of december 31, 2014, 12% of our outstanding debt was borrowed through credit facilities provided by or credit-enhanced by fannie mae with agency rate-based maturities ranging from 2015 through 2018. in 2014, we decreased the indebtedness outstanding on our fannie mae and freddie mac credit facilities from $651.8 million on december 31, 2013 to $436.9 million, including paying off all outstanding amounts on the freddie mac credit facilities, as of december 31, 2014 and added $395.8 million of unsecured senior notes. a decision by the u.s. government to eliminate or downscale fannie mae or freddie mac or to reduce government support for multifamily housing more generally may adversely affect interest rates, capital availability, development of multifamily communities and the value of multifamily residential real estate and, as a result, may adversely affect us and our growth and operations.
failure to hedge effectively against interest rates may adversely affect results of operations.
from time-to-time we may seek to manage our exposure to interest rate volatility by using interest rate hedging arrangements, such as interest rate cap agreements and interest rate swap agreements. these agreements involve risks, such as the risk that the counterparties may fail to honor their obligations under these arrangements, that these arrangements may not be effective in reducing our exposure to interest rate changes and that a court could rule that such an agreement is not legally enforceable. hedging may reduce overall returns on our investments. failure to hedge effectively against interest rate changes could have a material adverse effect on us and our ability to make distributions to our shareholders and pay amounts due on our debt.
a downgrade in our credit ratings could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
we have a significant amount of debt outstanding. we are currently assigned corporate credit ratings from each of the three ratings agencies based on their evaluation of our creditworthiness. these ratings are based on a number of factors, which
18
included their assessment of our financial strength, liquidity, capital structure, asset quality, and sustainability of cash flow and earnings. if our credit ratings are downgraded or other negative action is taken, we could be required to pay additional interest and fees on our outstanding borrowings. in addition, a downgrade may adversely impact our ability to borrow secured and unsecured debt and otherwise limit our access to capital, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
issuances of additional debt or equity may adversely impact our financial condition.
our capital requirements depend on numerous factors, including the occupancy and turnover rates of our apartment communities, development and capital expenditures, costs of operations and potential acquisitions. we cannot accurately predict the timing and amount of our capital requirements. if our capital requirements vary materially from our plans, we may require additional financing sooner than anticipated. accordingly, we could become more leveraged, resulting in increased risk of default on our obligations and in an increase in our debt service requirements, both of which could adversely affect our financial condition and ability to access debt and equity capital markets in the future. if we issue additional equity securities to obtain additional financing, the interest of our existing shareholders could be diluted.
risks related to maa's organization and ownership of its stock maa's ownership limit restricts the transferability of its capital stock.
maa's charter limits ownership of its capital stock by any single shareholder to 9.9% of the value of all outstanding shares of its capital stock, both common and preferred, unless approved by its board of directors. the charter also prohibits anyone from buying shares if the purchase would result in it losing reit status. this could happen if a share transaction results in fewer than 100 persons owning all of its shares or in five or fewer persons, applying certain broad attribution rules of the code, owning 50% or more of its shares. if you acquire shares in excess of the ownership limit or in violation of the ownership requirements of the code for reits, maa:
•   will consider the transfer to be null and void;
•   will not reflect the transaction on its books;
•   may institute legal action to enjoin the transaction;
•   will not pay dividends or other distributions with respect to those shares;
•   will not recognize any voting rights for those shares;
•   will consider the shares held in trust for its benefit; and
•   will either direct you to sell the shares and turn over any profit to maa, or maa will redeem the shares. if maa redeems the shares, you will be paid a price equal to the lesser of:
◦   the principal price paid for the shares by the holder,
◦   a price per share equal to the market price (as determined in the manner set forth in its charter) of the applicable capital stock,
◦   the market price (as so determined) on the date such holder would, but for the restrictions on transfers set forth in its charter, be deemed to have acquired ownership of the shares and
◦   the maximum price allowed under tennessee greenmail act (such price being the average of the highest and lowest closing market price for the shares during the 30 trading days preceding the purchase of such shares or, if the holder of such shares has commenced a tender offer or has announced an intention to seek control of maa, during the 30 trading days preceding the commencement of such tender offer or the making of such announcement).
the redemption price may be paid, at maa's option, by delivering one common unit (subject to adjustment from time to time in the event of, among other things, stock splits, stock dividends, or recapitalizations affecting its common stock or certain mergers, consolidations or asset transfers by maa) issued by the operating partnership for each excess share being redeemed.
if you acquire shares in violation of the limits on ownership described above:
•   you may lose your power to dispose of the shares;
•   you may not recognize profit from the sale of such shares if the market price of the shares increases; and
•   you may be required to recognize a loss from the sale of such shares if the market price decreases.
19
provisions of maa's charter and tennessee law may limit the ability of a third party to acquire control of maa.
ownership limit the 9.9% ownership limit discussed above may have the effect of precluding acquisition of control of maa by a third party without the consent of our board of directors.
preferred stock maa's charter authorizes our board of directors to issue up to 20,000,000 shares of preferred stock. the board of directors may establish the preferences and rights of any preferred shares issued. the issuance of preferred stock could have the effect of delaying or preventing someone from taking control of maa, even if a change in control were in maa shareholders' best interests. as of december 31, 2014, no shares of preferred stock were issued and outstanding.
tennessee anti-takeover statutes as a tennessee corporation, maa is subject to various legislative acts, which impose restrictions on and require compliance with procedures designed to protect shareholders against unfair or coercive mergers and acquisitions. these statutes may delay or prevent offers to acquire maa and increase the difficulty of consummating any such offers, even if maa's acquisition would be in maa shareholders' best interests.
market interest rates and low trading volume may have an adverse effect on the market value of maa's common stock.
the market price of shares of a reit may be affected by the distribution rate on those shares, as a percentage of the price of the shares, relative to market interest rates. if market interest rates increase, prospective purchasers of maa's shares may expect a higher annual distribution rate. higher interest rates would not, however, result in more funds for maa to distribute and, in fact, would likely increase maa's borrowing costs and potentially decrease funds available for distribution. this could cause the market price of maa's common stock to go down. in addition, although maa's common stock are listed on the new york stock exchange, or nyse, the daily trading volume of maa's common stock may be lower than the trading volume for other industries. as a result, maa's investors who desire to liquidate substantial holdings may find that they are unable to dispose of their shares in the market without causing a substantial decline in the market value of maa's common stock.
changes in market conditions or a failure to meet the market's expectations with regard to our results of operations and cash distributions could adversely affect the market price of maa's common stock.
we believe that the market value of a reit's equity securities is based primarily upon the market's perception of the reit's growth potential and its current and potential future cash distributions, and is secondarily based upon the real estate market value of the underlying assets. for that reason, maa's common stock may trade at prices that are higher or lower than the net asset value per share. to the extent we retain operating cash flow for investment purposes, working capital reserves or other purposes, these retained funds, while increasing the value of our underlying assets, may not correspondingly increase the market price of maa's common stock. in addition, we are subject to the risk that our cash flow will be insufficient to pay distributions to maa's shareholders. our failure to meet the market's expectations with regard to future earnings and cash distributions would likely adversely affect the market price of maa's stock.
the stock markets, including nyse, on which maa lists its common stock, have experienced significant price and volume fluctuations. as a result, the market price of maa's common stock could be similarly volatile, and investors in maa's common stock may experience a decrease in the value of their shares, including decreases unrelated to our operating performance or prospects. among the market conditions that may affect the market price of maa's publicly traded securities are the following:
•   our financial condition and operating performance and the performance of other similar companies;
•   actual or anticipated differences in our quarterly and annual operating results;
•   changes in our revenues or earnings estimates or recommendations by securities analysts;
•   publication of research reports about us or our industry by securities analysts;
•   additions and departures of key personnel;
•   inability to access the capital markets;
•   strategic decisions by us or our competitors, such as acquisitions, dispositions, spin-offs, joint ventures, strategic investments or changes in business strategy;
20
•   the issuance of additional shares of maa's common stock, or the perception that such sales may occur, including under maa's at-the-market offering programs;
•   the reputation of reits generally and the reputation of reits with portfolios similar to ours;
•   the attractiveness of the securities of reits in comparison to securities issued by other entities (including securities issued by other real estate companies);
•   an increase in market interest rates, which may lead prospective investors to demand a higher distribution rate in relation to the price paid for maa's common stock;
•   the passage of legislation or other regulatory developments that adversely affect us or our industry;
•   speculation in the press or investment community;
•   actions by institutional shareholders or hedge funds;
•   changes in accounting principles;
•   terrorist acts; and
•   general market conditions, including factors unrelated to our performance.
in the past, securities class action litigation has often been instituted against companies following periods of volatility in their stock price. this type of litigation could result in substantial costs and divert our management's attention and resources.
risks related to the operating partnership's organization and ownership of op units the operating partnership's existing unitholders have limited approval rights, which may prevent the operating partnership's sole general partner, maa, from completing a change of control transaction that may be in the best interests of all unitholders and of all the shareholders of maa.
maa may not engage in a sale or other disposition of all or substantially all of the assets of the operating partnership, dissolve the operating partnership or, upon the occurrence of certain triggering events, take any action that would result in any unitholder realizing taxable gain, without the approval of the holders of a majority of the outstanding op units held by holders other than maa or its affiliates, or class a op units. the right of the holders of our class a op units to vote on these transactions could limit maa's ability to complete a change of control transaction that might otherwise be in the best interest of all of our unitholders and all shareholders of maa.
in certain circumstances, certain of the operating partnership's unitholders must approve the operating partnership's sale of certain properties contributed by the unitholders.
in certain circumstances as detailed in the partnership agreement of the operating partnership, the operating partnership may not sell or otherwise transfer certain properties unless a specified percentage of the limited partners who were partners in the limited partnership holding such properties at the time of its acquisition by us approves such sale or transfer. the exercise of these approval rights by the operating partnership's unitholders could delay or prevent the operating partnership from completing a transaction that may be in the best interest of all of the operating partnership's unitholders and all shareholders of maa.
maa, its officers and directors have substantial influence over the operating partnership's affairs.
maa, as the operating partnership's sole general partner and acting through its officers and directors, has a substantial influence on the operating partnership's affairs. maa, its officers and directors could exercise their influence in a manner that is not in the best interest of the operating partnership's unitholders. also, maa owns approximately 94.7% of the op units and as such, will have substantial influence on the outcome of substantially all matters submitted to the operating partnership's unitholders for approval.
market interest rates and low trading volume may have an adverse effect on the market value of maa's common stock, which would affect the redemption price of the op units.
the market price of shares of a reit may be affected by the distribution rate on those shares, as a percentage of the price of the shares, relative to market interest rates. if market interest rates increase, prospective purchasers of maa's common stock may expect a higher annual distribution rate. higher interest rates would not, however, result in more funds for maa to distribute and, in fact, would likely increase maa's borrowing costs and potentially decrease funds available for distribution. this could cause the market price of maa's common stock to go down, which would reduce the price received upon redemption of any op units, or if maa so elects, the value of maa's common stock received in lieu of cash upon redemption of such op units. in addition, although maa's common stock is listed on the nyse, the daily trading volume of maa's shares may be lower than the trading volume for companies in other industries. as a result, maa's investors who desire to liquidate
21
substantial holdings may find that they are unable to dispose of their shares in the market without causing a substantial decline in the market value of the shares.
insufficient cash flow from operations or a decline in the market price of maa's common stock may reduce the amount of cash available to the operating partnership to meet its obligations.
the operating partnership is subject to the risk that its cash flow will be insufficient to service its debt and to pay distributions to its unitholders, which may cause maa to not have the funds to pay distributions to its shareholders. maa's failure to meet the market's expectations with regard to future results of operations and cash distributions would likely adversely affect the market price of its shares and thus potentially reduce maa's ability to contribute funds from issuances down to the operating partnership, resulting in a lower level of cash available for investment or to service our debt or to make distributions to the operating partnership's unitholders.
risks related to tax laws failure to qualify as a reit would cause us to be taxed as a corporation, which would significantly reduce funds available for distribution to shareholders.
if maa fails to qualify as a reit for federal income tax purposes, it will be subject to federal income tax on its taxable income at regular corporate rates (subject to any applicable alternative minimum tax). in addition, unless maa is entitled to relief under applicable statutory provisions, it would be ineligible to make an election for treatment as a reit for the four taxable years following the year in which maa loses its qualification. the additional tax liability resulting from the failure to qualify as a reit would significantly reduce or eliminate the amount of funds available for distribution to maa's shareholders. furthermore, maa would no longer be required to make distributions to its shareholders. thus, maa's failure to qualify as a reit could also impair its ability to expand its business and raise capital, and would adversely affect the value of its common stock.
maa believes that it is organized and qualified as a reit, and maa intends to operate in a manner that will allow it to continue to qualify as a reit. however, maa cannot assure you that it is qualified as a reit, or that maa will remain qualified in the future. this is because qualification as a reit involves the application of highly technical and complex provisions of the code for which there are only limited judicial and administrative interpretations and involves the determination of a variety of factual matters and circumstances not entirely within maa's control. in addition, future legislation, new regulations, administrative interpretations or court decisions may significantly change the tax laws or the application of the tax laws with respect to qualification as a reit for federal income tax purposes or the federal income tax consequences of this qualification.
even if maa qualifies as a reit, we will be subject to certain federal, state and local taxes on our income and property and on taxable income that maa does not distribute to its shareholders. in addition, maa may hold certain assets and engage in certain activities that a reit could not engage in directly through its taxable reit subsidiaries, or trss, and will be subject to federal income tax at regular corporate rates on the income of those subsidiaries.
we may incur adverse tax consequences if colonial failed to qualify as a reit for u.s. federal income tax purposes; and if that occurs, it may have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations and financial condition.
prior to the merger, colonial operated in a manner intended to allow it to qualify as a reit for u.s. federal income tax purposes under the code. as discussed in exhibit 99.1 to our current report on form 8-k filed with the sec on september 16, 2013, qualification as a reit involves the application of highly technical and complex code provisions for which there are only limited judicial and administrative interpretations and colonial's qualification as a reit prior to the merger was generally subject to the same requirements, risks and uncertainties as described in such exhibit 99.1. moreover, the complexity of these provisions and of the applicable treasury regulations that have been promulgated under the code is greater in the case of a reit that holds its assets through a partnership (such as we do and colonial did prior to the merger). the determination of various factual matters and circumstances not entirely within a reit's control may affect its ability to qualify as a reit.
if colonial is determined to have lost its reit status at any time prior to the merger, maa will face serious tax consequences and material tax liabilities. because maa owns no material assets other than its ownership interest in the operating partnership, the operating partnership and its subsidiaries would likely be required to provide cash to maa to satisfy any such tax liabilities, which would substantially reduce the operating partnership's available cash, including cash
22
available to pay its indebtedness or make distributions to its limited partners or maa's shareholders because, among other things:
•   maa would be required to pay u.s. federal income tax on colonial's prior net income at regular corporate rates for the years it did not qualify for taxation as a reit (and, for such years, colonial would not be allowed a deduction for dividends paid to its former shareholders in computing its taxable income);
•   colonial could be subject to the federal alternative minimum tax and possibly increased state and local taxes for such periods; and
•   unless colonial is entitled to relief under applicable statutory provisions, neither it nor any "successor" company could elect to be taxed as a reit until the fifth taxable year following the year during which it was disqualified.
maa is liable for any taxes payable by colonial for any periods prior to the merger. in addition, if colonial failed to qualify as a reit but we nonetheless qualified as a reit, in the event of a taxable disposition of a former colonial asset during the ten years following the merger we would be subject to corporate tax with respect to any built-in gain inherent in such asset as of the date of the merger. in addition, under the "investment company" rules under section 368 of the code, if both maa and colonial were "investment companies" under such rules, the failure of either colonial or us to have qualified as a reit could cause the merger to be taxable to us and our shareholders. as a result of all these factors, colonial's failure to have qualified as a reit could jeopardize our qualification as a reit and require our operating partnership to provide material amounts of cash to us to satisfy our additional tax liabilities and therefore have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, business and prospects and our ability to make payments on our indebtedness or distributions to our shareholders.
the operating partnership may fail to be treated as a partnership for federal income tax purposes.
we believe that the operating partnership qualifies, and has so qualified since its formation, as a partnership for federal income tax purposes and not as a publicly traded partnership taxable as a corporation. no assurance can be provided, however, that the internal revenue service, or irs, will not challenge the treatment of the operating partnership as a partnership for federal income tax purposes or that a court would not sustain such a challenge. if the irs were successful in treating the operating partnership as a corporation for federal income tax purposes, then the taxable income of the operating partnership would be taxable at regular corporate income tax rates. in addition, the treatment of the operating partnership as a corporation would cause maa to fail to qualify as a reit. see "failure to qualify as a reit would cause us to be taxed as a corporation, which would significantly reduce funds available for distribution to shareholders" above.
item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion analyzes the financial condition and results of operations of both maa and the operating partnership, of which the maa is the sole general partner and in which maa owned a 94.7% limited partner interest as of december 31, 2014. maa conducts all of its business through the operating partnership and the operating partnership's various subsidiaries.
critical accounting policies and estimates a critical accounting policy is one that is both important to our financial condition and results of operations and that involves some degree of uncertainty. the following discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto, which have been prepared in accordance with united states generally accepted accounting principles, or gaap. the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management to make a number of estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. on an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates and assumptions based upon historical experience and various other factors and circumstances. we believe that our estimates and assumptions are reasonable under the circumstances; however, actual results may differ from these estimates and assumptions.
we believe that the estimates and assumptions listed below are most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations because they require the greatest subjective determinations and form the basis of accounting policies deemed to be most critical.
acquisition of real estate assets we account for our acquisitions of investments in real estate in accordance with asc 805-10, business combinations, which requires the fair value of the real estate acquired to be allocated to the acquired tangible assets, consisting of land, building and furniture, fixtures and equipment, and identified intangible assets, consisting of the value of in-place leases and other contracts. in calculating the fair value of acquired tangible assets, management divides forecasted net operating income (noi) by a market capitalization rate. management analyzed historical stabilized noi to determine its estimate for forecasted noi. management estimates the market capitalization rate by analyzing the market capitalization rates for properties with comparable ages in similar sized markets. although management's estimates of the fair value of acquired tangible assets have been materially accurate in the past, variability of future operating performance as well as additional information becoming available could lead to the modification of the initial fair value calculation and purchase price allocation. subsequent adjustments made to the purchase price allocation, if any, would be made within the allocation period, which typically does not exceed one year.
impairment of long-lived assets, including goodwill we account for long-lived assets in accordance with the provisions of accounting standards for the impairment or disposal of long-lived assets and evaluate our goodwill for impairment under accounting standards for goodwill and other intangible assets. we evaluate goodwill for impairment on at least an annual basis, or more frequently if a goodwill impairment indicator is identified. we periodically evaluate long-lived assets, including investments in real estate and goodwill, for indicators that would suggest that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable. the judgments regarding the existence of such indicators are based on factors such as operating performance, market conditions and legal factors. if impairment indicators exist for a long-lived asset, management compares the carrying amount of the asset to an estimate of the undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset. management estimates future cash flows by analyzing historical cash flows generated by the asset. if impairment indicators exist for goodwill, management compares the carrying amount of the asset to an estimate of the implied fair value of the asset. management calculates the fair value of the asset by dividing historical operating cash flows by a market capitalization rate. management estimates the market capitalization rate by analyzing the market capitalization rates for properties with comparable ages in similar sized markets. historically, impairment analysis estimates have been materially accurate, which resulted in no impairment losses recognized during the years ended december 31, 2014, 2013, and 2012.
cost capitalization repairs and maintenance costs are expensed as incurred while significant improvements, renovations, and replacements are capitalized. the cost to complete any deferred repairs and maintenance at properties acquired by us in order to elevate the condition of the property to our standards are capitalized as incurred. the carrying costs related to development
41
projects, including interest, property taxes, insurance and allocated direct development salary cost during the construction period, are capitalized. management uses judgment in determining whether costs should be expensed or capitalized.
loss contingencies the outcomes of the claims, disputes and legal proceedings described or referenced above are subject to significant uncertainty. the company records an accrual for loss contingencies when a loss is probable and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. the company reviews these accruals quarterly and makes revisions based on changes in facts and circumstances. when a loss contingency is not both probable and reasonably estimable, the company does not accrue the loss. however, for material loss contingencies, if the unrecorded loss (or an additional loss in excess of the accrual) is at least a reasonable possibility and material, then the company discloses a reasonable estimate of the possible loss, or range of loss, if such reasonable estimate can be made. if the company cannot make a reasonable estimate of the possible loss, or range of loss, then that is disclosed.
the assessment of whether a loss is probable or a reasonable possibility, and whether the loss or range of loss is reasonably estimable, often involve a series of complex judgments about future events. among the factors that the company considers in this assessment, including with respect to the matters disclosed in this note, are the nature of existing legal proceedings and claims, the asserted or possible damages or loss contingency (if reasonably estimable), the progress of the matter, existing law and precedent, the opinions or views of legal counsel and other advisers, the company's experience in similar matters, the facts available to the company at the time of assessment, and how the company intends to respond, or has responded, to the proceeding or claim. the company's assessment of these factors may change over time as individual proceedings or claims progress. for matters where the company is not currently able to reasonably estimate a range of reasonably possible loss, the factors that have contributed to this determination include the following: (i) the damages sought are indeterminate; (ii) the proceedings are in the early stages; (iii) the matters involve novel or unsettled legal theories or a large or uncertain number of actual or potential cases or parties; and/or (iv) discussions with the parties in matters that are expected ultimately to be resolved through negotiation and settlement have not reached the point where the company believes a reasonable estimate of loss, or range of loss, can be made. in such instances, the company believes that there is considerable uncertainty regarding the timing or ultimate resolution of such matters, including a possible eventual loss or business impact, if any.

overview of the year ended december 31, 2014
as noted earlier, on october 1, 2013, we consummated the merger and acquired all of colonial's net assets. as a result of the merger, the results of operations for 2013 include twelve months of results for maa and three months of results for the legacy colonial assets. the results of operations for 2014 include twelve months of results for both the maa and colonial portfolios. our december 31, 2014 and december 31, 2013 balance sheets include the combined assets and liabilities of maa and colonial. all properties acquired from colonial have been placed in our non-same store operating segment, as the properties are recent acquisitions and had not been owned and stabilized for at least twelve months as of january 1, 2014.
we experienced an increase in income from continuing operations in 2014 as increases in revenues outpaced increases in expenses. the increases in revenues came from a 4.5% increase in our large market same store segment, a 1.8% increase in our secondary market same store segment and a 225.9% increase in our non-same store and other segment, which was primarily a result of the merger. the increase in expense came from a 2.8% increase in our large market same store segment, a 2.1% increase in our secondary market same store segment and a 227.6% increase in our non-same store and other segment, which was primarily the result of the merger. our same store portfolio represents those communities that have been held and have been stabilized for at least twelve months. communities excluded from the same store portfolio would include recent acquisitions (including the colonial portfolio), communities being developed or in lease-up, communities undergoing extensive renovations, and communities identified as discontinued operations. the drivers of these increases are discussed below in the results of operations section.
we have grown externally during the past three years by following our acquisition strategy to invest in large and mid-sized growing markets in the sunbelt region of the united states. apart from the merger, we acquired seven properties for our portfolio in 2012, four in 2013 and eight in 2014. offsetting some of this increased revenue stream were nine apartment dispositions in 2012, nine apartment dispositions in 2013, and eight apartment dispositions in 2014.

average effective monthly rent/unit, excluding lease-up and development     $948.26             $883.40             $855.71
occupancy, excluding lease-up and development                                  94.1   %            94.9   %            95.1   %
see discussion of same store average rent per unit and occupancy comparisons in the trends section below.
in addition to the multifamily assets detailed above, we also owned or owned an interest in three commercial properties totaling approximately 293,000 square feet of leasable space.
average effective monthly rent per unit is equal to the average of gross rent amounts after the effect of leasing concessions for occupied units plus prevalent market rates asked for unoccupied units, divided by the total number of units. leasing concessions represent discounts to the current market rate. we believe average effective monthly rent is a helpful measurement in evaluating average pricing. it does not represent actual rental revenue collected per unit.
the following is a discussion of our consolidated financial condition and results of operations for the years ended december 31, 2014, 2013, and 2012. this discussion should be read in conjunction with all of the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10-k.

the increase in property revenues from our same store portfolio is primarily a result of increased average effective rent per unit of 3.0%. the increase in property revenues from our non-same store and other group is primarily due to the addition of the colonial portfolio as a result of the merger, which represents $273.3 million of the increase. the remaining $66.6 million of the increase was related to acquisitions other than the merger.

the increase in property operating expenses from our same store portfolio is primarily a result of increases in real estate taxes of $3.9 million and utilities expenses of $1.3 million, offset by a decrease in insurance expenses of $1.0 million. the increase in property operating expenses from our non-same store and other group is primarily due to the addition of the colonial portfolio as a result of the merger, which represents $106.9 million of the increase. the remaining $27.4 million of the increase was related to acquisitions other than the merger.

the increase in depreciation and amortization expense from our same store portfolio resulted from capital spending made during the ordinary course of business. the increase in depreciation and amortization expense from our non-same store and other group is primarily due to the addition of the colonial portfolio as a result of the merger.
property management expenses property management expenses for the year ended december 31, 2014 were approximately $32.1 million, an increase of $9.0 million from the year ended december 31, 2013. the majority of the increase was related to increases in payroll expenses of $3.0 million, state franchise taxes of $2.7 million, software maintenance of $2.1 million, and incentive bonuses of $0.9 million as a result of the increased headcount and scope of work resulting from the merger.
general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses for the year ended december 31, 2014 were approximately $20.9 million, an increase of $5.3 million from the year ended december 31, 2013. the majority of the increase was related to increases in incentive bonuses of $3.3 million and payroll expenses of $1.2 million as a result of the increased headcount resulting from the merger.
44
merger and integration related expenses merger related expenses, primarily severance, legal, and professional costs for the acquisition of colonial were approximately $3.2 million for the year ended december 31, 2014, a decrease of $29.3 million from the year ended december 31, 2013. we also incurred integration related expenses, primarily related to temporary systems, staffing, and facilities costs of $8.4 million for the year ended december 31, 2014, an increase of $3.3 million from the year ended december 31, 2013.
interest expense interest expense for the year ended december 31, 2014 was approximately $119.5 million, an increase of $43.5 million from the year ended december 31, 2013. the increase was primarily the result of an increase in our average debt outstanding from the year ended december 31, 2013 to the year ended december 31, 2014 of approximately $1.38 billion, due primarily to the assumption of colonial's debt as a result of the merger.
debt extinguishment loss on debt extinguishment for the year ended december 31, 2014 was approximately $2.6 million, an increase of $2.2 million from the year ended december 31, 2013. the increase was primarily the result of the prepayment of a loan for a property sold during the year ended december 31, 2014.
discontinued operations we recorded a gain on sale of discontinued operations of $5.4 million for the year ended december 31, 2014 as compared to a $76.8 million gain for the year ended december 31, 2013. the decrease in the gain is caused by the proceeds received in 2014 being less than the proceeds received in 2013 in relation to the net book value of the properties sold and, in accordance with newly adopted asu 2014-08, recording a gain on sale of depreciable assets excluded from discontinued operations in 2014, which is discussed further below.
dispositions of depreciable real estate assets excluded from discontinued operations we recorded a gain on sale of depreciable assets excluded from discontinued operations of $42.6 million for the year ended december 31, 2014. we did not record a similar gain for the year ended december 31, 2013 because we did not dispose of any properties that were excluded from discontinued operations.
net income attributable to noncontrolling interests net income attributable to noncontrolling interests for the year ended december 31, 2014 was approximately $8.3 million, an increase of $4.3 million from the year ended december 31, 2013. this increase is primarily due to the increase in op unitholders as a result of the merger.
net income attributable to maa primarily as a result of the items discussed above, net income attributable to maa increased by approximately $32.7 million in the year ended december 31, 2014 from the year ended december 31, 2013.

the increase in depreciation and amortization expense from our same store portfolio resulted from asset additions made during the normal course of business. the increase in depreciation and amortization expense from our non-same store and other group is primarily due to the addition of the colonial portfolio as a result of the merger.
general and administrative expenses general and administrative expense for the year ended december 31, 2013 was approximately $15.6 million, an increase of $1.8 million from the year ended december 31, 2012. the majority of the increase was related to an increase in tax preparation fees, audit fees, and stock incentives.
merger and integration related expenses merger related expenses for the acquisition of colonial were approximately $32.4 million for the year ended december 31, 2013. we also incurred integration related expenses of $5.1 million for the year ended december 31, 2013. there were no merger related expenses or integration related expenses for the year ended december 31, 2012.
interest expense interest expense for the year ended december 31, 2013 was approximately $75.9 million, an increase of $18.0 million from the year ended december 31, 2012. the increase was primarily the result of an increase in our average debt outstanding of $451.6 million from the year ended december 31, 2012 to the year ended december 31, 2013, due primarily to the assumption of colonial's debt as a result of the merger.
discontinued operations income from discontinued operations before gain on sale for the year ended december 31, 2013 was approximately $5.1 million, a decrease of $1.9 million from the year ended december 31, 2012. the decrease is driven by the fact that the properties sold in 2013 had lower net income than the properties sold in 2012.
we recorded a gain on sale of discontinued operations of $76.8 million and $41.6 million for the years ended december 31, 2013 and december 31, 2012, respectively. the increase in the gain is caused by the proceeds being greater than the net book value of the properties in 2013 compared to 2012.
net income attributable to noncontrolling interests net income attributable to noncontrolling interests for the year ended december 31, 2013 was approximately $4.0 million, an decrease of $0.6 million from the year ended december 31, 2012.
net income attributable to maa primarily as a result of the foregoing, net income attributable to maa increased by approximately $10.1 million in the year ended december 31, 2013 from the year ended december 31, 2012.

funds from operations funds from operations, or ffo, represents net income (computed in accordance with gaap) excluding extraordinary items, net income attributable to noncontrolling interest, asset impairment, gains or losses on disposition of real estate assets, plus depreciation and amortization of real estate, and adjustments for joint ventures to reflect ffo on the same basis. disposition of real estate assets includes sales of discontinued operations.
ffo should not be considered as an alternative to net income or any other gaap measurement of performance, as an indicator of operating performance or as an alternative to cash flow from operating, investing, and financing activities as a measure of liquidity. we believe that ffo is helpful to investors in understanding our operating performance because its calculation excludes depreciation and amortization expense on real estate assets. we believe that gaap historical cost depreciation of real estate assets is generally not correlated with changes in the value of those assets, whose value does not diminish predictably over time, as historical cost depreciation implies. our calculation of ffo may differ from the methodology for calculating ffo utilized by other reits and, accordingly, may not be comparable to such other reits.
core ffo represents ffo excluding certain non-cash or non-routine items such as acquisition, merger and integration expenses, mark-to-market debt adjustments and loss or gain on debt extinguishment. while our definition of core ffo is similar to others in our industry, our precise methodology for calculating core ffo may differ from that utilized by other reits and, accordingly, may not be comparable to such other reits. core ffo should not be considered as an alternative to net income. maa believes that core ffo is helpful in understanding our operating performance in that it removes certain items that by their nature are not comparable over periods and therefore tend to obscure actual operating performance.

ffo for the year ended december 31, 2014 increased approximately $173.1 million from the year ended december 31, 2013 primarily as a result of the increase in total property revenues of $355.0 million discussed above that was partially offset by the $139.0 million increase in property operating expenses, the $43.5 million of increased interest expense, the $9.0 million of increased property management expenses, and the $5.3 million of increased general and administrative expenses.
ffo for the year ended december 31, 2013 increased approximately $34.7 million from the year ended december 31, 2012 primarily as a result of the increase in property revenues of $159.1 million discussed above that was partially offset by the $59.2 million increase in property operating expenses, the $32.4 million of merger related expenses, and the $18.0 million of increased interest expense.
core ffo for the year ended december 31, 2014 increased approximately $133.4 million from the year ended december 31, 2013 primarily as a result of the increase in total property revenues of $355.0 million discussed above that was partially offset by the $139.0 million increase in property operating expenses, the $43.5 million of increased interest expense, the $9.0 million of increased property management expenses, and the $5.3 million of increased general and administrative expenses.
core ffo for the year ended december 31, 2013 increased by approximately $64.6 million from the year ended december 31, 2012 primarily as a result of the increase in total property revenues of $159.1 million discussed above that was partially offset by the $59.2 million increase in property operating expenses and the $18.0 million of increased interest expense.
trends during the twelve months ended december 31, 2014, demand for apartments was strong, as it was during the twelve months ended december 31, 2013. this strength was evident on two fronts: same store average physical occupancy during the twelve months ended december 31, 2014 was strong, ending the year at 95.5% occupancy and averaging 95.3% for the year; while same store effective rent per unit continued to grow, up 3.3% in the twelve months ended december 31, 2014 as compared to the twelve months ended december 31, 2013. in addition, effective rent was up 4.0% for the month of december 2014 as compared to the month of december 2013.
an important part of our portfolio strategy is to maintain a broad diversity of markets across the sunbelt region of the united states. the diversity of markets tends to mitigate exposure to economic issues in any one geographic market or area. we believe that a well-diversified portfolio, including both large and select secondary markets, will perform well in "up" cycles as well as weather "down" cycles better. as of december 31, 2014, we were invested in approximately 49 defined metropolitan statistical areas, with approximately 64% of our multifamily assets, based on gross assets, in large markets and 36% of our multifamily assets in select secondary markets.
new supply of rental units has increased in several key markets and multifamily permitting increased in 2014. we believe this permitting will ultimately lead to a further increase in supply but also believe the lack of new apartments in recent years combined with demand from new households will help keep supply and demand in balance. also, we believe that more sustainable credit terms for residential mortgages should work to favor rental demand at existing multi-family properties. competition from condominiums reverting back to rental units, or new condominiums being converted to rental, has not been a major factor in our portfolio because most of our submarkets have not been primary areas for condominium development. we have found the same to be true for rental competition from single family homes. we have avoided committing a significant amount of capital to markets or submarkets where most of the excessive inflation in house prices occurred. we saw significant rental competition from condominiums or single family houses in only a few of our submarkets. long term, we expect demographic trends (including the growth of prime age groups for rentals and immigration and population movement to the southeast and southwest) will continue to build apartment rental demand for our markets.
our focus is on maintaining strong physical occupancy while increasing pricing where possible through our revenue management system. as noted above, physical occupancy ended the year strong and also averaged nearly 60 basis points better in 2014 as compared to 2013. as we continue into the typically slower winter leasing season, the level of physical occupancy puts us in a good position to maximize pricing in the first quarter of 2015.
we continue to develop improved products, operating systems and procedures that we believe enable us to capture more revenues. the continued benefit of ancillary services (such as our cable saver and deposit saver programs), improved collections and utility reimbursements enable us to capture increased revenue. we also actively work on improving processes and products to reduce expenses, such as new web-sites and internet access for our residents that enable them to transact their business with us more simply and effectively.

liquidity and capital resources our cash flows from operating, investing, and financing activities, as well as general economic and market conditions, are the principal factors affecting our liquidity and capital resources. the significant changes in cash from the year ended december 31, 2013 to the year ended december 31, 2014 due to operating, investing, and financing activities are as follows:
operating activities net cash flow provided by operating activities increased to $384.1 million for the year ended december 31, 2014 from $258.4 million for the year ended december 31, 2013. this change was a result of various items, including higher revenue as discussed above.
investing activities net cash used in investing activities increased to $203.8 million for the year ended december 31, 2014 from $83.8 million for the year ended december 31, 2013. the primary drivers of this change are as follows:

the increase in cash outflows from purchases of real estate and other assets primarily resulted from the acquisition of eight apartment communities during the year ended december 31, 2014 compared to the acquisition of four apartment communities during the year ended december 31, 2013. the increase in proceeds from disposition of real estate assets primarily resulted from the sale of eight apartment communities and two commercial properties during the year ended december 31, 2014 compared to the sale of nine apartment communities during the year ended december 31, 2013. the increase in cash outflows for normal capital improvements is due to the fact that we owned more properties throughout 2014 than we owned throughout 2013. during october 2013, we acquired 115 apartment communities through our merger with colonial. owning these properties for all of 2014 led to increased capital improvement spending. the decrease in cash outflows from the return (funding) of escrow for future acquisitions resulted from the release of funds held in escrow for two 1031(b) transactions at december 31, 2014 compared to having funds held in escrow for the same two 1031(b) transactions at december 31, 2013. we also acquired $63.5 million of cash during the merger, which accounts for the decrease in cash acquired in connection with the colonial merger from 2013 to 2014.

the decrease in cash outflows from the net change in credit lines from 2013 to 2014 was due to the timing of borrowings and repayments on our various lines of credit. the increase in cash inflows from proceeds on notes payable is due to the fact that in 2014, we issued $400 million in senior unsecured notes while in 2013 we issued only $350 million in senior unsecured notes. the increase in cash outflows from principal payments on notes payable is primarily due to the fact that during 2014 we paid off $192.2 million of bonds originally issued by colonial that matured during the year. the decrease in cash inflows from the proceeds from the issuance of common shares is due to the fact that during 2013 we issued approximately 365,000 shares through our atm plan. we issued no shares through our atm plan during 2014. the increase in cash outflows from dividends paid on common shares is due to the fact that we had more shares of common stock outstanding during 2014 than during 2013. in connection with the merger, in october 2013, we issued approximately 31.9 million shares. the additional shares of common stock outstanding during 2014 along with our increase in the dividend rate led to an increase in the aggregate amount of dividends paid during the year ended december 31, 2014.
free cash flow free cash flow represents net cash provided by operating activities (computed in accordance with gaap) less funding of normal capital improvements to existing real estate assets, distributions to unitholders, and dividends paid on common and preferred shares. free cash flow should not be considered as an alternative to any gaap measurement of performance or liquidity. our calculation of free cash flow may differ from the methodology for calculating free cash flow utilized by other companies and, accordingly, may not be comparable to such other companies.
the following table is a reconciliation of free cash flow to net cash provided by operating activities for the years ended december 31, 2014, 2013, and 2012 (dollars in thousands):

while we had sufficient liquidity to permit dividend distributions at current rates through additional borrowings, if necessary, any significant deterioration in operations could result in our financial resources being insufficient to pay distributions to shareholders at the current rate, in which event we would be required to reduce the dividend distribution rate.
we believe that we have adequate resources to fund our current operations, annual refurbishment of our properties, and incremental investment in new apartment properties. our capital resources consist of both equity and debt securities.

equity as of december 31, 2014, we owned 75,267,675 op units, comprising a 94.7% limited partnership interest in the operating partnership, while the remaining 4,191,152 outstanding op units were held by limited partners of the operating partnership. holders of op units (other than us and our affiliates) may require us to redeem their op units from time to time, in which case we may, at our option, pay the redemption price either in cash (in an amount per op unit equal, in general, to the average closing price of our common stock on the new york stock exchange over a specified period prior to the redemption date) or by delivering one share of our common stock (subject to adjustment under specified circumstances) for each op unit so redeemed. in addition, we have registered the 4,191,152 shares of our common stock, which as of december 31, 2014, were issuable upon redemption of op units held by the operating partnership's limited partners under the securities act of 1933, as amended, so that those shares can be sold freely in the public markets. to the extent that additional op units are issued to limited partners of the operating partnership, we will likely register the additional shares of common stock issuable upon redemption of those op units under the securities act of 1933, as amended, so that those shares can also be sold in the public markets. if we issue shares of our common stock upon the redemption of op units in our operating partnership, sales of substantial amounts of such shares of our common stock, or the perception that these sales could occur, may adversely affect prevailing market prices for our common stock or may impair our ability to raise capital through the sale of our common stock or other equity securities.
in connection with the merger, we issued approximately 31.9 million shares of maa common stock and approximately 2.6 million op units on october 1, 2013.

at december 31, 2014, we had secured credit facility relationships with prudential mortgage capital which are credit enhanced by fannie mae and a $500.0 million bank unsecured facility with a syndicate of banks. together, these credit facilities provided a total line capacity of $951.3 million with all but $18.2 million collateralized and available to borrow at december 31, 2014. we had total borrowings outstanding under these credit facilities of $495.9 million at december 31, 2014.
secured credit facilities we rely on the efficient operation of the financial markets to refinance debt maturities, and on rate renewals for fannie mae. fannie mae provided credit enhancement for approximately $436.9 million of our outstanding debt through our fannie mae facilities, as defined below, as of december 31, 2014.

the interest rate markets for fannie mae discount mortgage backed securities, or dmbs, which in our experience are highly liquid and highly correlated with three-month libor interest rates, are also an important component of our liquidity and interest rate swap effectiveness. prudential mortgage capital, a delegated underwriting and servicing, or dus, lender for fannie mae, markets 90-day fannie mae dmbs monthly, and is obligated to advance funds to us at dmbs rates plus a credit spread under the terms of the credit agreements between prudential and us.

off-balance sheet arrangements at december 31, 2014, and 2013, we did not have any relationships, including those with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes.

our investments in our real estate joint ventures are unconsolidated and are recorded using the equity method for the joint ventures in which we do not have a controlling interest.
insurance we renegotiated our insurance programs effective july 1, 2014. we believe that the property and casualty insurance program in place provides appropriate insurance coverage for financial protection against insurable risks such that any insurable loss experienced that can be reasonably anticipated would not have a significant impact on our liquidity, financial position or results of operation.

inflation our resident leases at the apartment communities allow, at the time of renewal, for adjustments in the rent payable thereunder, and thus may enable us to seek rent increases. almost all leases are for one year or less. the short-term nature of these leases generally serves to reduce our risk to adverse effects of inflation.

asu 2014-09, revenue from contracts with customers                                                                                this asu establishes principles for recognizing revenue upon the transfer of promised goods or services to customers, in an amount that reflects the expected consideration received in exchange for those goods or services.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   this asu is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after december 15, 2016. early adoption is not permitted.                                                                           the amendments may be applied retrospectively to each prior period presented or retrospectively with the cumulative effect recognized as of the date of initial application. the company is currently in the process of evaluating the impact of adoption of this asu on its consolidated financial condition and results of operations taken as a whole, but does not expect the impact to be material. the company has not yet determined which method will be used for initial application.
asu 2014-08, reporting discontinued operations and disclosures of disposals of components of an entity                            this asu raises the threshold for disposals to qualify as discontinued operations. it also requires additional disclosures for discontinued operations and new disclosures for individually material disposal transactions that do not meet the definition of a discontinued operation.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         this asu is effective for fiscal years beginning after december 15, 2014, and interim periods within those years; however, early adoption is permitted beginning in the first quarter of 2014.   we adopted this asu on january 1, 2014. the adoption of this asu required us to not classify certain disposals occurring during 2014 as discontinued operations.the 2014 dispositions did not qualify for discontinued operations treatment and therefore the gains on these properties are presented as a component of continuing operations for 2014.

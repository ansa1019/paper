item 1a.   risk factors in addition to the other information in this report, the following risk factors should be carefully considered in evaluating our company and its business.
our quarterly and annual operating results may fluctuate in future periods, which may cause our stock price to fluctuate our quarterly and annual operating results have varied significantly in the past and could vary significantly in the future, which makes it difficult for us to predict our future operating results. our operating results may fluctuate due to a variety of factors, many of which are outside of our control, including the changing and recently volatile u.s. and global economic environment, which may cause our stock price to fluctuate. in particular, we anticipate that the size of customer orders may increase as we continue to focus on larger business accounts. a delay in the recognition of revenue, even from just one account, may have a significant negative impact on our results of operations for a given period. in the past, a majority of our sales have been realized near the end of a quarter. accordingly, a delay in an anticipated sale past the end of a particular quarter may negatively impact our results of operations for that quarter, or in some cases, that fiscal year. additionally, we have exposure to the credit risks of some of our customers and sub-tenants. although we have programs in place that are designed to monitor and
16
mitigate the associated risk, there can be no assurance that such programs will be effective in reducing our credit risks adequately. we monitor individual payment capability in granting credit arrangements, seek to limit the total credit to amounts we believe our customers can pay and maintain reserves we believe are adequate to cover exposure for potential losses. if there is a deterioration of a sub-tenant's or a major customer's creditworthiness or actual defaults are higher than expected, future losses, if incurred, could harm our business and have a material adverse effect on our operating results. further, our operating results may be below the expectations of securities analysts and investors in future quarters or years. our failure to meet these expectations will likely harm the market price of our common stock. such a decline could occur, and has occurred in the past, even when we have met our publicly stated revenue and/or earnings guidance.
our stock price could be volatile, particularly during times of economic uncertainty and volatility in domestic and international stock markets our stock price has been volatile and has fluctuated significantly in the past. the trading price of our stock is likely to continue to be volatile and subject to fluctuations in the future. some of the factors that could significantly affect the market price of our stock include:
•   actual or anticipated variations in operating and financial results;
•   analyst reports or recommendations;
•   rumors, announcements or press articles regarding our competitors' operations, management, organization, financial condition or financial statements; and
•   other events or factors, many of which are beyond our control.
the stock market in general and the market for technology companies in particular, have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations. these fluctuations have often been unrelated or disproportionate to operating performance. the fluctuations may continue in the future and this could significantly impact the value of our stock and your investment.
cloud based computing trends present competitive and execution risks customers are transitioning to a hybrid computing environment utilizing various cloud-based software and services accessed via various smart client devices. pricing and delivery models are evolving and our competitors are developing and deploying cloud-based services for customers. we are devoting significant resources to develop and deploy our own competing cloud-based software and services strategies. while we believe our expertise and investments in software and infrastructure for cloud-based services provides us with a strong foundation to compete, it is uncertain whether our strategies will attract the customers or generate the revenue required to be successful. in addition to software development costs, we are incurring costs to build and maintain infrastructure to support cloud-computing services. these costs may reduce the operating margins we have previously achieved. whether we are successful in this new business model depends on our execution in a number of areas, including:
•   continuing to innovate and bring to market compelling cloud-based services that generate increasing traffic and market share;
•   maintaining the utility, compatibility and performance of our software on the growing array of cloud computing platforms; and
•   implementing the infrastructure to deliver our own cloud based services.
these new business models may reduce our revenues or operating margins and could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.
our business could be adversely impacted by conditions affecting the information technology market a substantial portion of our business depends on the demand for information technology by large enterprise customers and service providers. in addition to the challenges presented by new cloud computing models, we are dependent upon the overall economic health of our current and prospective customers and the continued growth and evolution of the internet. international, national, regional and local economic conditions, such as recessionary economic cycles, protracted economic slowdown or further deterioration of the economy could adversely impact demand for our products. demand for our products and services depends substantially upon the general demand for application delivery products and associated services, which fluctuates based on numerous factors, including capital spending levels and growth of our current and prospective customers, as well as general economic conditions. moreover, the purchase of our products is often discretionary and may involve a significant commitment of capital and other resources. future economic projections for the information technology sector are uncertain as companies continue to reassess their spending for technology projects and embrace new models for delivery of it
17
services, such as cloud computing. as a result, spending priorities for our current and future customers may vary and demand for our products and services may be impacted. in addition, customer buying patterns are changing over time and more customers seek to rent software on a subscription basis. these evolving business models could lead to changes in demand and licensing strategies, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.
industry consolidation may result in increased competition some of our competitors have made acquisitions or entered into partnerships or other strategic relationships to offer a more comprehensive solution than they had previously offered. we have also entered into large, strategic partnerships to enhance our competitive position in the marketplace. as it companies attempt to strengthen or maintain their market positions in the evolving application delivery, mobility, cloud networking and cloud platform markets, these companies continue to seek to deliver comprehensive it solutions to end users and combine enterprise-level hardware and software solutions that may compete with our solutions and which could negatively impact our partnerships. these consolidators or potential consolidators may have significantly greater financial, technical and other resources than we do and may be better positioned to acquire and offer complementary products and services. the companies resulting from these possible combinations may create more compelling product and service offerings and be able to offer greater pricing flexibility or sales and marketing support for such offerings than we can. these heightened competitive pressures could result in a loss of customers or a reduction in our revenues or revenue growth rates, all of which could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.
in addition to other risks listed in this "risk factors" section, factors that may affect our operating results include, but are not limited to:
•   fluctuations in demand for our products and services due to changing market conditions, pricing conditions, technology evolution, seasonality, or other changes in the global economic environment;
•   changes or fluctuations in sales and implementation cycles for our products and services;
•   reduced visibility into our customers' spending and implementation plans;
•   reductions in customers' budgets for data center and other it purchases or delays in these purchases;
•   fluctuations in our gross margins, including the factors described herein, which may contribute to such fluctuations;
•   our ability to control costs, including operating expenses, the costs of hardware and software components, and other manufacturing costs;
•   our ability to develop, introduce and gain market acceptance of new products, technologies and services, and our success in new and evolving markets;
•   any significant changes in the competitive environment, including the entry of new competitors or the substantial discounting of products or services;
•   the timing and execution of product transitions or new product introductions, and related inventory costs;
•   variations in sales channels, product costs, or mix of products sold;
•   our ability to establish and manage our distribution channels, and the effectiveness of any changes we make to our distribution model;
•   the ability of our contract manufacturers and suppliers to provide component parts, hardware platforms and other products in a timely manner;
•   benefits anticipated from our investments in sales, marketing, product development, manufacturing or other activities;
•   changes in tax laws or regulations, or other accounting rules; and
•   general economic conditions, both domestically and in our foreign markets.
our success depends on our timely development of new products and features, market acceptance of new product offerings and proper management of the timing of the life cycle of our products the markets for our products and services are characterized by:
•   rapid technological change;
•   evolving industry standards;
•   fluctuations in customer demand;
18
•   changes in customer requirements; and
•   frequent new product and service introductions and enhancements.
our continued success depends on our ability to identify and develop new products and new features for our existing products to meet the demands of these changes, and the acceptance of those products and features by our existing and target customers. if we are unable to identify, develop and deploy new products and new product features on a timely basis, our business and results of operations may be harmed.
the current development cycle for our products is on average 12-24 months. the introduction of new products or product enhancements may shorten the life cycle of our existing products, or replace sales of some of our current products, thereby offsetting the benefit of even a successful product introduction, and may cause customers to defer purchasing our existing products in anticipation of the new products. this could harm our operating results by decreasing sales, increasing our inventory levels of older products and exposing us to greater risk of product obsolescence. we have also experienced, and may in the future experience, delays in developing and releasing new products and product enhancements. this has led to, and may in the future lead to, delayed sales, increased expenses and lower quarterly revenue than anticipated. also, in the development of our products, we have experienced delays in the prototyping of our products, which in turn has led to delays in product introductions. in addition, complexity and difficulties in managing product transitions at the end-of-life stage of a product can create excess inventory of components associated with the outgoing product that can lead to increased expenses. any or all of the above problems could materially harm our business and results of operations.
our success depends on sales and continued innovation of our application delivery networking product lines for the fiscal year ended september 30, 2014, we derived approximately 98.1% of our net product revenues, or approximately 53.0% of our total net revenues, from sales of our application delivery networking (adn) product lines. we expect to continue to derive a significant portion of our net revenues from sales of our adn products in the future. implementation of our strategy depends upon these products being able to solve critical network availability, performance and security problems for our customers. if our adn products are unable to solve these problems for our customers or if we are unable to sustain the high levels of innovation in our adn product feature set needed to maintain leadership in what will continue to be a competitive market environment, our business and results of operations will be harmed.
we may not be able to compete effectively in the emerging application delivery networking market the markets we serve are new, rapidly evolving and highly competitive, and we expect competition to persist and intensify in the future. our principal competitors in the application delivery networking market include brocade communications systems, inc., citrix systems, inc., radware ltd. and a10 networks. in related adc markets, we compete with the following:
•   cisco, juniper networks and checkpoint systems in the network firewall market;
•   cisco, imperva and citrix in the web application firewall market;
•   cisco, juniper and a10 in carrier grade nat;
•   procera, allot, sandvine and other dpi vendors with our pem offerings;
•   riverbed technology and silver peak systems in the wan optimization and application acceleration market; and
•   oracle via the acquisition of tekelec and acme packet in the diameter signaling market.
•   ibm in end-user protection against malware, phishing and other cyberthreats.
•   akamai networks in cloud-based ddos protection.
•   blue coat systems in protecting enterprises from inbound and outbound malware.
we expect to continue to face additional competition as new participants enter our markets. as we continue to expand globally, we may see new competitors in different geographic regions. in addition, larger companies with significant resources, brand recognition, and sales channels may form alliances with or acquire competing application delivery networking solutions from other companies and emerge as significant competitors. potential competitors may bundle their products or incorporate an internet traffic management or security component into existing products in a manner that discourages users from purchasing our products. any of these circumstances may limit our opportunities for growth and negatively impact our financial performance.
19
the average selling price of our products may decrease and our costs may increase, which may negatively impact gross profits it is possible that the average selling prices of our products will decrease in the future in response to competitive pricing pressures, increased sales discounts, new product introductions by us or our competitors or other factors. therefore, in order to maintain our gross profits, we must develop and introduce new products and product enhancements on a timely basis and continually reduce our product costs. our failure to do so will cause our net revenue and gross profits to decline, which will harm our business and results of operations. in addition, we may experience substantial period-to-period fluctuations in future operating results due to the erosion of our average selling prices.
it is difficult to predict our future operating results because we have an unpredictable sales cycle our products have a lengthy sales cycle and the timing of our revenue is difficult to predict. historically, our sales cycle has ranged from approximately two to three months and has tended to lengthen as we have increasingly focused our sales efforts on the enterprise market. also, as our distribution strategy is focused on a channel model, utilizing value-added resellers, distributors and systems integrators, the level of variability in the length of sales cycle across transactions has increased and made it more difficult to predict the timing of many of our sales transactions. sales of our products require us to educate potential customers in their use and benefits. sales of our products are subject to delays from the lengthy internal budgeting, approval and competitive evaluation processes that large enterprises and governmental entities may require. for example, customers frequently begin by evaluating our products on a limited basis and devote time and resources to testing our products before they decide whether or not to purchase. customers may also defer orders as a result of anticipated releases of new products or enhancements by our competitors or us. as a result, our products have an unpredictable sales cycle that contributes to the uncertainty of our future operating results.
our business may be harmed if our contract manufacturers are not able to provide us with adequate supplies of our products or if a single source of hardware assembly is lost or impaired we outsource the manufacturing of our hardware platforms to third party contract manufacturers who assemble these hardware platforms to our specifications. we have experienced minor delays in shipments from contract manufacturers in the past. however, if we experience major delays in the future or other problems, such as inferior quality and insufficient quantity of product, any one or a combination of these factors may harm our business and results of operations. the inability of our contract manufacturers to provide us with adequate supplies of our products or the loss of one or more of our contract manufacturers may cause a delay in our ability to fulfill orders while we obtain a replacement manufacturer and may harm our business and results of operations. in particular, we currently subcontract manufacturing of our application delivery networking products to a single contract manufacturer with whom we do not have a long-term contract. if our arrangement with this single source of hardware assembly was terminated or otherwise impaired, and we were not able to engage another contract manufacturer in a timely manner, our business, financial condition and results of operation could be adversely affected.
if the demand for our products grows, we will need to increase our raw material and component purchases, contract manufacturing capacity and internal test and quality control functions. any disruptions in product flow may limit our revenue, may harm our competitive position and may result in additional costs or cancellation of orders by our customers.
our business could suffer if there are any interruptions or delays in the supply of hardware components from our third-party sources we currently purchase several hardware components used in the assembly of our products from a number of single or limited sources. lead times for these components vary significantly. the unavailability of suitable components, any interruption or delay in the supply of any of these hardware components or the inability to procure a similar component from alternate sources at acceptable prices within a reasonable time, may delay assembly and sales of our products and, hence, our revenues, and may harm our business and results of operations.
we are subject to governmental export and import controls that could subject us to liability or impair our ability to compete in international markets our products are subject to u.s. export controls and may be exported outside the u.s. only with the required level of export license or through an export license exception because we incorporate encryption technology into our products. in addition, various countries regulate the import of certain encryption technology and have enacted laws that could limit our ability to distribute our products or our customers' ability to implement our products in those countries. changes in our products or changes in export and import regulations may create delays in the introduction of our products in international markets, prevent our customers with international operations from deploying our products throughout their global systems or, in some cases, prevent the export or import of our products to certain countries altogether. any change in export or import
20
regulations or related legislation, shift in approach to the enforcement or scope of existing regulations or change in the countries, persons or technologies targeted by such regulations, could result in decreased use of our products by, or in our decreased ability to export or sell our products to, existing or potential customers with international operations. any decreased use of our products or limitation on our ability to export or sell our products would likely adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition.
reliance on shipments at the end of the quarter could cause our revenue for the applicable period to fall below expected levels as a result of customer buying patterns and the efforts of our sales force and channel partners to meet or exceed their sales objectives, we have historically received a substantial portion of sales orders and generated a substantial portion of revenue during the last few weeks of each fiscal quarter. in addition, any significant interruption in our information technology systems, which manage critical functions such as order processing, revenue recognition, financial forecasts, inventory and supply chain management, and trade compliance reviews, could result in delayed order fulfillment and decreased revenue for that fiscal quarter. if expected revenue at the end of any fiscal quarter is delayed for any reason, including the failure of anticipated purchase orders to materialize, our third party contract manufacturers' inability to manufacture and ship products prior to fiscal quarter-end to fulfill purchase orders received near the end of the fiscal quarter, our failure to manage inventory to meet demand, our inability to release new products on schedule, any failure of our systems related to order review and processing, or any delays in shipments based on trade compliance requirements, our revenue for that quarter could fall below our expectations, resulting in a decline in the trading price of our common stock.
we may not be able to adequately protect our intellectual property, and our products may infringe on the intellectual property rights of third parties we rely on a combination of patent, copyright, trademark and trade secret laws, and restrictions on disclosure of confidential and proprietary information to protect our intellectual property rights. despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights, unauthorized parties may attempt to copy or otherwise obtain and use our products or technology. monitoring unauthorized use of our products is difficult, and we cannot be certain that the steps we have taken will prevent misappropriation of our technology, particularly in foreign countries where the laws may not protect our proprietary rights as fully as in the united states.
our industry is characterized by the existence of a large number of patents and frequent claims and related litigation regarding patent and other intellectual property rights. in the ordinary course of our business, we are involved in disputes and licensing discussions with others regarding their claimed proprietary rights and cannot provide assurance that we will always successfully defend ourselves against such claims. we expect that infringement claims may increase as the number of products and competitors in our market increases and overlaps occur. also, as we have gained greater visibility, market exposure and competitive success, we face a higher risk of being the subject of intellectual property infringement claims. if we are found to infringe the proprietary rights of others, or if we otherwise settle such claims, we could be compelled to pay damages or royalties and either obtain a license to those intellectual property rights or alter our products so that they no longer infringe upon such proprietary rights. any license could be very expensive to obtain or may not be available at all. similarly, changing our products or processes to avoid infringing upon the rights of others may be costly or impractical. in addition, we have initiated, and may in the future initiate, claims or litigation against third parties for infringement of our proprietary rights, or to determine the scope and validity of our proprietary rights or those of our competitors. any of these claims, whether claims that we are infringing the proprietary rights of others, or vice versa, with or without merit, may be time-consuming, result in costly litigation and diversion of technical and management personnel or require us to cease using infringing technology, develop non-infringing technology or enter into royalty or licensing agreements. further, our license agreements typically require us to indemnify our customers, distributors and resellers for infringement actions related to our technology, which could cause us to become involved in infringement claims made against our customers, distributors or resellers. any of the above-described circumstances relating to intellectual property rights disputes could result in our business and results of operations being harmed.
we incorporate open source software into our products. although we monitor our use of open source closely, the terms of many open source licenses have not been interpreted by u.s. courts, and there is a risk that such licenses could be construed in a manner that could impose unanticipated conditions or restrictions on our ability to commercialize our products. we could also be subject to similar conditions or restrictions should there be any changes in the licensing terms of the open source software incorporated into our products. in either event, we could be required to seek licenses from third parties in order to continue offering our products, to re-engineer our products or to discontinue the sale of our products in the event re-engineering cannot be accomplished on a timely or successful basis, any of which could adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition.
21
many of our products include intellectual property licensed from third parties. in the future, it may be necessary to renew licenses for third party intellectual property or obtain new licenses for other technology. these third party licenses may not be available to us on acceptable terms, if at all. the inability to obtain certain licenses, or litigation regarding the interpretation or enforcement of license rights and related intellectual property issues, could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition. furthermore, we license some third party intellectual property on a non-exclusive basis and this may limit our ability to protect our intellectual property rights in our products.
we may not be able to sustain or develop new distribution relationships, and a reduction or delay in sales to significant distribution partners could hurt our business we sell our products and services through multiple distribution channels in the united states and internationally, including leading industry distributors, value-added resellers, systems integrators, service providers and other indirect channel partners. we have a limited number of agreements with companies in these channels, and we may not be able to increase our number of distribution relationships or maintain our existing relationships. recruiting and retaining qualified channel partners and training them in our technologies requires significant time and resources. these channel partners may also market, sell and support products and services that are competitive with ours and may devote more resources to the marketing, sales and support of such competitive products. our indirect sales channel structure could subject us to lawsuits, potential liability, and reputational harm if, for example, any of our channel partners misrepresent the functionality of our products or services to customers or violate laws or our corporate policies. if we are unable to establish or maintain our indirect sales channels, our business and results of operations will be harmed. in addition, three worldwide distributors of our products accounted for 45.9% of our total net revenue for fiscal year 2014. three worldwide distributors of our products accounted for 44.1% of our total net revenue for fiscal year 2013. a substantial reduction or delay in sales of our products to these distribution partners, if not replaced by sales to other indirect channel partners and distributors, could harm our business, operating results and financial condition.
undetected software or hardware errors or security vulnerabilities may harm our business and results of operations our products may contain undetected errors or defects when first introduced or as new versions are released. we have experienced these errors or defects in the past in connection with new products and product upgrades. we expect that these errors or defects will be found from time to time in new or enhanced products after commencement of commercial shipments. these problems may cause us to incur significant warranty and repair costs, divert the attention of our engineering personnel from our product development efforts and cause significant customer relations problems. we may also be subject to liability claims for damages related to product errors or defects. while we carry insurance policies covering this type of liability, these policies may not provide sufficient protection should a claim be asserted. a material product liability claim may harm our business and results of operations.
our products must successfully operate with products from other vendors. as a result, when problems occur in a network, it may be difficult to identify the source of the problem. the occurrence of software or hardware problems, whether caused by our products or another vendor's products, may result in the delay or loss of market acceptance of our products. the occurrence of any of these problems may harm our business and results of operations.
our products are used to manage critical applications and data for customers and third parties may attempt to exploit security vulnerabilities in our products. as we continue to focus on the development and marketing of security solutions, we become a bigger target for malicious computer hackers who wish to exploit security vulnerabilities in our products. these problems may cause us to incur significant remediation costs, divert the attention of our engineering personnel from our product development efforts and cause significant customer relations problems. adverse publicity related to security vulnerabilities or damage to a customer's operations due to exploitation of security vulnerability in our products may harm our business and results of operations.
any errors, defects or vulnerabilities in our products could result in:
•   expenditures of significant financial and product development resources in efforts to analyze, correct, eliminate, or work-around errors and defects or to address and eliminate vulnerabilities;
•   loss of existing or potential customers or channel partners;
•   delayed or lost revenue;
•   delay or failure to attain market acceptance;
•   an increase in warranty claims compared with our historical experience, or an increased cost of servicing warranty claims, either of which would adversely affect our gross margins; and
22
•   litigation, regulatory inquiries, or investigations that may be costly and harm our reputation.
we are dependent on various information technology systems, and failures of or interruptions to those systems could harm our business many of our business processes depend upon our it systems, the systems and processes of third parties, and on interfaces with the systems of third parties. for example, our order entry system provides information to the systems of our contract manufacturers, which enables them to build and ship our products. if those systems fail or are interrupted, or if our ability to connect to or interact with one or more networks is interrupted, our processes may function at a diminished level or not at all. this would harm our ability to ship products, and our financial results may be harmed.
in addition, reconfiguring our it systems or other business processes in response to changing business needs may be time-consuming and costly. to the extent this impacted our ability to react timely to specific market or business opportunities, our financial results may be harmed.
our operating results are exposed to risks associated with international commerce as our international sales increase, our operating results become more exposed to international operating risks. additionally, our international sales and operations are subject to a number of risks, including the following:
•   greater difficulty in enforcing contracts and accounts receivable collection and longer collection periods;
•   the uncertainty of protection for intellectual property rights in some countries;
•   greater risk of unexpected changes in regulatory practices, tariffs, and tax laws and treaties;
•   risks associated with trade restrictions and foreign legal requirements, including the importation, certification, and localization of our products required in foreign countries;
•   greater risk of a failure of foreign employees, partners, distributors, and resellers to comply with both u.s. and foreign laws, including antitrust regulations, the u.s. foreign corrupt practices act, and any trade regulations ensuring fair trade practices;
•   heightened risk of unfair or corrupt business practices in certain geographies and of improper or fraudulent sales arrangements that may impact financial results and result in restatements of, or irregularities in, financial statements;
•   increased expenses incurred in establishing and maintaining office space and equipment for our international operations;
•   greater difficulty in recruiting local experienced personnel, and the costs and expenses associated with such activities;
•   management communication and integration problems resulting from cultural and geographic dispersion;
•   fluctuations in exchange rates between the u.s. dollar and foreign currencies in markets where we do business;
•   economic uncertainty around the world, including continued economic uncertainty as a result of sovereign debt issues in europe; and
•   general economic and political conditions in these foreign markets.
we must hire and train experienced personnel to staff and manage our foreign operations. to the extent that we experience difficulties in recruiting, training, managing, and retaining an international staff, and specifically staff related to sales management and sales personnel, we may experience difficulties in sales productivity in foreign markets. we also enter into strategic distributor and reseller relationships with companies in certain international markets where we do not have a local presence. if we are not able to maintain successful strategic distributor relationships internationally or recruit additional companies to enter into strategic distributor relationships, our future success in these international markets could be limited. business practices in the international markets that we serve may differ from those in the united states and may require us in the future to include terms other than our standard terms in customer contracts. we intend to continue expanding into international markets. sales outside of the americas represented 43.1% and 42.5% of our net revenues for the fiscal years ended september 30, 2014 and 2013, respectively.
these factors and other factors could harm our ability to gain future international revenues and, consequently, materially impact our business, operating results, and financial condition. the expansion of our existing international operations and entry into additional international markets will require significant management attention and financial resources. our failure to successfully manage our international operations and the associated risks effectively could limit the future growth of our business.
23
a portion of our revenue is generated by sales to government entities, which are subject to a number of challenges and risks sales to u.s. and foreign, federal, state, and local governmental agency end-customers account for a significant portion of our revenues and we may in the future increase sales to government entities. sales to government entities are subject to a number of risks. selling to government entities can be highly competitive, expensive, and time consuming, often requiring significant upfront time and expense without any assurance that these efforts will generate a sale. the substantial majority of our sales to date to government entities have been made indirectly through our channel partners. government certification requirements for products like ours may change, thereby restricting our ability to sell into the federal government sector until we have attained the revised certification. government demand and payment for our products and services may be impacted by public sector budgetary cycles and funding authorizations, with funding reductions or delays adversely affecting public sector demand for our products and services. government entities may have statutory, contractual or other legal rights to terminate contracts with our distributors and resellers for convenience or due to a default, and any such termination may adversely impact our future operating results. governments routinely investigate and audit government contractors' administrative processes, and any unfavorable audit could result in the government refusing to continue buying our products and services, a reduction of revenue or fines or civil or criminal liability if the audit uncovers improper or illegal activities, which could adversely impact our operating results in a material way. finally, for purchases by the u.s. government, the government may require certain products to be manufactured in the united states and other relatively high cost manufacturing locations, and we may not manufacture all products in locations that meet the requirements of the u.s. government, affecting our ability to sell these products to the u.s. government.
our failure to adequately protect personal information could have a material adverse effect on our business a wide variety of local, state, national, and international laws, directives and regulations apply to the collection, use, retention, protection, disclosure, transfer, and other processing of personal data. these data protection and privacy-related laws and regulations continue to evolve and may result in ever-increasing regulatory and public scrutiny and escalating levels of enforcement and sanctions and increased costs of compliance. our failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations, or to protect such data, could result in enforcement action against us, including fines, imprisonment of company officials and public censure, claims for damages by end-customers and other affected individuals, damage to our reputation and loss of goodwill (both in relation to existing end-customers and prospective end-customers), any of which could have a material adverse effect on our operations, financial performance, and business. changing definitions of personal data and personal information, within the european union, the united states, and elsewhere, especially relating to classification of ip addresses, machine identification, location data, and other information, may limit or inhibit our ability to operate or expand our business, including limiting strategic partnerships that may involve the sharing of data.
misuse of our products could harm our reputation our products may be misused by end-customers or third parties that obtain access to our products. for example, our products could be used to censor private access to certain information on the internet. such use of our products for censorship could result in negative publicity and damage to our reputation. in addition, as many of our products are subject to export control regulations, diversion of our products to restricted third parties by others could result in investigations, penalties, fines, trade restrictions and negative publicity that could damage our reputation and materially impact our business, operating results, and financial condition.
changes in governmental regulations could negatively affect our revenues many of our products are subject to various regulations promulgated by the united states and various foreign governments including, but not limited to, environmental regulations and regulations implementing export license requirements and restrictions on the import or export of some technologies, especially encryption technology. changes in governmental regulation and our inability or failure to obtain required approvals, permits or registrations could harm our international and domestic sales and adversely affect our revenues, business and operations.
new regulations related to conflict minerals may force us to incur additional expenses and could limit the supply and increase the costs of certain metals and minerals used in the manufacturing of our products in august 2012, the sec adopted new requirements under the dodd-frank wall street reform and consumer protection act of 2010 (or the dodd-frank act) for companies that use certain minerals and derivative metals (referred to as conflict minerals, regardless of their country of origin) in their products, whether or not these products are manufactured by third parties. the dodd-frank act requires companies to perform due diligence and disclose whether or not such minerals originate from the democratic republic of congo or adjoining countries. we filed a report on form sd with the sec regarding such matters on may 30, 2014 and are required to file on an annual basis going forward. these new requirements could adversely
24
affect the sourcing, availability and pricing of minerals or metals used in the manufacture of our products and the numerous components that go into our products all of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and operating results. in addition, we will incur additional costs to comply with the disclosure requirements, including costs related to determining the source of any relevant minerals and metals used in our products. we have a complex supply chain and many components are sourced through our contract manufacturer and we may not be able to sufficiently verify the origins for these minerals and metals used in our products through the due diligence procedures that we implement. as a result, we may face reputational challenges with our customers and other stakeholders and possible regulatory risk.
changes in financial accounting standards may cause adverse unexpected revenue fluctuations and affect our reported results of operations a change in accounting policies can have a significant effect on our reported results and may even affect our reporting of transactions completed before the change is effective. new pronouncements and varying interpretations of existing pronouncements have occurred with frequency and may occur in the future. changes to existing rules, or changes to the interpretations of existing rules, could lead to changes in our accounting practices, and such changes could adversely affect our reported financial results or the way we conduct our business.
we may have exposure to greater than anticipated tax liabilities our provision for income taxes is subject to volatility and could be adversely affected by nondeductible stock-based compensation, changes in the research and development tax credit laws, earnings being lower than anticipated in jurisdictions where we have lower statutory rates and being higher than anticipated in jurisdictions where we have higher statutory rates, transfer pricing adjustments, not meeting the terms and conditions of tax holidays or incentives, changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities, changes in actual results versus our estimates, or changes in tax laws, regulations, accounting principles or interpretations thereof. in addition, like other companies, we may be subject to examination of our income tax returns by the u.s. internal revenue service and other tax authorities. while we regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes from such examinations and the adequacy of our provision for income taxes, there can be no assurance that such provision is sufficient and that a determination by a tax authority will not have an adverse effect on our results of operations.
acquisitions present many risks and we may not realize the financial and strategic goals that are contemplated at the time of the transaction with respect to our past acquisitions, as well as any other future acquisitions we may undertake, we may find that the acquired businesses, products or technologies do not further our business strategy as expected, that we paid more than what the assets are later worth or that economic conditions change, all of which may generate future impairment charges. our acquisitions may be viewed negatively by customers, financial markets or investors. there may be difficulty integrating the operations and personnel of the acquired business, and we may have difficulty retaining the key personnel of the acquired business. we may have difficulty in integrating the acquired technologies or products with our existing product lines. our ongoing business and management's attention may be disrupted or diverted by transition or integration issues and the complexity of managing geographically and culturally diverse locations. we may have difficulty maintaining uniform standards, controls, procedures and policies across locations. we may experience significant problems or liabilities associated with product quality, technology and other matters.
our inability to successfully operate and integrate newly-acquired businesses appropriately, effectively and in a timely manner, or to retain key personnel of any acquired business, could have a material adverse effect on our ability to take advantage of further growth in demand for integrated traffic management and security solutions and other advances in technology, as well as on our revenues, gross margins and expenses.
our success depends on our key personnel and our ability to hire, retain and motivate qualified executives, sales and marketing, operations, product development and professional services personnel our success depends, in large part, on our ability to attract, engage, retain, and integrate qualified executives and other key employees throughout all areas of our business. in order to attract and retain executives and other key employees in a competitive marketplace, we must provide a competitive compensation package, including cash- and equity-based compensation. if we do not obtain the stockholder approval needed to continue granting equity compensation in a competitive manner, our ability to attract, retain, and motivate executives and key employees could be weakened. failure to successfully hire executives and key employees or the loss of any executives and key employees could have a significant impact on our operations. in addition, our ceo recently announced his intended retirement at the end of fiscal year 2015. the process of identifying his successor could be disruptive to our business and the failure to identify and hire his successor in a timely manner could adversely affect our business and results of operations. further, changes in our management team may be disruptive to our business, and any failure to successfully integrate key new hires or promoted employees could adversely
25
affect our business and results of operations. the complexity of our application delivery networking products and their integration into existing networks and ongoing support, as well as the sophistication of our sales and marketing effort, requires us to retain highly trained developers, professional services, customer support and sales personnel. competition for qualified developers, professional services, customer support and sales personnel in our industry is intense because of the limited number of people available with the necessary technical skills and understanding of our products. our ability to hire and retain these personnel may be adversely affected by volatility or reductions in the price of our common stock, since these employees are generally granted restricted stock units. the loss of services of any of our key personnel, the inability to retain and attract qualified personnel in the future or delays in hiring qualified personnel may harm our business and results of operations.
we face litigation risks we are a party to lawsuits in the normal course of our business. litigation in general, and intellectual property and securities litigation in particular, can be expensive, lengthy and disruptive to normal business operations. moreover, the results of complex legal proceedings are difficult to predict. responding to lawsuits has been, and will likely continue to be, expensive and time-consuming for us. an unfavorable resolution of these lawsuits could adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial condition.
anti-takeover provisions could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us our board of directors has the authority to issue up to 10,000,000 shares of preferred stock and to determine the price, rights, preferences, privileges and restrictions, including voting rights, of those shares without any further vote or action by the shareholders. the rights of the holders of common stock may be subject to, and may be adversely affected by, the rights of the holders of any preferred stock that may be issued in the future. the issuance of preferred stock may have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing a change of control of our company without further action by our shareholders and may adversely affect the voting and other rights of the holders of common stock. further, certain provisions of our bylaws, including a provision limiting the ability of shareholders to raise matters at a meeting of shareholders without giving advance notice, may have the effect of delaying or preventing changes in control or management of our company, which could have an adverse effect on the market price of our common stock. in addition, our articles of incorporation currently provide for a staggered board, which may make it more difficult for a third party to gain control of our board of directors. similarly, state anti-takeover laws in the state of washington related to corporate takeovers may prevent or delay a change of control of our company.
our business is subject to the risks of earthquakes, fire, power outages, floods, and other catastrophic events, and to interruption by man-made problems such as terrorism a significant natural disaster, such as an earthquake, a fire, a flood, or a significant power outage could have a material adverse impact on our business, operating results, and financial condition. we have an administrative and product development office and a third party contract manufacturer located in the san francisco bay area, a region known for seismic activity. in addition, natural disasters could affect our supply chain, manufacturing vendors, or logistics providers' ability to provide materials and perform services such as manufacturing products or assisting with shipments on a timely basis. in the event our or our service providers' information technology systems or manufacturing or logistics abilities are hindered by any of the events discussed above, shipments could be delayed, resulting in missed financial targets, such as revenue and shipment targets, for a particular quarter. in addition, cyber-attacks, acts of terrorism, or other geo-political unrest could cause disruptions in our business or the business of our supply chain, manufacturers, logistics providers, partners, or end-customers or the economy as a whole. any disruption in the business of our supply chain, manufacturers, logistics providers, partners or end-customers that impacts sales at the end of a fiscal quarter could have a significant adverse impact on our quarterly results. all of the aforementioned risks may be further increased if the disaster recovery plans for us and our suppliers prove to be inadequate. to the extent that any of the above should result in delays or cancellations of customer orders, or the delay in the manufacture, deployment or shipment of our products, our business, financial condition and operating results would be adversely affected.

overview we are a global provider of software and hardware solutions and services within an intelligent services framework that help companies efficiently and securely manage the delivery, optimization and security of application and data traffic on networks, and to optimize the performance and utilization of data storage infrastructure and other network resources for their customers, partners, and employees. we market and sell our products primarily through multiple indirect sales channels in the americas (primarily the united states); europe, the middle east, and africa (emea); japan; and the asia pacific region (apac). enterprise customers (fortune 1000 or business week global 1000 companies) in the technology, telecommunications, financial services, transportation, education, manufacturing and health care industries, along with government customers, continue to make up the largest percentage of our customer base.
our management team monitors and analyzes a number of key performance indicators in order to manage our business and evaluate our financial and operating performance. those indicators include:
•   revenues. the majority of our revenues are derived from sales of our application delivery networking (adn) products including our high end viprion chassis and related software modules; local traffic manager (ltm), global traffic manager (gtm) and link controller; advanced firewall manager (afm), carrier grade network address translation (cgnat) and policy enforcement manager (pem), that leverage the unique performance characteristics of our hardware and software architecture; and products that incorporate acquired technology, including application security manager (asm), application acceleration manager (aam), access policy manager (apm) and edge gateway; signaling delivery controller products (sdc); and the websafe, mobilesafe and secure web gateway security offerings which are sold to customers on a subscription basis. we also derive revenues from the sales of services including annual maintenance contracts, training and consulting services. we carefully monitor the sales mix of our revenues within each reporting period. we believe customer acceptance rates of our new products and feature enhancements are indicators of future trends. we also consider overall revenue concentration by customer and by geographic region as additional indicators of current and future trends.
•   cost of revenues and gross margins. we strive to control our cost of revenues and thereby maintain our gross margins. significant items impacting cost of revenues are hardware costs paid to our contract manufacturers, third-party software license fees, amortization of developed technology and personnel and overhead expenses. our margins have remained relatively stable; however, factors such as sales price, product mix, inventory obsolescence, returns, component price increases and warranty costs could significantly impact our gross margins from quarter to quarter and represent significant indicators we monitor on a regular basis.
•   operating expenses. operating expenses are substantially driven by personnel and related overhead expenses. existing headcount and future hiring plans are the predominant factors in analyzing and forecasting future operating expense trends. other significant operating expenses that we monitor include marketing and promotions, travel, professional fees, computer costs related to the development of new products, facilities and depreciation expenses.
•   liquidity and cash flows. our financial condition remains strong with significant cash and investments and no long term debt. the decrease in cash and investments for fiscal year 2014 was primarily due to $650.5 million of cash used to repurchase outstanding common stock under our share repurchase program. this decrease was partially offset by cash provided by operating activities of $549.0 million in fiscal year 2014. going forward, we believe the primary driver of cash flows will be net income from operations. on may 22, 2014, we acquired all issued and outstanding shares of defense.net, inc. (defense.net) for $49.4 million in cash. capital expenditures of $22.7 million for fiscal year 2014 were comprised primarily of information technology infrastructure and equipment to support the growth of our core business activities. we will continue to evaluate possible acquisitions of, or investments in businesses, products, or technologies that we believe are strategic, which may require the use of cash.
32
•   balance sheet. we view cash, short-term and long-term investments, deferred revenue, accounts receivable balances and days sales outstanding as important indicators of our financial health. deferred revenues continued to increase in fiscal 2014 due to growth in the amount of annual maintenance contracts purchased on new products and maintenance renewal contracts related to our existing product installation base. our days sales outstanding for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2014 was 47.
critical accounting policies our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america. the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect the more significant estimates and judgments used in the preparation of our financial statements.
revenue recognition. we sell products through distributors, resellers, and directly to end users. revenue is recognized provided that all of the following criteria have been met:
•   persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists. evidence of an arrangement generally consists of a purchase order issued pursuant to the terms and conditions of a distributor, reseller or end user agreement.
•   delivery has occurred. we use shipping or related documents, or written evidence of customer acceptance, when applicable, to verify delivery or completion of any performance terms.
•   the sales price is fixed or determinable. we assess whether the sales price is fixed or determinable based on payment terms associated with the transaction and whether the sales price is subject to refund or adjustment.
•   collectability is reasonably assured. we assess collectability primarily based on the creditworthiness of the customer as determined by credit checks and related analysis, as well as the customer's payment history.
revenue from the sale of products is generally recognized when the product has been shipped and the customer is obligated to pay for the product. when rights of return are present and we cannot estimate returns, revenue is recognized when such rights of return lapse. payment terms to domestic customers are generally net 30 days to net 45 days. payment terms to international customers range from net 30 days to net 120 days based on normal and customary trade practices in the individual markets. we offer extended payment terms to certain customers, in which case, revenue is recognized when payments are due.
revenues for post-contract customer support (pcs) are recognized on a straight-line basis over the service contract term. pcs includes a limited period of telephone support, updates, repair or replacement of any failed product or component that fails during the term of the agreement, bug fixes and rights to upgrades, when and if available. consulting services are customarily billed at fixed hourly rates, plus out-of-pocket expenses, and revenues are recognized when the consulting has been completed. training revenue is recognized when the training has been completed.
arrangement consideration is first allocated between software (consisting of nonessential and stand-alone software) and non-software deliverables. the majority of our products are hardware appliances which contain software essential to the overall functionality of the products. hardware appliances are generally sold with pcs and on occasion, with consulting and/or training services. arrangement consideration in such multiple element transactions is allocated to each element based on a fair value hierarchy, where the selling price for an element is based on vendor specific objective evidence (vsoe), if available, third-party evidence (tpe), if available and vsoe is not available; or the best estimate of selling price (besp), if neither vsoe or tpe is available.
for software deliverables, we allocate revenue between multiple elements based on software revenue recognition guidance. software revenue recognition guidance requires revenue earned on software arrangements involving multiple elements to be allocated to each element based on the relative fair values of those elements. the fair value of an element must be based on vsoe. where fair value of delivered elements is not available, revenue is recognized on the "residual method" based on the fair value of undelivered elements. if evidence of fair value of one or more undelivered elements does not exist, all revenue is deferred and recognized at the earlier of the delivery of those elements or the establishment of fair value of the remaining undelivered elements.
we establish vsoe for our products, pcs, consulting and training services based on the sales price charged for each element when sold separately. the sales price is discounted from the applicable list price based on various factors including the type of customer, volume of sales, geographic region and program level. our list prices are generally not fair value as discounts
33
may be given based on the factors enumerated above. we use historical sales transactions to determine whether vsoe can be established for each of the elements. in most instances, vsoe of fair value is the sales price of actual standalone (unbundled) transactions within the past 12 month period, when a substantial majority of transactions (more than 80%) are priced within a narrow range, which we have determined to be plus or minus 15% of the median sales price.
we believe that the vsoe of fair value of training and consulting services is represented by the billable rate per hour, based on the rates charged to customers when they purchase standalone training or consulting services. the price of consulting services is not based on the type of customer, volume of sales, geographic region or program level.
we are typically not able to determine vsoe or tpe for non-software products. tpe is determined based on competitor prices for similar elements when sold separately. generally, our go-to-market strategy differs from that of other competitive products or services in its markets and our offerings contain a significant level of differentiation such that the comparable pricing of products with similar functionality cannot be obtained. furthermore, we are unable to reliably determine the selling prices on a stand-alone basis of similar products offered by our competitors.
when we are unable to establish selling price using vsoe or tpe, we use besp in our allocation of arrangement consideration. the objective of besp is to determine the price at which we would transact a sale if the product or service were sold on a stand-alone basis. we have been able to establish besp through the list price, less a discount deemed appropriate to maintain a reasonable gross margin. management regularly reviews gross margin information at the consolidated level. non-software product besp is determined through our review of historical sales transactions within the past 12 month period. additional factors considered in determining an appropriate besp include, but are not limited to, cost of products, pricing practices, geographies, customer classes, and distribution channels.
we regularly validate the vsoe of fair value and besp for elements in its multiple element arrangements. we account for taxes collected from customers and remitted to governmental authorities on a net basis and excluded these amounts from revenues.
reserve for doubtful accounts. estimates are used in determining our allowance for doubtful accounts and are based upon an assessment of selected accounts and as a percentage of our remaining accounts receivable by aging category. in determining these percentages, we evaluate historical write-offs, current trends in the credit quality of our customer base, as well as changes in the credit policies. we perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers' financial condition and do not require any collateral. if there is deterioration of a major customer's credit worthiness or actual defaults are higher than our historical experience, our allowance for doubtful accounts may not be sufficient.
reserve for product returns. in some instances, product revenue from distributors is subject to agreements allowing rights of return. product returns are estimated based on historical experience and are recorded at the time revenues are recognized. accordingly, we reduce recognized revenue for estimated future returns at the time revenue is recorded. when rights of return are present and we cannot estimate returns, revenue is recognized when such rights lapse. the estimates for returns are adjusted periodically based upon changes in historical rates of returns and other related factors. it is possible that these estimates will change in the future or that the actual amounts could vary from our estimates.
accounting for income taxes. we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements. this process involves estimating our actual current tax exposure, including assessing the risks associated with tax audits, together with assessing temporary differences resulting from the different treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes. these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities. due to the evolving nature and complexity of tax rules combined with the large number of jurisdictions in which we operate, it is possible that our estimates of our tax liability could change in the future, which may result in additional tax liabilities and adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.
stock-based compensation. we account for stock-based compensation using the straight-line attribution method for recognizing compensation expense over the requisite service period of the related award. we recognized $127.2 million and $104.2 million of stock-based compensation expense for the years ended september 30, 2014 and 2013, respectively. as of september 30, 2014, there was $100.0 million of total unrecognized stock-based compensation cost, the majority of which will be recognized over the next two years. going forward, stock-based compensation expenses may increase as we issue additional equity-based awards to continue to attract and retain key employees.
we issue incentive awards to our employees through stock-based compensation consisting of restricted stock units (rsus). the value of rsus is determined using the fair value method, which in this case, is based on the number of shares granted and the quoted price of our common stock on the date of grant.
34
we recognize compensation expense for only the portion of rsus that are expected to vest. therefore, we apply estimated forfeiture rates that are derived from historical employee termination behavior. based on historical differences with forfeitures of stock-based awards granted to our executive officers and board of directors versus grants awarded to all other employees, we developed separate forfeiture expectations for these two groups. in fiscal year 2014, the estimated forfeiture rate for grants awarded to our executive officers and board of directors was approximately 6.6% and the estimated forfeiture rate for grants awarded to all other employees was approximately 7.3%. if the actual number of forfeitures differs from those estimated by management, additional adjustments to stock-based compensation expense may be required in future periods.
we recognize compensation costs for awards with performance conditions when we conclude it is probable that the performance condition will be achieved. we reassess the probability of vesting at each balance sheet date and adjust compensation costs based on our probability assessment.
common stock repurchase. on january 22, 2014, we announced that our board of directors authorized an additional $500 million for our common stock share repurchase program. this new authorization is incremental to the existing $1.1 billion program, initially approved in october 2010 and expanded in august 2011, october 2011, april 2013, and november 2013. acquisitions for the share repurchase programs will be made from time to time in private transactions or open market purchases as permitted by securities laws and other legal requirements. the programs can be terminated at any time. as of november 20, 2014, we had repurchased and retired 18,449,755 shares at an average price of $82.41 per share and we had $279.6 million remaining to purchase shares as part of our repurchase programs.
goodwill and intangible assets. goodwill represents the excess purchase price over the estimated fair value of net assets acquired as of the acquisition date. we test goodwill for impairment on an annual basis and between annual tests when impairment indicators are identified. goodwill is written down when impaired. goodwill was recorded in connection with the acquisition of defense.net, inc. in may 2014, versafe ltd. and linerate systems, inc. in fiscal year 2013, traffix systems in fiscal year 2012, acopia networks, inc. in fiscal year 2007, swan labs, inc. in fiscal year 2006, magnifire websystems, inc. in fiscal year 2004 and uroam, inc. in fiscal year 2003. for our annual goodwill impairment test in all periods to date, we have operated under one reporting unit and the fair value of the reporting unit has been determined by the company's enterprise value. we perform our annual goodwill impairment test during the second fiscal quarter.
as part of the annual goodwill impairment test, we first perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether further impairment testing is necessary. if, as a result of its qualitative assessment, it is more-likely-than-not (i.e. greater than 50% chance) that the fair value of our reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, the quantitative impairment test will be required. otherwise, no further testing will be required.
examples of events and circumstances that might indicate that a reporting unit's fair value is less than its carrying amount include macro-economic conditions such as deterioration in the entity's operating environment or industry or market considerations; entity-specific events such as increasing costs, declining financial performance, or loss of key personnel; or other events such as an expectation that a reporting unit will be sold or a sustained decrease in the stock price on either an absolute basis or relative to peers.
if it is determined, as a result of the qualitative assessment, that it is more-likely-than-not that the fair value of our reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, the provisions of authoritative guidance require that we perform a two-step impairment test on goodwill. the first step of the test identifies whether potential impairment may have occurred, while the second step of the test measures the amount of the impairment, if any. impairment is recognized when the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its fair value. in march 2014, we completed a qualitative assessment of potential impairment indicators and concluded that it was more-likely-than-not that the fair value of our reporting unit exceeded its carrying amount.
acquired in-process research and development (ipr&d) are intangible assets initially recognized at fair value and classified as indefinite-lived assets until the successful completion or abandonment of the associated research and development efforts. during the development period, these assets will not be amortized as charges to earnings; instead these assets will be tested for impairment on an annual basis or more frequently if impairment indicators are identified. ipr&d was recorded in connection with the acquisition of linerate systems, inc. in february 2013.
investments. our investments are diversified among high-credit quality debt securities in accordance with our investment policy. we classify our investments as available-for-sale, which are reported at fair market value with the related unrealized gains and losses included in accumulated other comprehensive income or loss in stockholders' equity. realized gains and losses and declines in value of these investments judged to be other than temporary are included in other income (expense). to date, we have not deemed it necessary to record any charges related to other-than-temporary declines in the estimated fair values of our marketable debt securities. however, the fair value of our investments is subject to volatility. declines in the fair value of our investments judged to be other than temporary could adversely affect our future operating results.

net revenues. total net revenues increased 16.9% in fiscal year 2014 from fiscal year 2013, compared to an increase of 7.6% in fiscal year 2013 from the prior year. overall revenue growth for the year ended september 30, 2014 was primarily due to increased service and product revenues as a result of our increased installed base of products and increased demand for our core adn products. international revenues represented 48.3%, 47.5% and 47.1% of net revenues in fiscal years 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. we expect international sales will continue to represent a significant portion of net revenues, although we cannot provide assurance that international revenues as a percentage of net revenues will remain at current levels.
net product revenues increased 17.2% in fiscal year 2014 from fiscal year 2013, compared to a decrease of 2.4% in fiscal year 2013 from the prior year. the increase of $137.3 million in net product sales for fiscal year 2014 was primarily due to a $130.6 million increase in the volume of sales of our adn products and a $11.5 million increase in the volume of sales of our traffix products, partially offset by a $4.7 million reduction in the volume of sales of our arx file virtualization products. the decrease of $19.7 million in net product sales for fiscal year 2013 was primarily due to a $14.0 million reduction in the volume of sales of our adn products and a $5.7 million reduction in the volume of sales of our arx file virtualization products. product sales slowed particularly in the first and second quarters of fiscal year 2013, as many customers evaluated new appliances that were introduced during fiscal year 2014. product sales showed significant sequential growth in the third and fourth quarters of fiscal year 2013, with strong customer demand for the new appliances. sales of our adn products represented 98.1%, 98.7% and 98.4% of total product revenues in fiscal years 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively.
net service revenues increased 16.6% in fiscal year 2014 from fiscal year 2013, compared to an increase of 22.2% in fiscal year 2013 from the prior year. the increases in service revenue were the result of increased purchases or renewals of maintenance contracts driven by additions to our installed base of products, as well as growth in sales of consulting and training offerings.
avnet technology solutions, one of our worldwide distributors, accounted for 14.0%, 16.6% and 17.1% of our total net revenues in fiscal years 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. ingram micro, inc., another worldwide distributor, accounted for 17.4%, 15.7% and 13.8% of our total net revenues in fiscal year 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. westcon, another worldwide distributor, accounted for 14.5% and 11.8% of our total net revenues in fiscal year 2014 and 2013, respectively. ingram micro, inc. and westcon group, inc. accounted for 14.2% and 19.8% of our accounts receivable as of september 30, 2014, respectively. ingram micro, inc. accounted for 18.6% of our accounts receivable as of september 30, 2013. no other distributors accounted for more than 10% of total net revenue or receivables.

other income, net. other income, net, consists primarily of interest income and foreign currency transaction gains and losses. other income, net decreased 48.0% in fiscal year 2014, as compared to fiscal year 2013 and increased 23.1% in fiscal year 2013, as compared to fiscal year 2012. interest income was $5.7 million, $6.3 million and $6.9 million for fiscal years 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. the decrease in other income, net for fiscal year 2014 was primarily due to $1.7 million in foreign currency losses, compared to the prior year and a $1.0 million charge for a legal settlement in the first quarter of fiscal year 2014. the increase in other income, net for fiscal year 2013 as compared to fiscal year 2012 was primarily due to an increase in foreign currency transaction gains of $1.4 million.

provision for income taxes. we recorded a 37.4% provision for income taxes for fiscal year 2014, compared to 36.7% for fiscal year 2013 and 36.3% for fiscal year 2012. the increase in the effective tax rate from fiscal year 2013 to 2014 was primarily due to the expiration of the united states federal credit for increasing research activities at december 31, 2013, and due to additional tax benefit recognized during fiscal year 2013 as a result of the reinstatement of the united states federal credit for increasing research activities retroactive to january 1, 2012.
we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount we believe is more likely than not to be realized. in making these determinations we consider historical and projected taxable income, and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the appropriateness of a valuation allowance. the net increase in the valuation allowance of $1.8 million for fiscal year 2014 was primarily related to tax net operating losses incurred in certain foreign jurisdictions, and state tax credit carryforwards. our net deferred tax assets as of september 30, 2014 and 2013 were $43.1 million and $33.4 million, respectively.
our worldwide effective tax rate may fluctuate based on a number of factors, including variations in projected taxable income in the various geographic locations in which we operate, changes in the valuation of our net deferred tax assets, resolution of potential exposures, tax positions taken on tax returns filed in the various geographic locations in which we operate, and the introduction of new accounting standards or changes in tax laws or interpretations thereof in the various geographic locations in which we operate. we have recorded liabilities to address potential tax exposures related to business and income tax positions we have taken that could be challenged by taxing authorities. the ultimate resolution of these potential exposures may be greater or less than the liabilities recorded which could result in an adjustment to our future tax expense.
liquidity and capital resources we have funded our operations with our cash balances, cash generated from operations and proceeds from public offerings of our securities.

cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments and long-term investments totaled $1,128.3 million as of september 30, 2014 compared to $1,271.1 million as of september 30, 2013, representing a decrease of $142.8 million. the decrease was primarily due to $650.5 million of cash required for the repurchase of outstanding common stock under our share repurchase program in fiscal 2014, and cash requirements of $49.4 million for the purchase of defense.net in the third fiscal quarter, which was partially offset by cash provided by operating activities of $549.0 million for fiscal year 2014. in fiscal year 2013, the increase was primarily due to cash provided by operating activities of $499.7 million, which was partially offset by $200.0 million of additional cash required for the repurchase of outstanding common stock under our share repurchase program in fiscal 2013. the increase in cash provided by operating activities for fiscal year 2013 was also partially offset by $124.9 million for the acquisition of linerate systems and $87.7 million for the acquisition of versafe.
cash provided by operating activities during fiscal year 2014 was $549.0 million compared to $499.7 million in fiscal year 2013 and $495.4 million in fiscal year 2012. cash provided by operating activities resulted primarily from cash generated from net income, after adjusting for non-cash charges such as stock-based compensation, depreciation and amortization charges and changes in operating assets and liabilities.

cash provided by investing activities during fiscal year 2014 was $150.6 million compared to cash used in investing activities of $352.5 million in fiscal year 2013 and cash used in investing activities of $352.3 million in fiscal year 2012. cash provided by investing activities for fiscal year 2014 was primarily the result of the sale and maturity of investments partially offset by the purchase of investments and capital expenditures related to maintaining our operations worldwide, and $49.4 million for the defense.net acquisition. cash used in investing activities for fiscal year 2013 was primarily the result of he purchase of investments and capital expenditures related to maintaining our operations worldwide and $212.6 million for the linerate systems and versafe acquisitions, partially offset by the sale and maturity of investments. cash used in investing activities for fiscal year 2012 was primarily the result of the purchase of investments and capital expenditures related to maintaining our operations worldwide and $128.3 million for the acquisition of traffix systems, partially offset by the sale and maturity of investments.
cash used in financing activities was $605.0 million for fiscal year 2014, compared to $166.3 million for fiscal year 2013 and $149.2 million for fiscal year 2012. cash used in financing activities for fiscal year 2014 included $650.5 million to repurchase common stock under our share repurchase program, which was partially offset by cash received from the exercise of employee stock options and stock purchases under our employee stock purchase plan of $35.3 million and excess tax benefits related to share-based compensation of $10.3 million. cash used in financing activities for fiscal year 2013 included $200.0 million to repurchase common stock under our share repurchase program, which was partially offset by cash received from the exercise of employee stock options and stock purchases under our employee stock purchase plan of $29.6 million and excess tax benefits related to share-based compensation of $4.1 million. cash used in financing activities for fiscal 2012 included $184.8 million to repurchase common stock under our share repurchase program, which was partially offset by cash received from the exercise of employee stock options and stock purchases under our employee stock purchase plan of $25.2 million and excess tax benefits related to share-based compensation of $10.4 million.
based on our current operating and capital expenditure forecasts, we believe that our existing cash and investment balances, together with cash generated from operations should be sufficient to meet our operating requirements for the next twelve months. our future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including our rate of revenue growth, the expansion of our sales and marketing activities, the timing and extent of expansion into new territories, the timing of introductions of new products and enhancements of existing products, and the continuing market acceptance of our products.

as of september 30, 2014, we had approximately $6.8 million of tax liabilities, including interest and penalties, related to uncertain tax positions (see note 6 to our consolidated financial statements). because of the high degree of uncertainty regarding the settlement of these liabilities, we are unable to estimate the years in which future cash outflows may occur.
purchase obligations are comprised of purchase commitments with our contract manufacturers. the agreement with our primary contract manufacturer allows it to procure component inventory on our behalf based on our production forecast. we are obligated to purchase component inventory that the contract manufacturer procures in accordance with the forecast, unless cancellation is given within applicable lead times.

december 15, 2012. we adopted asu 2013-2 in the first quarter of fiscal 2014. the adoption of asu 2013-2 did not have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements, but did require additional disclosures.
in may 2014, the fasb issued asu 2014-09, revenue from contracts with customers (asu 2014-09). asu 2014-09 outlines a new, single comprehensive model for entities to use in accounting for revenue arising from contracts with customers and supersedes most current revenue recognition guidance, including industry-specific guidance. the new model will require revenue recognition to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration a company expects to receive in exchange for those goods or services. the amendments in asu 2014-09 are effective for annual reporting periods beginning after december 15, 2016, including interim periods within that reporting period and early adoption is not permitted. the standard can be applied either retrospectively to each period presented or as a cumulative-effect adjustment as of the date of adoption. we are currently assessing the impact that this updated standard will have on our consolidated financial statements and footnote disclosures.
in june 2014, the fasb issued asu 2014-12, compensation - stock compensation (topic 718): accounting for share-based payments when the terms of an award provide that a performance target could be achieved after the requisite service period (asu 2014-12), which requires that a performance target that affects vesting, and that could be achieved after the requisite service period, be treated as a performance condition. as such, the performance target should not be reflected in estimating the grant date fair value of the award. this update further clarifies that compensation cost should be recognized in the period in which it becomes probable that the performance target will be achieved and should represent the compensation cost attributable to the period(s) for which the requisite service has already been rendered. the new standard is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after december 15, 2015. early adoption is permitted. we do not anticipate that the adoption of this standard will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.

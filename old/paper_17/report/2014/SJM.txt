item 1a.   risk factors.

our business, operations, and financial condition are subject to various risks and uncertainties. the risk factors described below should be carefully considered, together with the other information contained or incorporated by reference in this report and our other filings with the sec, in connection with evaluating the company, our business, and the forward-looking statements contained in this report. additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial also may affect us. the occurrence of any of these known or unknown risks could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.
   we may be unable to grow market share of our products.

we operate in the competitive food industry whose growth potential is generally correlated to population growth. our success depends in part on our ability to grow our brands faster than the population in general. we consider our ability to build and sustain the equity of our brands critical to our market share growth. if we do not succeed in these efforts, our market share growth may slow, which could have a material impact on our results of operations.
   our proprietary brands, packaging designs, and manufacturing methods are essential to the value of our business, and the inability to protect these could harm the value of our brands and adversely affect our sales and profitability.

6
the success of our business depends significantly on our brands, know-how, and other intellectual property. we rely on a combination of trademarks, service marks, trade secrets, patents, copyrights, and similar rights to protect our intellectual property. the success of our growth strategy depends on our continued ability to use our existing trademarks and service marks in order to maintain and increase brand awareness and further develop our brand. if our efforts to protect our intellectual property are not adequate, or if any third party misappropriates or infringes on our intellectual property, the value of our brand may be harmed, which could have a material adverse effect on our business. from time to time, we are engaged in litigation to protect our intellectual property, which could result in substantial costs as well as diversion of management attention.
in particular, we consider our proprietary coffee roasting methods essential to the consistent flavor and richness of our coffee products and, therefore, essential to our coffee brands. because many of the roasting methods we use are not protected by patents, it may be difficult for us to prevent competitors from copying our roasting methods if such methods become known. we also believe that our packaging innovations, such as brick packaging technology and our aromasealtm canisters, are important to the coffee business marketing and operational efforts. if our competitors copy our roasting or packaging methods or develop more advanced roasting or packaging methods, the value of our coffee brands may be diminished, and we could lose customers to our competitors.
   we use a single national broker to represent a portion of our branded products to the retail grocery trade and any failure by the broker to effectively represent us could adversely affect our business.

we use a single national broker in the u.s. to represent a portion of our branded products to the retail grocery trade. our business would suffer disruption if this broker were to default in the performance of its obligations to perform brokerage services or if this broker fails to effectively represent us to the retail grocery trade, which could adversely affect our business.
   loss or interruption of supply from single-source suppliers of raw materials and finished goods could have a disruptive effect on our business and adversely affect our results of operations.

we have elected to source certain raw materials, such as packaging for our folgers coffee products, as well as our jif peanut butter and crisco oil products, and finished goods, such as k-cup® packs, from single sources of supply. while we believe that, except as set forth below, alternative sources of these raw materials and finished goods could be obtained on commercially reasonable terms, loss or an extended interruption in supplies from a single-source supplier would result in additional costs, could have a disruptive short-term effect on our business, and could adversely affect our results of operations.
keurig is our single-source supplier for k-cup® packs which are used in its proprietary keurig® k-cup brewing system. there are a limited number of manufacturers other than keurig that are making cups that will work in such proprietary brewing system. if keurig is unable to supply k-cup® packs to us for any reason, it could be difficult to find an alternative supplier for such goods on commercially reasonable terms, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.
   our results may be adversely impacted as a result of increased cost, limited availability, and/or insufficient quality of raw materials, including commodities and agricultural products.

we and our business partners purchase and use large quantities of many different commodities and agricultural products in the manufacturing of our products, including green coffee, peanuts, sweeteners, edible oils, fruit, wheat, milk, and cocoa. in addition, we and our business partners utilize significant quantities of plastic, glass, and cardboard to package our products and natural gas and fuel oil to manufacture, package, and distribute our products. the prices of these commodities, agricultural products, and other materials are subject to volatility and can fluctuate
7
due to conditions that are difficult to predict, including global supply and demand, commodity market fluctuations, crop sizes and yield fluctuations, weather, natural disasters, currency fluctuations, investor speculation, trade agreements, political unrest, consumer demand, and changes in governmental agricultural programs. in addition, we compete for certain raw materials, notably corn and soy-based agricultural products, with the biofuels industry, which has resulted in increased prices for these raw materials. additionally, farm acreage currently devoted to other agricultural products we purchase may be utilized for biofuels crops resulting in higher cost for the other agricultural products we utilize. although we use basis, futures, and options contracts to manage commodity price volatility in some instances, commodity price increases ultimately result in corresponding increases in our raw material and energy costs.
we expect the green coffee commodity markets to continue to be challenging due to significant ongoing price volatility. for example, during the first half of the 2014 calendar year, drought conditions and coffee tree leaf rust fungus have affected production in key coffee-producing regions, such as brazil and central america. due to the significance of green coffee to our coffee business, combined with our ability to only partially mitigate future price risk through purchasing practices and hedging activities, significant increases or decreases in the cost of green coffee could have an adverse impact on our profitability. in addition, if we are not able to purchase sufficient quantities of green coffee due to any of the above factors or to a worldwide or regional shortage, we may not be able to fulfill the demand for our coffee, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.
   our efforts to manage commodity, foreign currency exchange, and other price volatility through derivative instruments could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.

we use derivative instruments, including commodity futures and options, to reduce the price volatility associated with anticipated commodity purchases. the extent of our derivative position at any given time depends on our assessment of the markets for these commodities. if we fail to take a derivative position and costs subsequently increase, or if we institute a position and costs subsequently decrease, our costs may be greater than anticipated or higher than our competitors costs and our financial results could be adversely affected. in addition, our liquidity may be adversely impacted by the cash margin requirements of the commodities exchanges or the failure of a counterparty to perform in accordance with a contract.
beginning in 2015, we will elect to mark-to-market all of our commodity and foreign currency exchange derivatives through the statement of consolidated income. prior to 2015, mark-to-market gains and losses on derivatives that qualified for hedge accounting as cash flow hedges were initially deferred in accumulated other comprehensive income. as a result of this change in accounting treatment, changes in the fair value of all of our derivatives will be immediately recognized in consolidated earnings, resulting in increased volatility in both gross profit and net income. these gains and losses will be reported in cost of products sold in our statement of consolidated income but excluded from our segment operating results and non-gaap earnings until the related inventory is sold, at which time the gains and losses will be reclassified to segment profit and non-gaap earnings. although this change more accurately aligns the derivative gains and losses with the underlying exposure being hedged within segment results, we may experience more volatility in our consolidated earnings as a result of this change in accounting treatment.
   we may be limited in our ability to pass cost increases on to our customers in the form of price increases or may realize a decrease in sales volume to the extent price increases are implemented.

we may not be able to pass some or all of any increases in the price of raw materials, energy, and other input costs to our customers by raising prices. to the extent competitors do not also increase their prices, customers and consumers may choose to purchase competing products or may shift purchases to private label or other lower-priced offerings, which may adversely affect our results of operations.
8
consumers may be less willing or able to pay a price differential for our branded products, and may increasingly purchase lower-priced offerings and may forego some purchases altogether, especially during economic downturns. retailers may also increase levels of promotional activity for lower-priced offerings as they seek to maintain sales volumes during times of economic uncertainty. accordingly, sales volumes of our branded products could be reduced or lead to a shift in sales mix toward our lower-margin offerings. as a result, decreased demand for our products may adversely affect our results of operations.
   certain of our products are sourced from single manufacturing sites.

we have consolidated our production capacity for certain products, including substantially all of our coffee, fruit spreads, syrups, and toppings production, into single manufacturing sites. similarly, most of our peanut butter is being produced at our facility in lexington, kentucky. the conversion of our facility in memphis, tennessee, into an additional peanut butter plant is expected to be completed during 2015. we could experience a production disruption at these or any of our manufacturing sites resulting in a reduction or elimination of the availability of some of our products. if we are not able to obtain alternate production capability in a timely manner, our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be adversely affected.
   a significant interruption in the operation of any of our supply chain or distribution capabilities could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.

our ability and the ability of our third-party suppliers and service providers, distributors, and contract manufacturers to manufacture, distribute, and sell products is critical to our success. a significant interruption in the operation of any of our manufacturing or distribution capabilities, or the manufacturing or distribution capabilities of our suppliers, distributors, or contract manufacturers, or a service failure by a third-party service provider, whether as a result of adverse weather conditions or a natural disaster, work stoppage, terrorism, pandemic illness, or other causes, could significantly impair our ability to operate our business. notably, as a result of our current restructuring project, substantially all of our coffee production takes place in new orleans, louisiana, which is subject to risks associated with hurricane and other weather-related events. failure to take adequate steps to mitigate the likelihood or potential impact of such events, or to effectively manage such events if they occur, could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.
   our business could be harmed by strikes or work stoppages.

as of april 30, 2014, 26 percent of our employees, located at eight facilities, are covered by collective bargaining agreements. these contracts vary in term depending on location, with one contract expiring in 2015. we cannot assure that we will be able to renew these collective bargaining agreements on the same or more favorable terms as the current agreements, or at all, without production interruptions caused by labor stoppages. if a strike or work stoppage were to occur in connection with negotiations of new collective bargaining agreements or as a result of disputes under collective bargaining agreements with labor unions, our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be materially adversely affected.
   our ability to competitively serve customers depends on the availability of reliable transportation. increases in logistics and other transportation-related costs could adversely impact our results of operations.

logistics and other transportation-related costs have a significant impact on our earnings and results of operations. we use multiple forms of transportation, including ships, trucks, intermodals, and railcars, to bring our products to market. disruption to the timely supply of these
9
services or increases in the cost of these services for any reason, including availability or cost of fuel, regulations affecting the industry, labor shortages in the transportation industry, service failures by third-party service providers, accidents, or natural disasters (which may impact the transportation infrastructure or demand for transportation services), could have an adverse effect on our ability to serve our customers, and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.
   our operations are subject to the general risks of the food industry.

the food industry is subject to risks posed by food spoilage and contamination, product tampering, product recall, and consumer product liability claims. our operations could be impacted by both genuine and fictitious claims regarding our products, as well as our competitors products. in the event of product contamination or tampering, we may need to recall some of our products. a widespread product recall could result in significant loss due to the cost of conducting a product recall, including destruction of inventory and the loss of sales resulting from the unavailability of product for a period of time. we could also suffer losses from a significant product liability judgment against us. a significant product recall or a product liability judgment, involving either us or our competitors, could also result in a loss of consumer confidence in our food products or the food category, and an actual or perceived loss of value of our brands, materially impacting consumer demand.
   changes in our relationships with significant customers, including the loss of our largest customer, could adversely affect our results of operations.

sales to wal-mart stores, inc. and subsidiaries amounted to 27 percent of net sales in 2014. these sales are primarily included in the two u.s. retail market segments. trade receivables at april 30, 2014, included amounts due from wal-mart stores, inc. and subsidiaries of $76.6 million, or 25 percent of the total trade receivables balance. during 2014, our top 10 customers, collectively, accounted for 62 percent of consolidated net sales. we expect that a significant portion of our revenues will continue to be derived from a limited number of customers. our customers are generally not contractually obligated to purchase from us. these customers make purchase decisions based on a combination of price, promotional support, product quality, consumer demand, customer service performance, their desired inventory levels, and other factors. changes in customers strategies, including a reduction in the number of brands they carry or a shift of shelf space to private label products, may adversely affect sales. customers also may respond to price increases by reducing distribution, resulting in reduced sales of our products. additionally, our customers may face financial or other difficulties that may impact their operations and their purchases from us, which could adversely affect our results of operations. a reduction in sales to one or more major customers could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.
   we operate in the competitive food industry and continued demand for our products may be affected by changes in consumer preferences.

we face competition across our product lines from other food companies with the primary methods and factors in competition being product quality, price, packaging, product innovation, nutritional value, convenience, customer service, advertising, and promotion. continued success is dependent on product innovation, the ability to secure and maintain adequate retail shelf space, and effective trade merchandising, advertising, and marketing programs. some of our competitors have substantial financial, marketing, and other resources, and competition with them in our various markets and product lines could cause us to reduce prices, increase marketing or other expenditures, or lose category share. category share and growth could be adversely impacted if we are not successful in introducing new products. in order to generate future revenues and profits, we must continue to sell products that appeal to our customers and consumers. specifically, there are a number of trends in consumer preferences that may impact us and the food industry as a whole, including convenience, taste, consumer dietary trends, and obesity, health, and nutritional concerns.
10
in particular, consumers, public health officials, and government officials have become increasingly concerned about the public health consequences associated with weight management, particularly among young people. prolonged negative perceptions concerning the health implications of certain food products could influence consumer preferences and acceptance of some of our products and marketing programs. although we strive to respond to consumer preferences and social expectations, we may not be successful in these efforts. increasing public concern regarding health issues and failure to satisfy consumer preferences could decrease demand for certain of our products and adversely affect our profitability.
   the success of our business depends substantially on consumer perceptions of our brands.

we are the branded market leader in several categories both in the u.s. and canada. we believe that maintaining and continually enhancing the value of our brands is critical to the success of our business. brand value is based in large part on consumer perceptions. success in promoting and enhancing brand value depends in large part on our ability to provide high-quality products. brand value could diminish significantly as a result of a number of factors, such as if we fail to preserve the quality of our products, if we are perceived to act in an irresponsible manner, if the company or our brands otherwise receive negative publicity, if our brands fail to deliver a consistently positive consumer experience, or if our products become unavailable to consumers. the growing use of social and digital media by consumers increases the speed and extent that information and opinions can be shared. if our brand values are diminished, our revenues and operating results could be materially adversely affected. in addition, anything that harms the pillsbury, dunkin donuts, carnation, borden, douwe egberts, or cumberland brands could adversely affect the success of our exclusive licensing agreements with the owners of these brands.
   we could be subject to adverse publicity or claims from consumers.

certain of our products contain caffeine and other ingredients, the health effects of which are the subject of public scrutiny, including the suggestion that consumption may have adverse health effects. an unfavorable report on the health effects of caffeine or other ingredients present in our products, product recalls, or negative publicity or litigation arising from other health risks could significantly reduce the demand for our products.
we may also be subject to complaints from or litigation by consumers who allege food and beverage-related illness, or other quality, health, or operational concerns. adverse publicity resulting from such allegations could materially adversely affect us, regardless of whether such allegations are true or whether we are ultimately held liable. a lawsuit or claim could result in an adverse decision against us, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.
   our operations are subject to the general risks associated with acquisitions.

our stated long-term strategy is to own and market leading north american food brands sold in the center of the store while maintaining a global perspective. we have historically made strategic acquisitions of brands and businesses and intend to do so in the future in support of this strategy. if we are unable to complete acquisitions or to successfully integrate and develop acquired businesses, we could fail to achieve the anticipated synergies and cost savings, or the expected increases in revenues and operating results, either of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial results. additional potential risks associated with acquisitions are the diversion of managements attention from other business concerns, additional debt leverage, the loss of key employees and customers of the acquired business, the assumption of unknown liabilities, disputes with sellers, and the inherent risk associated with entering a line of business in which we have no or limited prior experience.
11
   weak financial performance, downgrades in our credit ratings, or disruptions in the financial markets may adversely affect our ability to access capital in the future.

we may need new or additional financing in the future to conduct our operations, expand our business, or refinance existing indebtedness. our financial performance, our short-term and long-term credit ratings, the liquidity of the overall capital markets, and the state of the economy, including the food and beverage industry, may make credit and capital markets more difficult for us to access, even though we have an established revolving credit facility. from time to time, we have relied, and also may rely in the future, on access to financial markets as a source of liquidity for working capital requirements, acquisitions, and general corporate purposes. in particular, our access to funds under our revolving credit facility is dependent on the ability of the financial institutions that are parties to that facility to meet their funding commitments. the obligations of the financial institutions under our revolving credit facility are several and not joint and, as a result, a funding default by one or more institutions does not need to be made up by the others. in addition, long-term volatility and disruptions in the capital and credit markets as a result of uncertainty, changing or increased regulation of financial institutions, reduced alternatives, or failure of significant financial institutions could adversely affect our access to the liquidity needed for our businesses in the longer term. such disruptions could require us to take measures to conserve cash until the markets stabilize or until alternative credit arrangements or other funding for our business needs can be arranged. disruptions in the capital and credit markets could also result in higher interest rates on publicly issued debt securities and increased costs under credit facilities. continuation of these disruptions would increase our interest expense and capital costs and could adversely affect our results of operations and financial position.
   a material impairment in the carrying value of acquired goodwill or other intangible assets could negatively affect our consolidated operating results and net worth.

a significant portion of our assets is goodwill and other intangible assets, the majority of which are not amortized but are reviewed at least annually for impairment. at april 30, 2014, the carrying value of goodwill and other intangible assets totaled approximately $6.1 billion, compared to total assets of approximately $9.1 billion and total shareholders equity of approximately $5.0 billion. if the carrying value of these assets exceeds the current estimated fair value, the asset is considered impaired and this could result in a noncash charge to earnings. any such impairment charge would reduce earnings and could be material. events and conditions that could result in impairment include a sustained drop in the market price of our common shares, increased competition or loss of market share, obsolescence, or product claims that result in a significant loss of sales or profitability over the product life. crisco has historically been a leader in the shortening and cooking oils categories. in recent years, however, crisco sales volume has been impacted by substantial price competition with private label offerings, volatile commodity prices, and a decline in the shortening category. the estimated fair value of the crisco trademark decreased approximately $7.0 million, or 4 percent, from 2013 to 2014. we anticipate modest long-term growth for the crisco business due to the competitive landscape of the cooking oils category and assumed a long-term growth rate of 2.5 percent for the 2014 annual impairment test of our indefinite-lived trademarks. a sensitivity analysis was performed on the crisco trademark assuming a hypothetical 50-basis-point increase in the discount rate and a 50-basis-point decrease in the expected long-term growth rate which yielded an estimated fair value slightly below carrying value. the crisco brand continues to be important to the company, and we continue to focus on its long-term health. however, if recent trends continue, the long-term assumptions relative to growth rates and profitability of the crisco brand may not be attained, which could result in an impairment of the crisco trademark.
   changes in tax, environmental, or other regulations and laws, or their application, or failure to comply with existing licensing, trade, and other regulations and laws could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition.

12
our operations are subject to various regulations and laws administered by federal, state, and local government agencies in the u.s., as well as to regulations and laws administered by government agencies in canada and other countries in which we have operations and our products are sold. in particular, the manufacturing, marketing, packaging, labeling, and distribution of food products are each subject to governmental regulation that is increasingly extensive, encompassing such matters as ingredients (including whether a product contains genetically modified ingredients), packaging, advertising, relations with distributors and retailers, health, safety, and the environment. additionally, we are routinely subject to new or modified tax and securities regulations, other laws and regulations, and accounting and reporting standards.
in the u.s., we are required to comply with federal laws, such as the food, drug and cosmetic act, the occupational safety and health act, the clean air act, the clean water act, the resource conservation and recovery act, laws governing equal employment opportunity, and various other federal statutes and regulations. we are also subject to various state and local statutes and regulations. for instance, the california safe drinking water and toxic enforcement act of 1986 (commonly referred to as proposition 65) requires that a specific warning appear on any product sold in the state of california that contains a substance listed by that state as having been found to cause cancer or birth defects. this law exposes all food and beverage producers to the possibility of having to provide warnings on their products. the detection of even a trace amount of a listed substance can subject an affected product to the requirement of a warning label. products containing listed substances that occur naturally or that are contributed to such products solely by a municipal water supply are generally exempt from the warning requirement. if we are required to add warning labels to any of our products or place warnings in certain locations where our products are sold as a result of proposition 65, sales of those products could suffer not only in those locations but elsewhere.
complying with new regulations and laws, or changes to existing regulations and laws, or their application could increase our production costs or adversely affect our sales of certain products. in addition, our failure or inability to comply with applicable regulations and laws could subject us to civil remedies, including fines, injunctions, recalls or seizures, as well as potential criminal sanctions, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition.
   our operations in certain developing markets expose us to regulatory risks.

in many countries outside of the u.s., particularly in those with developing economies, it may be common for others to engage in business practices prohibited by laws and regulations applicable to us, such as the u.s. foreign corrupt practices act or similar local anti-bribery or anti-corruption laws. these laws generally prohibit companies and their employees, contractors, or agents from making improper payments to government officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. failure to comply with these laws could subject us to civil and criminal penalties that could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.
   changes in climate or legal, regulatory, or market measures to address climate change may negatively affect our business and operations.

while scientific consensus on the existence, potential causes, or likely outcomes of global climate change has not yet been reached, researchers continue to aggressively explore this issue. there already exists significant political and scientific concern that emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases may alter the composition of the global atmosphere in ways that are affecting and are expected to continue affecting the global climate. the emission of such greenhouse gases may have an adverse impact on global temperatures, weather patterns, and the frequency and severity of extreme weather and natural disasters. in the event that climate change has a negative effect on agricultural productivity, we may be subject to decreased availability or less favorable pricing for certain commodities that are necessary for our products, such as green coffee, peanuts, sweeteners, edible oils, wheat, milk, cocoa, and various fruits and vegetables. we may also be subjected to decreased availability or less favorable pricing for water as a result
13
of such change, which could impact our manufacturing and distribution operations. in addition, natural disasters and extreme weather conditions may disrupt the productivity of our facilities or the operation of our supply chain.
increasing concern over climate change also may result in more regulatory requirements to reduce or mitigate the effects of greenhouse gases. in the event that such regulations are enacted and are more rigorous than existing regulations, we may experience significant increases in costs of operation and delivery. in particular, increased regulation of utility providers, fuel emissions, or suppliers could substantially increase our operating, distribution, or supply chain costs. we could also face increased costs related to defending and resolving legal claims and other litigation related to climate change. as a result, climate change could negatively affect our results of operations, cash flows, or financial position.
   if our information technology systems fail to perform adequately or we are unable to protect such information technology systems against data corruption, cyber-based attacks, or network security breaches, our operations could be disrupted, and we may suffer financial damage or loss because of lost or misappropriated information.

we rely on information technology networks and systems, including the internet, to process, transmit, and store electronic information. in particular, we depend on our information technology infrastructure to effectively manage our business data, supply chain, logistics, finance, and other business processes and for digital marketing activities and electronic communications between company personnel and our customers and suppliers. if we do not allocate and effectively manage the resources necessary to build, sustain, and protect an appropriate technology infrastructure, or we do not effectively implement system upgrades, our business or financial results could be negatively impacted. security breaches or system failures of our infrastructure, whether due to attacks by hackers, employee error, or other causes, can create system disruptions, shutdowns, or unauthorized disclosure of confidential information. if we are unable to prevent such breaches or failures, our operations could be disrupted, or we may suffer financial damage or loss because of lost or misappropriated information.
in addition, we have outsourced several information technology support services and administrative functions, including accounts payable processing, benefit plan administration, and other functions, to third-party service providers, and may outsource other functions in the future to achieve cost savings and efficiencies. if the service providers to which we outsource these functions do not perform effectively, we may not be able to achieve the expected cost savings and may have to incur additional costs to correct errors made by such service providers. depending on the function involved, such errors may also lead to business disruption, processing inefficiencies, the loss of or damage to intellectual property through security breach, the loss of sensitive data through security breach, or otherwise.
item 7.   managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations.

managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations, including a discussion of liquidity and capital resources, and critical accounting estimates and policies, is incorporated herein by reference to the information set forth in our 2014 annual report to shareholders under the caption managements discussion and analysis, on pages 22 through 34.

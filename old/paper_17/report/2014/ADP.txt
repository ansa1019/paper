item 1a. risk factors our businesses routinely encounter and address risks, some of which may cause our future results to be different than we currently anticipate. risk factors described below represent our current view of some of the most important risks facing our businesses and are important to understanding our business. the following information should be read in conjunction with management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations, quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk and the consolidated financial statements and related notes included in this annual report on form 10-k. this discussion includes a number of forward-looking statements. you should refer to the description of the qualifications and limitations on forward-looking statements in the first paragraph under management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations included in this annual report on form 10-k. the level of importance of each of the following risks may vary from time to time, and any of these risks may have a material effect on our business.
changes in laws and regulations may decrease our revenues and earnings our business is subject to a wide range of complex laws and regulations. changes in laws or governmental regulations, or changes in the interpretation of existing laws or regulations by a regulatory authority, may decrease our revenues and earnings and may require us to change the manner in which we conduct some aspects of our business. for example, a change in regulations either decreasing the amount of taxes to be withheld or allowing less time to remit taxes to government authorities would adversely impact interest income from investing client funds before such funds are remitted to the applicable taxing authorities or client employees. changes in taxation requirements in the united states or in other countries could adversely affect our effective tax rate and our net income. changes in laws that govern the co-employment arrangement between a professional employer organization and its worksite employees may require us to change the manner in which we conduct some aspects of our peo business. health care reform under the affordable care act, as amended, related state laws, and the regulations adopted or to be adopted thereunder, have the potential to impact substantially the way that employers provide health insurance to employees and the health insurance market for the small and midsized businesses that comprise adp totalsource's clients and prospects. we are unable to determine the ultimate impact that health care reform will have on our peo business and our ability to attract and retain peo clients. amendments to money transmitter statutes have required us to receive licenses in some jurisdictions, and the adoption of new money transmitter statutes in other jurisdictions, as well as changes in the interpretation of existing statutes, in the future could require additional registration or licensing, as well as possible changes to the manner in which we conduct some aspects of our money movement business or our client funds investment strategy.
our businesses host, collect, use and store personal information about our clients and employees of our clients, and a security or privacy breach may damage or disrupt our businesses, result in the disclosure of confidential information, damage our reputation, increase our costs and cause losses a number of our businesses host, collect, use and store large amounts of personal information about our clients and employees of our clients, including payroll information, healthcare information, personal and business financial data, social security numbers, bank account numbers, tax information and other sensitive personal and business information. in addition, we collect and maintain personal information of our employees in the ordinary course of our business. we are focused on ensuring our operating environments safeguard and protect personal and business information, and although we believe that we maintain a robust program of information security and controls and none of the threats that we have encountered to date have materially impacted us, the impact of a breach could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.
we are also subject to various laws, rules and regulations relating to the collection, use and security of personal and business information. the future enactment of more restrictive laws, rules or regulations could have an adverse impact on us through increased costs or restrictions on our businesses. in addition, the possession and use of personal information and data in conducting our business subjects us to laws that may require notification to clients or employees of a privacy breach.
globally, attacks on information technology systems continue to grow in frequency, complexity and sophistication. although this is a global problem, it may affect our businesses more than other businesses because malevolent third parties may focus on the amount and type of personal and business information that our businesses host, collect, use and store. any cyber attack, unauthorized intrusion, malicious software infiltration, network disruption, denial of service, corruption of data, or theft of non-public or other sensitive information, or similar act by a malevolent party could create financial liability, regulatory sanction, or a loss of confidence in our ability to serve clients or cause current or potential clients to choose another service provider. as these threats continue to evolve, we may be required to invest significant additional resources to modify and enhance our information security and controls or to investigate and remediate any security vulnerabilities. in addition, while our operating environment is designed to safeguard and protect personal and business information, we do not have the ability to
11
monitor the implementation of similar safeguards by our clients, vendors or their respective employees, and, in any event, third parties may be able to circumvent those security measures.
our systems may be subject to disruptions that could adversely affect our business and reputation many of our businesses are highly dependent on our ability to process, on a daily basis, a large number of complicated transactions. we rely heavily on our payroll, financial, accounting, and other data processing systems. if any of these systems fails to operate properly or becomes disabled even for a brief period of time, we could suffer financial loss, a disruption of our businesses, liability to clients, regulatory intervention, or damage to our reputation. we have disaster recovery, business continuity, and crisis management plans and procedures designed to protect our businesses against a multitude of events including natural disasters, military or terrorist actions, power or communication failures, or similar events. despite our preparations, our plans may not be successful in preventing the loss of client data, service interruptions, disruptions to our operations, or damage to our important facilities.
if we fail to adapt our technology to meet client needs and preferences, the demand for our services may diminish our businesses operate in industries that are subject to rapid technological advances and changing client needs and preferences. in order to remain competitive and responsive to client demands, we continually upgrade, enhance, and expand our existing solutions and services. if we fail to respond successfully to technology challenges, the demand for our services may diminish.
political and economic factors may adversely affect our business and financial results trade, monetary and fiscal policies, and political and economic conditions may substantially change, and credit markets may experience periods of constriction and volatility. when there is a slowdown in the economy, employment levels and interest rates may decrease with a corresponding impact on our businesses. clients may react to worsening conditions by reducing their spending on payroll and other outsourcing services or renegotiating their contracts with us. in addition, a reduction in availability of financing during such conditions, even to borrowers with the highest credit ratings, may limit our access to short-term debt markets to meet liquidity needs required by our employer services business.
we invest our client funds in liquid, investment-grade marketable securities, money market securities, and other cash equivalents. nevertheless, our client fund assets are subject to general market, interest rate, credit, and liquidity risks. these risks may be exacerbated, individually or in unison, during periods of unusual financial market volatility.
we are dependent upon various large banks to execute automated clearing house and wire transfers as part of our client payroll and tax services. while we have contingency plans in place for bank failures, a systemic shutdown of the banking industry would impede our ability to process funds on behalf of our payroll and tax services clients and could have an adverse impact on our financial results and liquidity.
we derive a significant portion of our revenues and operating income outside of the united states and, as a result, we are exposed to market risk from changes in foreign currency exchange rates that could impact our consolidated results of operations, financial position or cash flows.
change in our credit ratings could adversely impact our operations and lower our profitability the major credit rating agencies periodically evaluate our creditworthiness and have given us very strong long-term debt and the highest commercial paper ratings. failure to maintain high credit ratings on long-term and short-term debt could increase our cost of borrowing, reduce our ability to obtain intra-day borrowing required by our employer services business, and ultimately reduce our client interest revenue.
our proposed spin-off of our dealer services business is subject to inherent risks the proposed spin-off of our dealer services business is subject to inherent risks and uncertainties including, among others: risks that the spin-off will not be consummated; increased demands on our management team to accomplish the spin-off; and significant transaction costs and risks from changes in the results of operations of our reportable segments.
we may be unable to attract and retain qualified personnel our ability to grow and provide our clients with competitive services is partially dependent on our ability to attract and retain highly motivated people with the skills to serve our clients. competition for skilled employees in the outsourcing and other markets in which we operate is intense and, if we are unable to attract and retain highly skilled and motivated personnel, results of our operations may suffer.

executive overview on april 10, 2014, we announced that our board of directors approved a plan to separate our dealer services business into an independent publicly traded company through a tax-free spin-off of 100% of dealer services to adp shareholders. we expect to receive at least $700 million in connection with the spin-off, which we plan to return to our shareholders after the spin-off through share repurchases, depending upon market conditions. following the spin-off, we intend to increase the dividend annually, subject to board of director approval, keeping intact our 39-year track record of consecutive dividend increases. however, we expect to grow the dividend at a slower rate than earnings to allow us to return to our pre-separation target dividend payout ratio of 55% to 60% in about two years. we believe that the separation of the dealer services business will allow both companies to focus on their respective businesses, industries, and strategic opportunities and we will further direct our attention and resources to our mission and three strategic pillars discussed below. we expect to complete the separation by october 2014.
adp's mission is to help organizations unlock their business potential with our insightful solutions. we seek to embrace new technology and innovation to deliver market leading products and services that meet the needs of our clients across all of our markets. our commitment to service excellence lies at the core of our relationship with each of our clients, whether a small, midsized or large organization in one or multiple countries. our business strategy is based on strategic pillars, which are predicated on our ability to drive innovation and service excellence, and attract, build, and retain the right talent to position adp as the global market leader in human capital management (hcm) services. our strategic pillars are to:
•   grow our integrated suite of cloud-based hcm, benefits, and payroll solutions to serve the u.s. market;
•   invest to grow and scale our hr business process outsourcing solutions by leveraging our platforms and processes; and
•   leverage our global presence to offer clients hcm, benefits, and payroll solutions where they do business.
our results during fiscal 2014 continue to reflect the strength of our underlying business model, including the diversity of our client base and products. our focus on product innovation and improvements in salesforce productivity led to growth in new business bookings. we are pleased with the performance of our business segments, which have continued to drive good revenue growth and pretax margin expansion. revenue retention improved across our business segments and we continue to benefit from the strength of our pays per control metric, which represents the number of employees on our clients' payrolls as measured on a same-store-sales basis utilizing a representative subset of payrolls ranging from small to large businesses that are reflective of a broad range of u.s. geographic regions. during fiscal 2014, we were impacted by the decline in high-margin client interest revenues as a result of lower interest rates, partially offset by an increase in our average client funds balance. we expect this high-margin client interest revenue to increase in the fiscal year ending june 30, 2015, but at a slower rate than our underlying processing revenue.
consolidated revenues in fiscal 2014 increased 8%, to $12,206.5 million, as compared to fiscal 2013. earnings from continuing operations before income taxes increased 10%, to $2,274.6 million, as compared to fiscal 2013 and net earnings from continuing operations increased 11%, to $1,502.6 million, as compared to fiscal 2013. our diluted earnings per share from continuing operations increased 11% to $3.11 in fiscal 2014, as compared to $2.79 in fiscal 2013.
our fiscal 2014 results include $14.9 million of incremental costs directly attributable to our planned separation of our dealer service business and our fiscal 2013 results include a $42.7 million non tax-deductible goodwill impairment charge related to our adp advancedmd business. excluding these items, our earnings from continuing operations before income taxes increased 8%, to $2,289.5 million, as compared to $2,118.8 million for fiscal 2013, and net earnings from continuing operations increased 8%, to $1,517.5 million, compared to $1,400.8 million for fiscal 2013. our adjusted diluted earnings per share from continuing operations increased 9%, to $3.14 for fiscal 2014 from $2.88, as adjusted, for fiscal 2013, due to increased adjusted net earnings from continuing operations and fewer shares outstanding.
our business segment results were solid with employer services' revenues increasing 8% to $8,535.2 million and earnings from continuing operations before income taxes increasing 14% to $2,517.8 million, peo services' revenues increasing 15% to $2,270.9 million and earnings from continuing operations before income taxes increasing 17% to $234.3 million, and dealer services' revenues increasing 7% to $1,951.4 million and earnings from continuing operations before income taxes increasing 14% to $428.1 million in fiscal 2014. employer services' and peo services' new business bookings, which represent annualized recurring revenues anticipated from sales orders to new and existing clients, grew 7% worldwide, to over $1.4 billion in fiscal 2014. dealer services' new business bookings showed strength as we continued to experience the effects of a stronger automotive industry and increased penetration of applications within our base. our key business metrics continue to reflect the core strength of our business model, with our employer services' worldwide client revenue retention rate increasing to an all-time high of 91.4% and our pays per control metric increased 2.8% for the twelve months ended june 30, 2014 from the twelve months ended june 30, 2013.

interest on funds held for clients decreased approximately 11%, or $47.2 million, to $373.7 million from $420.9 million in fiscal 2013. the decrease in the consolidated interest on funds held for clients resulted from the decrease in the average interest rate earned to 1.8% in fiscal 2014, as compared to 2.2% in fiscal 2013, partially offset by growth in average client funds balance of 8% resulting from the continued strength and growth of our employer services segment.
we invest our funds held for clients in accordance with adp's prudent and conservative investment guidelines, where the safety of principal, liquidity, and diversification are the foremost objectives of our investment strategy. the portfolio is predominantly invested in aaa/aa rated fixed-income securities. our client funds investment strategy is structured to allow us to average our way through an interest rate cycle by laddering the maturities of our investments out to five years (in the case of the extended portfolio) and out to ten years (in the case of the long portfolio).  this investment strategy is supported by our short-term financing arrangements necessary to satisfy short-term funding requirements relating to client funds obligations.
our financial condition and balance sheet remain solid at june 30, 2014, with cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities of $4.1 billion, of which $2.2 billion related to outstanding commercial paper borrowings. these borrowings were a normal part of our client funds extended investment strategy. our net cash flows provided by operating activities were $1,821.4 million in fiscal 2014, as compared to $1,577.2 million in fiscal 2013. this increase in cash flows provided by operating activities from fiscal 2013 to fiscal 2014 was due to higher net earnings in fiscal 2014, favorable changes in timing differences on the net components of working capital, and lower pension contributions. the increase in cash provided by investing activities of $2,391.7 million is due to the timing of receipts and disbursements of restricted cash and cash equivalents held to satisfy client funds obligations, partially offset by the timing of purchases and sales of corporate and client fund marketable securities. the increase in cash used in financing activities of $2,509.2 million is primarily due to the timing of cash received from items such as proceeds from reverse repurchase agreements, proceeds from the issuance of commercial paper, and payments made related to client funds as compared to the prior year.
we have a strong business model with a high percentage of recurring revenues, excellent margins, the ability to generate consistent, healthy cash flows, strong client retention, and low capital expenditure requirements. we continue to enhance value to our shareholders, and in fiscal 2014 returned excess cash of $883.1 million through dividends and $667.3 million through our share buyback program. in the last five fiscal years, we have reduced the company's common stock outstanding by approximately 4% through share buybacks, net of the effect of common stock issued under employee stock-based compensation programs. we have also raised the dividend payout per share for 39 consecutive years.

fiscal 2014 compared to fiscal 2013
total revenues total revenues increased $918.9 million, or 8%, to $12,206.5 million in fiscal 2014, as compared to fiscal 2013, due to an increase in revenues in employer services of 8%, or $610.3 million, to $8,535.2 million, an increase in revenues in peo services of 15%, or $297.7 million, to $2,270.9 million, and an increase in revenues in dealer services of 7%, or $131.2 million, to $1,951.4 million.
21
total revenues in fiscal 2014 include interest on funds held for clients of $373.7 million, as compared to $420.9 million in fiscal 2013.  the decrease in the consolidated interest earned on funds held for clients resulted from the decrease in the average interest rate earned to 1.8% in fiscal 2014, as compared to 2.2% in fiscal 2013, partially offset by an increase in our average client funds balance of 8%, to $20.7 billion, in fiscal 2014.
total expenses our total expenses increased $697.1 million, or 7%, to $10,004.8 million in fiscal 2014, as compared to fiscal 2013.  the increase in our total expenses was due to an increase in operating expenses of $517.1 million, an increase in selling, general and administrative expenses of $145.0 million, an increase in systems development and programming costs of $63.7 million and separation costs related to the planned separation of our dealer services business of $14.9 million in fiscal 2014, partially offset by the goodwill impairment charge of $42.7 million in fiscal 2013. total expenses would have increased approximately 8% without the impact of the 2014 separation costs related to the dealer services separation and the fiscal 2013 goodwill impairment charge.
our total costs of revenues increased $582.9 million, or 9%, to $7,221.4 million in fiscal 2014, as compared to fiscal 2013, primarily due to an increase in operating expenses of $517.1 million and an increase in systems development and programming costs of $63.7 million.
operating expenses increased $517.1 million, or 9% in fiscal 2014, as compared to fiscal 2013, due to the increase in revenues described above, including the increases in peo services, which has pass-through costs that are re-billable and which include costs for benefits coverage, workers' compensation coverage and state unemployment taxes for worksite employees.  these pass-through costs were $1,736.0 million for fiscal 2014, which included costs for benefits coverage of $1,383.3 million and costs for workers' compensation and payment of state unemployment taxes of $352.7 million.  these pass-through costs were $1,513.5 million for fiscal 2013, which included costs for benefits coverage of $1,193.2 million and costs for workers' compensation and payment of state unemployment taxes of $320.3 million.  the increase in operating expenses is also due to higher labor-related expenses in employer services of $65.9 million.
systems development and programming costs increased $63.7 million, or 10%, in fiscal 2014, as compared to fiscal 2013, due to increased costs to develop, support, and maintain our products, partially offset by a higher proportion of capitalized costs of our strategic projects.
selling, general and administrative expenses increased $145.0 million, or 6%, in fiscal 2014, as compared to fiscal 2013.  the increase in expenses was related to an increase in selling expenses of $81.8 million resulting from investments in our salesforce and an increase in stock-based compensation expense of $29.7 million, and $17.9 million higher severance expenses in fiscal 2014, as compared to fiscal 2013.
separation costs represent the incremental costs associated with our planned separation of dealer services and totaled $14.9 million for fiscal 2014. we expect to incur separation costs of between $40 million and $50 million during the fiscal year ending june 30, 2015 ("fiscal 2015").

from lower average interest rates of 1.5% in fiscal 2013 to 1.4% in fiscal 2014 and lower average daily corporate funds, which decreased from $4.2 billion in fiscal 2013 to $4.1 billion in fiscal 2014. in addition, we recognized gains of $2.2 million pertaining to the sale of two buildings during fiscal 2013.
earnings from continuing operations before income taxes earnings from continuing operations before income taxes increased $198.5 million, or 10%, to $2,274.6 million in fiscal 2014, which includes the effect of the $14.9 million of separation costs directly attributable to the proposed separation of our dealer services business, compared to $2,076.1 million in fiscal 2013, which includes the effect of the $42.7 million goodwill impairment charge. overall margin increased approximately 20 basis points from 18.4% in fiscal 2013 to 18.6% in fiscal 2014. this increase was due to margin improvements in our business segments, partially offset by approximately 70 basis points of margin decline related to the continued decline in interest on funds held for clients discussed above and 30 basis points of margin decline due to increased stock-based compensation costs. overall margin also benefited 20 basis points from the lower costs related to the incremental separation costs of $14.9 million included in fiscal 2014 compared to the $42.7 million charge related to the goodwill impairment in fiscal 2013.
adjusted earnings from continuing operations before income taxes adjusted earnings from continuing operations before income taxes increased $170.7 million, or 8%, to $2,289.5 million, in fiscal 2014, compared to $2,118.8 million for fiscal 2013, due to increased revenue and margin improvement in our business segments, partially offset by the continued decline in interest on funds held for clients. margin, adjusted for the fiscal 2014 separation costs directly attributable to the proposed separation of our dealer services business and the fiscal 2013 goodwill impairment charge related to our adp advancedmd business, remained flat at 18.8%. margin improvements in our business segments were offset, primarily by approximately 70 basis points of margin decrease related to the continued decline in interest on fund held for clients discussed above and 30 basis of margin decline due to increased stock-based compensation costs.
provision for income taxes the effective tax rate in fiscal 2014 and 2013 was 33.9% and 34.6%, respectively. the effective tax rate in fiscal 2014 includes a 0.2 percentage point increase due to the non tax-deductible separation costs related to our planned separation of our dealer services business and the effective tax rate for fiscal 2013 includes a 0.7 percentage point increase due to the fiscal 2013 non tax-deductible goodwill impairment charge. the remaining decrease of 0 basis points is due to the resolution of certain tax matters and the reversal of a valuation allowance, partially offset by an increase in foreign taxes and reduced foreign tax credits available.
net earnings from continuing operations and diluted earnings per share from continuing operations net earnings from continuing operations increased $144.5 million, or 11%, to $1,502.6 million in fiscal 2014, compared to $1,358.1 million in fiscal 2013, which includes the effect of the $42.7 million goodwill impairment charge. diluted earnings per share from continuing operations increased 11% to $3.11 in fiscal 2014, as compared to $2.79 in fiscal 2013.

net cash flows provided by operating activities were $1,821.4 million for fiscal 2014, as compared to $1,577.2 million for fiscal 2013.  the increase in net cash flows provided by operating activities was due to $110.1 million higher net earnings in fiscal 2014, a lower pension contribution of $50.6 million, and a favorable change in the remaining components of net working capital. for the year ended june 30, 2014, other operating activities include a $49.9 million use of funds and financing activities include a $49.9 million source of funds for excess tax benefits related to stock-based compensation. for the year ended june 30, 2013, other operating activities include a $16.2 million use of funds and financing activities include a $16.2 million source of funds for excess tax benefits related to stock-based compensation.
net cash flows provided by investing activities were $813.3 million for fiscal 2014, as compared to net cash flows used in investing activities of $1,578.4 million for fiscal 2013. the net change in cash provided by investing activities is due to the timing of receipts and disbursements of restricted cash and cash equivalents held to satisfy client funds obligations of $2,698.8 million and a decrease in the purchases of corporate and client funds marketable securities of $1,487.7 million, partially offset by the a decrease in proceeds from sales and maturities of corporate and clients funds marketable securities of $1,579.1 million.
net cash flows used in financing activities were $2,358.2 million for fiscal 2014 as compared to net cash flows provided by financing activities of $151.0 million for fiscal 2013.  the net change in cash provided by financing activities is due to the net decrease in client funds obligations of $4,128.0 million as a result of the timing of cash received and payments made related to client funds and the timing of our borrowings and repayments of our reverse repurchase obligations, partially offset by the net increase in proceeds from commercial paper borrowings of $2,173.0 million.
we purchased approximately 9.0 million shares of our common stock at an average price per share of $75.06 during fiscal 2014 compared to purchases of 10.4 million shares at an average price per share of $61.89 during fiscal 2013.  from time to time, the company may repurchase shares of its common stock under its authorized share repurchase programs.  the company considers several factors in determining when to execute share repurchases, including, among other things, actual and potential acquisition activity, cash balances and cash flows, issuances due to employee benefit plan activity, and market conditions.
our u.s. short-term funding requirements related to client funds are sometimes obtained through a short-term commercial paper program, which provides for the issuance of up to $7.25 billion in aggregate maturity value of commercial paper, rather than liquidating previously-collected client funds that have already been invested in available-for-sale securities. in july 2014, we increased our u.s. short-term commercial paper program to provide for the issuance of up to $7.5 billion in aggregate maturity value. our commercial paper program is rated a-1+ by standard and poor's and prime-1 by moody's.  these ratings denote the highest quality commercial paper securities.  maturities of commercial paper can range from overnight to up to 364 days.  for fiscal 2014 and 2013, our average borrowings were $2.3 billion and $2.4 billion, respectively, at weighted average interest rate of 0.1% and 0.2%, respectively. the weighted average maturity of the company's commercial paper during fiscal 2014 approximated two days. we have successfully borrowed through the use of our commercial paper program on an as needed basis to meet short-term funding requirements related to client funds obligations. at june 30, 2014, we had $2.2 billion of commercial paper outstanding, which was subsequently repaid on july 1, 2014. at june 30, 2013, we had no outstanding obligations under our short-term commercial paper program.
our u.s. and canadian short-term funding requirements related to client funds obligations are sometimes obtained on a secured basis through the use of reverse repurchase agreements, which are collateralized principally by government and government agency securities, rather than liquidating previously-collected client funds that have already been invested in available-for-sale securities. these agreements generally have terms ranging from overnight to up to five business days.  we have successfully borrowed through the use of reverse repurchase agreements on an as needed basis to meet short-term funding
31
requirements related to client funds obligations. at june 30, 2014, there were no outstanding obligations related to the reverse repurchase agreements. at june 30, 2013, we had $245.9 million of obligations outstanding related to reverse repurchase agreements, which were repaid on july 2, 2013. for fiscal 2014 and 2013, we had average outstanding balances under reverse repurchase agreements of $361.7 million and $362.0 million, respectively, at weighted average interest rates of 0.5% and 0.7%, respectively. in addition, we have $3.25 billion available to us on a committed basis under these reverse repurchase agreements. we believe that we currently meet all conditions set forth in the committed reverse repurchase agreements to borrow thereunder, and we are not aware of any conditions that would prevent us from borrowing part or all of the $3.25 billion available to us under the committed reverse repurchase agreements.
we have a $2.25 billion, 364-day credit agreement with a group of lenders that matures in june 2015. in addition, we have a five-year $2.0 billion credit facility and a five-year $3.25 billion credit facility maturing in june 2018 and june 2019, respectively, each with an accordion feature under which the aggregate commitment can be increased by $500.0 million, subject to the availability of additional commitments. the interest rate applicable to committed borrowings is tied to libor, the effective federal funds rate, or the prime rate depending on the notification provided by the company to the syndicated financial institutions prior to borrowing.  the company is also required to pay facility fees on the credit agreements. the primary uses of the credit facilities are to provide liquidity to the commercial paper program and funding for general corporate purposes, if necessary.  we had no borrowings through june 30, 2014 under the credit agreements. we believe that we currently meet all conditions set forth in the revolving credit agreements to borrow thereunder, and we are not aware of any conditions that would prevent us from borrowing part or all of the $7.5 billion available to us under the revolving credit agreements.
our investment portfolio does not contain any asset-backed securities with underlying collateral of subprime mortgages, alternative-a mortgages, sub-prime auto loans or sub-prime home equity loans, collateralized debt obligations, collateralized loan obligations, credit default swaps, asset-backed commercial paper, derivatives, auction rate securities, structured investment vehicles or non-investment grade fixed-income securities. we own aaa rated senior tranches of fixed rate credit card, auto loan, rate reduction, and other asset-backed securities, secured predominately by prime collateral.  all collateral on asset-backed securities is performing as expected.  in addition, we own senior debt directly issued by federal home loan banks and federal farm credit banks.  we do own mortgage-backed securities, which represent an undivided beneficial ownership interest in a group or pool of one or more residential mortgages.  these securities are collateralized by the cash flows of 15-year and 30-year residential mortgages and are guaranteed by federal national mortgage association and federal home loan mortgage corporation as to the timely payment of principal and interest.  our client funds investment strategy is structured to allow us to average our way through an interest rate cycle by laddering the maturities of our investments out to five years (in the case of the extended portfolio) and out to ten years (in the case of the long portfolio).  this investment strategy is supported by our short-term financing arrangements necessary to satisfy short-term funding requirements relating to client funds obligations.
capital expenditures for continuing operations in fiscal 2014 were $218.7 million, as compared to $174.8 million in fiscal 2013 and $146.2 million in fiscal 2012. the capital expenditures in fiscal 2014 related to our data center and other facility improvements made to support our operations. we expect capital expenditures in fiscal 2015 to be between $250 million and $275 million.
the following table provides a summary of our contractual obligations as of june 30, 2014:

(1)   these amounts represent the principal repayments of our debt and are included on our consolidated balance sheets. the estimated interest payments due by the corresponding period above are $0.5 million, $0.6 million, $0.1 million, and $0.0 million, respectively, which have been excluded.
(2)   included in these amounts are various facilities and equipment leases and software license agreements. we enter into operating leases in the normal course of business relating to facilities and equipment, as well as the licensing of software. the majority of our lease agreements have fixed payment terms based on the passage of time. certain facility and equipment leases require payment of maintenance and real estate taxes and contain escalation provisions based on future adjustments in price indices. our future operating lease obligations could change if we exit certain contracts or if we enter into additional operating lease agreements.
(3)   purchase obligations are comprised of a $167.9 million reinsurance premium with ace american insurance company for the fiscal 2015 policy year, as well as obligations related to purchase and maintenance agreements on our software, equipment, and other assets.
(4)   we made the determination that net cash payments expected to be paid within the next 12 months, related to unrecognized tax benefits of $56.7 million at june 30, 2014, are expected to be up to $1 million. we are unable to make reasonably reliable estimates as to the period beyond the next 12 months in which cash payments related to unrecognized tax benefits are expected to be paid.
(5)   compensation and benefits primarily relates to amounts associated with our employee benefit plans and other compensation arrangements. these amounts exclude the estimated contributions to our defined benefit plans, which are expected to be $9.5 million in fiscal 2015.
(6)   acquisition-related obligations relate to deferred purchase consideration payments at future dates. a liability is established at the time of the acquisition for these fixed payments.
in addition to the obligations quantified in the table above, we had obligations for the remittance of funds relating to our payroll and payroll tax filing services. as of june 30, 2014, the obligations relating to these matters, which are expected to be paid in fiscal 2015, total $18,963.4 million and were recorded in client funds obligations on our consolidated balance sheets. we had $19,258.0 million of cash and marketable securities that have been impounded from our clients to satisfy such obligations recorded in funds held for clients on our consolidated balance sheets as of june 30, 2014.
adp indemnity provides workers' compensation and employer's liability deductible reimbursement insurance protection for peo services worksite employees up to a $1 million per occurrence. peo services has secured specific per occurrence and aggregate stop loss insurance from a wholly-owned and regulated insurance carrier of aig that covers all losses in excess of the $1 million per occurrence and also any aggregate losses within the $1 million retention that collectively exceed a certain level in certain policy years. should aig and its wholly-owned insurance company be unable to satisfy their contractual obligations, adp would also become responsible for satisfying these worksite employee workers' compensation obligations for these claims in excess of the $1 million per occurrence. we utilize historical loss experience and actuarial judgment to determine the estimated claim liability for the peo services business. premiums are charged to peo services to cover the claims expected to be incurred by the peo services' worksite employees. changes in estimated ultimate incurred losses are recognized by adp indemnity. during fiscal 2014, adp indemnity paid a premium of $142.4 million to enter into a reinsurance agreement with ace american insurance company to cover substantially all losses incurred by adp indemnity for the fiscal 2014 policy year up to the $1 million per occurrence related to the workers' compensation and employers' liability deductible reimbursement insurance protection for peo services worksite employees. adp indemnity paid a premium of $167.9 million in july 2014 to enter into a reinsurance agreement with ace american insurance company to cover substantially all losses for the fiscal 2015 policy year on terms substantially similar to the fiscal 2014 reinsurance policy. at june 30, 2014, adp indemnity's total assets were $378.4 million to satisfy the actuarially estimated unpaid losses of $318.8 million for the policy years since july 1, 2003. adp indemnity paid claims of $45.3 million and $59.5 million, net of insurance recoveries, in fiscal 2014 and 2013, respectively.
in the normal course of business, we also enter into contracts in which we make representations and warranties that relate to the performance of our services and products. we do not expect any material losses related to such representations and warranties.
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our overall investment portfolio is comprised of corporate investments (cash and cash equivalents, short-term marketable securities, and long-term marketable securities) and client funds assets (funds that have been collected from clients but not yet remitted to the applicable tax authorities or client employees).
33
our corporate investments are invested in cash and cash equivalents and highly liquid, investment-grade marketable securities.  these assets are available for repurchases of common stock for treasury and/or acquisitions, as well as other corporate operating purposes.  all of our short-term and long-term fixed-income securities are classified as available-for-sale securities.
our client funds assets are invested with safety of principal, liquidity, and diversification as the primary objectives. consistent with those objectives, we also seek to maximize interest income and to minimize the volatility of interest income.  client funds assets are invested in highly liquid, investment-grade marketable securities, with a maximum maturity of 10 years at the time of purchase and money market securities and other cash equivalents.  at june 30, 2014, approximately 92% of the available-for-sale securities categorized as u.s. treasury and direct obligations of u.s. government agencies were invested in senior, unsecured, non-callable debt directly issued by the federal home loan banks and federal farm credit banks.
we utilize a strategy by which we extend the maturities of our investment portfolio for funds held for clients and employ short-term financing arrangements to satisfy our short-term funding requirements related to client funds obligations.  our client funds investment strategy is structured to allow us to average our way through an interest rate cycle by laddering the maturities of our investments out to five years (in the case of the extended portfolio) and out to ten years (in the case of the long portfolio).  as part of our client funds investment strategy, we use the daily collection of funds from our clients to satisfy other unrelated client funds obligations, rather than liquidating previously-collected client funds that have already been invested in available-for-sale securities.  we minimize the risk of not having funds collected from a client available at the time such client's obligation becomes due by impounding, in virtually all instances, the client's funds in advance of the timing of payment of such client's obligation.  as a result of this practice, we have consistently maintained the required level of client funds assets to satisfy all of our obligations.
there are inherent risks and uncertainties involving our investment strategy relating to our client funds assets.  such risks include liquidity risk, including the risk associated with our ability to liquidate, if necessary, our available-for-sale securities in a timely manner in order to satisfy our client funds obligations.  however, our investments are made with the safety of principal, liquidity, and diversification as the primary goals to minimize the risk of not having sufficient funds to satisfy all of our client funds obligations.  we also believe we have significantly reduced the risk of not having sufficient funds to satisfy our client funds obligations by consistently maintaining access to other sources of liquidity, including our corporate cash balances, available borrowings under our $7.5 billion commercial paper program (rated a-1+ by standard and poor's and prime-1 (p1) by moody's, the highest possible credit ratings), our ability to execute reverse repurchase transactions ($3.25 billion of which is available on a committed basis), and available borrowings under our $7.5 billion committed revolving credit facilities. the reduced availability of financing during periods of economic turmoil, even to borrowers with the highest credit ratings, may limit our ability to access short-term debt markets to meet the liquidity needs of our business.  in addition to liquidity risk, our investments are subject to interest rate risk and credit risk, as discussed below.
we have established credit quality, maturity, and exposure limits for our investments.  the minimum allowed credit rating at time of purchase for corporate and canadian provincial bonds is bbb, for asset-backed securities is aaa, and for municipal bonds is a.  the maximum maturity at time of purchase for bbb rated securities is 5 years, for single a rated securities is 7 years, and for aa rated and aaa rated securities is 10 years. time deposits and commercial paper must be rated a-1 and/or p-1. money market funds must be rated aaa/aaa-mf.

we are exposed to interest rate risk in relation to securities that mature, as the proceeds from maturing securities are reinvested.  factors that influence the earnings impact of interest rate changes include, among others, the amount of invested funds and the overall portfolio mix between short-term and long-term investments.  this mix varies during the fiscal year and is impacted by daily interest rate changes.  the annualized interest rate earned on our entire portfolio decreased from 2.1% for fiscal 2013 to 1.7% for fiscal 2014.  a hypothetical change in both short-term interest rates (e.g., overnight interest rates or the federal funds rate) and intermediate-term interest rates of 25 basis points applied to the estimated average investment balances and any related short-term borrowings would result in approximately a $10 million impact to earnings from continuing operations before income taxes over the ensuing twelve-month period ending june 30, 2015.  a hypothetical change in only short-term interest rates of 25 basis points applied to the estimated average short-term investment balances and any related short-term borrowings would result in approximately a $5 million impact to earnings from continuing operations before income taxes over the ensuing twelve-month period ending june 30, 2015.
we are exposed to credit risk in connection with our available-for-sale securities through the possible inability of the borrowers to meet the terms of the securities.  we limit credit risk by investing in investment-grade securities, primarily aaa and aa rated securities, as rated by moody's, standard & poor's, and for canadian securities, dominion bond rating service. approximately 82% of our available-for-sale securities held a aaa or aa rating at june 30, 2014.  in addition, we limit amounts that can be invested in any security other than u.s. and canadian government or government agency securities.
we operate and transact business in various foreign jurisdictions and are therefore exposed to market risk from changes in foreign currency exchange rates that could impact our consolidated results of operations, financial position, or cash flows.  we manage our exposure to these market risks through our regular operating and financing activities and, when deemed appropriate, through the use of derivative financial instruments.  we may use derivative financial instruments as risk management tools and not for trading purposes.

recently issued accounting pronouncements in may 2014, the financial accounting standards board ("fasb") issued accounting standards update ("asu") 2014-09, "revenue from contracts with customers," which outlines a single comprehensive model for entities to use in accounting for revenue arising from contracts with customers and supersedes most current revenue recognition guidance, including industry-specific guidance. asu 2014-09 requires an entity to recognize revenue depicting the transfer of goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. asu 2014-09 will also result in enhanced revenue related disclosures. asu 2014-09 is effective for fiscal years, and interim reporting periods within those years, beginning after december 15, 2016. we have not yet determined the impact of asu 2014-09 on our consolidated results of operations, financial condition, or cash flows.
in april 2014, the fasb issued asu 2014-08, "reporting discontinued operations and disclosures of disposals of components of an entity." asu 2014-08 requires that a disposal representing a strategic shift that has (or will have) a major effect on an entity's financial results or a business activity classified as held for sale should be reported as discontinued operations. asu 2014-08 also expands the disclosure requirements for discontinued operations and adds new disclosures for individually significant dispositions that do not qualify as discontinued operations. asu 2014-08 is effective prospectively for fiscal years, and interim reporting periods within those years, beginning after december 15, 2014. the impact of asu 2014-08 is dependent upon the nature of dispositions, if any, after adoption.
in july 2013, the fasb issued asu 2013-11, "presentation of an unrecognized tax benefit when a net operating loss carryforward, a similar tax loss, or a tax credit carryforward exists." asu 2013-11 requires netting of unrecognized tax benefits against a deferred tax asset for a loss or other carryforward that would apply in settlement of the uncertain tax position. asu 2013-11 is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after december 15, 2013. retrospective adoption is permitted. the adoption of asu 2013-11 will not have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations, financial condition, or cash flows.
in july 2013, we adopted asu 2013-02, "comprehensive income (topic 220): reporting of amounts reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income."  asu 2013-02 requires entities to disclose the amount of income (loss) reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income to each respective line item on the income statement. the guidance allows companies to elect whether to disclose the reclassification either on the face of the income statement or in the notes to the financial statements, including cross-referencing other disclosures which provide additional details about these amounts. we have elected to disclose the reclassification in the notes to the financial statements with cross-references to other disclosures which provide additional details about the amounts. the adoption of asu 2013-02 did not have an impact on our consolidated results of operations, financial condition, or cash flows.
critical accounting policies our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america. the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates, judgments, and assumptions that affect reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, and expenses. we continually evaluate the accounting policies and estimates used to prepare the consolidated financial statements. the estimates are based on historical experience and assumptions believed to be reasonable under current facts and circumstances. actual amounts and results could differ from these estimates made by management. certain accounting policies that require significant management estimates and are deemed critical to our results of operations or financial position are discussed below.
revenue recognition. our revenues are primarily attributable to fees for providing services (e.g., employer services' and peo services' payroll processing fees) as well as investment income on payroll funds, payroll tax filing funds and other employer services' client-related funds. peo revenues are reported net of direct pass-through costs, which are costs billed and incurred for peo services' worksite employees, primarily consisting of payroll wages and payroll taxes. benefits, workers' compensation and state unemployment tax fees for worksite employees are included in peo revenues and the associated costs are included in operating expenses. we enter into agreements for a fixed fee per transaction (e.g., number of payees or number of payrolls processed). fees associated with services are recognized in the period services are rendered and earned under service arrangements with clients where service fees are fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured. our service fees are determined based on written price quotations or service agreements having stipulated terms and conditions that do not require management to make any significant judgments or assumptions regarding any potential uncertainties. interest income on collected but not yet remitted funds held for clients is recognized in revenues as earned, as the collection, holding, and remittance of these funds are critical components of providing these services.
36
we also recognize revenues associated with the sale of software systems and associated software licenses (e.g., dealer services' dealer management systems). for a majority of our software sales arrangements, which provide hardware, software licenses, installation, and post-contract customer support, revenues are recognized ratably over the software license term, as vendor-specific objective evidence of the fair values of the individual elements in the sales arrangement does not exist. changes to the elements in an arrangement and the ability to establish vendor-specific objective evidence for those elements could affect the timing of the revenue recognition.
we assess collectability of our revenues based primarily on the creditworthiness of the customer as determined by credit checks and analysis, as well as the customer's payment history. we do not believe that a change in our assumptions utilized in the collectability determination would result in a material change to revenues as no single customer accounts for a significant portion of our revenues.
goodwill. we account for goodwill in accordance with asc 350-10, which states that goodwill should not be amortized, but instead tested for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. we perform this impairment test by first comparing the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying amount. if the carrying value for a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, we then compare the implied fair value of our goodwill to the carrying amount in order to determine the amount of the impairment, if any. we determine the fair value of our reporting units using an equal weighted blended approach, which combines the income approach, which is the present value of expected cash flows, discounted at a risk-adjusted weighted-average cost of capital; and the market approach, which is based on using market multiples of companies in similar lines of business. significant assumptions used in determining the fair value of our reporting units include projected revenue growth rates, profitability projections, working capital assumptions, the weighted-average cost of capital, the determination of appropriate market comparison companies, and terminal growth rates. we had $3,113.8 million of goodwill as of june 30, 2014. based on the fair value analysis completed in the fourth quarter of 2014, management concluded that fair value exceeded carrying value for all reporting units and that no reporting units were at risk of goodwill impairment. in completing the annual impairment test for fiscal 2014, we evaluated the reasonableness of differences noted between the fair value and carrying value of each reporting unit. given the significance of our goodwill, an adverse change to the fair value of goodwill and intangible assets could result in an impairment charge which could be material to our consolidated earnings if we are unable to generate the anticipated revenue growth, synergies and/or cost savings associated with our acquisitions. during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013, there was an impairment charge of $42.7 million for the adp advancedmd reporting unit.
income taxes. the objectives of accounting for income taxes are to recognize the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year and deferred tax liabilities and assets for the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in an entity's financial statements or tax returns. judgment is required in addressing the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our consolidated financial statements or tax returns (e.g., realization of deferred tax assets, changes in tax laws or interpretations thereof). in addition, we are subject to the continuous examination of our income tax returns by the irs and other tax authorities. a change in the assessment of the outcomes of such matters could materially impact our consolidated financial statements.
there is a financial statement recognition threshold and measurement attribute for tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. specifically, the likelihood of an entity's tax benefits being sustained must be "more likely than not" assuming that those positions will be examined by taxing authorities with full knowledge of all relevant information prior to recording the related tax benefit in the financial statements. if a tax position drops below the "more likely than not" standard, the benefit can no longer be recognized. assumptions, judgment and the use of estimates are required in determining if the "more likely than not" standard has been met when developing the provision for income taxes. a change in the assessment of the "more likely than not" standard could materially impact our consolidated financial statements. as of june 30, 2014 and 2013, the company's liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits, which include interest and penalties, were $56.7 million and $70.7 million, respectively.
if certain pending tax matters settle within the next twelve months, the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits may increase or decrease for all open tax years and jurisdictions. based on current estimates, favorable settlements related to various jurisdictions and tax periods could increase earnings up to $10 million in the next twelve months. audit outcomes and the timing of audit settlements are subject to significant uncertainty. we continually assess the likelihood and amount of potential adjustments and adjust the income tax provision, the current tax liability and deferred taxes in the period in which the facts that give rise to a revision become known.
stock-based compensation. we measure stock-based compensation expense based on the fair value of the award on the date of grant. we determine the fair value of stock options issued by using a binomial option-pricing model. the binomial option-pricing model considers a range of assumptions related to volatility, dividend yield, risk-free interest rate and employee

exercise behavior. expected volatilities utilized in the binomial option-pricing model are based on a combination of implied market volatilities, historical volatility of our stock price and other factors. similarly, the dividend yield is based on historical experience and expected future changes. the risk-free rate is derived from the u.s. treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant. the binomial option-pricing model also incorporates exercise and forfeiture assumptions based on an analysis of historical data. the expected life of the stock option grants is derived from the output of the binomial model and represents the period of time that options granted are expected to be outstanding. determining these assumptions is subjective and complex, and therefore, a change in the assumptions utilized could impact the calculation of the fair value of our stock options.

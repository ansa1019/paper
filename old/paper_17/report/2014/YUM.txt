item 1a.   risk factors.
you should carefully review the risks described below as they identify important factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from our forward-looking statements and historical trends.
food safety and food-borne illness concerns may have an adverse effect on our business.
food-borne illnesses, such as e. coli, hepatitis a, trichinosis or salmonella, and food safety issues, such as food tampering, contamination or adulteration, have occurred in the past and could occur in the future. any report or publicity linking us or one of our concept restaurants, including restaurants operated by our concepts' franchisees, to instances of food-borne illness or food safety issues could adversely affect our concepts' brands and reputations as well as our revenues and profits and possibly lead to litigation.  if a customer of our concepts becomes ill from food-borne illnesses or as a result of food safety issues, restaurants in our system may be temporarily closed, which would decrease our revenues.  in addition, instances or allegations of food-borne illness or food safety issues, real or perceived, involving our restaurants, restaurants of competitors, suppliers or distributors (regardless of whether we use or have used those suppliers or distributors), or otherwise involving the types of food served at our
7
restaurants, could result in negative publicity that could adversely affect our sales. the occurrence of food-borne illnesses or food safety issues could also adversely affect the price and availability of affected ingredients, which could result in disruptions in our supply chain and/or lower margins for us and our concepts' franchisees.
our significant china operations subject us to risks that could negatively affect our business.
a significant and growing portion of our restaurants are located, and our revenues and profits originate, in china.  as a consequence, our financial results are increasingly dependent on our results in china, and our business is increasingly exposed to risks there.  these risks include changes in economic conditions (including consumer spending, unemployment levels and wage and commodity inflation), consumer preferences, taxation (including income and non-income based tax rates and laws) and the regulatory environment, as well as increased media scrutiny of our business and industry and increased competition.  in addition, our results of operations in china and the value of our chinese assets are affected by fluctuations in currency exchange rates, which may adversely affect reported earnings.  there can be no assurance as to the future effect of any such changes on our results of operations, financial condition or cash flows.
in addition, any significant or prolonged deterioration in u.s.-china relations could adversely affect our china business.  certain risks and uncertainties of doing business in china are solely within the control of the chinese government, and chinese law regulates the scope of our foreign investments and business conducted within china.  there are also uncertainties regarding the interpretation and application of laws and regulations and the enforceability of intellectual property and contract rights in china.  if we were unable to enforce our intellectual property or contract rights in china, our business would be adversely impacted.
health concerns arising from outbreaks of viruses or other diseases may have an adverse effect on our business.
outbreaks of avian flu occur from time to time around the world, including in china where a significant portion of our profits and revenues originate. it is possible that outbreaks in china and elsewhere could reach pandemic levels.  public concern over avian flu generally may cause fear about the consumption of chicken, eggs and other products derived from poultry, which could cause customers to consume less poultry and related products. this would likely result in lower revenues and profits. avian flu outbreaks could also adversely affect the price and availability of poultry, which could negatively impact our profit margins and revenues. widespread outbreaks could also affect our ability to attract and retain employees.
furthermore, other viruses such as h1n1 or "swine flu" may be transmitted through human contact, and the risk of contracting viruses could cause employees or guests to avoid gathering in public places, which could adversely affect restaurant guest traffic or the ability to adequately staff restaurants.  we could also be adversely affected if jurisdictions in which we have restaurants impose mandatory closures, seek voluntary closures or impose restrictions on operations of restaurants.  even if such measures are not implemented and a virus or other disease does not spread significantly, the perceived risk of infection or health risk may affect our business.
our foreign operations subject us to risks that could negatively affect our business.
a significant portion of our concepts' restaurants are operated in countries and territories outside of the u.s., and we intend to continue expansion of our international operations.  as a result, our business is increasingly exposed to risks inherent in foreign operations.  these risks, which can vary substantially by country, include political instability, corruption, social and ethnic unrest, changes in economic conditions (including consumer spending, unemployment levels and wage and commodity inflation), the regulatory environment, income and non-income based tax rates and laws and consumer preferences as well as changes in the laws and policies that govern foreign investment in countries where our restaurants are operated.
in addition, our results of operations and the value of our foreign assets are affected by fluctuations in currency exchange rates, which may adversely affect reported earnings.  more specifically, an increase in the value of the u.s. dollar relative to other currencies, such as the australian dollar, the british pound, the canadian dollar and the euro, as well as currencies in certain emerging markets, such as the russian ruble, could have an adverse effect on our reported earnings.  there can be no assurance as to the future effect of any such changes on our results of operations, financial condition or cash flows.
failure to protect the integrity and security of personal information of our customers and employees could result in substantial costs, expose us to litigation and damage our reputation.
we receive and maintain certain personal financial and other information about our customers and employees. the use of this information is regulated by evolving and increasingly demanding laws, as well as by certain third-party contracts. if our security and information systems are compromised as a result of data corruption or loss, cyber-attack or a network security incident or our employees, franchisees or vendors fail to comply with these laws and regulations and this information is obtained by unauthorized
8
persons or used inappropriately, it could result in liabilities and penalties and could damage our reputation, cause us to incur substantial costs and result in a loss of customer confidence, which could adversely affect our restaurant operations and results of operations and financial condition. additionally, we could be subject to litigation and government enforcement actions as a result of any such failure.
shortages or interruptions in the availability and delivery of food and other supplies may increase costs or reduce revenues.
the products sold by our concepts and their franchisees are sourced from a wide variety of domestic and international suppliers. we are also dependent upon third parties to make frequent deliveries of food products and supplies that meet our specifications at competitive prices.  shortages or interruptions in the supply of food items and other supplies to our restaurants could adversely affect the availability, quality and cost of items we buy and the operations of our restaurants.  such shortages or disruptions could be caused by inclement weather, natural disasters such as floods, drought and hurricanes, increased demand, problems in production or distribution, the inability of our vendors to obtain credit, political instability in the countries in which foreign suppliers and distributors are located, the financial instability of suppliers and distributors, suppliers' or distributors' failure to meet our standards, product quality issues, inflation, other factors relating to the suppliers and distributors and the countries in which they are located, food safety warnings or advisories or the prospect of such pronouncements or other conditions beyond our control.  a shortage or interruption in the availability of certain food products or supplies could increase costs and limit the availability of products critical to restaurant operations, which in turn could lead to restaurant closures and/or a decrease in sales.  in addition, failure by a principal distributor for our concepts and/or our concepts' franchisees to meet its service requirements could lead to a disruption of service or supply until a new distributor is engaged, and any disruption could have an adverse effect on our business.
we may not attain our target development goals, and aggressive development could cannibalize existing sales.
our growth strategy depends in large part on our ability to increase our net restaurant count in markets outside the u.s., especially china and other emerging markets.  the successful development of new units will depend in large part on our ability and the ability of our concepts' franchisees to open new restaurants and to operate these restaurants on a profitable basis.  we cannot guarantee that we, or our concepts' franchisees, will be able to achieve our expansion goals or that new restaurants will be operated profitably.  further, there is no assurance that any new restaurant will produce operating results similar to those of our existing restaurants.  other risks which could impact our ability to increase our net restaurant count include prevailing economic conditions and our, or our concepts' franchisees', ability to obtain suitable restaurant locations, negotiate acceptable lease or purchase terms for the locations, obtain required permits and approvals in a timely manner, hire and train qualified personnel and meet construction schedules.
expansion into target markets could also be affected by our concepts' franchisees' ability to obtain financing to construct and open new restaurants.  if it becomes more difficult or more expensive for our concepts' franchisees to obtain financing to develop new restaurants, the expected growth of our system could slow and our future revenues and operating cash flows could be adversely impacted.
in addition, the new restaurants could impact the sales of our existing restaurants nearby.  there can be no assurance that sales cannibalization will not occur or become more significant in the future as we increase our presence in existing markets.
changes in commodity and other operating costs could adversely affect our results of operations.
any increase in certain commodity prices, such as food, supply and energy costs, could adversely affect our operating results.  because our concepts and their franchisees provide competitively priced food, our ability to pass along commodity price increases to our customers is limited.  significant increases in gasoline prices could also result in a decrease of customer traffic at our restaurants or the imposition of fuel surcharges by our distributors, each of which could adversely affect our profit margins.  our operating expenses also include employee wages and benefits and insurance costs (including workers' compensation, general liability, property and health) which may increase over time. any such increase could adversely affect our profit margins.
our operating results are closely tied to the success of our concepts' franchisees.
a significant portion of our restaurants are operated by franchisees from whom we derive a significant portion of our revenues in the form of royalty payments. as a result, the success of our business depends in part upon the operational and financial success of our concepts' franchisees.  we have limited control over how our concepts' franchisees' businesses are run, and the inability of our concepts' franchisees to operate successfully could adversely affect our operating results through decreased royalty payments.
9
if franchisees incur too much debt or if economic or sales trends deteriorate such that they are unable to operate profitably or repay existing debt, it could result in financial distress, including insolvency or bankruptcy.  if a significant franchisee or a significant number of our concepts' franchisees become financially distressed, our operating results could be impacted through reduced or delayed royalty payments or increased rent obligations for leased properties on which we are contingently liable.
our success depends substantially on the value and perception of our brands.
our success depends in large part upon our ability to maintain and enhance the value of our brands and our customers' connection to our brands.  brand value is based in part on consumer perceptions on a variety of subjective qualities. business incidents, whether isolated or recurring and whether originating from us, our franchisees or suppliers, can significantly reduce brand value and consumer trust, particularly if the incidents receive considerable publicity or result in litigation.  for example, our brands could be damaged by claims or perceptions about the quality or safety of our products or the quality of our suppliers, regardless of whether such claims or perceptions are true.  any such incident could cause a decline in consumer confidence in, or the perception of, our concepts and/or our products and decrease the value of our brands as well as consumer demand for our products, which would likely result in lower revenues and profits.
our inability or failure to recognize, respond to and effectively manage the accelerated impact of social media could materially adversely impact our business.
there has been a marked increase in the use of social media platforms, including weblogs (blogs), social media websites, and other forms of internet-based communications which allow individuals access to a broad audience of consumers and other interested persons. many social media platforms immediately publish the content their subscribers and participants post, often without filters or checks on accuracy of the content posted. information posted on such platforms at any time may be adverse to our interests and/or may be inaccurate. the dissemination of information online could harm our business, prospects, financial condition, and results of operations, regardless of the information's accuracy. the harm may be immediate without affording us an opportunity for redress or correction.
other risks associated with the use of social media include improper disclosure of proprietary information, negative comments about our concepts, exposure of personally identifiable information, fraud and out-of-date information. the inappropriate use of social media by our customers or employees could increase our costs, lead to litigation or result in negative publicity that could damage our reputation.
we could be party to litigation that could adversely affect us by increasing our expenses or subjecting us to significant monetary damages and other remedies.
from time to time we are involved in a number of legal proceedings, which include consumer, employment, tort, patent, securities, derivative and other litigation (see the discussion of legal proceedings in note 18 to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this report). we are currently a defendant in cases containing class action allegations in which the plaintiffs have brought claims under federal and state wage and hour, disability and other laws. we are also currently a defendant in securities and derivative lawsuits alleging inadequate disclosures in violation of federal securities laws. plaintiffs in these types of lawsuits often seek recovery of very large or indeterminate amounts, and the magnitude of the potential loss relating to such lawsuits may not be accurately estimated.  regardless of whether any claims against us are valid, or whether we are ultimately held liable, such litigation may be expensive to defend and may divert resources away from our operations and negatively impact reported earnings.  with respect to insured claims, a judgment for monetary damages in excess of any insurance coverage could adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations.  any adverse publicity resulting from these allegations may also adversely affect our reputation, which in turn could adversely affect our results.
in addition, the restaurant industry has been subject to claims that relate to the nutritional content of food products, as well as claims that the menus and practices of restaurant chains have led to the obesity of some customers.  we may also be subject to this type of claim in the future and, even if we are not, publicity about these matters (particularly directed at the quick service and fast-casual segments of the industry) may harm our reputation and adversely affect our results.
changes in, or noncompliance with, governmental regulations may adversely affect our business operations, growth prospects or financial condition.
our concepts and their franchisees are subject to numerous laws and regulations around the world. these laws change regularly and are increasingly complex. for example, we are subject to:
10
•   the americans with disabilities act in the u.s. and similar state laws that give civil rights protections to individuals with disabilities in the context of employment, public accommodations and other areas.
•   the u.s. fair labor standards act, which governs matters such as minimum wages, overtime and other working conditions, as well as family leave mandates and a variety of similar state laws that govern these and other employment law matters.
•   anti-bribery and corruption laws and regulations, such as the foreign corrupt practices act, the uk bribery act and similar laws, which are the subject of increasing scrutiny and enforcement around the world.
•   laws and regulations in government-mandated health care benefits such as the patient protection and affordable care act.
•   laws relating to state and local licensing.
•   laws and regulations relating to health, sanitation, food, workplace safety, child labor, including laws prohibiting the use of certain "hazardous equipment" by employees younger than the age of 18 years of age, and fire safety and prevention.
•   laws and regulations relating to union organizing rights and activities.
•   laws relating to information security, privacy, cashless payments and consumer credit, protection and fraud.
•   environmental regulations.
•   federal and state immigration laws and regulations in the u.s.
compliance with new or existing laws and regulations could impact our operations. the compliance costs associated with these laws and regulations could be substantial. any failure or alleged failure to comply with these laws or regulations could adversely affect our reputation, international expansion efforts, growth prospects and financial condition or result in, among other things, litigation, revocation of required licenses, governmental investigations or proceedings, administrative enforcement actions, fines and civil and criminal liability. publicity relating to any such noncompliance could also harm our reputation and adversely affect our revenues.
tax matters, including changes in tax rates, disagreements with taxing authorities and imposition of new taxes could impact our results of operations and financial condition.
a significant percentage of our profit is earned outside the u.s. and taxed at lower rates than the u.s. statutory rates.  historically, the cash we generate outside the u.s. has principally been used to fund our international development. however, if the cash generated by our u.s. business is not sufficient to meet our need for cash in the u.s., we may need to repatriate a greater portion of our international earnings to the u.s. in the future.  we are required to record u.s. income tax expense in our financial statements at the point in time when our management determines that such funds are not permanently invested outside the u.s. this could cause our worldwide effective tax rate to increase materially.
we are subject to income taxes as well as non-income based taxes, such as payroll, sales, use, value-added, net worth, property, withholding and franchise taxes in both the u.s. and various foreign jurisdictions. we are also subject to regular reviews, examinations and audits by the internal revenue service and other taxing authorities with respect to such income and non-income based taxes inside and outside of the u.s. these reviews could include challenges of our methodologies for transfer pricing. if the irs or another taxing authority disagrees with our tax positions, we could face additional tax liability, including interest and penalties.  payment of such additional amounts upon final settlement or adjudication of any disputes could have a material impact on our results of operations and financial position.
in addition, we are directly and indirectly affected by new tax legislation and regulation and the interpretation of tax laws and regulations worldwide. changes in such legislation, regulation or interpretation could increase our taxes and have an adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition. this includes potential changes in tax laws or the interpretation of tax laws arising out of the base erosion profit shifting project initiated by the organization for economic co-operation and development.
11
our business may be adversely impacted by general economic conditions.
our results of operations are dependent upon discretionary spending by consumers, which may be affected by general economic conditions globally or in one or more of the markets we serve.  some of the factors that impact discretionary consumer spending include unemployment, disposable income and consumer confidence.  these and other macroeconomic factors could have an adverse effect on our sales, profitability or development plans, which could harm our financial condition and operating results.
the retail food industry in which we operate is highly competitive.
the retail food industry in which we operate is highly competitive with respect to price and quality of food products, new product development, advertising levels and promotional initiatives, customer service, reputation, restaurant location, and attractiveness and maintenance of properties.  if consumer or dietary preferences change, or our restaurants are unable to compete successfully with other retail food outlets in new and existing markets, our business could be adversely affected.  we also face growing competition as a result of convergence in grocery, deli and restaurant services, including the offering by the grocery industry of convenient meals, including pizzas and entrees with side dishes.  in addition, in the retail food industry, labor is a primary operating cost component.  competition for qualified employees could also require us to pay higher wages to attract a sufficient number of employees, which could adversely impact our profit margins.

item 7.   management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations.
introduction and overview the following management's discussion and analysis ("md&a"), should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements ("financial statements") and the forward-looking statements and the risk factors set forth in item 1a.
yum! brands, inc. ("yum" or the "company") operates, franchises or licenses a worldwide system of over 41,000 restaurants in more than 125 countries and territories operating primarily under the kfc, pizza hut or taco bell (collectively the "concepts") brands. these three concepts are the global leaders in the chicken, pizza and mexican-style food categories, respectively.  of the over 41,000 restaurants, 21% are operated by the company and 79% are operated by franchisees, licensees or unconsolidated affiliates.
the company is focused on the following key growth strategies:
•   building powerful brands through superior marketing, breakthrough innovation and compelling value with a foundation built on winning food and world class operations
•   driving aggressive unit expansion everywhere, especially in emerging markets, and building leading brands in every significant category in china and india
•   creating industry leading returns through franchising and disciplined use of capital, maximizing long-term shareholder value as of december 27, 2014, yum consists of five operating segments:
•   yum china ("china" or "china division") which includes all operations in mainland china
•   yum india ("india" or "india division") which includes all operations in india, bangladesh, nepal and sri lanka
•   the kfc division which includes all operations of the kfc concept outside of china division and india division
•   the pizza hut division which includes all operations of the pizza hut concept outside of china division and india division
•   the taco bell division which includes all operations of the taco bell concept outside of india division prior to 2014, our reporting segments consisted of yum restaurants international ("yri"), the united states, china and india. in the first quarter of 2014 we changed our management reporting structure to align our global operations outside of china and india by brand. as a result, our yri and united states reporting segments were combined, and we began reporting this information by three new reporting segments: kfc division, pizza hut division and taco bell division. china and india remain separate reporting segments. this new structure is designed to drive greater global brand focus, enabling us to more effectively share know-how and accelerate growth. while our consolidated results have not been impacted, we have restated our comparable segment information for consistent presentation.
our ongoing earnings growth model targets a 10% earnings per share ("eps") growth rate, which is based on our ongoing operating profit growth targets of 15% in china, 10% for our kfc division, 8% for our pizza hut division and 6% for our taco bell division. while we believe india is a significant long-term growth driver, our ongoing earnings growth model currently assumes no impact from india growth. see the division discussions within the results of operations of this md&a for further details of our divisional growth models.
2015 eps, prior to special items, is expected to grow at least 10%, consistent with our ongoing targeted growth rate. this includes an expected negative impact of approximately $75 million from foreign currency translation.
we intend for this md&a to provide the reader with information that will assist in understanding our results of operations, including performance metrics that management uses to assess the company's performance. throughout this md&a, we commonly discuss the following performance metrics:
•   the company provides certain percentage changes excluding the impact of foreign currency translation ("fx" or "forex"). these amounts are derived by translating current year results at prior year average exchange rates. we believe the elimination of the foreign currency translation impact provides better year-to-year comparability without the distortion of foreign currency fluctuations.
22
•   system sales growth includes the results of all restaurants regardless of ownership, including company-owned, franchise, unconsolidated affiliate and license restaurants that operate our concepts, except for non-company-owned restaurants for which we do not receive a sales-based royalty. sales of franchise, unconsolidated affiliate and license restaurants typically generate ongoing franchise and license fees for the company (typically at a rate of 4% to 6% of sales). franchise, unconsolidated affiliate and license restaurant sales are not included in company sales on the consolidated statements of income; however, the franchise and license fees are included in the company's revenues. we believe system sales growth is useful to investors as a significant indicator of the overall strength of our business as it incorporates all of our revenue drivers, company and franchise same-store sales as well as net unit growth.
•   same-store sales growth is the estimated percentage change in sales of all restaurants that have been open and in the yum system one year or more. the impact of same-store sales growth on both our company-owned store results and franchise and license fees and income is described elsewhere in this md&amp;a.
•   company restaurant profit ("restaurant profit") is defined as company sales less expenses incurred directly by our company-owned restaurants in generating company sales. company restaurant margin as a percentage of sales is defined as restaurant profit divided by company sales. within the company sales and restaurant profit analysis, store portfolio actions represent the net impact of new unit openings, acquisitions, refranchising and store closures, and other primarily represents the impact of same-store sales as well as the impact of changes in costs such as inflation/deflation.
•   in addition to the results provided in accordance with u.s. generally accepted accounting principles ("gaap") throughout this md&amp;a, the company provides non-gaap measurements which present operating results on a basis before items that we have deemed special. the company uses earnings before special items as a key performance measure of results of operations for the purpose of evaluating performance internally and special items are not included in any of our segment results. this non-gaap measurement is not intended to replace the presentation of our financial results in accordance with gaap. rather, the company believes that the presentation of earnings before special items provides additional information to investors to facilitate the comparison of past and present operations, excluding those items that the company does not believe are indicative of our ongoing operations due to their size and/or nature.
all note references herein refer to the notes to the financial statements.  tabular amounts are displayed in millions of u.s. dollars except per share and unit count amounts, or as otherwise specifically identified. percentages may not recompute due to rounding.
results of operations summary all comparisons within this summary are versus the same period a year ago and exclude the impact of special items.  all system sales growth and operating profit comparisons exclude the impact of foreign currency.
2014 diluted eps increased by 4% to $3.09 per share as our china division, which is our largest profit contributor, had its sales and profits significantly impacted by adverse publicity in july surrounding improper food handling practices by a former supplier.
specifically, on july 20, 2014, an undercover report was televised in china depicting improper food handling practices by supplier shanghai husi, a division of osi, which is a large, global supplier to many in the restaurant industry. this triggered extensive news coverage in china that shook consumer confidence and impacted brand usage. subsequently, the shanghai fda (sfda) launched an investigation into this matter, alleging illegal activity by osi. upon learning of these events we terminated our relationship with osi globally with minimal disruption to our menu offerings in china. even though osi was a minor supplier, sales at kfc and pizza hut were disproportionately impacted given our category-leading positions. since july 21st, china division has experienced a significant, negative impact to sales and profits at both kfc and pizza hut.
prior to that incident, yum experienced a strong first half of the year with china division operating profit increasing 113% and eps increasing 27% through the first two quarters of 2014. at that point the company believed it was well on its way to recovering from a 9% eps decline in 2013, which was driven by declines in kfc china sales and profits due to intense media surrounding an investigation by the sfda into our poultry supply management that began in december 2012, coupled with additional intense media in april 2013 surrounding avian flu in china.
as a result of two supplier incidents impacting kfc china sales in a relatively short period of time, the recovery at kfc china has been slower than expected with same-store sales declining 18% in the fourth quarter of 2014. our pizza hut business in china, which was only impacted by the 2014 supplier incident, is recovering more quickly. china division same-store sales and operating profit declined 5% and 8%, respectively, for the full year 2014.
23
also during 2014:
•   kfc division system sales and operating profit increased by 6% and 13%, respectively. same store sales grew 3% and the division opened 666 new international units.
•   pizza hut division grew system sales by 1% and operating profit declined 13%. same-store sales declined 1% and the division opened 465 new international units.
•   taco bell division system sales and operating profit increased by 4% and 5%, respectively. same-store sales increased 3% and the division opened 236 new units.
•   foreign currency translation negatively impacted operating profit by $27 million.
•   our effective tax rate decreased from 28.0% in 2013 to 25.5% in 2014.

china division the china division has 6,715 units, predominately kfc and pizza hut casual dining restaurants which are the leading quick service and casual dining restaurant brands, respectively, in mainland china. given our strong competitive position, a growing economy and a population of approximately 1.4 billion in mainland china, the company is focused on rapidly adding kfc and pizza hut casual dining restaurants and accelerating the development of pizza hut home service (home delivery). our ongoing earnings growth model in china includes low double-digit percentage unit growth, mid-single digit same-store sales growth and moderate margin improvement, which we expect to drive annual operating profit growth of 15%.

(a)   effective the beginning of 2014, results from our 28 mauritius stores are included in kfc and pizza hut divisions as applicable. prior year units have been adjusted for comparability while division system sales growth, total revenues and operating profit (loss) have not been restated due to the immaterial dollar impact of this change. while there was no impact to our consolidated results, this change negatively impacted india's 2014 system sales growth, reported and excluding fx, by 10% and 11%, respectively. this change negatively impacted india's 2014 total revenues by 2% and operating profit (loss) by $1 million.
(b)   at the beginning of fiscal 2013, we eliminated the period lag that was previously used to facilitate the reporting of our india division's results. accordingly, the india division's 2013 results include the months of january through december 2013. due to the immateriality of the india division's results we did not restate the prior year's operating results for the elimination of this period lag. therefore, the 2012 results continue to include the months of december 2011 through november 2012. additionally, the table above compares these months. if we had compared like months in 2013 to 2012, india division system sales, excluding the impact of foreign currency translation, would have been 2% higher and same-store sales would have been 1% lower versus what is shown above, respectively, for the year ended december 28, 2013.

corporate g&a in 2014, the decrease in corporate g&a was driven by lower pension costs, including lapping higher pension settlement charges, partially offset by higher legal and professional fees.

unallocated closures and impairments in 2014 and 2013, unallocated closures and impairments represent little sheep impairment charges. see note 4.

other unallocated in 2014, other unallocated includes higher foreign exchange losses.
in 2012, other unallocated includes a non-cash gain of $74 million related to our acquisition of little sheep in 2012.
interest expense, net the decrease in interest expense, net for 2014 was driven by lapping $118 million of premiums paid and other costs related to the extinguishment of debt in 2013. the increase in 2013 versus 2012 due to this extinguishment was partially offset by lower average borrowings outstanding and lower interest rates versus 2012. see note 4.
income tax provision in 2014, 2013 and 2012, the reported effective income tax rates were 28.5%, 31.4% and 25.0%, respectively. see note 16 for further discussion of our income tax provision.
consolidated cash flows net cash provided by operating activities was $2,049 million in 2014 versus $2,139 million in 2013. the decrease was primarily driven by higher income taxes paid.
in 2013, net cash provided by operating activities was $2,139 million compared to $2,294 million in 2012. the decrease was primarily due to lower operating profit before special items and higher income taxes paid, partially offset by approximately $100 million in lower pension contributions.
net cash used in investing activities was $936 million in 2014 compared to $886 million in 2013. the increase was primarily driven by lower refranchising proceeds, partially offset by lapping the acquisition of restaurants in turkey from an existing franchisee in april 2013.
in 2013, net cash used in investing activities was $886 million compared to $1,005 million in 2012. the decrease was primarily driven by lapping the acquisition of little sheep and release of related restricted cash. see note 4.
net cash used in financing activities was $1,114 million in 2014 compared to $1,451 million in 2013. the decrease was primarily driven by higher borrowings on our revolving credit facility.
in 2013, net cash used in financing activities was $1,451 million compared to $1,716 million in 2012. the decrease was primarily driven by lower net debt payments and lower share repurchases in 2013, partially offset by higher dividends paid on common stock and lower tax benefits from share-based compensation.
consolidated financial condition the change in our goodwill and intangible assets, net is primarily the result of the impairment of little sheep's goodwill and trademark. see note 4.
the changes in our short-term borrowings and long-term debt are primarily due to the classification of $250 million in senior unsecured notes as short-term due to their september 2015 maturity date. long-term debt is also impacted by outstanding borrowings of $416 million under our revolving credit facility as of december 27, 2014. see note 10.
the decrease in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) is primarily the result of currency translation adjustment losses and net actuarial losses in our u.s. pension plans. see note 15.
liquidity and capital resources operating in the qsr industry allows us to generate substantial cash flows from the operations of our company-owned stores and from our extensive franchise operations which require a limited yum investment. net cash provided by operating activities has exceeded $1 billion in each of the last thirteen fiscal years, including over $2 billion in each fiscal year since 2011. we expect
37
these levels of net cash provided by operating activities to continue in the foreseeable future. however, unforeseen downturns in our business could adversely impact our cash flows from operations from the levels historically realized.
in the event our cash flows from operating activities are negatively impacted by business downturns, we believe we have the ability to temporarily reduce our discretionary spending without significant impact to our long-term business prospects. our discretionary spending includes capital spending for new restaurants, acquisitions of restaurants from franchisees, repurchases of shares of our common stock and dividends paid to our shareholders.
we generate a significant amount of cash from operating activities outside the u.s. that we have used historically to fund our international development. to the extent we have needed to repatriate international cash to fund our u.s. discretionary cash spending, including share repurchases, dividends and debt repayments, we have historically been able to do so in a tax-efficient manner. if we experience an unforeseen decrease in our cash flows from our u.s. businesses or are unable to refinance future u.s. debt maturities we may be required to repatriate future international earnings at tax rates higher than we have historically experienced.
we currently have investment-grade ratings from standard & poor's rating services (bbb) and moody's investors service (baa3). while we do not anticipate a downgrade in our credit rating, a downgrade would increase the company's current borrowing costs and could impact the company's ability to access the credit markets cost effectively if necessary. based on the amount and composition of our debt at december 27, 2014, our interest expense would not materially increase on a full-year basis should we receive a one-level downgrade in our ratings.
discretionary spending during 2014, we invested $1,033 million in capital spending, including $525 million in china, $273 million in kfc, $62 million in pizza hut, $143 million in taco bell and $21 million in india.  for 2015, we estimate capital spending will be approximately $1.1 billion.
during the year ended december 27, 2014 we repurchased shares for $820 million. on november 22, 2013, our board of directors authorized share repurchases through may 2015 of up to $750 million (excluding applicable transaction fees) of our outstanding common stock. on november 20, 2014, our board of directors authorized additional share repurchases through may 31, 2016 of up to $1 billion (excluding applicable transaction fees) of our outstanding common stock. at december 27, 2014, we had remaining capacity to repurchase up to $1.1 billion of outstanding common stock (excluding applicable transaction fees) under these authorizations. shares are repurchased opportunistically as part of our regular capital structure decisions.
during the year ended december 27, 2014, we paid cash dividends of $669 million. additionally, on november 20, 2014 our board of directors approved cash dividends of $0.41 per share of common stock that were distributed on february 6, 2015 to shareholders of record at the close of business on january 16, 2015. the company targets an ongoing annual dividend payout ratio of 40% to 45% of net income.
borrowing capacity our primary bank credit agreement comprises a $1.3 billion syndicated senior unsecured revolving credit facility (the "credit facility") which matures in march 2017 and includes 24 participating banks with commitments ranging from $23 million to $115 million. we believe the syndication reduces our dependency on any one bank.
under the terms of the credit facility, we may borrow up to the maximum borrowing limit, less outstanding letters of credit or banker's acceptances, where applicable. at december 27, 2014, our unused credit facility totaled $824 million net of outstanding letters of credit of $60 million and outstanding borrowings of $416 million. the interest rate for borrowings under the credit facility ranges from 1.0% to 1.75% over the "london interbank offered rate" ("libor"). the exact spread over libor under the credit facility depends upon our performance against specified financial criteria. interest on any outstanding borrowings under the credit facility is payable at least quarterly.
the credit facility is unconditionally guaranteed by our principal domestic subsidiaries and contains financial covenants relating to maintenance of leverage and fixed-charge coverage ratios and also contains affirmative and negative covenants including, among other things, limitations on certain additional indebtedness and liens, and certain other transactions specified in the agreement. given the company's strong balance sheet and cash flows we were able to comply with all debt covenant requirements at december 27, 2014 with a considerable amount of cushion. additionally, the credit facility contains cross-default provisions whereby our failure to make any payment on our indebtedness in a principal amount in excess of $125 million, or the acceleration of the maturity of any such indebtedness, will constitute a default under such agreement.
38
the majority of our remaining long-term debt primarily comprises senior unsecured notes with varying maturity dates from 2015 through 2043 and stated interest rates ranging from 3.75% to 6.88%. the notes represent senior, unsecured obligations and rank equally in right of payment with all of our existing and future unsecured unsubordinated indebtedness. amounts outstanding under senior unsecured notes were $2.8 billion at december 27, 2014. our senior unsecured notes provide that the acceleration of the maturity of any of our indebtedness in a principal amount in excess of $50 million will constitute a default under the senior unsecured notes unless such indebtedness is discharged, or the acceleration of the maturity of that indebtedness is annulled, within 30 days after notice.
contractual obligations our significant contractual obligations and payments as of december 27, 2014 included:
total            less than 1 year             1-3 years            3-5 years           more than 5 years long-term debt obligations(a)          $4,561                    $395                    $953                 $754                    $2,459

(a)   debt amounts include principal maturities and expected interest payments on a nominal basis. debt amounts exclude a fair value adjustment of $7 million related to interest rate swaps that hedge the fair value of a portion of our debt. see note 10.
(b)   these obligations, which are shown on a nominal basis, relate primarily to approximately 7,775 company-owned restaurants. see note 11.
(c)   purchase obligations include agreements to purchase goods or services that are enforceable and legally binding on us and that specify all significant terms, including: fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed, minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction. we have excluded agreements that are cancelable without penalty. purchase obligations relate primarily to supply agreements, marketing, information technology, purchases of property, plant and equipment ("pp&amp;e") as well as consulting, maintenance and other agreements.
(d)   includes actuarially determined timing of payments from our most significant unfunded pension plan as well as scheduled payments from our deferred compensation plan. this table excludes $129 million of future benefit payments for deferred compensation and other unfunded benefit plans to be paid upon separation of employee's service or retirement from the company, as we cannot reasonably estimate the dates of these future cash payments.
we sponsor noncontributory defined benefit pension plans covering certain salaried and hourly employees, the most significant of which are in the u.s. and uk.  the most significant of the u.s. plans, the yum retirement plan (the "plan"), is funded while benefits from our other significant u.s. plan are paid by the company as incurred (see footnote (d) above).  our funding policy for the plan is to contribute annually amounts that will at least equal the minimum amounts required to comply with the pension protection act of 2006.  however, additional voluntary contributions are made from time to time to improve the plan's funded status.  at december 27, 2014 the plan was in a net underfunded position of $191 million.  the uk pension plans were in a net overfunded position of $57 million at our 2014 measurement date.
subsequent to december 27, 2014, we contributed $75 million to the plan.  we do not anticipate making any additional significant contributions to the plan in 2015. investment performance and corporate bond rates have a significant effect on our net funding position as they drive our asset balances and discount rate assumptions.  future changes in investment performance and corporate bond rates could impact our funded status and the timing and amounts of required contributions in 2015 and beyond.
our post-retirement plan in the u.s. is not required to be funded in advance, but is pay as you go.  we made post-retirement benefit payments of $6 million in 2014 and no future funding amounts are included in the contractual obligations table.  see note 13.
39
we have excluded from the contractual obligations table payments we may make for exposures for which we are self-insured, including workers' compensation, employment practices liability, general liability, automobile liability, product liability and property losses (collectively "property and casualty losses") and employee healthcare and long-term disability claims.  the majority of our recorded liability for self-insured property and casualty losses and employee healthcare and long-term disability claims represents estimated reserves for incurred claims that have yet to be filed or settled.
we have not included in the contractual obligations table approximately $25 million of long-term liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits relating to various tax positions we have taken.  these liabilities may increase or decrease over time as a result of tax examinations, and given the status of the examinations, we cannot reliably estimate the period of any cash settlement with the respective taxing authorities.  these liabilities exclude amounts that are temporary in nature and for which we anticipate that over time there will be no net cash outflow.
off-balance sheet arrangements see the franchise loan pool and equipment guarantees and unconsolidated affiliates guarantees sections of note 18 for discussion of our off-balance sheet arrangements.
new accounting pronouncements not yet adopted in april 2014, the financial accounting standards board ("fasb") issued asu no. 2014-08, presentation of financial statements (topic 205) and property, plant, and equipment (topic 360): reporting discontinued operations and disclosures of disposals of components of an entity (asu 2014-08), which limits dispositions that qualify for discontinued operations presentation to those that represent strategic shifts that have or will have a major effect on an entity's operations and financial results. strategic shifts could include a disposal of a major geographical area, a major line of business, a major equity method investment or other major parts of the business. asu 2014-08 is effective prospectively for the company in our first quarter of fiscal 2015. we do not believe the adoption of this standard will have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements.
in may 2014, the fasb issued asu no. 2014-09, revenue from contracts with customers (topic 606) (asu 2014-09), to provide principles within a single framework for revenue recognition of transactions involving contracts with customers across all industries. asu 2014-09 is effective for the company in our first quarter of fiscal 2017 with no early adoption permitted. the standard allows for either a full retrospective or modified retrospective transition method. the standard will not impact our recognition of revenue from company-owned restaurants or our recognition of continuing fees from franchisees or licensees, which are based on a percentage of franchise and license sales. we are continuing to evaluate the impact the adoption of this standard will have on the recognition of other less significant revenue transactions such as initial fees from franchisees and refranchising of company-owned restaurants.
critical accounting policies and estimates our reported results are impacted by the application of certain accounting policies that require us to make subjective or complex judgments.  these judgments involve estimations of the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and may significantly impact our quarterly or annual results of operations or financial condition.  changes in the estimates and judgments could significantly affect our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows in future years.  a description of what we consider to be our most significant critical accounting policies follows.
impairment or disposal of long-lived assets we review long-lived assets of restaurants (primarily pp&e and allocated intangible assets subject to amortization) semi-annually for impairment, or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of a restaurant may not be recoverable.  we evaluate recoverability based on the restaurant's forecasted undiscounted cash flows, which incorporate our best estimate of sales growth and margin improvement based upon our plans for the unit and actual results at comparable restaurants.  for restaurant assets that are deemed to not be recoverable, we write down the impaired restaurant to its estimated fair value.  key assumptions in the determination of fair value are the future after-tax cash flows of the restaurant, which are reduced by future royalties a franchisee would pay, and a discount rate.  the after-tax cash flows incorporate reasonable sales growth and margin improvement assumptions that would be used by a franchisee in the determination of a purchase price for the restaurant.  estimates of future cash flows are highly subjective judgments and can be significantly impacted by changes in the business or economic conditions.
we perform an impairment evaluation at a restaurant group level if it is more likely than not that we will refranchise restaurants as a group.  expected net sales proceeds are generally based on actual bids from the buyer, if available, or anticipated bids given
40
the discounted projected after-tax cash flows for the group of restaurants.  historically, these anticipated bids have been reasonably accurate estimations of the proceeds ultimately received. the after-tax cash flows used in determining the anticipated bids incorporate reasonable assumptions we believe a franchisee would make such as sales growth and margin improvement as well as expectations as to the useful lives of the restaurant assets. these after-tax cash flows also include a deduction for the anticipated, future royalties we would receive under a franchise agreement with terms substantially at market entered into simultaneously with the refranchising transaction.
the discount rate used in the fair value calculations is our estimate of the required rate of return that a franchisee would expect to receive when purchasing a similar restaurant or groups of restaurants and the related long-lived assets.  the discount rate incorporates rates of returns for historical refranchising market transactions and is commensurate with the risks and uncertainty inherent in the forecasted cash flows.
we evaluate indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment on an annual basis or more often if an event occurs or circumstances change that indicates impairment might exist. we perform our annual test for impairment of our indefinite-lived intangible assets at the beginning of our fourth quarter. fair value is an estimate of the price a willing buyer would pay for the intangible asset and is generally estimated by discounting the expected future after-tax cash flows associated with the intangible asset.
our most significant indefinite-lived intangible asset is our little sheep trademark with a book value of $60 million at december 27, 2014. we recorded impairment charges in 2014 of $284 million to write the trademark down to its estimated fair value. see the little sheep acquisition and subsequent impairment section of note 4 for details. no additional indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment was recorded in 2014.
the fair value estimate of the little sheep trademark was based on the estimated price a willing buyer would pay for the asset and was determined using a relief from royalty valuation approach that included future estimated sales as a significant input. the fair value incorporated a discount rate of 13% as our estimate of the required rate of return that a third-party buyer would expect to receive when purchasing the little sheep trademark.
little sheep sales volumes and profit levels were significantly below forecasted amounts in 2014. as this continued a trend of under performance for the business, a significant number of company-operated restaurants were closed or refranchised during 2014 with future plans calling for further focus on franchise-ownership for the concept. as such, the inputs used in determining the fair value for the little sheep trademark reflect a reduction in company ownership to a level of 50 restaurants (from 92 restaurants at december 27, 2014). given so few company-operated restaurants, the primary drivers of fair value in 2014 include franchise revenue growth and revenues from a wholly-owned business that sells seasoning to retail customers. franchise revenue growth reflects annual same-store sales growth of 4% and approximately 35 new franchise units per year, partially offset by the impact of approximately 25 franchise closures per year. the seasoning business is forecasted to generate sales growth rates consistent with historical results.
impairment of goodwill we evaluate goodwill for impairment on an annual basis as of the beginning of our fourth quarter or more often if an event occurs or circumstances change that indicates impairment might exist.  goodwill is evaluated for impairment by determining whether the fair value of our reporting units exceed their carrying values. our reporting units are our business units (which are aligned based on geography) in our kfc, pizza hut and taco bell divisions and individual brands in our china and india divisions.  fair value is the price a willing buyer would pay for the reporting unit, and is generally estimated using discounted expected future after-tax cash flows from company-owned restaurant operations and franchise royalties.
future cash flow estimates and the discount rate are the key assumptions when estimating the fair value of a reporting unit.  future cash flows are based on growth expectations relative to recent historical performance and incorporate sales growth and margin improvement assumptions that we believe a third-party buyer would assume when determining a purchase price for the reporting unit.  the sales growth and margin improvement assumptions that factor into the discounted cash flows are highly correlated as cash flow growth can be achieved through various interrelated strategies such as product pricing and restaurant productivity initiatives. the discount rate is our estimate of the required rate of return that a third-party buyer would expect to receive when purchasing a business from us that constitutes a reporting unit. we believe the discount rate is commensurate with the risks and uncertainty inherent in the forecasted cash flows.
other than the little sheep reporting unit discussed below, the fair values of our other reporting units were substantially in excess of their respective carrying values as of the 2014 goodwill testing date.

as a result of our annual impairment testing we completely impaired what was our most significant goodwill balance of $160 million related to our little sheep reporting unit in 2014. see the little sheep acquisition and subsequent impairment section of note 4 for details. the fair value of the little sheep reporting unit was based on the estimated price a willing buyer would pay, and was determined using an income approach with future cash flow estimates generated by the business as a significant input. future cash flow estimates are primarily impacted by new unit development, sales growth and ownership strategy. this fair value incorporated a discount rate of 13% as our estimate of the required rate of return that a third-party buyer would expect to receive when purchasing the little sheep reporting unit.
little sheep sales volumes and profit levels were significantly below forecasted amounts in 2014. as this continued a trend of under performance for the business, a significant number of company-operated restaurants were closed or refranchised during 2014 with future plans calling for further focus on franchise-ownership for the concept. as such, the inputs used in determining the fair value for the little sheep reporting unit reflect a reduction in company ownership to a level of 50 restaurants (from 92 restaurants at december 27, 2014). given so few company-operated restaurants, the primary drivers of fair value in 2014 include franchise revenue growth and cash flows associated with a wholly-owned business that sells seasoning to retail customers. franchise revenue growth reflects annual same-store sales growth of 4% and approximately 35 new franchise units per year, partially offset by the impact of approximately 25 franchise closures per year. the seasoning business is forecasted to generate sales growth rates and margins consistent with historical results.
when we refranchise restaurants, we include goodwill in the carrying amount of the restaurants disposed of based on the relative fair values of the portion of the reporting unit disposed of in the refranchising versus the portion of the reporting unit that will be retained.  the fair value of the portion of the reporting unit disposed of in a refranchising is determined by reference to the discounted value of the future cash flows expected to be generated by the restaurant and retained by the franchisee, which include a deduction for the anticipated, future royalties the franchisee will pay us associated with the franchise agreement entered into simultaneously with the refranchising transaction. appropriate adjustments are made to the fair value determinations if such franchise agreement is determined to not be at prevailing market rates.  when determining whether such franchise agreement is at prevailing market rates our primary consideration is consistency with the terms of our current franchise agreements both within the country that the restaurants are being refranchised in and around the world.  the company believes consistency in royalty rates as a percentage of sales is appropriate as the company and franchisee share in the impact of near-term fluctuations in sales results with the acknowledgment that over the long-term the royalty rate represents an appropriate rate for both parties.
the discounted value of the future cash flows expected to be generated by the restaurant and retained by the franchisee is reduced by future royalties the franchisee will pay the company.  the company thus considers the fair value of future royalties to be received under the franchise agreement as fair value retained in its determination of the goodwill to be written off when refranchising.  others may consider the fair value of these future royalties as fair value disposed of and thus would conclude that a larger percentage of a reporting unit's fair value is disposed of in a refranchising transaction.
during 2014, the company's most significant refranchising activity was within our china operating segment, where 79 restaurants were refranchised (representing approximately 2% of beginning-of-year company units) and less than $1 million in goodwill was written off (representing approximately 1% of beginning-of-year goodwill).
see note 2 for a further discussion of our policies regarding goodwill.
self-insured property and casualty losses we record our best estimate of the remaining cost to settle incurred self-insured workers' compensation, employment practices liability, general liability, automobile liability, product liability and property losses (collectively "property and casualty losses").  the estimate is based on the results of an independent actuarial study and considers historical claim frequency and severity as well as changes in factors such as our business environment, benefit levels, medical costs and the regulatory environment that could impact overall self-insurance costs.  additionally, our reserve includes a risk margin to cover unforeseen events that may occur over the several years required to settle claims, increasing our confidence level that the recorded reserve is adequate.
see note 18 for a further discussion of our insurance programs.
pension plans certain of our employees are covered under defined benefit pension plans. our two most significant plans are in the u.s. and combined had a projected benefit obligation ("pbo") of $1,301 million and a fair value of plan assets of $991 million at december 27, 2014.
42
the pbo reflects the actuarial present value of all benefits earned to date by employees and incorporates assumptions as to future compensation levels.  due to the relatively long time frame over which benefits earned to date are expected to be paid, our pbos are highly sensitive to changes in discount rates.  for our u.s. plans, we measured our pbos using a discount rate of 4.30% at december 27, 2014.  this discount rate was determined with the assistance of our independent actuary.  the primary basis for our discount rate determination is a model that consists of a hypothetical portfolio of ten or more corporate debt instruments rated aa or higher by moody's or s&p with cash flows that mirror our expected benefit payment cash flows under the plans.  we exclude from the model those corporate debt instruments flagged by moody's or s&p for a potential downgrade (if the potential downgrade would result in a rating below aa by both moody's and s&p) and bonds with yields that were two standard deviations or more above the mean.  in considering possible bond portfolios, the model allows the bond cash flows for a particular year to exceed the expected benefit payment cash flows for that year.  such excesses are assumed to be reinvested at appropriate one-year forward rates and used to meet the benefit payment cash flows in a future year.  the weighted-average yield of this hypothetical portfolio was used to arrive at an appropriate discount rate.  we also ensure that changes in the discount rate as compared to the prior year are consistent with the overall change in prevailing market rates and make adjustments as necessary. a 50 basis-point increase in this discount rate would have decreased these u.s. plans' pbos by approximately $100 million at our measurement date.  conversely, a 50 basis-point decrease in this discount rate would have increased our u.s. plans' pbos by approximately $110 million at our measurement date.
the pension expense we will record in 2015 is also impacted by the discount rate, as well as the long-term rates of return on plan assets and mortality assumptions we selected at our measurement date.  we expect pension expense for our u.s. plans to increase approximately $25 million in 2015.  the increase is primarily driven by an increase in amortization of net loss due to higher net unrecognized losses in accumulated other comprehensive income.  higher net unrecognized losses in accumulated other comprehensive income are primarily a result of a lower discount rate at our 2014 measurement date. a 50 basis-point change in our discount rate assumption at our measurement date would impact our 2015 u.s. pension expense by approximately $13 million.
our estimated long-term rate of return on u.s. plan assets is based upon the weighted-average of historical returns for each asset category.  our expected long-term rate of return on u.s. plan assets, for purposes of determining 2015 pension expense, at december 27, 2014 was 6.75%.  we believe this rate is appropriate given the composition of our plan assets and historical market returns thereon.  a 100 basis point change in our expected long-term rate of return on plan assets assumption would impact our 2015 u.s. pension expense by approximately $9 million. additionally, every 100 basis point variation in actual return on plan assets versus our expected return of 6.75% will impact our unrecognized pre-tax actuarial net loss by approximately $9 million.
assumptions as to mortality of the participants in our u.s. defined benefit pension plans are key estimates in measuring the expected payments which participants may receive over their lifetimes and therefore the amount of expense we will recognize. in determining the most appropriate mortality assumptions for our u.s. defined benefit pension plans at december 27, 2014, we considered the updated mortality tables recently issued by the society of actuaries, coupled with other mortality information available from the social security administration and our consulting actuaries to develop updated mortality assumptions for our participant populations. the use of these updated mortality assumptions increased the benefit obligation for these u.s. defined benefit pension plans by approximately $46 million at december 27, 2014.
a decrease in discount rates has largely contributed to an unrecognized pre-tax actuarial net loss of $314 million included in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) for these u.s. plans at december 27, 2014.  we will recognize approximately $45 million of such loss in net periodic benefit cost in 2015 versus $17 million recognized in 2014. see note 13.
income taxes at december 27, 2014, we had valuation allowances of approximately $230 million to reduce our $1.2 billion of deferred tax assets to amounts that are more likely than not to be realized.  the net deferred tax assets primarily relate to temporary differences in profitable u.s. federal, state and foreign jurisdictions, net operating losses in certain foreign jurisdictions, the majority of which do not expire, and u.s. foreign tax credit carryovers that expire 10 years from inception and for which we anticipate having foreign earnings to utilize. in evaluating our ability to recover our deferred tax assets, we consider future taxable income in the various jurisdictions as well as carryforward periods and restrictions on usage. the estimation of future taxable income in these jurisdictions and our resulting ability to utilize deferred tax assets can significantly change based on future events, including our determinations as to feasibility of certain tax planning strategies. thus, recorded valuation allowances may be subject to material future changes.
as a matter of course, we are regularly audited by federal, state and foreign tax authorities.  we recognize the benefit of positions taken or expected to be taken in our tax returns in our income tax provision when it is more likely than not that the position would be sustained upon examination by these tax authorities.  a recognized tax position is then measured at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than fifty percent likely of being realized upon settlement.  at december 27, 2014 we had $115 million of unrecognized tax benefits, $17 million of which, if recognized, would impact the effective tax rate.  we evaluate unrecognized
43
tax benefits, including interest thereon, on a quarterly basis to ensure that they have been appropriately adjusted for events, including audit settlements, which may impact our ultimate payment for such exposures.
additionally, we have not provided deferred tax for investments in foreign subsidiaries where the carrying values for financial reporting exceed the tax basis, totaling approximately $2.0 billion at december 27, 2014, as we believe the excess is essentially permanently invested.  if our intentions regarding the duration of these investments change, deferred tax may need to be provided on this excess that could materially impact the provision for income taxes.
see note 16 for a further discussion of our income taxes.

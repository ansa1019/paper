item 1a.    risk factors natural gas and crude oil prices fluctuate widely, and low prices for an extended period would likely have a material adverse impact on our business.
our revenues, operating results, financial condition and ability to borrow funds or obtain additional capital depend substantially on prevailing prices for natural gas and oil. lower commodity prices may reduce the amount of natural gas and oil that we can produce economically. historically, natural gas and oil prices and markets have been volatile, with prices fluctuating widely, and they are likely to continue to be volatile. because our reserves are predominantly natural gas (approximately 96% of equivalent proved reserves), changes in natural gas prices have a more significant impact on our financial results than oil prices. natural gas prices, based on the first of the month henry hub index price, were $4.30 per mmbtu in december 2014 and have continued to decline to $2.87 per mmbtu in february 2015, while oil prices, based on the nymex monthly average price, were $59.29 per barrel in december 2014 and have continued to decline to $47.33 per barrel in january 2015. substantial or extended decline in prices in the future would have a negative impact on our oil and gas reserves and financial results. see "recent commodity price declines have resulted in an impairment of our oil and gas properties, and future natural gas and oil price declines may result in additional write-downs of the carrying amount of our assets, which could materially and adversely affect our results of operations."
prices for natural gas and oil are subject to wide fluctuations in response to relatively minor changes in the supply of and demand for natural gas and oil, market uncertainty and a variety of additional factors that are beyond our control. these factors include but are not limited to the following:
•   the levels and location of natural gas and oil supply and demand and expectations regarding supply and demand, including the potential long-term impact of an abundance of natural gas from shale (such as that produced from our marcellus shale properties) on the global natural gas supply;
•   the level of consumer product demand;
•   weather conditions;
•   political conditions or hostilities in natural gas and oil producing regions, including the middle east, africa and south america;
•   the ability of the members of the organization of petroleum exporting countries and other exporting nations to agree to and maintain oil price and production controls;
•   the price level of foreign imports;
•   actions of governmental authorities;
•   the availability, proximity and capacity of gathering, transportation, processing and/or refining facilities in regional or localized areas that may affect the realized price for natural gas and oil;
•   inventory storage levels;
•   the nature and extent of domestic and foreign governmental regulations and taxation, including environmental and climate change regulation;
•   the price, availability and acceptance of alternative fuels;
•   technological advances affecting energy consumption;
20
•   speculation by investors in oil and natural gas;
•   variations between product prices at sales points and applicable index prices; and
•   overall economic conditions, including the value of the u.s. dollar relative to other major currencies.
these factors and the volatile nature of the energy markets make it impossible to predict with any certainty the future prices of natural gas and crude oil. if natural gas and crude oil prices decline significantly for a sustained period of time, the lower prices may cause us to scale back our planned drilling program or adversely affect our ability to make planned expenditures, raise additional capital or meet our financial obligations.
drilling natural gas and oil wells is a high-risk activity.
our growth is materially dependent upon the success of our drilling program. drilling for natural gas and oil involves numerous risks, including the risk that no commercially productive natural gas or oil reservoirs will be encountered. the cost of drilling, completing and operating wells is substantial and uncertain, and drilling operations may be curtailed, delayed or cancelled as a result of a variety of factors beyond our control, including:
•   unexpected drilling conditions, pressure or irregularities in formations;
•   equipment failures or accidents;
•   adverse weather conditions;
•   decreases in natural gas and oil prices;
•   surface access restrictions;
•   loss of title or other title related issues;
•   lack of available gathering or processing facilities or delays in the construction thereof;
•   compliance with, or changes in, governmental requirements and regulation, including with respect to wastewater disposal, discharge of greenhouse gases and fracturing; and
•   costs of shortages or delays in the availability of drilling rigs or crews and the delivery of equipment and materials.
our future drilling activities may not be successful and, if unsuccessful, such failure will have an adverse effect on our future results of operations and financial condition. our overall drilling success rate or our drilling success rate for activity within a particular geographic area may decline. we may be unable to lease or drill identified or budgeted prospects within our expected time frame, or at all. we may be unable to lease or drill a particular prospect because, in some cases, we identify a prospect or drilling location before seeking an option or lease rights in the prospect or location. similarly, our drilling schedule may vary from our capital budget. the final determination with respect to the drilling of any scheduled or budgeted wells will be dependent on a number of factors, including:
•   the results of exploration efforts and the acquisition, review and analysis of the seismic data;
•   the availability of sufficient capital resources to us and the other participants for the drilling of the prospects;
•   the approval of the prospects by other participants after additional data has been compiled;
•   economic and industry conditions at the time of drilling, including prevailing and anticipated prices for natural gas and oil and the availability of drilling rigs and crews;
•   our financial resources and results; and
•   the availability of leases and permits on reasonable terms for the prospects and any delays in obtaining such permits.
these projects may not be successfully developed and the wells, if drilled, may not encounter reservoirs of commercially productive natural gas or oil.
21
our proved reserves are estimates. any material inaccuracies in our reserve estimates or underlying assumptions could cause the quantities and net present value of our reserves to be overstated or understated.
reserve engineering is a subjective process of estimating underground accumulations of natural gas and oil that cannot be measured in an exact manner. the process of estimating quantities of proved reserves is complex and inherently imprecise, and the reserve data included in this document are only estimates. the process relies on interpretations of available geologic, geophysical, engineering and production data. the extent, quality and reliability of this technical data can vary. the process also requires certain economic assumptions, some of which are mandated by the sec, such as natural gas and oil prices. additional assumptions include drilling and operating expenses, capital expenditures, taxes and availability of funds. furthermore, different reserve engineers may make different estimates of reserves and cash flows based on the same data.
results of drilling, testing and production subsequent to the date of an estimate may justify revising the original estimate. accordingly, initial reserve estimates often vary from the quantities of natural gas and oil that are ultimately recovered, and such variances may be material. any significant variance could reduce the estimated quantities and present value of our reserves.
you should not assume that the present value of future net cash flows from our proved reserves is the current market value of our estimated natural gas and oil reserves. in accordance with sec requirements, we base the estimated discounted future net cash flows from our proved reserves on the 12-month average crude oil and natural gas index prices, calculated as the unweighted arithmetic average for the first day of the month price for each month and costs in effect on the date of the estimate, holding the prices and costs constant throughout the life of the properties. actual future prices and costs may differ materially from those used in the net present value estimate, and future net present value estimates using then current prices and costs may be significantly less than the current estimate. in addition, the 10% discount factor we use when calculating discounted future net cash flows for reporting requirements in compliance with the applicable accounting standards may not be the most appropriate discount factor based on interest rates in effect from time to time and risks associated with us or the oil and gas industry in general.
recent commodity price declines have resulted in an impairment of our oil and gas properties, and future natural gas and oil price declines may result in additional write-downs of the carrying amount of our assets, which could materially and adversely affect our results of operations.
the value of our assets depends on prices of natural gas and oil. declines in these prices as well as increases in development costs, changes in well performance, delays in asset development or deterioration of drilling results may result in our having to make material downward adjustments to our estimated proved reserves, and could result in an impairment charge and a corresponding write-down of the carrying amount of our oil and natural gas properties. for example, in december 2014, we recorded a $771.0 million impairment of oil and gas properties in certain non-core fields, primarily in east texas. the impairment of these fields was due to a significant decline in commodity prices in late 2014 and management's decision not to pursue any further activity in these non-core areas in the current price environment. because our reserves are predominately natural gas (approximately 96% of equivalent proved reserves), changes in natural gas prices have a more significant impact on our financial results than oil prices.
we evaluate our oil and gas properties for impairment on a field-by-field basis whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate a property's carrying amount may not be recoverable. we compare expected undiscounted future cash flows to the net book value of the asset. if the future undiscounted expected cash flows, based on our estimate of future crude natural gas and crude oil prices, operating costs and anticipated production from proved reserves and risk-adjusted probable and possible reserves, are lower than the net book value of the asset, the capitalized cost is reduced to fair value. commodity pricing is estimated by using a combination of assumptions management uses in its budgeting and forecasting process as well as historical and current prices adjusted for geographical location and quality differentials, as well as other factors that management believes will impact realizable prices. in the event that commodity prices decline further, there could be a significant revision in the future.
our future performance depends on our ability to find or acquire additional natural gas and oil reserves that are economically recoverable.
in general, the production rate of natural gas and oil properties declines as reserves are depleted, with the rate of decline depending on reservoir characteristics. unless we successfully replace the reserves that we produce, our reserves will decline, eventually resulting in a decrease in natural gas and oil production and lower revenues and cash flow from operations. our future natural gas and oil production is, therefore, highly dependent on our level of success in finding or acquiring additional reserves. we may not be able to replace reserves through our exploration, development and exploitation activities or by acquiring properties at acceptable costs. low natural gas and oil prices may further limit the kinds of reserves that we can develop and produce economically.
22
our reserve report estimates that production from our proved developed reserves as of december 31, 2014 will increase at a rate of 9% during 2015 and then decline at estimated rates of 36%, 23% and 17% during 2016, 2017 and 2018, respectively. future development of proved undeveloped and other reserves currently not classified as proved developed producing will impact these rates of decline. because of higher initial decline rates from newly developed reserves, we consider this pattern fairly typical.
exploration, development and exploitation activities involve numerous risks that may result in, among other things, dry holes, the failure to produce natural gas and oil in commercial quantities and the inability to fully produce discovered reserves.
we have substantial capital requirements, and we may not be able to obtain needed financing on satisfactory terms, if at all.
we rely upon access to both our revolving credit facility and longer-term capital markets as sources of liquidity for any capital requirements not satisfied by cash flow from operations or other sources. future challenges in the global financial system, including the capital markets, may adversely affect our business and our financial condition. our ability to access the capital markets may be restricted at a time when we desire, or need, to raise capital, which could have an impact on our flexibility to react to changing economic and business conditions. adverse economic and market conditions could adversely affect the collectability of our trade receivables and cause our commodity hedging counterparties to be unable to perform their obligations or to seek bankruptcy protection. future challenges in the economy could also lead to reduced demand for natural gas which could have a negative impact on our revenues.
strategic determinations, including the allocation of capital and other resources to strategic opportunities, are challenging, and our failure to appropriately allocate capital and resources among our strategic opportunities may adversely affect our financial condition and reduce our growth rate.
our future growth prospects are dependent upon our ability to identify optimal strategies for our business. in developing our business plan, we considered allocating capital and other resources to various aspects of our businesses including well-development (primarily drilling), reserve acquisitions, exploratory activity, corporate items and other alternatives. we also considered our likely sources of capital. notwithstanding the determinations made in the development of our 2015 plan, business opportunities not previously identified periodically come to our attention, including possible acquisitions and dispositions. if we fail to identify optimal business strategies, or fail to optimize our capital investment and capital raising opportunities and the use of our other resources in furtherance of our business strategies, our financial condition and growth rate may be adversely affected. moreover, economic or other circumstances may change from those contemplated by our 2015 plan, and our failure to recognize or respond to those changes may limit our ability to achieve our objectives.
negative public perception regarding us and/or our industry could have an adverse effect on our operations.
negative public perception regarding us and/or our industry resulting from, among other things, concerns raised by advocacy groups about hydraulic fracturing, oil spills, greenhouse gas or methane emissions and explosions of natural gas transmission lines, may lead to increased regulatory scrutiny, which may, in turn, lead to new state and federal safety and environmental laws, regulations, guidelines and enforcement interpretations. these actions may cause operational delays or restrictions, increased operating costs, additional regulatory burdens and increased risk of litigation. moreover, governmental authorities exercise considerable discretion in the timing and scope of permit issuance and the public may engage in the permitting process, including through intervention in the courts. negative public perception could cause the permits we need to conduct our operations to be withheld, delayed, or burdened by requirements that restrict our ability to profitably conduct our business.
our ability to sell our natural gas and oil production and/or the prices we receive for our production could be materially harmed if we fail to obtain adequate services such as transportation and processing.
the sale of our natural gas and oil production depends on a number of factors beyond our control, including the availability and capacity of transportation and processing facilities. we deliver our natural gas and oil production primarily through gathering systems and pipelines that we do not own. the lack of available capacity on these systems and facilities could reduce the price offered for our production or result in the shut-in of producing wells or the delay or discontinuance of development plans for properties. third-party systems and facilities may be unavailable due to market conditions or mechanical or other reasons. to the extent these services are unavailable, we would be unable to realize revenue from wells served by such facilities until suitable arrangements are made to market our production. our failure to obtain these services on acceptable terms could materially harm our business.
for example, the marcellus shale wells we have drilled to date have generally reported very high initial production rates. the amount of natural gas being produced in the area from these new wells, as well as natural gas produced from other existing wells, may exceed the capacity of the various gathering and intrastate or interstate transportation pipelines currently available.
23
in such event, this could result in wells being shut in or awaiting a pipeline connection or capacity and/or natural gas being sold at much lower prices than those quoted on nymex or than we currently project, which would adversely affect our results of operations and cash flows.
we are subject to complex laws and regulations, including environmental and safety regulations, which can adversely affect the cost, manner or feasibility of doing business.
our operations are subject to extensive federal, state and local laws and regulations, including drilling, permitting and safety laws and regulations and those relating to the generation, storage, handling, emission, transportation and discharge of materials into the environment. these laws and regulations can adversely affect the cost, manner or feasibility of doing business. many laws and regulations require permits for the operation of various facilities, and these permits are subject to revocation, modification and renewal. governmental authorities have the power to enforce compliance with their regulations, and violations could subject us to fines, injunctions or both. these laws and regulations have increased the costs of planning, designing, drilling, installing and operating natural gas and oil facilities, and new laws and regulations or revisions or reinterpretations of existing laws and regulations could further increase these costs. increased scrutiny of our industry may also occur as a result of epa's 2014-2016 national enforcement initiative, "ensuring energy extraction activities comply with environmental laws," through which epa will address incidences of noncompliance from natural gas extraction and production activities that may cause or contribute to significant harm to public health and/or the environment. in addition, we may be liable for environmental damages caused by previous owners of property we purchase or lease. risks of substantial costs and liabilities related to environmental compliance issues are inherent in natural gas and oil operations. for example, we could be required to install expensive pollution control measures or limit or cease activities on lands located within wilderness, wetlands or other environmentally or politically sensitive areas. failure to comply with these laws also may result in the suspension or termination of our operations and subject us to administrative, civil and criminal penalties as well as the imposition of corrective action orders. it is possible that other developments, such as stricter environmental laws and regulations, and claims for damages to property or persons resulting from natural gas and oil production, would result in substantial costs and liabilities.
acquired properties may not be worth what we pay due to uncertainties in evaluating recoverable reserves and other expected benefits, as well as potential liabilities.
successful property acquisitions require an assessment of a number of factors beyond our control. these factors include estimates of recoverable reserves, exploration potential, future natural gas and oil prices, operating costs, production taxes and potential environmental and other liabilities. these assessments are complex and inherently imprecise. our review of the properties we acquire may not reveal all existing or potential problems. in addition, our review may not allow us to fully assess the potential deficiencies of the properties. we do not inspect every well, and even when we inspect a well we may not discover structural, subsurface, or environmental problems that may exist or arise.
there may be threatened or contemplated claims against the assets or businesses we acquire related to environmental, title, regulatory, tax, contract, litigation or other matters of which we are unaware, which could materially and adversely affect our production, revenues and results of operations. we often assume certain liabilities, and we may not be entitled to contractual indemnification for pre-closing liabilities, including environmental liabilities, and our contractual indemnification may not be effective. at times, we acquire interests in properties on an "as is" basis with limited representations and warranties and limited remedies for breaches of such representations and warranties. in addition, significant acquisitions can change the nature of our operations and business if the acquired properties have substantially different operating and geological characteristics or are in different geographic locations than our existing properties.
the integration of the properties we acquire could be difficult, and may divert management's attention away from our existing operations.
the integration of the properties we acquire could be difficult, and may divert management's attention and financial resources away from our existing operations. these difficulties include:
•   the challenge of integrating the acquired properties while carrying on the ongoing operations of our business;
•   the inability to retain key employees of the acquired business;
•   potential lack of operating experience in a geographic market of the acquired properties; and
•   the possibility of faulty assumptions underlying our expectations.
the process of integrating our operations could cause an interruption of, or loss of momentum in, the activities of our business. members of our management may be required to devote considerable amounts of time to this integration process,
24
which will decrease the time they will have to manage our existing business. if management is not able to effectively manage the integration process, or if any significant business activities are interrupted as a result of the integration process, our business could suffer.
we face a variety of hazards and risks that could cause substantial financial losses.
our business involves a variety of operating risks, including:
•   well site blowouts, cratering and explosions;
•   equipment failures;
•   pipe or cement failures and casing collapses, which can release natural gas, oil, drilling fluids or hydraulic fracturing fluids;
•   uncontrolled flows of natural gas, oil or well fluids;
•   pipeline ruptures;
•   fires;
•   formations with abnormal pressures;
•   handling and disposal of materials, including drilling fluids and hydraulic fracturing fluids;
•   release of toxic gas;
•   buildup of naturally occurring radioactive materials;
•   pollution and other environmental risks, including conditions caused by previous owners or lessors of our properties; and
•   natural disasters.
any of these events could result in injury or loss of human life, loss of hydrocarbons, significant damage to or destruction of property, environmental pollution, regulatory investigations and penalties, suspension or impairment of our operations and substantial losses to us.
our operation of natural gas gathering and pipeline systems also involves various risks, including the risk of explosions and environmental hazards caused by pipeline leaks and ruptures. the location of pipelines near populated areas, including residential areas, commercial business centers and industrial sites, could increase these risks. as of december 31, 2014, we owned or operated approximately 3,100 miles of natural gas gathering and pipeline systems. as part of our normal maintenance program, we have identified certain segments of our pipelines that we believe periodically require repair, replacement or additional maintenance.
we may not be insured against all of the operating risks to which we are exposed.
we maintain insurance against some, but not all, of these risks and losses. we do not carry business interruption insurance. in addition, pollution and environmental risks generally are not fully insurable. the occurrence of an event not fully covered by insurance could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.
we have limited control over the activities on properties we do not operate.
other companies operate some of the properties in which we have an interest. as of december 31, 2014, non-operated wells represented approximately 9.2% of our total owned gross wells, or approximately 3.2% of our owned net wells. we have limited ability to influence or control the operation or future development of these non-operated properties, including compliance with environmental, safety and other regulations, or the amount of capital expenditures that we are required to fund with respect to them. the failure of an operator of our wells to adequately perform operations, an operator's breach of the applicable agreements or an operator's failure to act in ways that are in our best interest could reduce our production and revenues. our dependence on the operator and other working interest owners for these projects and our limited ability to influence or control the operation and future development of these properties could materially adversely affect the realization of our targeted returns on capital in drilling or acquisition activities and lead to unexpected future costs.
25
terrorist activities and the potential for military and other actions could adversely affect our business.
the threat of terrorism and the impact of military and other action have caused instability in world financial markets and could lead to increased volatility in prices for natural gas and oil, all of which could adversely affect the markets for our operations. acts of terrorism, including cybersecurity threats to gain unauthorized access to sensitive information or to render data or systems unusable, could be directed against companies operating in the united states. the u.s. government has issued public warnings that indicate energy assets might be specific targets of terrorist organizations. these developments have subjected our operations to increased risk and, depending on their ultimate magnitude, could have a material adverse effect on our business.
competition in our industry is intense, and many of our competitors have substantially greater financial and technological resources than we do, which could adversely affect our competitive position.
competition in the natural gas and oil industry is intense. major and independent natural gas and oil companies actively bid for desirable natural gas and oil properties, as well as for the capital, equipment and labor required to operate and develop these properties. our competitive position is affected by price, contract terms and quality of service, including pipeline connection times, distribution efficiencies and reliable delivery record. many of our competitors have financial and technological resources and exploration and development budgets that are substantially greater than ours. these companies may be able to pay more for exploratory projects and productive natural gas and oil properties and may be able to define, evaluate, bid for and purchase a greater number of properties and prospects than our financial or human resources permit. in addition, these companies may be able to expend greater resources on the existing and changing technologies that we believe will be increasingly important to attaining success in the industry. these companies may also have a greater ability to continue drilling activities during periods of low natural gas and oil prices and to absorb the burden of current and future governmental regulations and taxation.
we may have hedging arrangements that expose us to risk of financial loss and limit the benefit to us of increases in prices for natural gas and oil.
from time to time, when we believe that market conditions are favorable, we use certain financial derivative instruments to manage price risk associated with our natural gas and crude oil production. while there are many different types of derivatives available, we generally utilize collar and swap agreements to attempt to manage price risk more effectively.
the collar arrangements are put and call options used to establish floor and ceiling prices for a fixed volume of production during a certain time period. they provide for payments to counterparties if the index price exceeds the ceiling and payments from the counterparties if the index price falls below the floor. the swap agreements call for payments to, or receipts from, counterparties based on whether the index price for the period is greater or less than the fixed price established for that period when the swap is put in place. these arrangements limit the benefit to us of increases in prices. in addition, these arrangements expose us to risks of financial loss in a variety of circumstances, including when:
•   a counterparty is unable to satisfy its obligations;
•   production is less than expected; or
•   there is an adverse change in the expected differential between the underlying price in the derivative instrument and actual prices received for our production.
the cftc has promulgated regulations to implement statutory requirements for swap transactions. these regulations are intended to implement a regulated market in which most swaps are executed on registered exchanges or swap execution facilities and cleared through central counterparties. while we believe that our use of swap transactions exempt us from certain regulatory requirements, the changes to the swap market due to increased regulation could significantly increase the cost of entering into new swaps or maintaining existing swaps, materially alter the terms of new or existing swap transactions and/or reduce the availability of new or existing swaps. if we reduce our use of swaps as a result of the dodd-frank act and regulations, our results of operations may become more volatile and our cash flows may be less predictable.
we will continue to evaluate the benefit of utilizing derivatives in the future. please read "management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations" in item 7 and "quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk" in item 7a for further discussion concerning our use of derivatives.
the loss of key personnel could adversely affect our ability to operate.
our operations are dependent upon a relatively small group of key management and technical personnel, and one or more of these individuals could leave our employment. the unexpected loss of the services of one or more of these individuals could
26
have a detrimental effect on us. in addition, our drilling success and the success of other activities integral to our operations will depend, in part, on our ability to attract and retain experienced geologists, engineers and other professionals. competition for experienced geologists, engineers and some other professionals is extremely intense. if we cannot retain our technical personnel or attract additional experienced technical personnel, our ability to compete could be harmed.
federal and state legislation and regulatory initiatives related to oil and gas development, including hydraulic fracturing, could result in increased costs and operating restrictions or delays.
most of our exploration and production operations depend on the use of hydraulic fracturing to enhance production from oil and gas wells. this technology involves the injection of fluids-usually consisting mostly of water but typically including small amounts of several chemical additives-as well as sand or other proppants into a well under high pressure in order to create fractures in the rock that allow oil or gas to flow more freely to the wellbore. most of our wells would not be economical without the use of hydraulic fracturing to stimulate production from the well. hydraulic fracturing operations have historically been overseen by state regulators as part of their oil and gas regulatory programs; however, the epa has asserted federal regulatory authority over certain hydraulic fracturing activities involving diesel under the safe drinking water act and has released permitting guidance for hydraulic fracturing activities that use diesel in fracturing fluids in those states where epa is the permitting authority, including pennsylvania. as a result, we may be subject to additional permitting requirements for hydraulic fracturing operations as well as various restrictions on those operations. these permitting requirements and restrictions could result in delays in operations at well sites as well as increased costs to make wells productive. in addition, legislation introduced in congress would provide for federal regulation of hydraulic fracturing under the safe drinking water act and require the public disclosure of certain information regarding the chemical makeup of hydraulic fracturing fluids. if adopted, this legislation could establish an additional level of regulation and permitting at the federal, state or local levels, and could make it easier for third parties opposed to the hydraulic fracturing process to initiate legal proceedings based on allegations that specific chemicals used in the fracturing process could adversely affect the environment, including groundwater, soil or surface water. moreover, in may 2014, the epa announced an advanced notice of proposed rulemaking under the toxic substances control act relating to data collection, including the chemical substances and mixtures used in hydraulic fracturing. further, in may 2013, the department of the interior's bureau of land management (blm) issued a proposed rule to regulate hydraulic fracturing on public and indian land. the rule would require companies to publicly disclose the chemicals used in hydraulic fracturing operations to the blm after fracturing operations have been completed and includes provisions addressing well-bore integrity and flowback water management plans. we voluntarily disclose on a well-by-well basis the chemicals we use in the hydraulic fracturing process at www.fracfocus.org.
on august 16, 2012, the epa published final rules that establish new air emission control requirements for natural gas and ngl production, processing and transportation activities, including new source performance standards to address emissions of sulfur dioxide and volatile organic compounds, and national emission standards for hazardous air pollutants (neshaps) to address hazardous air pollutants frequently associated with gas production and processing activities. among other things, these final rules require the reduction of volatile organic compound emissions from natural gas wells through the use of reduced emission completions or "green completions" on all hydraulically fractured wells constructed or refractured after january 1, 2015. in addition, gas wells were required to use completion combustion device equipment (i.e., flaring) if emissions cannot be directed to a gathering line. further, the final rules under neshaps include maximum achievable control technology (mact) standards for "small" glycol dehydrators that are located at major sources of hazardous air pollutants and modifications to the leak detection standards for valves. in december 2014, the epa finalized additional amendments to these rules that, among other things, distinguished between multiple flowback stages during completion and clarified that storage tanks permanently removed from service are not affected by any requirements. in january 2015, the epa announced plans to propose a rule in summer 2015 governing methane emissions from oil and natural gas completion operations.
compliance with these requirements, especially the imposition of these green completion requirements, may require modifications to certain of our operations, including the installation of new equipment to control emissions at the well site that could result in significant costs, including increased capital expenditures and operating costs, and could adversely impact our business.
in addition to these federal legislative and regulatory proposals, some states in which we operate, such as pennsylvania, west virginia and texas, and certain local governments have adopted, and others are considering adopting, regulations that could restrict hydraulic fracturing in certain circumstances, including requirements regarding chemical disclosure, casing and cementing of wells, withdrawal of water for use in high-volume hydraulic fracturing of horizontal wells, baseline testing of nearby water wells, and restrictions on the type of additives that may be used in hydraulic fracturing operations. for example, the city of denton, texas adopted a moratorium on hydraulic fracturing in november 2014, and new york announced the intention to create a statewide ban on hydraulic fracturing in december 2014. in addition, pennsylvania's act 13 of 2012 became law on february 14, 2012 and amended the state's oil and gas act to impose an impact fee for drilling, increase setbacks from certain water sources, require water management plans, increase civil penalties, strengthen the pennsylvania
27
department of environmental protection's (padep) authority over the issuance of drilling permits, and require the disclosure of chemical information regarding the components in hydraulic fracturing fluids. on december 19, 2013, the pennsylvania supreme court struck down as unconstitutional portions of act 13 that made statewide rules on oil and gas preempt local zoning rules. the remaining challenges to act 13 were remanded to the state commonwealth court, which dismissed those challenges in july 2014. this could result in additional local restrictions on oil and gas activity in the state.
we use a significant amount of water in our hydraulic fracturing operations. our inability to locate sufficient amounts of water, or dispose of or recycle water used in our operations, could adversely impact our operations. moreover, new environmental initiatives and regulations could include restrictions on our ability to conduct certain operations such as hydraulic fracturing or disposal of waste, including, but not limited to, produced water, drilling fluids and other wastes associated with the exploration, development or production of natural gas. compliance with environmental regulations and permit requirements governing the withdrawal, storage and use of surface water or groundwater necessary for hydraulic fracturing of wells may increase our operating costs and cause delays, interruptions or termination of our operations, the extent of which cannot be predicted, all of which could have an adverse effect on our operations and financial condition. for example, in april 2011, padep called on all marcellus shale natural gas drilling operators to voluntarily cease by may 19, 2011 delivering wastewater to those centralized treatment facilities that were grandfathered from the application of padep's total dissolved solids regulations. in october 2011, the epa announced that it plans to develop standards for disposal of wastewater produced from shale gas operations to publicly owned treatment works (potws), which will be proposed in 2015. the regulations will be developed under the epa's effluent guidelines program under the authority of the clean water act. in response to these actions, operators including us have begun to rely more on recycling of flowback and produced water from well sites as a preferred alternative to disposal.
a number of federal agencies are analyzing, or have been requested to review, a variety of environmental issues associated with hydraulic fracturing practices. the epa is conducting a study of the potential environmental effects of hydraulic fracturing on drinking water and groundwater. the epa released a progress report outlining work currently underway on december 21, 2012 and is expected to release a draft report of final results in early 2015. this study and other studies that may be undertaken by epa or other federal agencies could spur initiatives to further regulate hydraulic fracturing under the safe drinking water act, the toxic substances control act, or other statutory and/or regulatory mechanisms.
climate change and climate change legislation and regulatory initiatives could result in increased operating costs and decreased demand for the oil and natural gas that we produce.
climate change, the costs that may be associated with its effects, and the regulation of greenhouse gas (ghg) emissions have the potential to affect our business in many ways, including increasing the costs to provide our products and services, reducing the demand for and consumption of our products and services (due to change in both costs and weather patterns), and the economic health of the regions in which we operate, all of which can create financial risks. in addition, legislative and regulatory responses related to ghg emissions and climate change may increase our operating costs. the united states congress has previously considered legislation related to ghg emissions. there have also been international efforts seeking legally binding reductions in ghg emissions. for example, in november 2014, the obama administration announced an agreement with china to voluntarily reduce ghg emissions to 26% to 28% of 2005 levels by 2025. further, the united states joined over 190 countries in lima, peru in december 2014 and agreed to draft an emissions reduction plan ahead of further international climate negotiations in paris, france in 2015. in addition, increased public awareness and concern may result in more state, regional and/or federal requirements to reduce or mitigate ghg emissions. for example, in june 2013, the obama administration announced its climate action plan, which, among other things, directs federal agencies to develop a strategy for the reduction of methane emissions, including emissions from the oil and gas sector. pursuant to this plan, the epa announced in january 2015 a plan to regulate methane emissions from the oil and gas sector.
in september 2009, the epa finalized a mandatory ghg reporting rule that requires large sources of ghg emissions to monitor, maintain records on, and annually report their ghg emissions beginning january 1, 2010. the rule applies to large facilities emitting 25,000 metric tons or more of carbon dioxide-equivalent (co2e) emissions per year and to most upstream suppliers of fossil fuels, as well as manufacturers of vehicles and engines. subsequently, in november 2010, the epa issued ghg monitoring and reporting regulations that went into effect on december 30, 2010, specifically for oil and natural gas facilities, including onshore and offshore oil and natural gas production facilities that emit 25,000 metric tons or more of co2e per year. the rule required reporting of ghg emissions by regulated facilities to the epa by march 2012 for emissions during 2011 and annually thereafter. we are required to report our ghg emissions to the epa each year in march under this rule and have submitted our annual reports in compliance with the deadline. the epa also issued a final rule that makes certain stationary sources and newer modification projects subject to permitting requirements for ghg emissions, beginning in 2011, under the caa. however, in june 2014, the u.s. supreme court, in uarg v. epa, limited the application of the ghg permitting requirements under the prevention of significant deterioration and title v permitting programs to sources that would otherwise need permits based on the emission of conventional pollutants.
28
federal and state regulatory agencies can impose administrative, civil and/or criminal penalties for non-compliance with air permits or other requirements of the caa and associated state laws and regulations. in addition, the passage of any federal or state climate change laws or regulations in the future could result in increased costs to (i) operate and maintain our facilities, (ii) install new emission controls on our facilities and (iii) administer and manage any ghg emissions program. if we are unable to recover or pass through a significant level of our costs related to complying with climate change regulatory requirements imposed on us, it could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. to the extent financial markets view climate change and ghg emissions as a financial risk, this could negatively impact our cost of and access to capital. legislation or regulations that may be adopted to address climate change could also affect the markets for our products by making our products more or less desirable than competing sources of energy.
moreover, some experts believe climate change poses potential physical risks, including an increase in sea level and changes in weather conditions, such as an increase in changes in precipitation and extreme weather events. to the extent that such unfavorable weather conditions are exacerbated by global climate change or otherwise, our operations may be adversely affected to a greater degree than we have previously experienced, including increased delays and costs. however, the uncertain nature of changes in extreme weather events (such as increased frequency, duration, and severity) and the long period of time over which any changes would take place make any estimations of future financial risk to our operations caused by these potential physical risks of climate change unreliable.
certain federal income tax law changes have been proposed that, if passed, would have an adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations, and cash flows.
substantive changes to existing federal income tax laws have been proposed that, if adopted, would repeal many tax incentives and deductions that are currently used by u.s. oil and gas companies and would impose new taxes. the proposals include: repeal of the percentage depletion allowance for oil and natural gas properties; elimination of the ability to fully deduct intangible drilling costs in the year incurred; repeal of the manufacturing tax deduction for oil and gas companies; and increase in the geological and geophysical amortization period for independent producers. should some or all of these proposals become law, our taxes will increase, potentially significantly, which would have a negative impact on our net income and cash flows. this could also reduce our drilling activities in the u.s. since none of these proposals have yet to become law, we do not know the ultimate impact these proposed changes may have on our business.
provisions of delaware law and our bylaws and charter could discourage change in control transactions and prevent stockholders from receiving a premium on their investment.
our charter authorizes our board of directors to set the terms of preferred stock. in addition, delaware law contains provisions that impose restrictions on business combinations with interested parties. our bylaws prohibit the calling of a special meeting by our stockholders and place procedural requirements and limitations on stockholder proposals at meetings of stockholders. because of these provisions of our charter, bylaws and delaware law, persons considering unsolicited tender offers or other unilateral takeover proposals may be more likely to negotiate with our board of directors rather than pursue non-negotiated takeover attempts. as a result, these provisions may make it more difficult for our stockholders to benefit from transactions that are opposed by an incumbent board of directors.
the personal liability of our directors for monetary damages for breach of their fiduciary duty of care is limited by the delaware general corporation law and by our charter.
the delaware general corporation law allows corporations to limit available relief for the breach of directors' duty of care to equitable remedies such as injunction or rescission. our charter limits the liability of our directors to the fullest extent permitted by delaware law. specifically, our directors will not be personally liable for monetary damages for any breach of their fiduciary duty as a director, except for liability:
•   for any breach of their duty of loyalty to the company or our stockholders;
•   for acts or omissions not in good faith or that involve intentional misconduct or a knowing violation of law;
•   under provisions relating to unlawful payments of dividends or unlawful stock repurchases or redemptions; and
•   for any transaction from which the director derived an improper personal benefit.
this limitation may have the effect of reducing the likelihood of derivative litigation against directors, and may discourage or deter stockholders or management from bringing a lawsuit against directors for breach of their duty of care, even though such an action, if successful, might otherwise have benefited our stockholders.

item 7.    management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion is intended to assist you in understanding our results of operations and our present financial condition. our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form 10-k contain additional information that should be referred to when reviewing this material.
overview on an equivalent basis, our production in 2014 increased by 29% from 2013. we produced 531.8 bcfe, or 1.5 bcfe per day, in 2014, compared to 413.6 bcfe, or 1.1 bcfe per day, in 2013. natural gas production increased by 113.8 bcf, or 29%, to 508.0 bcf in 2014 compared to 394.2 bcf in 2013. this increase was primarily the result of higher production in the marcellus shale associated with our drilling program in pennsylvania, partially offset by lower production primarily in oklahoma and west texas as a result of certain non-core asset dispositions in the fourth quarter of 2013 and normal production declines in texas and west virginia. crude oil/condensate/ngl production increased by 0.7 mbbls, or 23%, from 3.2 mmbbls in 2013 to 4.0 mmbbls in 2014. this increase was the result of higher production resulting from our oil-focused eagle ford shale drilling program in south texas, partially offset by lower production associated with certain non-core asset dispositions in oklahoma in the fourth quarter of 2013.
our financial results depend on many factors, particularly the price of natural gas and crude oil and our ability to market our production on economically attractive terms. our average realized natural gas price for 2014 was $3.28 per mcf, 8% lower than the $3.56 per mcf price realized in 2013. our average realized crude oil price for 2014 was $88.50 per bbl, 12% lower than the $101.13 per bbl price realized in 2013. these realized prices include realized gains and losses resulting from commodity derivatives. for information about the impact of these derivatives on realized prices, refer to "results of operations" in item 7.
commodity prices are determined by many factors that are outside of our control. historically, commodity prices have been volatile, and we expect them to remain volatile. commodity prices are affected by changes in market supply and demand, which are impacted by overall economic activity, weather, pipeline capacity constraints, inventory storage levels, basis differentials and other factors. as a result, we cannot accurately predict future natural gas, ngl and crude oil prices and, therefore, we cannot determine with any degree of certainty what effect increases or decreases will have on our capital program, production volumes or future revenues. in addition to production volumes and commodity prices, finding and developing sufficient amounts of natural gas and crude oil reserves at economical costs are critical to our long-term success. see "risk factors-natural gas and oil prices fluctuate widely, and low prices for an extended period would likely have a material adverse impact on our business" and "risk factors-our future performance depends on our ability to find or acquire additional natural gas and oil reserves that are economically recoverable" in item 1a.
in december 2014, we recorded a $771.0 million impairment of oil and gas properties in certain non-core fields, primarily in east texas. the impairment of these fields was due to a significant decline in commodity prices in late 2014 and management's decision not to pursue any further activity in these non-core areas in the current price environment.
effective april 1, 2014, we elected to discontinue hedge accounting on a prospective basis. subsequent to april 1, 2014, our derivative instruments were accounted for on a mark-to-market basis with changes in fair value recognized currently in operating revenues in the consolidated statement of operations. as a result of these mark-to-market adjustments, we will likely experience volatility in our earnings from time to time due to commodity price volatility. refer to "impact of derivative instruments on operating revenues" below and note 6 to the consolidated financial statements for more information.
we drilled 200 gross wells (176.5 net) with a success rate of 99.5% in 2014 compared to 181 gross wells (153.5 net) with a success rate of 98.3% in 2013. our 2014 total capital and exploration spending was approximately $1.6 billion (excluding the eagle ford shale acquisitions discussed below) compared to $1.2 billion in 2013. the increase in capital spending was the result of our drilling programs in the marcellus shale and eagle ford shale. we allocate our planned program for capital and exploration expenditures among our various operating areas based on return expectations, availability of services and human resources.
our 2015 drilling program includes approximately $900.0 million in capital and exploration expenditures and approximately $69.8 million in expected contributions to our equity method investments. these expenditures are expected to be funded by operating cash flow, existing cash and, if required, borrowings under our revolving credit facility. we will continue to assess the natural gas and crude oil price environment along with our liquidity position and may increase or decrease our capital and exploration expenditures accordingly.
36
acquisitions and divestitures in december 2014, we completed the acquisition of certain proved and unproved oil and gas properties in the eagle ford shale in south texas for approximately $30.5 million and paid total cash consideration as of the closing date of approximately $29.6 million, which reflects the impact of customary purchase price adjustments and acquisition costs. the acquisition was funded with borrowings under our revolving credit facility.
in october 2014, we completed the acquisition of certain proved and unproved oil and gas properties in the eagle ford shale in south texas for approximately $210.0 million and paid total net cash consideration as of the closing date of approximately $185.2 million, which reflects the purchase price and adjustments of approximately $17.4 million for consents that the seller was unable to obtain for certain leaseholds prior to closing and approximately $8.0 million for the impact of customary purchase price adjustments and acquisition costs. the acquisition was funded with proceeds from the private placement of senior unsecured fixed rate notes completed in september 2014.
in october 2014, we completed the divestiture of certain proved and unproved oil and gas properties in east texas to a third party for approximately $44.3 million. total cash consideration received by the company as of the closing date was approximately $42.8 million, which reflects the impact of customary purchase price adjustments.
financial condition capital resources and liquidity our primary sources of cash in 2014 were from funds generated from the sale of natural gas and oil production, the issuance of fixed rate notes and proceeds from the sale of certain oil and gas properties during the year. these cash flows were primarily used to fund our capital and exploration expenditures, repayments of borrowings under our revolving credit facility and related interest payments, share repurchases and the payment of dividends. see below for additional discussion and analysis of cash flow.
operating cash flow fluctuations are substantially driven by commodity prices and changes in our production volumes and operating expenses. prices for natural gas and crude oil have historically been volatile, including seasonal influences and demand; however, the impact of other risks and uncertainties have also influenced prices throughout the recent years. in addition, fluctuations in cash flow may result in an increase or decrease in our capital and exploration expenditures. see "results of operations" for a review of the impact of prices and volumes on revenues.
our working capital is also substantially influenced by the variables discussed above. from time to time, our working capital will reflect a surplus, while at other times it will reflect a deficit. this fluctuation is not unusual. we believe we have adequate availability under our revolving credit facility and liquidity available to meet our working capital requirements.

operating activities. net cash provided by operating activities in 2014 increased by $211.9 million over 2013. this increase was primarily due to higher operating revenues, partially offset by higher operating expenses (excluding non-cash expenses) and an increase in working capital. the increase in operating revenues was primarily due to an increase in equivalent production, partially offset by a decrease in realized natural gas and crude oil prices. equivalent production volumes increased by 29% for 2014 compared to 2013 as a result of higher natural gas and oil production. average realized natural gas and crude oil prices decreased by 8% and 12%, respectively, for 2014 compared to 2013.
net cash provided by operating activities in 2013 increased by $372.4 million over 2012. this increase was primarily due to higher operating revenues partially offset by higher operating expenses (excluding non-cash expenses) and unfavorable changes in working capital and other assets and liabilities. the increase in operating revenues was primarily due to an increase in equivalent production, partially offset by lower realized natural gas and crude oil prices. equivalent production volumes increased by 55% for 2013 compared to 2012 as a result of higher natural gas and crude oil production. average realized natural gas and crude oil prices decreased by 3% and less than 1%, respectively, for 2013 compared to 2012.
37
see "results of operations" for additional information relative to commodity price, production and operating expense movements. we are unable to predict future commodity prices and, as a result, cannot provide any assurance about future levels of net cash provided by operating activities. realized prices may decline in future periods.
investing activities. cash flows used in investing activities increased by $746.6 million from 2013 to 2014 due to a $284.9 million increase in capital and exploration expenditures, a decrease of $284.0 million in proceeds from the sale of assets, a $214.7 million increase in acquisition expenditures related to the acquisitions of eagle ford shale assets that closed in the fourth quarter of 2014, and a $19.2 million increase in capital contributions associated with our equity investments. partially offsetting the increases was a $56.2 million decrease in restricted cash related to the release of funds by our qualified intermediary due to a lapse in the statutory holding period and the funding of oil and gas lease acquisitions during 2014 associated with like-kind exchange transactions pursuant to section 1031 of the internal revenue code.
cash flows used in investing activities increased by $152.7 million from 2012 to 2013 due to a $266.8 million increase in capital and exploration expenditures and a $12.0 million increase associated with our equity investment in constitution. these increases were partially offset by a net $126.1 million increase in proceeds from the sale of assets, a portion of which was retained in a qualified intermediary and recognized as restricted cash on the consolidated balance sheet.
financing activities. cash flows provided by financing activities increased by $539.6 million from 2013 to 2014 due to $545.0 million of higher net borrowings and a decrease in share repurchases of $25.8 million, partially offset by a decrease of $20.3 million in tax benefits associated with our stock-based compensation, an $8.0 million increase in dividends paid and an increase in cash paid for capitalized debt issuance costs of $2.9 million.
cash flows used in financing activities increased by $227.9 million from 2012 to 2013 due to $164.6 million of stock repurchases, $77.0 million of lower net borrowings and an increase in dividends paid of $8.5 million, partially offset by an $18.9 million increase in the tax benefit associated with our stock‐based compensation and a decrease in cash paid for capitalized debt issuance costs of $2.3 million.
in september 2014, we completed a private placement of $925 million aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured fixed rate notes with a weighted-average interest rate of 3.65%, consisting of amounts due in 2021, 2024 and 2026.
effective april 15, 2014, the lenders under our revolving credit facility approved an increase in our borrowing base from $2.3 billion to $3.1 billion as part of the annual redetermination under the terms of the revolving credit facility agreement. the commitments under the revolving credit facility remain unchanged at $1.4 billion. see note 5 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for further details.
at december 31, 2014, we had $140.0 million of borrowings outstanding under our revolving credit facility at a weighted-average interest rate of 2.4% compared to $460.0 million of borrowings outstanding at a weighted-average interest rate of 2.0% at december 31, 2013. as of december 31, 2014, we had $1.3 billion available for future borrowings under our revolving credit facility.
we were in compliance with all restrictive financial covenants in both the revolving credit facility and fixed rate notes as of december 31, 2014.
we strive to manage our debt at a level below the available credit line in order to maintain borrowing capacity. our revolving credit facility includes a covenant limiting our total debt. management believes that, with internally generated cash flow, existing cash on hand and availability under our revolving credit facility, we have the capacity to finance our spending plans and maintain our strong financial position.

_______________________________________________________________________________
(1)   includes $140.0 million and $460.0 million of borrowings outstanding under our revolving credit facility at december 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively.
for the years ended december 31, 2014 and 2013, we repurchased 4.3 million shares for a total cost of $138.9 million and 4.8 million shares for a total cost of $164.6 million, respectively. during 2014 and 2013, we also paid dividends of $33.3 million ($0.08 per share) and $25.2 million ($0.06 per share) on our common stock, respectively. a regular dividend has been declared for each quarter since we became a public company in 1990.
capital and exploration expenditures on an annual basis, we generally fund most of our capital and exploration expenditures, excluding any significant property acquisitions, with cash generated from operations and, when necessary, borrowings under our revolving credit facility. we budget these expenditures based on our projected cash flows for the year.
the following table presents major components of our capital and exploration expenditures:

(1)   interest payments have been calculated utilizing the fixed rates associated with our fixed rate notes outstanding at december 31, 2014. interest payments on our revolving credit facility were calculated by assuming that the december 31, 2014 outstanding balance of $140.0 million will be outstanding through the may 2017 maturity date and that our fixed rate notes will remain outstanding through their respective maturity dates. a constant interest rate of 2.4% was assumed for the interest payments on our revolving credit facility, which was the december 31, 2014 weighted-average interest rate. actual results will differ from these estimates and assumptions.
(2)   in january 2015, we entered into a natural gas transportation agreement associated with our production in pennsylvania, which increased our future aggregate obligations under our transportation commitments by approximately $105.9 million over the next 10 years, which is not included in the table above. for further information on our obligations under transportation and gathering agreements, drilling rig commitments and operating leases, see note 9 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements.
(3)   for further information on our equity investment contribution commitment, see note 4 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements.
amounts related to our asset retirement obligation are not included in the above table given the uncertainty regarding the actual timing of such expenditures. the total amount of our asset retirement obligation at december 31, 2014 was $126.7 million. see note 8 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for further details.
we have no off-balance sheet debt or other similar unrecorded obligations.
potential impact of our critical accounting policies readers of this document and users of the information contained in it should be aware of how certain events may impact our financial results based on the accounting policies in place. our most significant policies are discussed below.
successful efforts method of accounting we follow the successful efforts method of accounting for our oil and gas producing activities. acquisition costs for proved and unproved properties are capitalized when incurred. exploration costs, including geological and geophysical costs, the costs of carrying and retaining unproved properties and exploratory dry hole costs are expensed. development costs, including costs to drill and equip development wells and successful exploratory drilling costs to locate proved reserves are capitalized.
oil and gas reserves the process of estimating quantities of proved reserves is inherently imprecise, and the reserve data included in this document are only estimates. the process relies on interpretations of available geologic, geophysical, engineering and production data. the extent, quality and reliability of this technical data can vary. the process also requires certain economic assumptions, some of which are mandated by the sec, such as crude oil and natural gas prices. additional assumptions include drilling and operating expenses, capital expenditures, taxes and availability of funds. any significant variance in the interpretations or assumptions could materially affect the estimated quantity and value of our reserves.
40
our reserves have been prepared by our petroleum engineering staff and audited by miller and lents, independent petroleum engineers, who in their opinion determined the estimates presented to be reasonable in the aggregate. for more information regarding reserve estimation, including historical reserve revisions, refer to the supplemental oil and gas information to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8.
our rate of recording dd&a expense is dependent upon our estimate of proved and proved developed reserves, which are utilized in our unit-of-production calculation. if the estimates of proved reserves were to be reduced, the rate at which we record dd&a expense would increase, reducing net income. such a reduction in reserves may result from lower market prices, which may make it uneconomic to drill and produce higher cost fields. a 5% positive or negative revision to proved reserves would result in a decrease of $0.05 per mcfe and an increase of $0.05 per mcfe, respectively, on our dd&a rate. revisions in significant fields may individually affect our dd&a rate. it is estimated that a positive or negative reserve revision of 10% in one of our most productive fields would result in a decrease of $0.05 per mcfe and an increase of $0.07 per mcfe, respectively, on our total dd&a rate. these estimated impacts are based on current data, and actual events could require different adjustments to our dd&a rate.
in addition, a decline in proved reserve estimates may impact the outcome of our impairment test under applicable accounting standards. due to the inherent imprecision of the reserve estimation process, risks associated with the operations of proved producing properties and market sensitive commodity prices utilized in our impairment analysis, management cannot determine if an impairment is reasonably likely to occur in the future.
carrying value of oil and gas properties we evaluate our proved oil and gas properties for impairment on a field-by-field basis whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate an asset's carrying amount may not be recoverable. we compare expected undiscounted future cash flows to the net book value of the asset. if the future undiscounted expected cash flows, based on our estimate of future natural gas and crude oil prices, operating costs and anticipated production from proved reserves and risk-adjusted probable and possible reserves, are lower than the net book value of the asset, the capitalized cost is reduced to fair value. commodity pricing is estimated by using a combination of assumptions management uses in its budgeting and forecasting process, historical and current prices adjusted for geographical location and quality differentials, as well as other factors that management believes will impact realizable prices. in the event that commodity prices remain low or decline, there could be a significant revision in the future. fair value is calculated by discounting the future cash flows. the discount factor used is based on rates utilized by market participants that are commensurate with the risks inherent in the development and production of the underlying natural gas and oil.
unproved oil and gas properties are assessed periodically for impairment on an aggregate basis through periodic updates to our undeveloped acreage amortization based on past drilling and exploration experience, our expectation of converting leases to held by production and average property lives. average property lives are determined on a geographical basis and based on the estimated life of unproved property leasehold rights. historically, the average property life in each of the geographical areas has not significantly changed and generally range from three to five years. the commodity price environment may impact the capital available for exploration projects as well as development drilling. we have considered these impacts when determining the amortization rate of our undeveloped acreage, especially in exploratory areas. if the average unproved property life decreases or increases by one year, the amortization would increase by approximately $21.8 million or decrease by approximately $14.8 million, respectively, per year.
as these properties are developed and reserves are proved, the remaining capitalized costs are subject to depreciation and depletion. if the development of these properties is deemed unsuccessful, the capitalized costs related to the unsuccessful activity is expensed in the year the determination is made. the rate at which the unproved properties are written off depends on the timing and success of our future exploration and development program.
asset retirement obligations the majority of our asset retirement obligations (aro) relates to the plugging and abandonment of oil and gas wells and to a lesser extent meter stations, pipelines, processing plants and compressors. we record the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation in the period in which it is incurred, with the associated asset retirement cost capitalized as part of the carrying amount of the related long-lived asset. the recognition of an asset retirement obligation requires management to make assumptions that include estimated plugging and abandonment costs, timing of settlements, inflation rates and discount rate. in periods subsequent to initial measurement, the asset retirement cost is depreciated using the units-of-production method, while increases in the discounted aro liability resulting from the passage of time (accretion expense) are reflected as depreciation, depletion and amortization expense.
41
accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities under applicable accounting standards, the fair value of each derivative instrument is recorded as either an asset or liability on the balance sheet. at the end of each quarterly period, these instruments are marked-to-market.
through march 31, 2014, we elected to designate our commodity derivatives as cash flow hedges for accounting purposes. effective april 1, 2014, we elected to discontinue hedge accounting for our commodity derivatives on a prospective basis. accordingly, the change in the fair value of derivatives designated as cash flow hedges that were effective was recorded to accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in stockholders' equity in the consolidated balance sheet. the ineffective portion of the change in the fair value of derivatives designated as cash flow hedges and the change in fair value of derivatives not designated as hedges are recorded as a component of operating revenues in gain (loss) on derivative instruments in the consolidated statement of operations.
our derivative contracts are measured based on quotes from our counterparties. such quotes have been derived using an income approach that considers various inputs including current market and contractual prices for the underlying instruments, quoted forward prices for natural gas and crude oil, basis differentials, volatility factors and interest rates, such as a libor curve for a similar length of time as the derivative contract term, as applicable. these estimates are verified using relevant nymex futures contracts or are compared to multiple quotes obtained from counterparties for reasonableness. the determination of fair value also incorporates a credit adjustment for non-performance risk. we measure the non-performance risk of our counterparties by reviewing credit default swap spreads for the various financial institutions in which we have derivative transactions, while our non-performance risk is evaluated using a market credit spread provided by one of our banks.
employee benefit plans our costs of long-term employee benefits, particularly postretirement benefits, are incurred over long periods of time, and involve many uncertainties over those periods. the net periodic benefit cost attributable to current periods is based on several assumptions about such future uncertainties, and is sensitive to changes in those assumptions. it is management's responsibility, often with the assistance of independent experts, to select assumptions that in its judgment represent best estimates of those uncertainties. it also is management's responsibility to review those assumptions periodically to reflect changes in economic or other factors that affect those assumptions. significant assumptions used to determine our postretirement benefit obligation and related costs include discount rates and health care cost trends. see note 11 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion relative to our employee benefit plans.
stock-based compensation we account for stock-based compensation under the fair value method of accounting in accordance with applicable accounting standards. under the fair value method, compensation cost is measured at the grant date for equity-classified awards and remeasured each reporting period for liability-classified awards based on the fair value of an award and is recognized over the service period, which is generally the vesting period. to calculate fair value, we use either a monte carlo or black-scholes valuation model, as determined by the specific provisions of the award. the use of these models requires significant judgment with respect to expected life, volatility and other factors. stock-based compensation cost for all types of awards is included in general and administrative expense in the consolidated statement of operations. see note 13 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for a full discussion of our stock-based compensation.
recent accounting pronouncements in april 2014, the financial accounting standards board (fasb) issued accounting standards update (asu) no. 2014-08, reporting discontinued operations and disclosures of disposals of components of an entity. the guidance applies prospectively to new disposals and new classifications of disposal groups as held for sale after the effective date. the guidance is effective for interim and annual periods beginning on or after december 15, 2014. we do not expect the adoption of this guidance to have a material impact on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.
in may 2014, the fasb issued asu no. 2014-09, revenue from contracts with customers, as a new topic, accounting standards codification topic 606. the new revenue recognition standard provides a five-step analysis of transactions to determine when and how revenue is recognized. the core principle of the guidance is that a company should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. this asu is effective beginning in fiscal year 2017 and can be adopted either retrospectively or as a cumulative-effect adjustment as of the date of adoption. we are currently evaluating the effect that adopting this guidance will have on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.
42
in august 2014, the fasb issued asu no. 2014-15, presentation of financial statements - going concern, as a new sub-topic, accounting standards codification sub-topic 205.40. the new going concern standard codifies in generally accepted accounting principles (gaap) management's responsibility to evaluate whether there is substantial doubt about an entity's ability to continue as a going concern and to provide related footnote disclosures. this asu is effective for interim and annual periods beginning on or after december 15, 2016 and early adoption is permitted. we do not expect the adoption of this guidance to have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations.
other issues and contingencies regulations.    our operations are subject to various types of regulation by federal, state and local authorities. see "regulation of oil and natural gas exploration and production," "natural gas marketing, gathering and transportation," "federal regulation of petroleum," "pipeline safety regulation," and "environmental and safety regulations" in the "other business matters" section of item 1 for a discussion of these regulations.
restrictive covenants.    our ability to incur debt and to make certain types of investments is subject to certain restrictive covenants in our various debt instruments. among other requirements, our revolving credit agreement and our fixed rate notes specify a minimum annual coverage ratio of consolidated cash flow to interest expense for the trailing four quarters of 2.8 to 1.0 and a minimum asset coverage ratio of the present value of proved reserves plus adjusted cash to indebtedness and other liabilities of 1.75 to 1.0. our revolving credit agreement also requires us to maintain a minimum current ratio of 1.0 to 1.0. at december 31, 2014, we were in compliance with all restrictive financial covenants in both the revolving credit agreement and fixed rate notes. in the unforeseen event that we fail to comply with these covenants, we may apply for a temporary waiver with the lender, which, if granted, would allow us a period of time to remedy the situation.
operating risks and insurance coverage.    our business involves a variety of operating risks. see "risk factors-we face a variety of hazards and risks that could cause substantial financial losses" in item 1a. in accordance with customary industry practice, we maintain insurance against some, but not all, of these risks and losses. the occurrence of any of these events not fully covered by insurance could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows. the costs of these insurance policies are somewhat dependent on our historical claims experience, the areas in which we operate and market conditions.
commodity pricing and risk management activities.    our revenues, operating results, financial condition and ability to borrow funds or obtain additional capital depend substantially on prevailing prices for natural gas and crude oil. declines in natural gas and crude oil prices may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, liquidity, ability to obtain financing and operating results. lower natural gas and crude oil prices also may reduce the amount of natural gas and crude oil that we can produce economically. historically, natural gas and crude oil prices and markets have been volatile, with prices fluctuating widely, and they are likely to continue to be volatile. depressed prices in the future would have a negative impact on our future financial results. in particular, substantially lower prices would significantly reduce revenue and could potentially trigger an impairment of our long-lived assets. because our reserves are predominantly natural gas (approximately 96% of equivalent proved reserves), changes in natural gas prices may have a more significant impact on our financial results than oil prices.
the majority of our production is sold at market responsive prices. generally, if the related commodity index declines, the price that we receive for our production will also decline. therefore, the amount of revenue that we realize is partially determined by factors beyond our control. however, management may mitigate this price risk on all or a portion of our anticipated production with the use of commodity derivatives. most recently, we have used commodity derivatives such as collar and swap arrangements to reduce the impact of declining prices on our revenue. under both arrangements, there is also a risk that the movement of index prices may result in our inability to realize the full benefit of an improvement in market conditions.
results of operations
2014 and 2013 compared we reported net income for 2014 of $104.5 million, or $0.25 per share, compared to net income for 2013 of $279.8 million, or $0.67 per share. the decrease in net income was due to higher operating expenses, partially offset by an increase in operating revenues and an increase in income tax benefit.

natural gas revenues the increase in natural gas revenues of $185.4 million is due to higher production, partially offset by lower natural gas prices. the increase in our production was the result of our marcellus shale drilling program in pennsylvania, partially offset by lower production primarily in oklahoma and west texas as a result of certain non-core asset dispositions in the fourth quarter of 2013 and normal production declines in texas and west virginia.
crude oil and condensate revenues the increase in crude oil and condensate revenues of $22.5 million is due to higher production, partially offset by lower crude oil prices. the increase in production was a result of our oil-focused eagle ford shale drilling program in south texas, partially offset by lower production associated with certain non-core asset dispositions in oklahoma and west texas in the fourth quarter of 2013.
gain (loss) on derivative instruments effective april 1, 2014, we elected to discontinue hedge accounting on a prospective basis. subsequent to april 1, 2014, our derivative instruments were accounted for on a mark-to-market basis with changes in fair value recognized currently in operating revenues in the consolidated statement of operations. gain (loss) on derivative instruments includes an $81.7 million gain related to the change in fair value of realized cash settlements of derivative instruments previously frozen in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) and a $137.6 million unrealized mark-to-market gain on our commodity derivative instruments.

total costs and expenses from operations increased by $869.9 million from 2013 to 2014. the primary reasons for this fluctuation are as follows:
•   direct operations increased $4.7 million largely due to higher operating costs as a result of higher production, an increase in disposal and recycling costs related to our marcellus shale operations and an increase in costs associated with oil processing and related fuel charges related to our eagle ford shale operations. partially offsetting these increases were lower costs associated with certain non-core assets in oklahoma and west texas that were sold in the fourth quarter of 2013.
•   transportation and gathering increased $119.8 million due to higher throughput as a result of higher production, slightly higher transportation rates and the commencement of various transportation and gathering agreements in late 2013 and during 2014.
•   brokered natural gas increased $0.1 million from 2013 to 2014. see the preceding table titled "brokered natural gas" for further analysis.
•   taxes other than income increased $4.0 million due to $2.5 million higher drilling impact fees associated with our marcellus shale drilling activities, $2.5 million higher production taxes and $0.9 million higher franchise and other taxes. production taxes increased due to higher oil production in south texas, offset by taxes associated with certain non-core assets in oklahoma and west texas that were sold in the fourth quarter of 2013. these increases are partially offset by a $1.9 million decrease in ad valorem taxes.
•   exploration increased $10.6 million as a result of higher exploratory dry hole costs of $7.5 million and higher geophysical and geological and other expenses.
•   depreciation, depletion and amortization decreased $18.3 million due to a $36.2 million decrease in amortization of unproved properties in 2014 due to lower amortization rates as a result of favorable results from our drilling program in pennsylvania. this decrease was partially offset by a net increase in depreciation and depletion of $14.6 million, consisting of a $167.6 million increase due to higher equivalent production volumes for 2014 compared to 2013, partially offset by a decrease of $153.0 million due to a lower dd&amp;a rate of $1.13 per mcfe for 2014 compared to $1.42 per mcfe for 2013. the lower dd&amp;a rate was primarily due to lower cost of reserve additions associated with our marcellus shale drilling program and the impact of the disposition of higher rate fields in oklahoma and west texas in the fourth quarter of 2013.
•   impairment of oil and gas properties was $771.0 million in 2014 due to the impairment of certain non-core fields, primarily in east texas. the impairment of these fields was due to a significant decline in commodity prices in late
46
2014 and management's decision not to pursue activity in these non-core areas in the current price environment. there was no impairment in 2013.
•   general and administrative decreased $22.0 million due to lower stock-based compensation expense of $30.4 million associated with the mark-to-market of our liability-based performance awards and our supplemental employee incentive plan due to changes in our stock price during 2014 compared to 2013 and lower employee-related expenses. these decreases were partially offset by increases in professional fees.
earnings (loss) on equity method investments. the increase in equity method investments is the result of the increase in our proportionate share of net earnings from our equity method investments in 2014 compared to 2013.
gain (loss) on sale of assets.    during 2014, we recognized an aggregate gain of $17.1 million primarily due to the sale of certain proved and unproved oil and gas properties in east texas. during 2013, we recognized an aggregate net gain of $21.4 million, which includes a $19.4 million gain from the sale of certain proved and unproved oil and gas properties located in the oklahoma and texas panhandles and a $17.5 million loss from the sale of certain proved and unproved oil and gas properties located in oklahoma, texas and kansas. we also sold various other proved and unproved properties in 2013 for a net gain of $19.5 million.
interest expense.    interest expense increased $7.7 million as a result of an increase in interest expense of $9.7 million associated with our private placement in september 2014 of $925 million aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured fixed rate notes with a weighted-average interest rate of 3.65%, higher commitment fees of $2.3 million and increased amortization of debt issuance costs of $1.1 million. these increases were partially offset by a decrease in interest expense of $3.1 million due to the repayment of $75.0 million of our 7.33% weighted-average fixed rate notes in july 2013 and $1.1 million associated with our revolving credit facility due to a decrease in weighted-average borrowings based on daily balances of approximately $410.0 million compared to approximately $454.4 million during 2014 and 2013, respectively.
income tax expense.    income tax expense decreased $277.8 million due to a decrease in pretax income and a lower effective tax rate.  the effective tax rates for 2014 and 2013 were (222.4)% and 42.4%, respectively. the effective tax rate was lower as a result of a change in estimated net deferred state tax liabilities reflected in our consolidated balance sheet, which were based on updated state apportionment factors in states in which we operate.
2013 and 2012 compared we reported net income for 2013 of $279.8 million, or $0.67 per share, compared to net income for 2012 of $131.7 million, or $0.31 per share. the increase in net income was primarily due to an increase in natural gas and crude oil and condensate revenues, partially offset higher operating expenses.

natural gas revenues the increase in natural gas revenues of $471.1 million is due to higher production, partially offset by lower natural gas prices. the increase in our production was the result of our marcellus shale drilling program in pennsylvania and expanded infrastructure in the area, partially offset by lower production primarily in texas, oklahoma and west virginia due to reduced natural gas drilling in these areas and normal production declines.
crude oil and condensate revenues the increase in crude oil and condensate revenues of $63.5 million is due to higher production associated with our oil‐focused eagle ford shale drilling program in south texas and, to a lesser extent, oklahoma, partially offset by lower crude oil prices.

total costs and expenses from operations increased by $268.1 million from 2012 to 2013. the primary reasons for this fluctuation are as follows:
•   direct operations increased $22.6 million largely due to higher operating costs primarily driven by higher production. in addition, we experienced higher costs associated with oil separation and processing and related fuel charges as a result of more stringent oil pipeline quality requirements in south texas related to our eagle ford operations, higher plugging and abandonment costs primarily in east texas and higher environmental and regulatory costs. partially offsetting these increases were a decrease in workover activity and lower lease maintenance costs.
•   transportation and gathering increased $86.2 million due to higher throughput as a result of higher production, slightly higher transportation rates and the commencement of various transportation and gathering agreements primarily in northeast pennsylvania and south texas throughout the second half of 2012.
•   brokered natural gas increased $1.4 million from 2012 to 2013. see the preceding table titled "brokered natural gas" for further analysis.
49
•   taxes other than income decreased $5.8 million due to lower drilling impact fees associated with our marcellus shale drilling activities. full year 2012 included $8.3 million related to the initial assessment of drilling impact fees associated with 2011 and prior period wells. in addition, franchise, sales and use and ad valorem taxes decreased year over year. these decreases were partially offset by higher production taxes as a result of an increase in oil production in south texas.
•   exploration decreased $19.3 million due to lower exploratory dry hole costs of $13.6 million primarily due to our brown dense/smackover exploratory well in union county, arkansas that was recorded in 2012. there were no significant exploratory dry hole costs recorded in 2013. in addition, geophysical and geological expenses decreased $7.0 million due to fewer requirements for the acquisition and processing of seismic data.
•   depreciation, depletion and amortization increased $199.6 million, of which $234.4 million was due to higher equivalent production volumes for 2013 compared to 2012, partially offset by a decrease of $70.8 million due to a lower dd&amp;a rate of $1.42 per mcfe for 2013 compared to $1.58 per mcfe for 2012. the lower dd&amp;a rate was primarily due to lower cost of reserve additions associated with our 2013 and 2012 drilling programs. in addition, amortization of unproved properties increased $35.5 million primarily due to an increase in amortization rates as a result of our ongoing evaluation of our unproved properties and undeveloped leasehold acquisitions during the year.
•   general and administrative decreased $16.6 million due to lower pension expense of $19.5 million associated with the liquidation of our pension plan that occurred in the second quarter of 2012, a decrease in legal expenses of $9.0 million and $2.2 million of lower charitable contribution costs associated with the funding of the construction of a hospital in northeast pennsylvania in 2012. these decreases are partially offset by $18.3 million of higher stock‐based compensation expense associated with the mark‐to‐market of our liability‐based performance awards due to changes in our stock price during 2013 compared to 2012 and the achievement of the interim and final triggers of our supplemental incentive compensation plan during 2013.
gain (loss) on sale of assets.    during 2013, we recognized an aggregate net gain of $21.4 million, which includes a $19.4 million gain from the sale of certain proved and unproved oil and gas properties located in the oklahoma and texas panhandles and a $17.5 million loss from the sale of certain proved and unproved oil and gas properties located in oklahoma, texas and kansas. we also sold various other proved and unproved properties for a net gain of $19.5 million. during 2012, we recognized an aggregate net gain of $50.6 million, which includes a $67.0 million gain associated with the sale of certain of our pearsall shale undeveloped leaseholds in south texas, partially offset by an $18.2 million loss on the sale of certain proved oil and gas properties located in south texas.
interest expense.    interest expense decreased $2.3 million as a result lower debt extinguishment costs of $1.3 million associated with our revolving credit facility amendment in may 2012 and lower interest expense as a result of the repayment of $75.0 million of our 7.33% weighted‐average fixed rate notes in july 2013. these decreases were offset by an increase in interest expense related to our revolving credit facility due to an increase in weighted‐average borrowings based on daily balances of approximately $454.4 million during 2013 compared to approximately $283.8 million 2012, partially offset by a lower weighted‐average effective interest rate of approximately 2.3% during 2013 compared to approximately 3.0% during 2012.
income tax expense.    income tax expense increased $99.7 million due to an increase in pretax income offset by a lower effective tax rate. the effective tax rates for 2013 and 2012 were 42.4% and 44.6%, respectively. the effective tax rate was lower due to a decrease in the impact of our state rates used to determine our deferred state tax liabilities and assets reflected in our consolidated balance sheet.

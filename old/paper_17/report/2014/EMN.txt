risk factors and their effects on the cash flows of the underlying transaction, the company uses various derivative financial instruments when appropriate in accordance with the company's hedging strategy and policies. designation is performed on a specific exposure basis to support hedge accounting. the changes in fair value of these hedging instruments are offset in part or in whole by corresponding changes in the anticipated cash flows of the underlying exposures being hedged. the company does not enter into derivative transactions for speculative purposes.
in 2014, the company implemented changes to its risk management framework that included changes in the horizon over which commodity related market risks are managed. beginning in third quarter 2014, the period over which the company hedges commodity price risks using derivative financial instruments was increased from a maximum of three years to a maximum of five years beyond its current fiscal year. the company weights its hedge portfolio more heavily in the first year with declining coverage over the remaining periods.
fair value hedges fair value hedges are defined as derivative or non-derivative instruments designated as and used to hedge the exposure to changes in the fair value of an asset or a liability or an identified portion thereof that is attributable to a particular risk. for derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as fair value hedges, the gain or loss on the derivative as well as the offsetting loss or gain on the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk are recognized in current earnings. in 2014, the company entered into interest rate swaps to hedge the interest rate risk on the 3.6% notes due 2022. as of december 31, 2014, the total notional amount of the company's interest rate swaps was $ 275 million . as of december 31, 2013, the company had no fair value hedges.

swaps              expense cash flow hedges cash flow hedges are derivative instruments designated as and used to hedge the exposure to variability in expected future cash flows that is attributable to a particular risk. for derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as a cash flow hedge, the effective portion of the gain or loss on the derivative is reported as a component of other comprehensive income, net of income taxes and reclassified into earnings in the same period or periods during which the hedged transaction affects earnings. gains and losses on the derivatives representing either hedge ineffectiveness or hedge components excluded from the assessment of effectiveness are recognized in current earnings.

notes to the audited consolidated financial statements foreign currency exchange rate hedging the company manufactures and sells its products in a number of countries throughout the world and, as a result, is exposed to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. to manage the volatility relating to these exposures, the company nets the exposures on a consolidated basis to take advantage of natural offsets. to manage the remaining exposure, the company enters into currency options and forwards from time to time to hedge probable anticipated, but not yet committed, export sales and purchase transactions expected within no longer than five years and denominated in foreign currencies (principally the euro and japanese yen) and forward exchange contracts to hedge certain firm commitments denominated in foreign currencies. these contracts are designated as cash flow hedges. the mtm gains or losses on qualifying hedges are included in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) to the extent effective, and reclassified into sales in the period during which the hedged transaction affects earnings.
commodity hedging certain raw material and energy sources used by the company, as well as sales of certain commodity products by the company, are subject to price volatility caused by weather, supply and demand conditions, economic variables and other unpredictable factors. these commodity and energy costs are primarily related to propane, ethane, natural gas, paraxylene, ethylene, and benzene. from time to time to mitigate expected fluctuations in market prices, the company enters into option and forward contracts. these contracts are designated as cash flow hedges. the mtm gains or losses on qualifying hedges are included in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) to the extent effective, and reclassified into cost of sales (for commodity purchases) and sales (for commodity sales) in the period during which the hedged transaction affects earnings.
interest rate hedging the company's policy is to manage interest expense using a mix of fixed and variable rate debt. to manage this mix effectively, the company from time to time enters into interest rate swaps in which the company agrees to exchange the difference between fixed and variable interest amounts calculated by reference to an agreed upon notional principal amount. these swaps are designated as hedges of the fair value of the underlying debt obligations and the interest rate differential is reflected as an adjustment to interest expense over the life of the swaps. as these instruments are 100 percent effective, there is no impact on earnings due to hedge ineffectiveness.
from time to time, the company also utilizes interest rate derivative instruments, primarily forward starting swaps and treasury locks, to hedge the company's exposure to movements in interest rates prior to anticipated debt offerings. these instruments are designated as cash flow hedges and are typically 100 percent effective. as a result, there is no current impact on earnings due to hedge ineffectiveness.
the mtm gains or losses on these hedges are included in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) to the extent effective, and are reclassified into interest expense over the term of the related debt instruments.

notes to the audited consolidated financial statements hedging summary at december 31, 2014 and 2013, pre-tax monetized positions and mtm gains and losses from raw materials and energy, currency, and certain interest rate hedges that were included in accumulated other comprehensive income totaled approximately $432 million in losses and $62 million in losses, respectively. losses increased in 2014 compared to
2013 as a result of a sharp decline in commodity prices, particularly propane, partially offset by increased gains resulting from a weaker euro and japanese yen. included in 2014 and 2013 were losses on settlement of forward starting interest rate swaps related to the issuance of debt for the solutia acquisition. if realized, approximately $144 million in pre-tax losses will be reclassified into earnings during the next 12 months.
ineffective portions of hedges are immediately recognized in cost of sales or other (income) charges, net. in 2014
, the company recognized $6 million in pre-tax losses for ineffectiveness on the commodity hedging portfolio. there were no gains or losses related to the ineffective portion of hedges recognized in 2013.
the gains or losses on nonqualifying derivatives or derivatives that are not designated as hedges are marked to market in the line item "other (income) charges, net" of the consolidated statements of earnings, and, in all periods presented, represent foreign exchange derivatives denominated in multiple currencies and are transacted and settled in the same quarter. the company recognized approximately $3 million net loss and $4 million net gain on nonqualifying derivatives during 2014 and 2013 , respectively. the company had no nonqualifying derivatives or derivatives that are not designated as hedges as of december 31, 2014 and december 31, 2013 .

the majority of the company's derivative assets are classified as level 2. level 2 fair value is based on estimates using standard pricing models. these standard pricing models use inputs which are derived from or corroborated by observable market data such as interest rate yield curves and currency spot and forward rates. the fair value of commodity contracts is derived using forward curves supplied by an industry recognized and unrelated third party.
in addition, on an ongoing basis, the company tests a subset of its valuations against valuations received from the transaction's counterparty to validate the accuracy of its standard pricing models. counterparties to these derivative contracts are highly rated financial institutions which the company believes carry minimal risk of nonperformance.
from time to time, the company holds level 3 assets for commodity hedges. the fair values of level 3 instruments are determined using pricing data similar to that used in level 2 financial instruments described above, and reflect adjustments for less liquid markets or longer contractual terms. level 3 hedges typically will mature within one year or less. the company determines the fair value of level 3 ethylene derivative forward contracts using an average of unadjusted forward ethylene prices provided by industry recognized experts to value its ethylene positions.

31, 2014 . the company does not have any cash collateral due under such agreements.
11.  retirement plans as described in more detail below, eastman offers various postretirement benefits to its employees.
defined contribution plans the company sponsors a defined contribution employee stock ownership plan (the "esop"), which is a component of the eastman investment plan and employee stock ownership plan ("eip/esop"), a plan under section 401(a) of the internal revenue code. eastman made a contribution in february 2015 to the eip/esop for substantially all u.s. employees equal to 5 percent of their eligible compensation for the 2014 plan year. employees may allocate contributions to other investment funds within the eip from the esop at any time without restrictions. allocated shares in the esop totaled 2,197,740 ; 2,289,618 ; and 2,410,806 shares as of december 31, 2014, 2013, and 2012, respectively.
dividends on shares held by the eip/esop are charged to retained earnings. all shares held by the eip/esop are treated as outstanding in computing earnings per share.
in 2006, the company amended its eip/esop to provide a company match of 50 percent of the first 7 percent of an employee's compensation contributed to the plan for employees who are hired on or after january 1, 2007. employees who are hired on or after january 1, 2007, are also eligible for the contribution to the esop as described above.
charges for domestic contributions to the eip/esop were $56 million , $43 million , and $40 million for 2014, 2013, and 2012, respectively.
defined benefit pension plans and other postretirement benefit plans pension plans eastman maintains defined benefit pension plans that provide eligible employees with retirement benefits.
110
notes to the audited consolidated financial statements effective january 1, 2000, the company's eastman retirement assistance plan, a u.s. defined benefit pension plan, was amended. employees' accrued pension benefits earned prior to january 1, 2000 are calculated based on previous plan provisions using the employee's age, years of service, and final average compensation as defined in the plans.
the amended plan uses a pension equity formula to calculate an employee's retirement benefits from january 1, 2000
forward. benefits payable will be the combined pre-2000 and post-1999 benefits. employees hired on or after january
1, 2007 are not eligible to participate in eastman's u.s. defined benefit pension plans.
in december 2014, as part of its acquisition of taminco, the company assumed taminco's non-u.s. defined benefit pension plans in belgium and finland. for more information on this acquisition, see note 2 , " acquisitions ".
in july 2012, as part of its acquisition of solutia, the company assumed solutia's u.s. and non-u.s. defined benefit pension plans. prior to the acquisition, the u.s. plans had been closed to new participants and were no longer accruing additional benefits. for more information on these acquisitions, see note 2 , " acquisitions ".
benefits are paid to employees from trust funds. contributions to the trust funds are made as permitted by laws and regulations. the pension trust funds do not directly own any of the company's common stock.
pension coverage for employees of eastman's non-u.s. operations is provided, to the extent deemed appropriate, through separate plans. the company systematically provides for obligations under such plans by depositing funds with trustees, under insurance policies, or by book reserves.
other postretirement benefit plans under its other postretirement benefit plans, eastman provides a subsidy for life insurance, health care, and dental benefits to eligible retirees hired prior to january 1, 2007, and a subsidy for health care and dental benefits to retirees' eligible survivors. in general, eastman provides those benefits to retirees eligible under the company's u.s. plans. similar benefits are also made available to retirees of holston defense corporation, a wholly-owned subsidiary of the company that, prior to january 1, 1999, operated a government-owned ammunition plant.
employees in the u.s. hired on or after january 1, 2007 do not have access to postretirement health care benefits.
a few of the company's non-u.s. operations have supplemental health benefit plans for certain retirees, the cost of which is not significant to the company.
in december 2014, as part of its acquisition of taminco, the company assumed taminco's u.s. postretirement benefit plan. for more information on this acquisition, see note 2 , " acquisitions ".
in july 2012, as part of its acquisition of solutia, the company assumed solutia's postretirement benefit plans which included a voluntary employees' beneficiary association ("veba") retiree trust. for more information on this acquisition, see note 2 , " acquisitions ".

notes to the audited consolidated financial statements in third quarter 2013, the company changed life insurance benefits provided to future retirees by the eastman other postretirement benefit plan which triggered an interim remeasurement of this other postretirement benefit plan obligation. the remeasurement resulted in a reduction in the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation of approximately $47 million which will be amortized as a prior service credit from accumulated other comprehensive income over 8 years. the remeasurement of the plan also resulted in a mark-to-market actuarial gain of $86 million in third quarter 2013. the actuarial gain was primarily due to a higher assumed discount rate of 4.72 percent in third quarter 2013 compared to 4.01 percent at december 31, 2012. the higher assumed discount rate is reflective of changes in global market conditions and interest rates on high-grade corporate bonds.
the estimated prior service credit for the u.s. pension and other postretirement benefit plans that will be amortized from accumulated other comprehensive income into net periodic cost in 2015 is $4 million and $24 million , respectively.
the assumptions used to develop the projected benefit obligation for the company's significant u.s. and non-u.s.
defined benefit pension plans and u.s. postretirement benefit plans are provided in the following tables.

a seven and one-half percent rate of increase in per capita cost of covered health care benefits is assumed for
2015. the rate is assumed to decrease gradually to five percent in 2020 and remain at that level thereafter. a one percent increase or decrease in health care cost trend would have had no material impact on the 2014 service and interest costs or the 2014 benefit obligation, because the company's contributions for benefits are fixed.
the company performed a five year experience study on assumptions for the u.s. plans in 2014 which included a review of the mortality tables. the company uses the rp-2000 table with scale aa static improvement scale and no collar adjustment. as a result of the study, the company will not change to the recently published rp-2014 table as the current rp-2000 table with scale aa more closely aligns with the company's experience.

notes to the audited consolidated financial statements the company's investment strategy for its defined benefit pension plans is to maximize the long-term rate of return on plan assets within an acceptable level of risk in order to meet or exceed the plan's actuarially assumed long-
term rate of return and to minimize the cost of providing pension benefits. a periodic asset/liability study is conducted in order to assist in the determination and, if necessary, modification of the appropriate long-term investment policy for the plan. the investment policy establishes a target allocation range for each asset class and the fund is managed within those ranges. the plans use a number of investment approaches including investments in equity, real estate, and fixed income funds in which the underlying securities are marketable in order to achieve this target allocation. the plans also invest in private equity and other funds. diversification is created through investment across various asset classes, geographies, fund managers, and individual securities. this investment process provides for a well-diversified portfolio with no significant concentration of risk. the investment process is monitored by an investment committee comprised of various senior executives from within eastman.
in december 2014, as part of its acquisition of taminco, the company assumed taminco's non-u.s. defined benefit pension plans in belgium and finland. the pension plans' assets consist of guaranteed investment contracts with an insurance company.
the company also assumed taminco's u.s. postretirement benefit plan which has no plan assets.
in july 2012, as part of its acquisition of solutia, the company assumed solutia's defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans. the solutia defined benefit pension plans adhere to the company's defined benefit plan investment strategy. the solutia defined benefit pension plans also utilize a dynamic de-risking strategy to shift from growth assets to liability matching assets as the plan's funded status improves. the investment strategy with respect to solutia's other postretirement benefits plan is to invest in an intermediate-
term, well diversified, high quality investment instruments, with a primary objective of capital preservation.
the expected rate of return for all plans was determined primarily by modeling the expected long-term rates of return for the categories of investments held by the plans and the targeted allocation percentage against various potential economic scenarios.
the company funded its u.s. defined benefit pension plans in the amount of $120 million in both 2014 and 2013. for
2015, there are no minimum required cash contributions for the u.s. defined benefit pension plans under the employee retirement income security act of 1974, as amended, and the internal revenue code of 1986, as amended.
benefits expected to be paid from pension plans and benefits, net of participant contributions, expected to be paid for postretirement benefit obligations are as follows:

12.  commitments purchase obligations and lease commitments the company had various purchase obligations at december 31, 2014 totaling $2.0 billion over a period of approximately 30 years for materials, supplies, and energy incident to the ordinary conduct of business. the company also had various lease commitments for property and equipment under cancelable, noncancelable, and month-
to-month operating leases totaling approximately $309 million over a period of approximately 45 years. of the total lease commitments, approximately 50 percent relate to real property, including office space, storage facilities, and land; approximately 40 percent relate to railcars; and approximately 10 percent relate to machinery and equipment, including computer and communications equipment and production equipment. rental expense, net of sublease income, was $80 million , $73 million , and $61 million in 2014, 2013, and 2012, respectively.

guarantees the company has operating leases with terms that require the company to guarantee a portion of the residual value of the leased assets upon termination of the lease as well as other guarantees. disclosures about each group of similar guarantees are provided below.
residual value guarantees the company has operating leases with terms that require the company to guarantee a portion of the residual value of the leased assets upon termination of the lease. these residual value guarantees at december 31, 2014 totaled
$121 million and consisted primarily of leases for railcars and company aircraft and will expire beginning in 2016.
management believes, based on current facts and circumstances, that the likelihood of material residual guarantee payments is remote.
other guarantees guarantees and claims also arise during the ordinary course of business from relationships with joint venture partners, suppliers, customers, and other parties when the company undertakes an obligation to guarantee the performance of others, if specified triggering events occur. non-performance under a contract could trigger an obligation of the company. the company's current other guarantees include guarantees relating primarily to intellectual property, environmental matters, and other indemnifications and have arisen through the normal course of business. the ultimate effect on future financial results is not subject to reasonable estimation because considerable uncertainty exists as to the final outcome of these claims, if they were to occur. these other guarantees have terms between 1 and 30 years with maximum potential future payments of approximately $29 million in the aggregate, with none of these guarantees individually significant to the company's operating results, financial position, or liquidity. the company's current expectation is that future payment or performance related to non-
performance under other guarantees is considered remote.
13.  environmental matters and asset retirement obligations certain eastman manufacturing sites generate hazardous and nonhazardous wastes, the treatment, storage, transportation, and disposal of which are regulated by various governmental agencies. in connection with the cleanup of various hazardous waste sites, the company, along with many other entities, has been designated a potentially responsible party ("prp") by the u.s. environmental protection agency under the comprehensive environmental response, compensation and liability act, which potentially subjects prps to joint and several liability for such cleanup costs. in addition, the company will be required to incur costs for environmental remediation and closure and postclosure under the federal resource conservation and recovery act. reserves for environmental contingencies have been established in accordance with eastman's policies described in note 1 , "
significant accounting policies ". the company's total reserve for environmental contingencies was $345 million and
$368 million at december 31, 2014 and 2013 , respectively. at december 31, 2014 and 2013 , this reserve included
$10 million and $9 million , respectively, related to sites previously closed and impaired by eastman, as well as sites that have been divested by eastman but for which the company retains the environmental liability.
120
notes to the audited consolidated financial statements estimated future environmental expenditures for remediation costs ranged from the minimum or best estimate of $324
million to the maximum of $548 million and from the minimum or best estimate of $341 million to the maximum of $581
million at december 31, 2014 and 2013 , respectively. the maximum estimated future costs are considered to be reasonably possible and include the amounts accrued at both december 31, 2014 and 2013 . although the resolution of uncertainties related to these environmental matters may have a material adverse effect on the company's consolidated results of operations in the period recognized, because of expected sharing of costs, the availability of legal defenses, and the company's preliminary assessment of actions that may be required, management does not believe that the company's liability for these environmental matters, individually or in the aggregate, will be material to the company's consolidated financial position or cash flows.
an asset retirement obligation is an obligation for the retirement of a tangible long-lived asset that is incurred upon the acquisition, construction, development, or normal operation of that long-lived asset. the company recognizes asset retirement obligations in the period in which they are incurred if a reasonable estimate of fair value can be made. the asset retirement obligation is subsequently adjusted for changes in fair value. the associated estimated asset retirement costs are capitalized as part of the carrying value of the long-lived assets and depreciated over their useful life. environmental asset retirement obligations consist of primarily closure and post-closure costs. for facilities that have environmental asset retirement obligations, the best estimate accrued to date over the facilities' estimated useful lives for these asset retirement obligation costs were $21 million and $27 million at december 31, 2014 and 2013 , respectively.
reserves for environmental remediation that management believes to be probable and estimable are recorded as current and long-term liabilities in the consolidated statements of financial position. these reserves include liabilities expected to be paid out within 30 years. the amounts charged to pre-tax earnings for environmental remediation and related charges are included in cost of sales and other (income) charges, net, and are summarized below:

the company's total environmental reserve for environmental contingencies, including remediation costs and asset retirement obligations, is recorded in the consolidated statements of financial position as follows:

long-term total                                  $           345    $   368
additionally, costs of certain remediation projects included in the assumed environmental reserve are subject to a cost-sharing arrangement with monsanto company ("monsanto") under the provisions of the amended and restated settlement agreement effective february 28, 2008 (the "effective date"), into which solutia entered with monsanto upon its emergence from bankruptcy (the "monsanto settlement agreement"). under the provisions of the monsanto settlement agreement, the company shares responsibility with monsanto for remediation at certain locations outside of the boundaries of plant sites in anniston, alabama and sauget, illinois (the "shared sites"). the company is responsible for the funding of environmental liabilities at the shared sites up to a total of $325 million from the effective date. if remediation costs for the shared sites exceed this amount, such costs will thereafter be shared equally between the company and monsanto. including payments by solutia prior to its acquisition by eastman, $64
million had been paid for costs at the shared sites as of december 31, 2014 . as of december 31, 2014 , an additional $212 million has been accrued for estimated future remediation costs at the shared sites, over a period of thirty years.
121
notes to the audited consolidated financial statements environmental costs are capitalized if they extend the life of the related property, increase its capacity, and/or mitigate or prevent future contamination. the cost of operating and maintaining environmental control facilities is charged to expense. the company's cash expenditures related to environmental protection and improvement were $319
million , $285 million , and $262 million in 2014 , 2013 , and 2012 , respectively. these amounts were primarily for operating costs associated with environmental protection equipment and facilities, but also included $79
million and $53 million in expenditures for engineering and construction in 2014 and 2013, respectively.
the company also has contractual obligations that include asset retirement obligations not associated with environmental liabilities. eastman's non-environmental asset retirement obligations are primarily associated with the future closure of leased manufacturing assets at pace, florida and oulu, finland acquired from taminco. these accrued non-environmental asset retirement obligations were $44 million as of december 31, 2014.
14.  legal matters general from time to time, the company and its operations are parties to, or targets of, lawsuits, claims, investigations and proceedings, including product liability, personal injury, asbestos, patent and intellectual property, commercial, contract, environmental, antitrust, health and safety, and employment matters, which are being handled and defended in the ordinary course of business. while the company is unable to predict the outcome of these matters, it does not believe, based upon currently available facts, that the ultimate resolution of any such pending matters will have a material adverse effect on its overall financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.

2014
in 2014 , there were net asset impairments and restructuring charges of $77 million .
in 2014, asset impairments of $18 million and restructuring charges, including severance, of $24 million were recognized in the afp segment for costs of the closure of a crystex ® r&d facility in france.
126
notes to the audited consolidated financial statements as a result of the annual impairment testing of indefinite-lived intangible assets, in third quarter 2014 the company recognized an intangible asset impairment of $22 million in the afp segment to adjust the carrying value of the crystex ® tradename to the estimated fair value. this impairment resulted from a decrease in projected revenue since the tradename was acquired from solutia in 2012. the estimated fair value was determined using an income approach, specifically the relief from royalty method.
in addition, during 2014, a change in estimate of certain costs for the fourth quarter 2012 termination of the operating agreement for the são jose dos campos, brazil site resulted in a restructuring charge of $5 million to previously recognized asset impairments and restructuring charges.
during 2014, the company recognized gains from the sales of previously impaired assets at the former photovoltaics production facility in germany and a former polymers production facility in china of $5 million and $2 million , respectively.
in 2014, charges in the am segment included $10 million of asset impairments, including intangible assets, and $2
million of restructuring charges primarily due to the closure of a production facility in taiwan for the flexvue ®
product line. 2014 also included $5 million of restructuring charges for severance associated with the integration of the acquired solutia businesses.
2013
in 2013, there were $76 million in asset impairments and restructuring charges and gains, net, including $23
million of restructuring charges primarily for severance associated with the integration of solutia. for additional information related to the acquisition of solutia, see note 2 , " acquisitions ".
during 2013, management decided not to continue its perennial woodtm growth initiative. this resulted in asset impairment charges of $16 million and restructuring charges of $14 million primarily for inventory and contract termination costs. also during fourth quarter 2013, management decided to terminate efforts to develop a continuous resin process in kuantan, malaysia and antwerp, belgium. this resulted in asset impairment charges of $4 million .
during 2013, management decided to shut-down the photovoltaics product line, including the primary production facility in germany. this resulted in the company recognizing asset impairments of $8 million and restructuring charges of $6 million including charges for severance.
during 2013, management also approved and recorded severance charges of $6 million primarily for a voluntary separation plan for certain employees.
in addition, during 2013, a change in estimate for certain costs for the fourth quarter 2012 termination of the operating agreement for the são jose dos campos, brazil site resulted in a reduction of $4 million to previously recorded asset impairments and restructuring charges.
2012
in 2012, there were $120 million in asset impairments and restructuring charges and gains, net.
during 2012, the company terminated an operating agreement at the acquired solutia facility in são jose dos campos, brazil, which resulted in asset impairments and restructuring charges of $35 million . restructuring charges for the shutdown of manufacturing activities at this site included contract termination costs for severance and other required costs under the operating agreement. additionally, the company recorded asset impairments for long-lived assets at the site, based on fair value indicators.
during 2012, management approved the closure of a production facility in china. based on business analysis completed in fourth quarter, the company concluded the production of the related product lines would be most efficiently performed in its kingsport, tennessee facility. this resulted in the company recognizing asset impairment and restructuring charges of $6 million .
during 2012, acquisition related restructuring charges of $32 million were recorded primarily for severance costs associated with the acquisition and integration of solutia.
127
notes to the audited consolidated financial statements during 2012, the company ceased r&d activities for renewable chemicals at a site it acquired in 2011, resulting in asset impairments and restructuring charges of $4 million .
during 2012, the company recognized asset impairments of $17 million due to a change in approach to address recently finalized boiler air emissions regulations. the company had incurred engineering costs associated with required modifications for its existing steam and electric generation capacity. however, based on the then current availability of natural gas and the lower cost of operation, management determined that conversion to natural gas fueled boilers was more cost efficient. the company entered into long-term natural gas supply agreements with a third party in fourth quarter 2012, triggering the impairment of the project.
during 2012, management decided to cease production of certain products in its perennial woodtm growth initiative.
as a result, a restructuring charge of $17 million was recognized for inventory costs in excess of recoverable value on these certain product lines and to accrue for losses on take-or-pay contracts with third parties. an analysis was performed to determine what, if any, impairment may be required for the associated fixed assets. based on the expected life of the assets and intended uses within the company's continuing acetylation initiatives, there was no impairment.
the company also recognized asset impairments related to land retained from the previously discontinued industrial gasification project. based on fair value indicators, the carrying value of the beaumont land was reduced by $6
million .

18.  share-based compensation plans and awards
2012 omnibus stock compensation plan eastman's 2012 omnibus stock compensation plan ("2012 omnibus plan") was approved by stockholders at the may 3,
2012 annual meeting of stockholders and shall remain in effect until its fifth anniversary. the 2012 omnibus plan authorizes the compensation and management development committee of the board of directors to: grant awards, designate participants, determine the types and numbers of awards, determine the terms and conditions of awards and determine the form of award settlement. under the 2012 omnibus plan, the aggregate number of shares reserved and available for issuance is 10 million , which will consist of a number of shares not previously authorized for issuance under any other plan. the number of shares covered by an award is counted against this share reserve as of the grant date of the award. shares covered by full value awards (e.g. performance shares and restricted stock awards) are counted against the total number of shares available for issuance or delivery under the plan as 2.5
shares for every one share covered by the award. any stock distributed pursuant to an award may consist of, in whole or in part, authorized and unissued stock, treasury stock, or stock purchased on the open market. under the
2012 omnibus plan and previous plans, the forms of awards have included: restricted stock and restricted stock units, stock options, stock appreciation rights ("sars"), and performance shares. the 2012 omnibus plan is flexible as to the number of specific forms of awards, but provides that stock options and sars are to be granted at an exercise price not less than 100 percent of the per share fair market value on the date of the grant .
director stock compensation subplan eastman's 2013 director stock compensation subplan ("directors' subplan"), a component of the 2012 omnibus plan, remains in effect until terminated by the board of directors or the earlier termination of the 2012 omnibus plan.
the directors' subplan provides for structured awards of restricted shares to non-employee members of the board of directors. restricted shares awarded under the directors' subplan are subject to the same terms and conditions of the 2012 omnibus plan. the directors' subplan does not constitute a separate source of shares for grant of equity awards and all shares awarded are part of the 10 million shares authorized under the 2012 omnibus plan. shares of restricted stock are granted on the first day of a non-employee director's initial term of service and shares of restricted stock are granted each year to each non-employee director on the date of the annual meeting of stockholders.
general the company is authorized by the board of directors under the 2012 omnibus plan to provide grants to employees and non-employee members of the board of directors. it has been the company's practice to issue new shares rather than treasury shares for equity awards that require settlement by the issuance of common stock and to withhold or accept back shares awarded to cover the related income tax obligations of employee participants. shares of unrestricted common stock owned by non-employee directors are not withheld or acquired to satisfy the withholding obligation related to their income taxes. shares of unrestricted common stock owned by specified senior management level employees are accepted by the company to pay the exercise price of stock options in accordance with the terms and conditions of their awards.

notes to the audited consolidated financial statements for 2014, 2013, and 2012, total share-based compensation expense (before tax) of approximately $28 million , $40
million , and $28 million , respectively, was recognized in selling, general and administrative expense in the consolidated statements of earnings for all share-based awards of which approximately $4 million , $5 million , and
$2 million , respectively, related to stock options. the compensation expense is recognized over the substantive vesting period, which may be a shorter time period than the stated vesting period for qualifying termination eligible employees as defined in the forms of award notice. for 2014 and 2013, approximately $1 million and $3
million , respectively, of stock option compensation expense was recognized due to qualifying termination eligibility preceding the requisite vesting period.
stock option awards options have been granted on an annual basis to non-employee directors under the directors' subplan and predecessor plans and by the compensation and management development committee of the board of directors under the 2012 omnibus plan and predecessor plans to employees. option awards have an exercise price equal to the closing price of the company's stock on the date of grant. the term of options is 10 years with vesting periods that vary up to three years. vesting usually occurs ratably over the vesting period or at the end of the vesting period. the company utilizes the black scholes merton option valuation model which relies on certain assumptions to estimate an option's fair value.
the weighted average assumptions used in the determination of fair value for stock options awarded in 2014 and 2013
are provided in the table below. there were no stock options granted in 2012.
assumptions                          2014      2013
expected volatility rate           25.82%    34.90%
expected dividend yield             1.70%     1.97%
average risk-free interest rate     1.44%     0.77%
expected forfeiture rate            0.75%     0.75%
expected term years                   4.7       5.0
the volatility rate of grants is derived from historical company common stock price volatility over the same time period as the expected term of each stock option award. the volatility rate is derived by mathematical formula utilizing the weekly high closing stock price data over the expected term.
the expected dividend yield is calculated using the company's average of the last four quarterly dividend yields .
the average risk-free interest rate is derived from united states department of treasury published interest rates of daily yield curves for the same time period as the expected term.
gaap specifies only share-based awards expected to vest be included in share-based compensation expense. estimated forfeiture rates are determined using historical forfeiture experience for each type of award and are excluded from the quantity of awards included in share-based compensation expense.
the weighted average expected term reflects the analysis of historical share-based award transactions and includes option swap and reload grants which may have much shorter remaining expected terms than new option grants.

notes to the audited consolidated financial statements for nonvested options at december 31, 2014, approximately $3 million in compensation expense will be recognized over the next three years.
other share-based compensation awards in addition to stock option awards, the company has awarded long-term performance share awards, restricted stock awards, and sars. the long-term performance awards are based upon actual return on capital compared to a target return on capital and total stockholder return compared to a peer group ranking by total stockholder return over a three year performance period. the awards are valued using a monte carlo simulation based model and vest pro-rata over the three year performance period. the number of long-term performance award target shares granted for the
2014-2016, 2013-2015, and 2012-2014 periods were 285 thousand, 270 thousand, and 338 thousand, respectively. the target shares granted are assumed to be 100 percent. at the end of the three-year performance period, the actual number of shares awarded can range from zero percent to 250 percent of the target shares granted based on the award notice. the number of restricted stock awards granted during 2014, 2013, and 2012 were 144 thousand, 146 thousand, and 84 thousand, respectively. the fair value of a restricted stock award is equal to the closing stock price of the company's stock on the date of grant and normally vests over a period of three years. the recognized compensation expense before tax for these other share-based awards in the years ended december 31, 2014, 2013, and
2012 was approximately $24 million , $35 million , and $26 million , respectively. the unrecognized compensation expense before tax for these same type awards at december 31, 2014 was approximately $35 million and will be recognized primarily over a period of two years.

notes to the audited consolidated financial statements
23.  recently issued accounting standards in april 2014, the financial accounting standards board ("fasb") issued amended accounting guidance for discontinued operations. the amendments improve the definition of discontinued operations by limiting discontinued operations reporting to disposals of components of an entity that represent strategic shifts that have (or will have) a major effect on any entity's operations and financial results. examples of a strategic shift that has (or will have) a major effect on an entity's operations and financial results could include a disposal of a major geographical area, a major line of business, a major equity method investment, or other major parts of an entity.
the amendments require an entity to present, for each comparative period, the assets and liabilities of a disposal group that includes a discontinued operation separately in the assets and liability sections, respectively, of the statement of financial position. in addition to enhanced disclosures for discontinued operations, disclosures are required for disposal of an individually significant component of an entity that does not qualify for discontinued operations presentation in the financial statements. this guidance is effective prospectively for reporting periods beginning on or after december 15, 2014. early adoption is permitted, but only for disposals that have not been reported in financial statements previously issued or available for issuance. the company has concluded that changes in its accounting required by this new guidance will not materially impact the company's future accounting for any discontinued operations or its financial position or results of operations.
in may 2014, the fasb and international accounting standards board jointly issued new principles-based accounting guidance for revenue recognition that will supersede virtually all existing revenue guidance. the core principle of this guidance is that an entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods and services. to achieve the core principle, the guidance establishes the following five steps: 1)
identify the contract(s) with a customer, 2) identify the performance obligation in the contract, 3) determine the transaction price, 4) allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract, and 5)
recognize revenue when (or as) the entity satisfies a performance obligation. the guidance also details the accounting treatment for costs to obtain or fulfill a contract. lastly, disclosure requirements have been enhanced to provide sufficient information to enable users of financial statements to understand the nature, amount, timing, and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from contracts with customers. this guidance is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after december 15, 2016, including interim periods within that reporting period.
early application is not permitted. the company is currently evaluating the impact this new guidance is expected to have on the company's financial position or results of operations and related disclosures.

item 9.  changes in and disagreements with accountants on accounting and financial disclosure none.
item 9a.  controls and procedures disclosure controls and procedures eastman chemical company ("eastman" or the "company") maintains a set of disclosure controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the company in reports that it files or submits under the securities exchange act of 1934 is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in securities and exchange commission rules and forms. disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by the company in the reports that it files or submits under the securities exchange act of 1934 is accumulated and communicated to the company's management, including its principal executive and principal financial officers, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. an evaluation was carried out under the supervision and with the participation of the company's management, including the chief executive officer
("ceo") and chief financial officer ("cfo"), of the effectiveness of the company's disclosure controls and procedures. based on that evaluation, the ceo and cfo have concluded that as of december 31, 2014 , the company's disclosure controls and procedures were effective to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed was accumulated and communicated to management as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.
management necessarily applies its judgment in assessing the costs and benefits of such controls and procedures, which, by their nature, can provide only reasonable assurance regarding management's control objectives.
management, including the ceo and cfo, does not expect that the company's disclosure controls and procedures can prevent all possible errors or fraud. a control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance; judgments in decision-making can be faulty; and breakdowns can occur because of simple errors or mistakes. additionally, controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of one or more persons. the design of any system of controls is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and while the company's disclosure controls and procedures are designed to be effective under circumstances where they should reasonably be expected to operate effectively, there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions. because of the inherent limitations in any control system, misstatements due to possible errors or fraud may occur and not be detected.
management's report on internal control over financial reporting management of the company is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. the company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed under the supervision of the company's ceo and cfo to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of the company's financial statements for external purposes in accordance with u.s. generally accepted accounting principles.
the company's internal control over financial reporting includes policies and procedures that:
•  pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect transactions and acquisitions and dispositions of assets of the company;
provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial
•  statements in accordance with u.s. generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and the directors of the company; and
•  provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the company's financial statements.
because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
140
management has assessed the effectiveness of its internal control over financial reporting as of december 31, 2014
based on the framework established in internal control - integrated framework (2013) issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission ("coso"). based on this assessment, management has determined that the company's internal control over financial reporting was effective as of december 31, 2014 .
management has elected to exclude the non-integrated taminco corporation and commonwealth laminating and coating, inc. 2014 acquisitions from its assessment of internal control over financial reporting during the year of acquisition. the assets acquired in 2014 represented 25 percent of the company's consolidated total assets as of december 31, 2014 and sales represented one percent of the company's consolidated sales for the year ended december
31, 2014 .
the effectiveness of the company's internal control over financial reporting as of december 31, 2014 has been audited by pricewaterhousecoopers llp, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report which appears herein.
changes in internal control over financial reporting there has been no change in the company's internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ended december 31, 2014 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially effect, the company's internal control over financial reporting. the company continues its integration of the acquired taminco and commonwealth businesses.

management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations growth initiatives may not achieve desired business or financial objectives and may require a significant use of resources in excess of those estimated or budgeted for such initiatives.
the company continues to identify and pursue growth opportunities through both organic growth initiatives and inorganic initiatives. these growth opportunities include development and commercialization or licensing of innovative new products and technologies and related employee leadership, expertise, and skill development and retention, expansion into new markets and geographic regions, and alliances, ventures, and acquisitions that complement and extend the company's portfolio of businesses and capabilities. there can be no assurance that such innovation, development and commercialization or licensing efforts, investments, or acquisitions and alliances
(including integration of acquired businesses) will result in financially successful commercialization of products, or acceptance by existing or new customers, or successful entry into new markets or otherwise achieve their underlying strategic business objectives or that they will be beneficial to the company's results of operations.
there also can be no assurance regarding the timing of completion of proposed acquisitions or licensing, expected benefits of proposed acquisitions or licensing, completion of integration plans, and synergies therefrom. there also can be no assurance that capital projects for growth efforts can be completed within the time or at the costs projected due, among other things, to demand for and availability of construction materials and labor and obtaining regulatory approvals and operating permits and reaching agreement on terms of key agreements and arrangements with potential suppliers and customers. any such delays or cost overruns or the inability to obtain such approvals or to reach such agreements on acceptable terms could negatively affect the returns from any proposed or current investments and projects.
significant acquisitions expose the company to risks and uncertainties, the occurrence of any of which could materially adversely affect the company's business, financial condition, and results of operations.
while acquisitions have been and continue to be a part of the company's growth strategy, acquisitions of large companies (such as the acquisition of taminco and solutia) subject the company to a number of risks and uncertainties, the occurrence of any of which could have a material adverse effect on eastman. these include, but are not limited to the possibilities that the financial performance of the acquired business may be significantly worse than expected; that significant additional indebtedness may constrain the company's ability to access the credit and capital markets at attractive interest rates and favorable terms, which may negatively impact the company's liquidity or ability to pursue certain growth initiatives; that the company may not be able to achieve the cost, revenue, tax, or other "synergies" expected from any acquisition, or that there may be delays in achieving any such synergies; that management's time and effort may be dedicated to the new business resulting in a loss of focus on the successful operation of the company's existing businesses; and that the company may be required to expend significant additional resources in order to integrate any acquired business into eastman or that the integration efforts will not achieve the expected benefits.
legislative or regulatory actions could increase the company's future compliance costs.
the company and its facilities and businesses are subject to complex health, safety and environmental laws and regulations, which require and will continue to require significant expenditures to remain in compliance with such laws and regulations. the company's accruals for such costs and associated liabilities are subject to changes in estimates on which the accruals are based. for example, any amount accrued for environmental matters reflects the company's assumptions about remediation requirements at the contaminated site, the nature of the remedy, the outcome of discussions with regulatory agencies and other potentially responsible parties at multi-party sites, and the number and financial viability of other potentially responsible parties. changes in the estimates on which the accruals are based, unanticipated government enforcement action, or changes in health, safety, environmental, chemical control regulations, and testing requirements could result in higher costs. specifically, pending and proposed u.s. federal legislation and regulation increase the likelihood that the company's manufacturing sites will in the future be impacted by regulation of greenhouse gas emissions and energy policy, which legislation and regulation, if enacted, may result in capital expenditures, increases in costs for raw materials and energy, limitations on raw material and energy source and supply choices, and other direct compliance costs.

management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in addition to the foregoing most significant known risk factors to the company, there may be other factors, not currently known to the company, which could, in the future, materially adversely affect the company, its business, financial condition, or results of operations. the foregoing discussion of the most significant risk factors to the company does not necessarily present them in order of importance. this disclosure, including that under "outlook"
and other forward-looking statements and related disclosures made by the company in this annual report and elsewhere from time to time, represents management's best judgment as of the date the information is given. the company does not undertake responsibility for updating any of such information, whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise, except as required by law. investors are advised, however, to consult any further public company disclosures (such as in filings with the securities and exchange commission or in company press releases) on related subjects.

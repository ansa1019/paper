item 1a. risk factors our business is subject to various risks and uncertainties. any of the risks and uncertainties described below could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations and should be considered in evaluating us. while we believe we have identified and discussed below the key risk factors affecting our business, there may be additional risks and uncertainties that are not presently known or that are not currently believed to be significant that may adversely affect our business, performance, or financial condition in the future.
deterioration of general economic conditions could harm our business and results of operations.
our business and results of operations may be adversely affected by changes in national or global economic conditions, including inflation, interest rates, availability of capital markets, consumer spending rates, energy availability and costs (including fuel surcharges), and the effects of governmental initiatives to manage economic conditions.
volatility in financial markets and deterioration of national and global economic conditions could impact our business and operations in a variety of ways, including as follows:
•   consumers may shift purchases to more generic, lower-priced, or other value offerings, or may forego certain purchases altogether during economic downturns, which could result in a reduction in sales of higher margin products or a shift in our product mix to lower margin offerings adversely affecting the results of our consumer foods or private brands operations;
•   decreased demand in the restaurant business, particularly casual and fine dining, which may adversely affect our commercial foods operations;
•   volatility in commodity and other input costs could substantially impact our result of operations;
•   volatility in the equity markets or interest rates could substantially impact our pension costs and required pension contributions; and
•   it may become more costly or difficult to obtain debt or equity financing to fund operations or investment opportunities, or to refinance our debt in the future, in each case on terms and within a time period acceptable to us.
we may not fully realize the anticipated growth opportunities and cost synergies from the acquisition of ralcorp holdings, inc. or in the expected time frame.
the anticipated benefits from our acquisition of ralcorp holdings, inc., or ralcorp, which we refer to as the acquisition, will depend, in part, on our ability to realize the anticipated growth opportunities and cost synergies from the acquisition.
our success in realizing these growth opportunities and cost synergies, and the timing of this realization, depends on the successful integration of ralcorp. there is a significant degree of difficulty and management distraction inherent in the process of integrating an acquisition as sizable as ralcorp. members of our senior management may be required to devote considerable amounts of time to this continuing integration process, which will decrease the time they will have to manage our company, service existing customers, attract new customers, and develop new products or strategies. if senior management is not able to effectively manage the ongoing integration process, or if any significant business activities are interrupted as a result of the process, our business could suffer. there can be no assurance that we will successfully or cost-effectively integrate the ralcorp business. the failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.
6
even if we are able to fully integrate ralcorp successfully, this integration may not result in the realization of the full benefits of the growth opportunities and cost synergies that we expect from this integration, and we cannot guarantee that these benefits will be achieved within anticipated time frames or at all. for example, we may not be able to eliminate duplicative costs. moreover, we may incur substantial expenses in connection with the integration. while certain expenses will continue to be incurred to achieve cost synergies, such expenses are difficult to estimate accurately, and may exceed current estimates. accordingly, the benefits from the acquisition may be offset by costs incurred to, or delays in, integrating the businesses.
our existing and future debt may limit cash flow available to invest in the ongoing needs of our business and could prevent us from fulfilling our debt obligations.
as of may 25, 2014, we had a substantial amount of debt, including $3.912 billion of senior notes that we issued, and a $900 million term loan that we entered into, in connection with the acquisition. we have the ability under our existing revolving credit facility to incur substantial additional debt. our level of debt could have important consequences. for example, it could:
•   make it more difficult for us to make payments on our debt;
•   require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to the payment of debt service, reducing the availability of our cash flow to fund working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, and other general corporate purposes;
•   increase our vulnerability to adverse economic or industry conditions;
•   limit our ability to obtain additional financing in the future to enable us to react to changes in our business; or
•   place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to businesses in our industry that have less debt.
additionally, any failure to meet required payments on our debt, or failure to comply with any covenants in the instruments governing our debt, could result in an event of default under the terms of those instruments and a downgrade to our credit ratings. a downgrade in our credit ratings would increase our borrowing costs and could affect our ability to issue commercial paper. in the event of a default, the holders of our debt could elect to declare all the amounts outstanding under such instruments to be due and payable. any default under the agreements governing our debt and the remedies sought by the holders of such debt could render us unable to pay principal and interest on our debt.
we may not realize the benefits that we expect from our supply chain and administrative efficiency plan, or scae plan.
during fiscal 2014, we announced our supply chain and administrative efficiency plan, or scae plan, which was an expansion of the scope of the plan to integrate ralcorp. the scae plan includes steps to optimize the entire organization's supply chain network and to improve selling, general and administrative effectiveness and efficiencies, as well as our continuing evaluation of plans for the integration of ralcorp and related restructuring activities. the successful design and implementation of the scae plan presents significant organizational design and infrastructure challenges and in many cases will require successful negotiations with third parties, including labor organizations, suppliers, business partners, and other stakeholders. in addition, the scae plan may not advance our business strategy as expected. events and circumstances, such as financial or strategic difficulties, delays and unexpected costs may occur that could result in our not realizing all or any of the anticipated benefits or our not realizing the anticipated benefits on our expected timetable. if we are unable to realize the anticipated savings of the scae plan, our ability to fund other initiatives may be adversely affected. any failure to implement the scae plan in accordance with our expectations could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
in addition, the complexity of the scae plan will require a substantial amount of management and operational resources. our management team must successfully implement administrative and operational changes necessary to achieve the anticipated benefits of the scae plan. these and related demands on our resources may divert the organization's attention from existing core businesses, integrating financial or other systems, have adverse effects on existing business relationships with suppliers and customers, and impact employee morale. as a result our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows may be adversely affected.
increases in commodity costs may have a negative impact on profits.
we use many different commodities such as wheat, corn, oats, soybeans, beef, pork, poultry, and energy. commodities are subject to price volatility caused by commodity market fluctuations, supply and demand, currency fluctuations, external conditions such as weather, and changes in governmental agricultural and energy policies and regulations. commodity price increases will result in increases in raw material, packaging, and energy costs and operating costs. we may not be able to increase our product prices and achieve cost savings that fully offset these increased costs; and increasing prices may result in reduced sales volume,
7
reduced margins, and profitability. we have experience in hedging against commodity price increases; however, these practices and experience reduce, but do not eliminate, the risk of negative profit impacts from commodity price increases. we do not fully hedge against changes in commodity prices, and the risk management procedures that we use may not always work as we intend.
volatility in the market value of derivatives we use to manage exposures to fluctuations in commodity prices will cause volatility in our gross margins and net earnings.
we utilize derivatives to manage price risk for some of our principal ingredients and energy costs, including grains (wheat, corn, and oats), oils, beef, pork, poultry, and energy. changes in the values of these derivatives are recorded in earnings currently, resulting in volatility in both gross margin and net earnings. these gains and losses are reported in cost of sales in our consolidated statements of earnings and in unallocated corporate items in our segment operating results until we utilize the underlying input in our manufacturing process, at which time the gains and losses are reclassified to segment operating profit. we may experience volatile earnings as a result of these accounting treatments.
increased competition may result in reduced sales or profits.
the food industry is highly competitive. our principal competitors have substantial financial, marketing, and other resources. increased competition can reduce our sales due to loss of market share or the need to reduce prices to respond to competitive and customer pressures. competitive pressures also may restrict our ability to increase prices, including in response to commodity and other cost increases. we sell branded, private brand, and customized food products, as well as commercially branded foods and ingredients. our branded products have an advantage over private brand products primarily due to advertising and name recognition, although private brand products typically sell at a discount to those of branded competitors. in addition, when branded competitors focus on price and promotion, the environment for private brand producers becomes more challenging because the price difference between private brand products and branded products may become less significant. in most product categories, we compete not only with other widely advertised branded products, but also with other private label and store brand products that are generally sold at lower prices. a strong competitive response from one or more of our competitors to our marketplace efforts, or a consumer shift towards more generic, lower-priced, or other value offerings, could result in us reducing pricing, increasing marketing or other expenditures, or losing market share. our profits could decrease if a reduction in prices or increased costs are not counterbalanced with increased sales volume.
significant private brand competitive activity can lead to volatility in results and margin compression.
private brand customer buying decisions are often based on a periodic bidding process. our sales volume may decrease significantly if our offer is too high and we lose the ability to sell private brand products through these channels, even temporarily. alternatively, we risk reducing our margins if our offer is successful but below our desired price. either of these outcomes may adversely affect our results of operations.
changes in our relationships with significant customers or suppliers could adversely affect us.
during fiscal 2014, our largest customer, wal-mart stores, inc. and its affiliates, accounted for approximately 17% of our net revenues. there can be no assurance that wal-mart stores, inc. and other significant customers will continue to purchase our products in the same quantities or on the same terms as in the past, particularly as increasingly powerful retailers continue to demand lower pricing. the loss of a significant customer or a material reduction in sales to a significant customer could materially and adversely affect our product sales, financial condition, and results of operations.
disruption of our supply chain could have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.
our ability to make, move, and sell our products is critical to our success. damage or disruption to our supply chain, including third-party manufacturing or transportation and distribution capabilities, due to weather, including any potential effects of climate change, natural disaster, fire or explosion, terrorism, pandemics, strikes, government action, or other reasons beyond our control or the control of our suppliers and business partners, could impair our ability to manufacture or sell our products. failure to take adequate steps to mitigate the likelihood or potential impact of such events, or to effectively manage such events if they occur, particularly when a product is sourced from a single supplier or location, could adversely affect our business or financial results. in addition, disputes with significant suppliers, including disputes regarding pricing or performance, could adversely affect our ability to supply products to our customers and could materially and adversely affect our product sales, financial condition, and results of operations.
8
the sophistication and buying power of our customers could have a negative impact on profits.
our customers, such as supermarkets, warehouse clubs, and food distributors, have continued to consolidate, resulting in fewer customers on which we can rely for business. these consolidations and the growth of supercenters have produced large, sophisticated customers with increased buying power and negotiating strength who are more capable of resisting price increases and can demand lower pricing, increased promotional programs, or specialty tailored products. in addition, larger retailers have the scale to develop supply chains that permit them to operate with reduced inventories or to develop and market their own retailer brands. these customers may also in the future use more of their shelf space, currently used for our products, for their store brand products. we continue to implement initiatives to counteract these pressures. however, if the larger size of these customers results in additional negotiating strength and/or increased private label or store brand competition, our profitability could decline.
consolidation also increases the risk that adverse changes in our customers' business operations or financial performance will have a corresponding material adverse effect on us. for example, if our customers cannot access sufficient funds or financing, then they may delay, decrease, or cancel purchases of our products, or delay or fail to pay us for previous purchases.
we must identify changing consumer preferences and develop and offer food products to meet their preferences.
consumer preferences evolve over time and the success of our food products depends on our ability to identify the tastes and dietary habits of consumers and to offer products that appeal to their preferences, including concerns of consumers regarding health and wellness, obesity, product attributes, and ingredients. introduction of new products and product extensions requires significant development and marketing investment. if our products fail to meet consumer preferences, or we fail to introduce new and improved products on a timely basis, then the return on that investment will be less than anticipated and our strategy to grow sales and profits with investments in acquisitions, marketing, and innovation will be less successful. similarly, demand for our products could be affected by consumer concerns or perceptions regarding the health effects of ingredients such as sodium, trans fats, sugar, processed wheat, or other product ingredients or attributes.
if we do not achieve the appropriate cost structure in the highly competitive food industry, our profitability could decrease.
our future success and earnings growth depend in part on our ability to achieve the appropriate cost structure and operate efficiently in the highly competitive food industry, particularly in an environment of volatile input costs. we continue to implement profit-enhancing initiatives that impact our supply chain and general and administrative functions. these initiatives are focused on cost-saving opportunities in procurement, manufacturing, logistics, and customer service, as well as general and administrative overhead levels. gaining additional efficiencies may become more difficult over time. our failure to reduce costs through productivity gains or by eliminating redundant costs resulting from acquisitions could adversely affect our profitability and weaken our competitive position. if we do not continue to effectively manage costs and achieve additional efficiencies, our competitiveness and our profitability could decrease.
we may be subject to product liability claims and product recalls, which could negatively impact our profitability.
we sell food products for human consumption, which involves risks such as product contamination or spoilage, product tampering, other adulteration of food products, mislabeling, and misbranding. we may be subject to liability if the consumption of any of our products causes injury, illness, or death. in addition, we will voluntarily recall products in the event of contamination or damage. we have issued recalls and have from time to time been and currently are involved in lawsuits relating to our food products. a significant product liability judgment or a widespread product recall may negatively impact our sales and profitability for a period of time depending on the costs of the recall, the destruction of product inventory, product availability, competitive reaction, customer reaction and consumer attitudes. even if a product liability claim is unsuccessful or is not fully pursued, the negative publicity surrounding any assertion that our products caused illness or injury could adversely affect our reputation with existing and potential customers and our corporate and brand image.
additionally, as a manufacturer and marketer of food products, we are subject to extensive regulation by the u.s. food and drug administration and other national, state, and local government agencies. the food, drug & cosmetic act, or the fdca, and the food safety modernization act and their respective regulations govern, among other things, the manufacturing, composition and ingredients, packaging, and safety of food products. some aspects of these laws use a strict liability standard for imposing sanctions on corporate behavior; meaning that no intent is required to be established. if we fail to comply with applicable laws and regulations, we may be subject to civil remedies, including fines, injunctions, recalls, or seizures, as well as criminal sanctions, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or results of operations. as previously disclosed, among the matters outstanding during fiscal 2014 related to the company's 2007 peanut butter recall, is an ongoing investigation by the u.s. attorney's office in georgia and the consumer protection branch of the department of justice. in fiscal 2011, we received formal requests from the u.s. attorney's office in georgia seeking a variety of records and information related to the operations of our peanut butter manufacturing facility in sylvester, georgia. we have been and continue
9
to be engaged in ongoing discussions with the u.s. attorney's office and the department of justice in regard to the investigation. we are pursuing a negotiated resolution, which we believe will likely involve a misdemeanor criminal disposition under the food, drug & cosmetics act.
any damage to our reputation could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.
maintaining a good reputation globally is critical to selling our products. product contamination or tampering, the failure to maintain high standards for product quality, safety, and integrity, including with respect to raw materials and ingredients obtained from suppliers, or allegations of product quality issues, mislabeling or contamination, even if untrue, may reduce demand for our products or cause production and delivery disruptions. our reputation could also be adversely impacted by any of the following, or by adverse publicity (whether or not valid) relating thereto: the failure to maintain high ethical, social, and environmental standards for all of our operations and activities; the failure to achieve our goals with respect to sodium or saturated fat; our research and development efforts; or our environmental impact, including use of agricultural materials, packaging, energy use, and waste management. failure to comply with local laws and regulations, to maintain an effective system of internal controls or to provide accurate and timely financial information could also hurt our reputation. damage to our reputation or loss of consumer confidence in our products for any of these or other reasons could result in decreased demand for our products and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations, as well as require additional resources to rebuild our reputation.
our results could be adversely impacted as a result of increased pension, labor, and people-related expenses.
inflationary pressures and any shortages in the labor market could increase labor costs, which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results or financial condition. our labor costs include the cost of providing employee benefits in the u.s. and foreign jurisdictions, including pension, health and welfare, and severance benefits. changes in interest rates, mortality rates, health care costs, early retirement rates, investment returns, and the market value of plan assets can affect the funded status of our defined benefit plans and cause volatility in the future funding requirements of the plans. a significant increase in our obligations or future funding requirements could have a negative impact on our results of operations and cash flows from operations. additionally, the annual costs of benefits vary with increased costs of health care and the outcome of collectively-bargained wage and benefit agreements.
if we fail to comply with the many laws applicable to our business, we may face lawsuits or incur significant fines and penalties.
our facilities and products are subject to many laws and regulations administered by the united states department of agriculture, the federal food and drug administration, the occupational safety and health administration, and other federal, state, local, and foreign governmental agencies relating to the processing, packaging, storage, distribution, advertising, labeling, quality, and safety of food products, the health and safety of our employees, and the protection of the environment. our failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations could subject us to lawsuits, administrative penalties, and civil remedies, including fines, injunctions, and recalls of our products. our operations are also subject to extensive and increasingly stringent regulations administered by the environmental protection agency, which pertain to the discharge of materials into the environment and the handling and disposition of wastes. failure to comply with these regulations can have serious consequences, including civil and administrative penalties and negative publicity. changes in applicable laws or regulations or evolving interpretations thereof, including increased government regulations to limit carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions as a result of concern over climate change, may result in increased compliance costs, capital expenditures, and other financial obligations for us, which could affect our profitability or impede the production or distribution of our products, which could affect our net operating revenues.
climate change, or legal, regulatory, or market measures to address climate change, may negatively affect our business and operations.
there is growing concern that carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases in the atmosphere may have an adverse impact on global temperatures, weather patterns, and the frequency and severity of extreme weather and natural disasters. in the event that such climate change has a negative effect on agricultural productivity, we may be subject to decreased availability or less favorable pricing for certain commodities that are necessary for our products, such as corn, wheat, and potatoes. we may also be subjected to decreased availability or less favorable pricing for water as a result of such change, which could impact our manufacturing and distribution operations. in addition, natural disasters and extreme weather conditions may disrupt the productivity of our facilities or the operation of our supply chain. the increasing concern over climate change also may result in more regional, federal, and/or global legal and regulatory requirements to reduce or mitigate the effects of greenhouse gases. in the event that such regulation is enacted and is more aggressive than the sustainability measures that we are currently undertaking to monitor our emissions and improve our energy efficiency, we may experience significant increases in our costs of operation and delivery. in particular,
10
increasing regulation of fuel emissions could substantially increase the distribution and supply chain costs associated with our products. as a result, climate change could negatively affect our business and operations.
we are increasingly dependent on information technology, and potential disruption, cyber attacks, security problems, and expanding social media vehicles present new risks.
we are increasingly dependent on information technology networks and systems, including the internet, to process, transmit, and store electronic and financial information, to manage and support a variety of business processes and activities, and to comply with regulatory, legal, and tax requirements. if we do not allocate and effectively manage the resources necessary to build and sustain the proper technology infrastructure and to maintain and protect the related automated and manual control processes, we could be subject to billing and collection errors, business disruptions, or damage resulting from security breaches. if any of our significant information technology systems suffer severe damage, disruption, or shutdown, and our business continuity plans do not effectively resolve the issues in a timely manner, our product sales, financial condition, and results of operations may be materially and adversely affected, and we could experience delays in reporting our financial results. in addition, there is a risk of business interruption, litigation risks, and reputational damage from leakage of confidential information.
the inappropriate use of certain media vehicles could cause brand damage or information leakage. negative posts or comments about the company on any social networking web site could seriously damage its reputation. in addition, the disclosure of non-public company sensitive information through external media channels could lead to information loss. identifying new points of entry as social media continues to expand presents new challenges. any business interruptions or damage to our reputation could negatively impact our financial condition, results of operations, and the market price of our common stock.
in connection with ralcorp's separation of its post brand cereals business, post agreed to indemnify ralcorp for certain liabilities. however, there can be no assurance that the indemnity will be sufficient to protect us against the full amount of such liabilities, or that post's ability to satisfy its indemnification obligations will not be impaired in the future.
pursuant to the separation and distribution agreement and the tax sharing agreement that ralcorp entered into with post in connection with the separation of ralcorp's post brand cereals business, post agreed to indemnify ralcorp for certain liabilities. third parties may seek to hold us responsible for any of the liabilities that post agreed to retain or assume, and there can be no assurance that the indemnification from post will be sufficient to protect us against the full amount of such liabilities, or that post will be able to fully satisfy its indemnification obligations. in addition, even if we ultimately succeed in recovering from post any amounts for which we are held liable, we may be temporarily required to bear these losses ourselves.
impairment in the carrying value of goodwill or other intangibles could result in the incurrence of impairment charges and negatively impact our net worth.
as of may 25, 2014, we had goodwill of $7.84 billion and other intangibles of $3.21 billion. the net carrying value of goodwill represents the fair value of acquired businesses in excess of identifiable assets and liabilities as of the acquisition date (or subsequent impairment date, if applicable). the net carrying value of other intangibles represents the fair value of trademarks, customer relationships, and other acquired intangibles as of the acquisition date (or subsequent impairment date, if applicable), net of accumulated amortization. goodwill and other acquired intangibles expected to contribute indefinitely to our cash flows are not amortized, but must be evaluated by management at least annually for impairment. amortized intangible assets are evaluated for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstance indicate that the carrying amounts of these assets may not be recoverable. impairments to goodwill and other intangible assets may be caused by factors outside our control, such as the inability to quickly replace lost co-manufacturing business, increasing competitive pricing pressures, lower than expected revenue and profit growth rates, changes in industry ebitda multiples, changes in discount rates based on changes in cost of capital (interest rates, etc.), or the bankruptcy of a significant customer and could result in the incurrence of impairment charges and negatively impact our net worth.
following the impairment charges recorded in fiscal 2014, the carrying value of goodwill in our private brands reporting units included $328.7 million for bars and coordinated, $464.4 million for cereal, $752.1 million for pasta, $816.2 million for snacks, $717.1 million for retail bakery, and $136.1 million for condiments. if the future performance of one or more of the reporting units within the private brands segment falls short of our expectations or if there are significant changes in risk-adjusted discount rates due to changes in market conditions, we could be required to recognize additional, material impairment charges in future periods.
11
the termination or expiration of current co-manufacturing arrangements could reduce our sales volume and adversely affect our results of operations.
our businesses periodically enter into co-manufacturing arrangements with manufacturers of products. the terms of these agreements vary but are generally for relatively short periods of time. volumes produced under each of these agreements can fluctuate significantly based upon the product's life cycle, product promotions, alternative production capacity, and other factors, none of which are under our direct control. our future ability to enter into co-manufacturing arrangements is not guaranteed, and a decrease in current co-manufacturing levels could have a significant negative impact on sales volume.
ardent mills may not achieve the benefits that are anticipated from the joint venture.
the benefits that are expected to result from the recently formed ardent mills joint venture will depend, in part, on our ability to realize the anticipated cost synergies in the transaction, ardent mills' ability to successfully integrate the conagra mills and horizon milling businesses and its ability to successfully manage the joint venture on a going-forward basis. it is not certain that we will realize these benefits at all, and if we do, it is not certain how long it will take to achieve these benefits. if, for example, we are unable to achieve the anticipated cost savings, or if there are unforeseen integration costs, or if ardent mills is unable to operate the joint venture smoothly in the future, the financial performance of the joint venture may be negatively affected.
if we are unable to complete proposed acquisitions or divestitures or integrate acquired businesses, our financial results could be materially and adversely affected.
from time to time, we evaluate acquisition candidates that may strategically fit our business objectives. if we are unable to complete acquisitions or to successfully integrate and develop acquired businesses, our financial results could be materially and adversely affected. in addition, we may divest businesses that do not meet our strategic objectives, or do not meet our growth or profitability targets. we may not be able to complete desired or proposed divestitures on terms favorable to us. gains or losses on the sales of, or lost operating income from, those businesses may affect our profitability. moreover, we may incur asset impairment charges related to acquisitions or divestitures that reduce our profitability.
our acquisition or divestiture activities may present financial, managerial, and operational risks. those risks include diversion of management attention from existing businesses, difficulties integrating or separating personnel and financial and other systems, effective and immediate implementation of control environment processes across our employee population, adverse effects on existing business relationships with suppliers and customers, inaccurate estimates of fair value made in the accounting for acquisitions and amortization of acquired intangible assets which would reduce future reported earnings, potential loss of customers or key employees of acquired businesses, and indemnities and potential disputes with the buyers or sellers. any of these factors could affect our product sales, financial condition, and results of operations.
12
item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis is intended to provide a summary of significant factors relevant to our financial performance and condition. the discussion should be read together with our consolidated financial statements and related notes in item 8, financial statements and supplementary data. results for the fiscal year ended may 25, 2014 are not necessarily indicative of results that may be attained in the future.
executive overview conagra foods, inc. (nyse: cag) is one of north america's largest packaged food companies with branded and private branded food found in 99% of america's households, as well as a strong commercial foods business serving restaurants and foodservice operations globally. consumers can find recognized brands such as banquet®, chef boyardee®, egg beaters®, healthy choice®, hebrew national®, hunt's®, marie callender's®, orville redenbacher's®, pam®, peter pan®, reddi-wip®, slim jim®, snack pack®, and many other conagra foods brands, along with food sold by conagra foods under private brand labels, in grocery, convenience, mass merchandise, club, and drug stores. additionally, conagra foods supplies frozen and sweet potato products as well as other vegetable, spice, bakery, and grain products to commercial and foodservice customers.
fiscal 2014 earnings reflected decreases in consumer foods volumes and challenges in private brands profitability. we anticipate fiscal 2015 to be a year of stabilization and recovery. we plan to benefit from stronger underlying operations, generate sizeable productivity and administrative savings, and continue to realize substantial synergies from the ralcorp transaction. administrative savings are also expected to play a growing role in earnings as we implement effectiveness and efficiency initiatives that began in fiscal 2014. we generated cash of approximately $1.55 billion from continuing operations and repaid $612 million of debt during fiscal 2014. we intend to continue to focus on repayment of debt in fiscal 2015.
on may 29, 2014, subsequent to the end of fiscal 2014, the company, cargill, incorporated ("cargill"), and chs inc. ("chs") (collectively, the "owners"), completed the formation of the previously announced ardent mills flour milling joint venture, which combined the north american flour milling operations and related businesses operated through the conagra mills division of conagra foods and the horizon milling joint venture of cargill and chs (see "formation of ardent mills" below).
fiscal 2014 diluted earnings per share from continuing operations were $0.70. fiscal 2013 diluted earnings per share from continuing operations were $1.85. several significant items affect the comparability of year-over-year results of continuing operations (see "items impacting comparability" below).

acquisitions in september 2013, we acquired frozen dessert production assets from harlan bakeries for $39.9 million in cash. the purchase included machinery, operating systems, warehousing/storage, and other assets associated with making frozen fruit pies, cream pies, pastry shells, and loaf cakes. this business is included in the consumer foods segment.
in january 2013, we acquired ralcorp for approximately $5.07 billion ($4.75 billion, net of cash acquired, plus assumed liabilities). ralcorp manufactured private brands of products including: ready-to-eat and hot cereals, nutritional and cereal bars,
18
snack mixes and other snack products, crackers and cookies, snack nuts, peanut butter, preserves and jellies, syrups, dressings, frozen griddle products including: pancakes, waffles, and french toast, frozen biscuits and other frozen pre-baked products such as breads and rolls, frozen and refrigerated dough products, and dry pasta and frozen pasta meals. the results of operations of the ralcorp business are included in each of our reporting segments, primarily private brands.
in august 2012, we acquired the p.f. chang's® and bertolli® brands frozen meal business from unilever for $266.9 million in cash. this business is included in the consumer foods segment.
discontinued operations in april 2014, we completed the sale of a small snack business, medallion foods, for $32.0 million in cash. the business results were previously reflected in the private brands segment. we reflected the results of these operations as discontinued operations for all periods presented. we recognized a pre-tax loss of $5.8 million ($3.5 million after-tax) on the sale of this business in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014. in the third quarter of fiscal 2014, we recognized an impairment charge related to allocated amounts of goodwill and intangible assets, totaling $25.4 million ($15.2 million after-tax), in anticipation of the divestiture of this business.
in september 2013, we completed the sale of the assets of the lightlife® business for $54.7 million in cash. the business results were previously reflected in the consumer foods segment. we reflected the results of these operations as discontinued operations for all periods presented. we recognized a pre-tax gain of $32.1 million ($19.8 million after-tax) on the sale of this business, which was classified as discontinued operations in fiscal 2014.
formation of ardent mills on may 25, 2014, we sold three flour milling facilities located in oakland, california, saginaw, texas, and new prague, minnesota, to miller milling company llc for a total cash consideration of $162.4 million. we recognized a pre-tax gain of $90.3 million ($55.7 million after-tax) during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014. the related assets have been reclassified as assets held for sale within our consolidated balance sheet for the period presented prior to divestiture. these mills were divested pursuant to an agreement with the u.s. department of justice related to the previously announced formation of the ardent mills flour milling joint venture. on may 29, 2014, subsequent to the end of fiscal 2014, the company, cargill, and chs completed the formation of ardent mills. in connection with the closing of the ardent mills joint venture, the company received total cash consideration of $565.3 million, before taxes (of which $162.4 million was recognized in fiscal 2014 from the sale of the three mills), and a 44% interest in the ardent mills joint venture. we expect to recognize a gain of approximately $625 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2015. the company has allocated the net cash proceeds primarily towards debt reduction.
restructuring plans we continue to execute a plan for the integration of ralcorp and related restructuring activities and during fiscal 2014, our board of directors approved an expansion of the scope of the plan to include steps to optimize the entire company's supply chain network and improve selling, general and administrative effectiveness and efficiencies, referred to as the supply chain and administrative efficiency plan (the "scae plan"). this plan was previously referred to as the ralcorp related restructuring plan. as a part of this scae plan, we expect to take actions to, among other things, continue the ongoing integration and restructuring of the operations of ralcorp, optimize manufacturing assets, optimize the company's dry distribution and mixing centers, and improve operational effectiveness and reduce overall costs in the company's administrative areas.
although we remain unable to make good faith estimates relating to the entire scae plan, we are reporting on actions initiated through the end of fiscal 2014, including the estimated amounts or range of amounts for each major type of costs expected to be incurred, and the charges that have or will result in cash outflows. we now expect to incur approximately $325.0 million of charges in connection with the scae plan, which includes $245.4 million of cash charges and $79.6 million of non-cash charges. in fiscal 2014 and 2013, we recognized charges of $83.7 million and $28.4 million, respectively, in relation to the scae plan.
during fiscal 2012, we started incurring costs in connection with actions taken to attain synergies when integrating businesses acquired prior to the third quarter of fiscal 2013. these costs, collectively referred to as "acquisition-related restructuring costs", include severance and other costs associated with consolidating facilities and administrative functions. we expect to incur $23.8 million of charges, $15.9 million of which are cash charges, in connection with the acquisition-related restructuring costs. we have recognized cumulative pre-tax expenses of $23.4 million ($15.5 million of which have resulted in cash outflows) related to the acquisition-related restructuring costs. in fiscal 2014, we recognized charges of $9.4 million, primarily representing costs related to asset impairments on equipment. in fiscal 2013, we recognized charges of $9.5 million. the acquisition-related restructuring costs are substantially complete.
19
in february 2011, our board of directors approved a plan designed to optimize our manufacturing and distribution networks, which we refer to as the network optimization plan. the network optimization plan consists of projects that involve, among other things, the exit of certain manufacturing facilities, the disposal of underutilized manufacturing assets, and actions designed to optimize our distribution network. in connection with the network optimization plan, we have incurred aggregate pre-tax costs of $76.7 million, including approximately $17.9 million of cash charges. in fiscal 2013, we recognized charges of $4.3 million in relation to the network optimization plan. at the end of fiscal 2013, the network optimization plan was substantially complete.
prior to our acquisition of ralcorp, the management of ralcorp had initiated certain activities designed to optimize ralcorp's manufacturing and distribution networks. we refer to these actions and the related costs as the "ralcorp pre-acquisition restructuring plans". these plans involved, among other things, the exit of certain manufacturing facilities. in connection with the ralcorp pre-acquisition restructuring plans, we have incurred $3.7 million of pre-tax charges ($1.9 million of which resulted in cash outflows). in fiscal 2014 and 2013, we recognized charges of $2.4 million and $1.3 million, respectively. at the end of fiscal 2014, the ralcorp pre-acquisition restructuring plans were substantially complete.
segment review as a result of the ralcorp acquisition, we implemented organizational changes during the second quarter of fiscal 2014 that resulted in new reporting segments. we began reporting our operations in three reporting segments: consumer foods, commercial foods, and private brands. we believe this recent operating structure will enhance our focus on profitability, coordinated business execution, and resource allocation across our business. prior periods have been reclassified to conform to the revised segment presentation. prior to this change in organizational structure, we had four operating and reportable segments.
consumer foods the consumer foods reporting segment includes branded food sold in various retail channels primarily in north america. our food products are found in a variety of categories (meals, entrees, condiments, sides, snacks, and desserts) throughout grocery and convenience stores across frozen, refrigerated, and shelf-stable temperature classes.
the consumer foods reporting segment no longer includes results for store brands (store brands are now part of the recently created private brands segment) or foodservice results (the foodservice business is now part of the commercial foods segment). the consumer foods reporting segment now includes additional international sales which were previously part of the ralcorp food group segment.
commercial foods the commercial foods reporting segment includes commercially branded and private branded food and ingredients, which are sold primarily to commercial, foodservice, food manufacturing, and industrial customers. the segment's primary food items include: frozen potato and sweet potato items and a variety of vegetable, spice and frozen bakery goods which are sold under brands such as lamb weston® and spicetec flavors & seasonings®.
the commercial foods reporting segment now includes foodservice results which were previously part of the consumer foods segment, as well as frozen bakery foodservice results, which were previously part of the ralcorp frozen bakery products segment. our milling business was included in the commercial foods segment for the periods covered by this report but was contributed to ardent mills shortly after the end of fiscal 2014.
private brands the private brands reporting segment includes private branded and customized food items sold in various retail channels, primarily in north america. our private brands are sold in a variety of categories in grocery and convenience stores including: hot and ready-to-eat cereal; snacks; condiments; bars and coordinated categories; pasta; and retail bakery goods.
the recently created private brands reporting segment includes a significant portion of results from the former ralcorp businesses and the store brands results which were previously part of the consumer foods segment.
presentation of derivative gains (losses) from economic hedges of forecasted cash flows in segment results derivatives used to manage commodity price risk and foreign currency risk are not designated for hedge accounting treatment. we believe these derivatives provide economic hedges of certain forecasted transactions. as such, these derivatives (except those related to our milling operations, see note 17 to the consolidated financial statements) are recognized at fair market value with realized and unrealized gains and losses recognized in general corporate expenses. the gains and losses are subsequently recognized
20
in the operating results of the reporting segments in the period in which the underlying transaction being economically hedged is included in earnings.
the following table presents the net derivative gains (losses) from economic hedges of forecasted commodity consumption and the foreign currency risk of certain forecasted transactions, under this methodology:

as of may 25, 2014, the cumulative amount of net derivative gains from economic hedges that had been recognized in general corporate expenses and not yet allocated to reporting segments was $26.9 million. this amount reflected net gains of $25.7 million incurred during the fiscal year ended may 25, 2014, as well as net gains of $1.2 million incurred prior to fiscal 2014. based on our forecasts of the timing of recognition of the underlying hedged items, we expect to reclassify to segment operating results gains of $26.5 million and $0.4 million to segment operating results in fiscal 2015 and 2016 and thereafter, respectively.

overall, our net sales increased $2.28 billion to $17.70 billion in fiscal 2014 compared to fiscal 2013, primarily related to the acquisition of ralcorp.
consumer foods net sales for fiscal 2014 were $7.32 billion, a decrease of $235.9 million, or 3%, compared to fiscal 2013. results reflected a 3% decrease in volume performance and a 1% decrease due to the impact of foreign exchange rates, partially offset by a 1% increase in price/mix. volume performance from our base businesses for fiscal 2014 was impacted negatively by competitor promotional activity. significant slotting and promotion investments related to new product launches, particularly in the first quarter, also weighed heavily on net sales in fiscal 2014. in addition, certain shipments planned for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014 were shifted to the first quarter of fiscal 2015 as a result of change in timing of retailer promotions and this negatively impacted volume performance.
sales of products associated with some of our most significant brands, including bertolli®, hunt's®, odom's®, libby's®, reddi-wip®, ro*tel®, slim jim®, and swiss miss® grew in fiscal 2014, as compared to fiscal 2013. significant brands whose products experienced sales declines in fiscal 2014 include act ii®, banquet®, chef boyardee®, healthy choice®, marie callender's®, orville redenbacher's®, snack pack®, and wesson®. a significant portion of the overall volume decline was driven by healthy choice, orville redenbacher's and chef boyardee (which collectively have annual sales in excess of $1 billion). the company has product and promotion changes, as well as refinements to consumer communication under way, which are expected to gradually improve the volume and profit performance of these brands throughout fiscal 2015.
commercial foods net sales were $6.19 billion in fiscal 2014, an increase of $124.2 million, or 2%, compared to fiscal 2013. results for fiscal 2014 reflected a 3% benefit from the acquisition of the frozen bakery business of ralcorp in january 2013. this increase was partially offset by the negative impact of the pass-through of $94.2 million of lower wheat prices in the milling
21
business. results for fiscal 2014 also reflected increased volume of 2% in the segment's lamb weston specialty potato products business, driven by increased sales to international customers, partially offset by lower price/mix. sales in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014 to international customers were favorably impacted by increased promotional activity and accelerated orders due to concerns about the effect of a potential external labor dispute on west coast exports. sales volume in the foodservice business decreased in fiscal 2014 compared to fiscal 2013 due to industry trends.
private brands net sales for fiscal 2014 were $4.20 billion. the increase of $2.39 billion represents a full year of ownership of the legacy ralcorp business in fiscal 2014 compared to four months in fiscal 2013. while sales and profits for private brands continued to be softer than expected through fiscal 2014, the company is currently focused on, and has recently organized to improve, sales force coverage, pricing strategies, customer service levels, and plant efficiencies. we have made pricing concessions to protect volumes as we address these challenges. the company expects improved net sales and operating profit from private brands over time.
selling, general and administrative ("sg&a") expenses (includes general corporate expenses)
sg&a expenses totaled $2.77 billion for fiscal 2014, an increase of $630.5 million compared to fiscal 2013. the increase in overall sg&a occurred as a result of the additional eight months of sg&a expenses for the ralcorp business as well as the following changes from our base business:
•   a gain of $90.3 million from the divestiture of three flour milling facilities in connection with the formation of the ardent mills joint venture, which was completed subsequent to the end of fiscal 2014,
•   a decrease in incentive compensation expense of $77.7 million,
•   charges of $75.7 million related to intangible asset impairments, primarily the chef boyardee brand,
•   a decrease in advertising and promotion expenses of $48.9 million,
•   an increase in salaries and wages of $63.7 million,
•   a charge of $16.5 million in connection with the impairment of a small production facility,
•   a benefit of $10.2 million related legal matters associated with the 2007 peanut butter recall, including a reduction of the legal accrual for pending matters and the reimbursement of settlement and defense costs from an insurer,
•   a charge of $8.9 million in connection with the impairment of certain assets received in connection with the bankruptcy of an onion products supplier, and
•   a benefit of $5.1 million in connection with the sale of land received in connection with the bankruptcy of an onion products supplier.
sg&a expenses for fiscal 2014 (including legacy ralcorp) also included:
•   charges of $605.4 million for the impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets within our private brands segment,
•   expenses of $94.1 million in connection with our restructuring plans,
•   $53.0 million in support of our integration of the former ralcorp business, and
•   transaction-related costs of $20.1 million, principally in connection with the formation of the ardent mills joint venture.
sg&a expenses from our base business in fiscal 2013 included:
•   a benefit of $25.0 million related to the favorable settlement of an insurance matter associated with the 2007 peanut butter recall,
•   a charge of $10.2 million in connection with the impairment of certain assets received in connection with the bankruptcy of an onion products supplier,
•   a charge of $7.5 million in connection with legal matters associated with the 2007 peanut butter recall,
22
•   charges of $6.2 million related to early extinguishment of debt as a result of early payments on our term loan facility,
•   a charge of $5.7 million reflecting the year-end write-off of actuarial losses in excess of 10% of our pension liability,
•   charges of $4.5 million related to environmental remediation matters related to beatrice company, and
•   charges of $3.0 million in connection with the garner accident.
sg&a expenses for fiscal 2013 (including legacy ralcorp) also included:
•   transaction-related costs of $108.2 million, principally relating to the acquisition of ralcorp,
•   expenses of $31.9 million in connection with our restructuring plans, and
•   expenses of $21.6 million in support of our integration of the former ralcorp business.

operating profit for the commercial foods segment was $774.6 million in fiscal 2014, an increase of $43.3 million, or 6%, compared to fiscal 2013. gross profits in the commercial foods segment were $38.2 million lower in fiscal 2014 than in fiscal 2013. decreases in operating profit for fiscal 2014 were driven by lower gross profit in the lamb weston specialty potato operations related to the change in mix of sales to international and retail customers due to the impact of a major foodservice customer not renewing a sizable amount of potato business at the end of fiscal 2013, moderate inflation in key inputs, and poor quality raw potatoes affecting plant recovery and throughputs. the significant decreases in lamb weston results were offset by significant reductions in incentive compensation expenses in fiscal 2014 and a gain of $90.7 million gain from the divestiture of three flour milling facilities, in connection with the formation of the ardent mills joint venture, which was completed subsequent the end of fiscal 2014. commercial foods operating profit for fiscal 2014 also included a charge of $16.5 million in connection with the impairment of a small production facility, as well as a charge of $8.9 million for the impairment of certain nonoperating assets and a $5.1 million gain from the sale of land, both related to assets received in connection with the bankruptcy of an onion products supplier. in addition, there were $4.8 million of charges in connection with our restructuring plans. results for fiscal 2013 reflected a $10.2 million charge to reduce the carrying value of collateral received in connection with the bankruptcy of the onion products supplier to its estimated fair value based upon updated appraisals. commercial foods operating profit also included $6.1 million of charges in fiscal 2013 related to the execution of our restructuring plans. included in the results of the commercial foods operating profit in fiscal 2013 was $3.1 million of incremental cost of goods sold due to the fair value adjustment to inventory resulting from acquisition accounting.
private brands operating loss for fiscal 2014 was $375.0 million compared to an operating profit for fiscal 2013 of $123.1 million. the majority of our private brands segment is comprised of the former ralcorp business. the increase in net sales, discussed above, reflects the impact of the ralcorp acquisition. operating profits have been below expectations due to sales force, supply chain, and pricing actions, as well as cost challenges associated with integration and business transition. we expect these margin pressures to continue for the next few quarters as a result of the deliberate pricing concessions made in previous quarters
23
to improve customer relationships and remain competitive in the marketplace during fiscal 2014. in fiscal 2014, we recognized charges of $605.4 million in connection with the impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets within the private brands segment. also included in the operating loss for fiscal 2014 were $35.9 million of charges in connection with our restructuring plans. included in the results of the private brands operating profit in fiscal 2013 was $13.6 million of incremental cost of goods sold due to the fair value adjustment to inventory resulting from acquisition accounting. based on the challenges in the private brands segment in fiscal 2014 and the gradual nature of the anticipated recovery from fiscal 2014 earnings levels, the company's current profit projections for the private brands segment are below original plans for the next several years, despite continued expectations for achievement of strong cost-related synergies.
interest expense, net in fiscal 2014, net interest expense was $379.0 million, an increase of $103.4 million, or 38%, from fiscal 2013. the increase reflects the issuance of $3.975 billion of senior debt, outstanding borrowings of $900 million under a term loan facility, and $716.0 million of senior debt that was exchanged in january 2013 in financing the ralcorp acquisition, in addition to the issuance of $750.0 million of senior notes in september 2012. interest expense in fiscal 2014 and 2013 reflected a net benefit of $12.1 million and $8.6 million, respectively, primarily resulting from interest rate swaps used to effectively convert the interest rates of certain outstanding debt instruments from fixed to variable.
income taxes our income tax expense was $298.2 million and $400.7 million in fiscal 2014 and 2013, respectively. the effective tax rate (calculated as the ratio of income tax expense to pre-tax income from continuing operations, inclusive of equity method investment earnings) was 49% for fiscal 2014 and 34% in fiscal 2013. the effective tax rate for fiscal 2014 reflects the incurrence of an impairment of intangible assets, $529.2 million of which was non-deductible goodwill, as well as the benefit of normal, recurring, income tax credits and deductions, some of which expired on december 31, 2013. the fiscal 2014 effective tax rate also included a change in estimate related to tax methods used for certain international sales, favorable tax adjustments resulting from changes in legal structure and state tax filing positions, resolution of foreign tax matters that were previously reserved, the effect of a law change in mexico requiring deconsolidation for tax reporting purposes, and the resolution of certain income tax matters related to dispositions of foreign operations in prior years. the effective tax rate for fiscal 2013 reflects the incurrence of various non-deductible transaction-related expenses, as well as a reduced domestic manufacturing deduction benefit, in connection with the acquisition of ralcorp. the fiscal 2013 effective tax rate also included favorable tax adjustments resulting from the implementation of the 2012 american taxpayer relief act during fiscal 2013.
we expect our effective tax rate in fiscal 2015, exclusive of any unusual transactions or tax events, to be approximately 34%.
equity method investment earnings we include our share of the earnings of certain affiliates based on our economic ownership interest in the affiliates. significant affiliates produce and market potato products for retail and foodservice customers. our share of earnings from our equity method investments was $32.8 million ($30.0 million in the commercial foods segment and $2.8 million in the consumer foods segment) and $37.5 million ($35.7 million in the commercial foods segment and $1.8 million in the consumer foods segment) in fiscal 2014 and 2013, respectively. in fiscal 2014, earnings also reflected a $3.4 million charge reflecting the year-end write-off of actuarial losses in excess of 10% of the pension liability.
results of discontinued operations our discontinued operations generated an after-tax gain of $4.1 million in fiscal 2014 and an after-tax loss of $0.7 million in fiscal 2013. in fiscal 2014, we completed the sale of a small snack business, medallion foods, for $32.0 million in cash. we recognized an after-tax loss of $3.5 million on the sale of this business in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014. in the third quarter of fiscal 2014, we recognized an impairment charge related to allocated amounts of goodwill and intangible assets, totaling $15.2 million after-tax, in anticipation of this divestiture.
we also completed the sale of the assets of the lightlife® business for $54.7 million in cash. we recognized an after-tax gain of $19.8 million on the sale of this business in fiscal 2014.
24
earnings per share our fiscal 2014 diluted earnings per share from continuing operations were $0.70. our fiscal 2013 diluted earnings per share from continuing operations were $1.85. see "items impacting comparability" above as several significant items affected the comparability of year-over-year results of operations.

overall, our net sales increased $2.1 billion to $15.43 billion in fiscal 2013, reflecting a 9% increase in our consumer foods segment and a 6% increase in our commercial foods segment relative to results in fiscal 2012, as well as increased sales due to the acquisition of ralcorp during the third quarter of fiscal 2013.
consumer foods net sales for fiscal 2013 were $7.55 billion, an increase of $605.6 million, or 9% compared to fiscal 2012. results reflected an 8% benefit from acquisitions and a 3% increase from net pricing/mix, offset by a 2% decrease in volume performance from our base businesses (those businesses owned for all of fiscal 2013 and 2012). increase in pricing/mix was due to pricing initiatives taken toward the end of fiscal 2012. the decrease in volume performance from our base businesses is primarily attributable to volume elasticity or the dampening effect of price increases on sales volume in the marketplace for fiscal 2013.
sales of products associated with some of our most significant brands, including act ii®, hebrew national®, hunt's®, marie callender's®, orville redenbacher's®, pam®, peter pan®, reddi-wip®, ro*tel®, slim jim®, swiss miss®, and wesson® grew in fiscal 2013, as compared to fiscal 2012. significant brands whose products experienced sales declines in fiscal 2013 include banquet®, blue bonnet®, chef boyardee®, david®, egg beaters®, healthy choice®, kid cuisine®, manwich®, and snack pack®.
commercial foods net sales were $6.07 billion in fiscal 2013, an increase of $320.0 million, or 6%, compared to fiscal 2012. net sales in our flour milling business were $47.1 million higher in fiscal 2013 than fiscal 2012, principally reflecting the pass-through of $19.5 million of higher wheat prices in the milling business. results for fiscal 2013 also reflected improved net pricing/mix of 5% in the segment's lamb weston specialty potato products business, while sales volumes were flat. sales in commercial foods due to the acquisition of the ralcorp frozen bakery business increased $97.4 million in fiscal 2013 compared to fiscal 2012.
private brands net sales for fiscal 2013 and fiscal 2012 were $1.81 billion and $638.3 million, respectively. the increase represented the ownership of ralcorp for four months in fiscal 2013.
selling, general and administrative ("sg&a") expenses (includes general corporate expenses)
sg&a expenses totaled $2.14 billion for fiscal 2013, an increase of $156.3 million compared to fiscal 2012.

consumer foods operating profit for fiscal 2013 was $1.00 billion, an increase of $122.0 million, or 14%, compared to fiscal 2012. gross profits in consumer foods were $253.6 million higher in fiscal 2013 than in fiscal 2012, driven by the impact of higher net sales, discussed above, and the benefit of supply chain cost savings initiatives, partially offset by moderate inflation in product costs (particularly for proteins, packaging, peanuts, sweeteners, and beans). businesses acquired in fiscal 2013 contributed $26.8 million of operating profit to fiscal 2013. other items that significantly impacted consumer foods operating profit in fiscal 2013 included:
•   an increase in advertising and promotion expense of $90.7 million,
•   an increase in incentive compensation expense of $31.7 million,
•   charges totaling $12.1 million in connection with our restructuring plans,
•   charges of $10.9 million of acquisition-related costs, and
•   an increase in salaries and wages of $11.7 million.
26
items that significantly impacted consumer foods operating profit in fiscal 2012 included:
•   a gain of $58.6 million, resulting from the remeasurement to fair value of our previously held noncontrolling equity interest in atfl, in connection with our acquisition of a majority interest in that company, and
•   charges totaling $55.9 million in connection with our restructuring plans.
operating profit for the commercial foods segment was $731.3 million in fiscal 2013, an increase of $115.6 million, or 19%, compared to fiscal 2012. gross profits in the commercial foods segment were $157.3 million higher in fiscal 2013 than in fiscal 2012, driven by higher gross profit in the lamb weston specialty potato operations due to increased net pricing/mix, as well as productivity improvements, partially offset by higher input costs. results for fiscal 2013 also reflected a $10.2 million charge to reduce the carrying value of collateral received in connection with the bankruptcy of an onion products supplier to its estimated fair value based upon updated appraisals. included in the results of the foodservice operating profit in fiscal 2013 was $3.1 million of incremental cost of goods sold due to the fair value adjustment to inventory resulting from acquisition accounting. commercial foods operating profit included $6.1 million of charges in fiscal 2012 related to the execution of our restructuring plans. in the third quarter of fiscal 2013, a significant foodservice customer did not renew a significant portion of its potato products purchase contracts with our lamb weston business, which we expected to have an unfavorable impact in fiscal 2014. operating profit in the foodservice business increased due to the acquisition of the ralcorp frozen bakery business, which contributed $7.0 million in fiscal 2013.
private brands segment operating profit for fiscal 2013 was $123.1 million, an increase of $27.9 million compared to fiscal 2012. included in the results of the private brands segment operating profit in fiscal 2013 was $13.6 million of incremental cost of goods sold due to the fair value adjustment to inventory resulting from acquisition accounting.
interest expense, net in fiscal 2013, net interest expense was $275.6 million, an increase of $71.6 million, or 35%, from fiscal 2012. the increase reflects the issuance of $3.975 billion of senior debt, borrowings of $1.5 billion under a term loan facility, and $716.0 million of senior debt that was exchanged in january 2013 in financing the ralcorp acquisition, in addition to the issuance of $750.0 million of senior notes in september 2012. interest expense in fiscal 2013 and 2012 reflected a net benefit of $8.6 million and $8.9 million, respectively, primarily resulting from interest rate swaps used to effectively convert the interest rates of certain outstanding debt instruments from fixed to variable (these hedges were terminated in fiscal 2011).
income taxes our income tax expense was $400.7 million and $191.7 million in fiscal 2013 and 2012, respectively. the effective tax rate (calculated as the ratio of income tax expense to pre-tax income from continuing operations, inclusive of equity method investment earnings) was 34% for fiscal 2013 and 29% in fiscal 2012. the effective tax rate for fiscal 2013 reflects the incurrence of various non-deductible transaction-related expenses, as well as a reduced domestic manufacturing deduction benefit, in connection with the acquisition of ralcorp. the effective tax rate for fiscal 2012 is reflective of the benefit of normal, recurring, income tax credits and deductions combined with a lower pre-tax level of earnings (due in large part to the impact of the write-off of $396.9 million of actuarial losses under the method of accounting for pension benefits adopted in fiscal 2012), as well as a $58.6 million nontaxable gain on the remeasurement to fair value of our previously held noncontrolling equity interest in atfl, in connection with our acquisition of a majority interest in that company. the fiscal 2013 effective tax rate also included favorable tax adjustments resulting from the implementation of the 2012 american taxpayer relief act during fiscal 2013, while the fiscal 2012 effective tax rate was unfavorably impacted by the prior expiration of these tax benefits during fiscal 2012. in the third quarter of fiscal 2013, we received an adverse mexican tax court ruling and recorded a reserve of $4.0 million.
equity method investment earnings we include our share of the earnings of certain affiliates based on our economic ownership interest in the affiliates. significant affiliates produce and market potato products for retail and foodservice customers. our share of earnings from our equity method investments was $37.5 million ($1.8 million in the consumer foods segment and $35.7 million in the commercial foods segment) and $44.9 million ($4.9 million in the consumer foods segment and $40.0 million in the commercial foods segment) in fiscal 2013 and 2012, respectively. the decrease in equity method investment earnings in the commercial foods segment were a result of higher input costs for a foreign potato processing venture, in addition to a charge of $2.1 million reflecting the year-end write-off of actuarial losses in excess of 10% of the pension liability.
27
results of discontinued operations our discontinued operations generated an after-tax loss of $0.7 million in fiscal 2013 and an after-tax gain of $6.5 million in fiscal 2012.
earnings per share fiscal 2013 diluted earnings per share from continuing operations were $1.85. fiscal 2012 diluted earnings per share were $1.12, including $1.10 per diluted share from continuing operations and income of $0.02 per diluted share from discontinued operations. see "items impacting comparability" above as several significant items affected the comparability of year-over-year results of operations.
liquidity and capital resources sources of liquidity and capital our primary financing objective is to maintain a prudent capital structure that provides us flexibility to pursue our growth objectives. if necessary, we use short-term debt principally to finance ongoing operations, including our seasonal requirements for working capital (accounts receivable, prepaid expenses and other current assets, and inventories, less accounts payable, accrued payroll, and other accrued liabilities) and a combination of equity and long-term debt to finance both our base working capital needs and our non-current assets. we increased our indebtedness significantly during fiscal 2013 as a result of the ralcorp acquisition. we have been focused on repaying a significant portion of our indebtedness subsequent to the ralcorp acquisition. we are committed to maintaining an investment grade rating.
at may 25, 2014, we had a $1.5 billion revolving credit facility. the facility is scheduled to mature in september 2018. the facility has historically been used principally as a back-up facility for our commercial paper program. as of may 25, 2014, there were no outstanding borrowings under the facility. the facility requires that our consolidated funded debt not exceed 70% of our consolidated capital base in the four quarters commencing on january 29, 2014, and 65% thereafter, and that our fixed charges coverage ratio be greater than 1.75 to 1.0. as of may 25, 2014, we were in compliance with these financial covenants.
as of may 25, 2014, we had $137.0 million outstanding under our commercial paper program. the highest level of borrowings during fiscal 2014 was $395.0 million.
in fiscal 2013, we borrowed $1.5 billion under our term loan facility. we are required to repay borrowings under the term loan facility in equal installments of 2.5% per quarter beginning june 1, 2013 with the remainder of the borrowings to be paid on the maturity date unless prepaid in accordance with the terms of the term loan facility. we may prepay borrowings without premium or penalty. as of may 25, 2014, we had $900.0 million outstanding under the term loan facility. the term loan facility matures on january 29, 2018. the term loan facility interest rate is calculated based on libor plus 1.75%. net proceeds were used for the acquisition of ralcorp. the term loan facility requires that our consolidated funded debt not exceed 70% of our consolidated capital base in the four quarters commencing on january 29, 2014, and 65% thereafter, and that our fixed charges coverage ratio be greater than 1.75 to 1.0. as of may 25, 2014, we were in compliance with these financial covenants.
as of the end of fiscal 2014, our senior long-term debt ratings were all investment grade. a significant downgrade in our credit ratings would not affect our ability to borrow amounts under the revolving credit facility, although borrowing costs would increase. a downgrade of our short-term credit ratings would impact our ability to borrow under our commercial paper program by negatively impacting borrowing costs and causing shorter durations, as well as making access to commercial paper more difficult.
we repurchase our shares of common stock from time to time after considering market conditions and in accordance with repurchase limits authorized by our board of directors. in december 2011, the company's board of directors approved a $750.0 million increase to our share repurchase authorization. under the share repurchase authorization, we may repurchase our shares periodically over several years, depending on market conditions and other factors, and may do so in open market purchases or privately negotiated transactions. the authorization has no time limit and may be suspended or discontinued at any time. we repurchased 2.9 million shares of our common stock for an aggregate of $100.0 million under this program in fiscal 2014. the company's total remaining share repurchase authorization as of may 25, 2014 was $181.9 million.
in the second quarter of fiscal 2014, we completed the sale of the assets of the lightlife business for $54.7 million in cash.
in the second quarter of fiscal 2014, we acquired the frozen dessert production assets from harlan bakeries for $39.9 million in cash.
in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014, we completed the sale of medallion foods for $32.0 million in cash.
28
subsequent to the end of fiscal 2014, we received $565.3 million in cash upon the closing of the ardent mills joint venture, which included $162.4 million associated with the sale of three flour milling facilities at the end of fiscal 2014.
subsequent to our fiscal year end, in june 2014, we repaid $350.0 million of the principal amount outstanding under the term loan facility with a portion of the proceeds received in connection with the formation of ardent mills. we paid the remaining outstanding principal balance of $550.0 million under the term loan facility in july 2014, and terminated the facility, with a portion of the proceeds from the formation of ardent mills and approximately $330 million of borrowings under our commercial paper program.
cash flows in fiscal 2014, we used $0.8 million of cash, which was the net result of $1.55 billion generated from operating activities, $514.1 million used in investing activities, $1.03 billion used in financing activities, and a decrease of $3.8 million in cash due to the effect of changes in foreign currency exchange rates.
cash generated from operating activities of continuing operations totaled $1.55 billion in fiscal 2014, as compared to $1.41 billion generated in fiscal 2013. the increase in operating cash is largely due to the full year of results of the former ralcorp business in fiscal 2014 as compared to four months of results in fiscal 2013. operating cash outflows for interest payments increased $179.8 million to $395.7 million in fiscal 2014 as a result of the increase in debt from the ralcorp acquisition.we contributed $18.3 million and $19.8 million to our pension plans in fiscal 2014 and 2013, respectively. in fiscal 2013, decreases in consumer foods inventories (excluding impacts of acquisitions) due to more stable commodity prices and utilization of prior physical positions were offset by increases in our commercial foods segment resulting from higher wheat prices and increased potato harvest yields. also in fiscal 2013, tax related cash flow benefits of $180.1 million realized from lower current income tax payments as a result of paying off ralcorp debt were largely offset by outflows of $130.1 million resulting from costs associated with the ralcorp acquisition and $42.5 million in interest accrued by ralcorp prior to the acquisition which was subsequently paid. in fiscal 2014, cash outflows included amounts associated with ralcorp integration costs of $47.2 million and previously accrued acquisition related costs, primarily severance and retention costs of $24.4 million. we paid larger incentive compensation payments in the first quarter of fiscal 2014 (earned in fiscal 2013) than in the first quarter of fiscal 2013 (earned in fiscal 2012).
cash used in investing activities totaled $514.1 million in fiscal 2014 versus $5.47 billion in fiscal 2013. investing activities of continuing operations in fiscal 2014 consisted primarily of capital expenditures of $602.4 million, which increased from fiscal 2013 due to the increases associated with the former ralcorp businesses, as well as several significant planned plant expansions and improvements. additionally, we purchased certain frozen dessert production assets for $39.9 million in fiscal 2014. investing activities in fiscal 2013 consisted primarily of the purchase of ralcorp for $4.75 billion, net of cash acquired, capital expenditures of $453.7 million, and the acquisition of the p.f. chang's® and bertolli® brands frozen meal business from unilever for $266.9 million in cash. investing activities of discontinued operations generated $86.7 million in fiscal 2014 primarily from the sale of assets of the lightlife and medallion foods businesses.
cash used for financing activities of continuing operations totaled $1.03 billion in fiscal 2014 compared with cash generated from financing activities of $4.13 billion in fiscal 2013. in fiscal 2014, we decreased our total debt by $612.4 million, including the repayment of $500.0 million aggregate principal amount of our 5.875% senior notes upon maturity in april 2014. in fiscal 2013, we issued long-term debt that generated $6.22 billion in cash and repaid $2.07 billion in debt, primarily $1.44 billion paid for principal and contractual amounts on ralcorp notes tendered in connection with the ralcorp acquisition and prepayment of $600.0 million of the term loan facility. in conjunction with the ralcorp acquisition, we issued common stock for $269.2 million in net cash proceeds in fiscal 2013. during fiscal 2014 and 2013, we paid dividends of $420.9 million and $400.7 million, respectively. in fiscal 2014 and 2013, we repurchased $100.0 million and $245.0 million, respectively, of our common stock as part of our share repurchase program. amounts generated from employee stock option exercise proceeds and issuance of other stock awards were $103.7 million and $274.4 million in fiscal 2014 and 2013, respectively.
the company had cash and cash equivalents of $183.1 million at may 25, 2014 and $183.9 million at may 26, 2013, of which $146.3 million at may 25, 2014 and $166.4 million at may 26, 2013 was held in foreign countries. the company makes an assertion regarding the amount of foreign earnings intended for permanent reinvestment outside the united states, with the balance available to be repatriated to the united states. the cash held by foreign subsidiaries for permanent reinvestment is generally used to finance the subsidiaries' operational activities and future foreign investments. no related tax liability has been accrued as of may 25, 2014. in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014, the company's foreign subsidiaries repaid $92.9 million of intercompany notes to domestic subsidiaries. these loan repayments did not result in significant additional income taxes. in addition, in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014, certain of the company's foreign subsidiaries extended short term loans to domestic entities totaling $37.8 million. such loans were repaid in the first quarter of fiscal 2015. at may 25, 2014, management does not intend to permanently repatriate
29
additional foreign cash. any future decision to repatriate foreign cash could result in an adjustment to the deferred tax liability after considering available foreign tax credits and other tax attributes. it is not practicable to determine the amount of any such deferred tax liability at this time.
we estimate our capital expenditures in fiscal 2015 to be approximately $600 million.
management believes that existing cash balances, cash flows from operations, existing credit facilities, and access to capital markets will provide sufficient liquidity to meet our working capital needs, planned capital expenditures, and payment of anticipated quarterly dividends for at least the next twelve months.
off-balance sheet arrangements we use off-balance sheet arrangements (e.g., leases accounted for as operating leases) where sound business principles warrant their use. we also periodically enter into guarantees and other similar arrangements as part of transactions in the ordinary course of business. these are described further in "obligations and commitments," below.
variable interest entities not consolidated we have variable interests in certain entities that we have determined to be variable interest entities, but for which we are not the primary beneficiary. we do not consolidate the financial statements of these entities.
we hold a 50.0% interest in lamb weston rdo, a potato processing venture. we provide all sales and marketing services to lamb weston rdo. we receive a fee for these services based on a percentage of the net sales of the venture. we reflect the value of our ownership interest in this venture in other assets in our consolidated balance sheets, based upon the equity method of accounting. the balance of our investment was $12.6 million and $15.2 million at may 25, 2014 and may 26, 2013, respectively, representing our maximum exposure to loss as a result of our involvement with this venture. the capital structure of lamb weston rdo includes owners' equity of $25.4 million and term borrowings from banks of $42.8 million as of may 25, 2014. we have determined that we do not have the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the economic performance of this venture.
we lease certain office buildings from entities that we have determined to be variable interest entities. the lease agreements with these entities include fixed-price purchase options for the assets being leased, representing our only variable interest in these lessor entities. these leases are accounted for as operating leases, and accordingly, there are no material assets or liabilities associated with these entities included in our consolidated balance sheets. we have no material exposure to loss from our variable interests in these entities. we have determined that we do not have the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the economic performance of these entities. in making this determination, we have considered, among other items, the terms of the lease agreements, the expected remaining useful lives of the assets leased, and the capital structure of the lessor entities.
obligations and commitments as part of our ongoing operations, we enter into arrangements that obligate us to make future payments under contracts such as lease agreements, debt agreements, and unconditional purchase obligations (i.e., obligations to transfer funds in the future for fixed or minimum quantities of goods or services at fixed or minimum prices, such as "take-or-pay" contracts). the unconditional purchase obligation arrangements are entered into in our normal course of business in order to ensure adequate levels of sourced product are available. of these items, debt and capital lease obligations, which totaled $8.9 billion as of may 25, 2014, were recognized as liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets. operating lease obligations and unconditional purchase obligations, which totaled $2.9 billion as of may 25, 2014, were not recognized as liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets, in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.

1 amount includes open purchase orders and agreements, some of which are not legally binding and/or may be cancellable. such agreements are generally settleable in the ordinary course of business in less than one year.
we are also contractually obligated to pay interest on our long-term debt and capital lease obligations. the weighted average coupon interest rate of the long-term debt obligations outstanding as of may 25, 2014 was approximately 4.2%.
the operating lease obligations noted in the table above have not been reduced by non-cancellable sublease rentals of $32.3 million.
we own a 49.99% interest in lamb weston bsw, llc ("lamb weston bsw"), a potato processing venture with ochoa ag unlimited foods, inc. ("ochoa"). we provide all sales and marketing services to lamb weston bsw. under certain circumstances, we could be required to compensate ochoa for lost profits resulting from significant production shortfalls ("production shortfalls"). commencing on june 1, 2018, or on an earlier date under certain circumstances, we have a contractual right to purchase the remaining equity interest in lamb weston bsw from ochoa (the "call option"). we are currently subject to a contractual obligation to purchase all of ochoa's equity investment in lamb weston bsw at the option of ochoa (the "put option"). the purchase prices under the call option and the put option (the "options") are based on the book value of ochoa's equity interest at the date of exercise, as modified by an agreed-upon rate of return for the holding period of the investment balance. the agreed-upon rate of return varies depending on the circumstances under which any of the options are exercised. as of may 25, 2014, the price at which ochoa had the right to put its equity interest to us was $41.9 million. this amount, which is presented within other noncurrent liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets, is not included in the "contractual obligations" table above as the payment is contingent upon the exercise of the put option by ochoa, and the eventual occurrence and timing of such exercise is uncertain.
as part of our ongoing operations, we also enter into arrangements that obligate us to make future cash payments only upon the occurrence of a future event (e.g., guarantees of debt or lease payments of a third party should the third party be unable to perform). in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, the following commercial commitments are not recognized as liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets. a summary of our commitments, including commitments associated with equity method investments, as of may 25, 2014 was as follows:

in certain limited situations, we will guarantee an obligation of an unconsolidated entity. we guarantee certain leases and other commercial obligations resulting from the 2002 divestiture of our fresh beef and pork operations. the remaining terms of these arrangements do not exceed two years and the maximum amount of future payments we have guaranteed was $5.4 million as of may 25, 2014.
we are a party to various potato supply agreements. under the terms of certain such potato supply agreements, we have guaranteed repayment of short-term bank loans of the potato suppliers, under certain conditions. at may 25, 2014, the amount of
31
supplier loans effectively guaranteed by us was $34.4 million, included in the table above. we have not established a liability for these guarantees, as we have determined that the likelihood of our required performance under the guarantees is remote.
we were a party to a supply agreement with an onion processing company where we had guaranteed, under certain conditions, repayment of a secured loan (the "secured loan") of this onion products supplier to the onion products supplier's lender. the amount of our guarantee was $25.0 million. during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012, we received notice from the lender that the onion products supplier had defaulted on the secured loan and we exercised our option to purchase the secured loan from the lender for $40.8 million, thereby assuming first-priority secured rights to the underlying collateral for the amount of the secured loan, and cancelling our guarantee. the onion products supplier filed for bankruptcy during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012. during the second quarter of fiscal 2013, we acquired ownership and all rights to the collateral, consisting of agricultural land and a processing facility. during the third quarter of fiscal 2013, we recognized an impairment charge of $10.2 million in our commercial foods segment to reduce the carrying amount of the collateral to its estimated fair value based upon updated appraisals. during the second quarter of fiscal 2014, we recognized an additional impairment charge of $8.9 million in our commercial foods segment to reduce the carrying amount of the plant assets to their estimated fair value based upon expected sales proceeds. in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014, we sold the agricultural land and recognized a gain of $5.1 million in our commercial foods segment. based on our estimate of the value of the processing facility, we expect to recover the remaining carrying value through our sale of this asset.
federal income tax credits were generated related to our sweet potato production facility in delhi, louisiana. third parties invested in certain of these income tax credits. we have guaranteed these third parties the face value of these income tax credits over their statutory lives, through fiscal 2017, in the event that the income tax credits are recaptured or reduced. the face value of the income tax credits was $26.7 million as of may 25, 2014. we believe the likelihood of the recapture or reduction of the income tax credits is remote, and therefore we have not established a liability in connection with this guarantee.
the obligations and commitments tables above do not include any reserves for uncertainties in income taxes, as we are unable to reasonably estimate the ultimate amount or timing of settlement of our reserves for income taxes. the liability for gross unrecognized tax benefits at may 25, 2014 was $84.9 million. the net amount of unrecognized tax benefits at may 25, 2014, that, if recognized, would impact our effective tax rate was $50.8 million. recognition of these tax benefits would have a favorable impact on our effective tax rate.
critical accounting estimates the process of preparing financial statements requires the use of estimates on the part of management. the estimates used by management are based on our historical experiences combined with management's understanding of current facts and circumstances. certain of our accounting estimates are considered critical as they are both important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results and require significant or complex judgment on the part of management. the following is a summary of certain accounting estimates considered critical by management.
our audit/finance committee has reviewed management's development, selection, and disclosure of the critical accounting estimates.
marketing costs-we incur certain costs to promote our products through marketing programs, which include advertising, customer incentives, and consumer incentives. we recognize the cost of each of these types of marketing activities as incurred in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. the judgment required in determining marketing costs can be significant. for volume-based incentives provided to customers, management must continually assess the likelihood of the customer achieving the specified targets. similarly, for consumer coupons, management must estimate the level at which coupons will be redeemed by consumers in the future. estimates made by management in accounting for marketing costs are based primarily on our historical experience with marketing programs with consideration given to current circumstances and industry trends. as these factors change, management's estimates could change and we could recognize different amounts of marketing costs over different periods of time.
we have recognized reserves of approximately $169.4 million for these marketing costs as of may 25, 2014. changes in the assumptions used in estimating the cost of any individual customer marketing program would not result in a material change in our results of operations or cash flows.
advertising and promotion expenses totaled $417.4 million, $466.3 million, and $362.3 million in fiscal 2014, 2013, and 2012, respectively.
income taxes-our income tax expense is based on our income, statutory tax rates, and tax planning opportunities available in the various jurisdictions in which we operate. tax laws are complex and subject to different interpretations by the taxpayer and respective governmental taxing authorities. significant judgment is required in determining our income tax expense and in
32
evaluating our tax positions, including evaluating uncertainties. management reviews tax positions at least quarterly and adjusts the balances as new information becomes available. deferred income tax assets represent amounts available to reduce income taxes payable on taxable income in future years. such assets arise because of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities, as well as from net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. management evaluates the recoverability of these future tax deductions by assessing the adequacy of future expected taxable income from all sources, including reversal of taxable temporary differences, forecasted operating earnings, and available tax planning strategies. these estimates of future taxable income inherently require significant judgment. management uses historical experience and short and long-range business forecasts to develop such estimates. further, we employ various prudent and feasible tax planning strategies to facilitate the recoverability of future deductions. to the extent management does not consider it more likely than not that a deferred tax asset will be recovered, a valuation allowance is established.
further information on income taxes is provided in note 14 "pre-tax income and income taxes" to the consolidated financial statements.
environmental liabilities-environmental liabilities are accrued when it is probable that obligations have been incurred and the associated amounts can be reasonably estimated. management works with independent third-party specialists in order to effectively assess our environmental liabilities. management estimates our environmental liabilities based on evaluation of investigatory studies, extent of required clean-up, our known volumetric contribution, other potentially responsible parties, and our experience in remediating sites. environmental liability estimates may be affected by changing governmental or other external determinations of what constitutes an environmental liability or an acceptable level of clean-up. management's estimate as to our potential liability is independent of any potential recovery of insurance proceeds or indemnification arrangements. insurance companies and other indemnitors are notified of any potential claims and periodically updated as to the general status of known claims. we do not discount our environmental liabilities as the timing of the anticipated cash payments is not fixed or readily determinable. to the extent that there are changes in the evaluation factors identified above, management's estimate of environmental liabilities may also change.
we have recognized a reserve of approximately $63.0 million for environmental liabilities as of may 25, 2014. the reserve for each site is determined based on an assessment of the most likely required remedy and a related estimate of the costs required to effect such remedy. historically, the underlying assumptions utilized in estimating this reserve have been appropriate as actual payments have neither differed materially from the previously estimated reserve balances, nor have significant adjustments to this reserve balance been necessary.
employment-related benefits-we incur certain employment-related expenses associated with pensions, postretirement health care benefits, and workers' compensation. in order to measure the annual expense associated with these employment-related benefits, management must make a variety of estimates including, but not limited to, discount rates used to measure the present value of certain liabilities, assumed rates of return on assets set aside to fund these expenses, compensation increases, employee turnover rates, anticipated mortality rates, anticipated health care costs, and employee accidents incurred but not yet reported to us. the estimates used by management are based on our historical experience as well as current facts and circumstances. we use third-party specialists to assist management in appropriately measuring the expense associated with these employment-related benefits. different estimates used by management could result in us recognizing different amounts of expense over different periods of time. we had recognized a pension liability of $451.8 million and $480.8 million, a postretirement liability of $283.2 million and $302.7 million, and a workers' compensation liability of $107.7 million and $105.1 million, as of the end of fiscal 2014 and 2013, respectively. we also had recognized a pension asset of $18.8 million and $6.6 million as of the end of fiscal 2014 and 2013, respectively, as certain individual plans of the company had a positive funded status.
we recognize cumulative changes in the fair value of pension plan assets and net actuarial gains or losses in excess of 10% of the greater of the fair value of plan assets or the plan's projected benefit obligation ("the corridor") in current period expense annually as of our measurement date, which is our fiscal year-end, or when measurement is required otherwise under generally accepted accounting principles.
we recognized pension expense from company plans of $(5.9) million, $23.5 million, and $421.8 million in fiscal years 2014, 2013, and 2012, respectively. such amounts reflect the year-end write-off of actuarial losses in excess of 10% of our pension liability. this also reflected expected returns on plan assets of $252.9 million, $216.4 million, and $196.0 million in fiscal years 2014, 2013, and 2012, respectively. we contributed $18.5 million, $19.8 million, and $326.4 million to our pension plans in fiscal years 2014, 2013, and 2012, respectively. we anticipate contributing approximately $12.9 million to our pension plans in fiscal 2015.
one significant assumption for pension plan accounting is the discount rate. we select a discount rate each year (as of our fiscal year-end measurement date) for our plans based upon a hypothetical bond portfolio for which the cash flows from coupons and maturities match the year-by-year projected benefit cash flows for our pension plans. the hypothetical bond portfolio is
33
comprised of high-quality fixed income debt instruments (usually moody's aa) available at the measurement date. based on this information, the discount rate selected by us for determination of pension expense was 4.05% for fiscal 2014, 4.5% for fiscal 2013, and 5.3% for fiscal 2012. we selected a discount rate of 4.15% for determination of pension expense for fiscal 2015. a 25 basis point increase in our discount rate assumption as of the end of fiscal 2014 would have resulted in a decrease of $1.8 million in our pension expense for fiscal 2014. a 25 basis point decrease in our discount rate assumption as of the end of fiscal 2014 would have resulted in an increase of $7.3 million in our pension expense for fiscal 2014. for our year-end pension obligation determination, we selected discount rates of 4.15% and 4.05% for fiscal years 2014 and 2013, respectively.
another significant assumption used to account for our pension plans is the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets. in developing the assumed long-term rate of return on plan assets for determining pension expense, we consider long-term historical returns (arithmetic average) of the plan's investments, the asset allocation among types of investments, estimated long-term returns by investment type from external sources, and the current economic environment. based on this information, we selected 7.75% for the long-term rate of return on plan assets for determining our fiscal 2014 pension expense. a 25 basis point increase/decrease in our expected long-term rate of return assumption as of the beginning of fiscal 2014 would decrease/increase annual pension expense for our pension plans by $8.3 million. we selected an expected rate of return on plan assets of 7.75% to be used to determine our pension expense for fiscal 2015. a 25 basis point increase/decrease in our expected long-term rate of return assumption as of the beginning of fiscal 2015 would decrease/increase annual pension expense for our pension plans by $8.7 million.
the rate of compensation increase is another significant assumption used in the development of accounting information for pension plans. we determine this assumption based on our long-term plans for compensation increases and current economic conditions. based on this information, we selected 4.25% for fiscal years 2014 and 2013 as the rate of compensation increase for determining our year-end pension obligation. we selected 4.25% for the rate of compensation increase for determination of pension expense for each of fiscal years 2014, 2013, and 2012. a 25 basis point increase/decrease in our rate of compensation increase assumption as of the beginning of fiscal 2014 would increase/decrease pension expense for our pension plans by $0.9 million for the year. we selected a rate of 4.25% for the rate of compensation increase to be used to determine our pension expense for fiscal 2015. a 25 basis point increase in our rate of compensation increase assumption as of the beginning of fiscal 2015 would increase pension expense for our pension plans by $0.8 million for the year. a 25 basis point decrease in our rate of compensation increase assumption as of the beginning of fiscal 2015 would decrease pension expense for our pension plans by $1.2 million for the year.
we also provide certain postretirement health care benefits. we recognized postretirement benefit expense of $9.9 million, $8.8 million, and $7.8 million in fiscal 2014, 2013, and 2012, respectively. we reflected liabilities of $283.2 million and $302.7 million in our balance sheets as of may 25, 2014 and may 26, 2013, respectively. we anticipate contributing approximately $25.5 million to our postretirement health care plans in fiscal 2015.
the postretirement benefit expense and obligation are also dependent on our assumptions used for the actuarially determined amounts. these assumptions include discount rates (discussed above), health care cost trend rates, inflation rates, retirement rates, mortality rates, and other factors. the health care cost trend assumptions are developed based on historical cost data, the near-term outlook, and an assessment of likely long-term trends. assumed inflation rates are based on an evaluation of external market indicators. retirement and mortality rates are based primarily on actual plan experience. the discount rate we selected for determination of postretirement expense was 3.35% for fiscal 2014, 3.9% for fiscal 2013, and 4.3% for fiscal 2012. we have selected a weighted-average discount rate of 3.65% for determination of postretirement expense for fiscal 2015. a 25 basis point increase/decrease in our discount rate assumption as of the beginning of fiscal 2013 would not have resulted in a material change to postretirement expense for our plans. we have assumed the initial year increase in cost of health care to be 10.0%, with the trend rate decreasing to 5.0% by 2022. a one percentage point change in the assumed health care cost trend rate would have the following effects:
($ in millions)                                        one percentincrease   one percentdecrease effect on total service and interest cost                    $0.8            $(0.7             )
effect on postretirement benefit obligation   18.9                           (16.8             )
we provide workers' compensation benefits to our employees. the measurement of the liability for our cost of providing these benefits is largely based upon actuarial analysis of costs. one significant assumption we make is the discount rate used to calculate the present value of our obligation. the weighted-average discount rate used at may 25, 2014 was 2.27%. a 25 basis point increase/decrease in the discount rate assumption would not have a material impact on workers' compensation expense.
business combinations, impairment of long-lived assets (including property, plant and equipment), identifiable intangible assets, and goodwill-we use the acquisition method in accounting for acquired businesses. under the acquisition method, our financial statements reflect the operations of an acquired business starting from the completion of the acquisition. the assets acquired and liabilities assumed are recorded at their respective estimated fair values at the date of the acquisition. any
34
excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair values of the identifiable net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill. significant judgment is often required in estimating the fair value of assets acquired, particularly intangible assets. as a result, in the case of significant acquisitions we normally obtain the assistance of a third-party valuation specialist in estimating fair values of tangible and intangible assets. the fair value estimates are based on available historical information and on expectations and assumptions about the future, considering the perspective of marketplace participants. while management believes those expectations and assumptions are reasonable, they are inherently uncertain. unanticipated market or macroeconomic events and circumstances may occur, which could affect the accuracy or validity of the estimates and assumptions.
determining the useful lives of intangible assets also requires management judgment. certain brand intangibles are expected to have indefinite lives based on their history and our plans to continue to support and build the acquired brands, while other acquired intangible assets (e.g. customer relationships) are expected to have determinable useful lives. our estimates of the useful lives of definite-lived intangible assets are primarily based upon historical experience, the competitive and macroeconomic environment, and our operating plans. the costs of definite-lived intangibles are amortized to expense over their estimated life.
we reduce the carrying amounts of long-lived assets, identifiable intangible assets, and goodwill to their fair values when the fair value of such assets is determined to be less than their carrying amounts (i.e., assets are deemed to be impaired). fair value is typically estimated using a discounted cash flow analysis, which requires us to estimate the future cash flows anticipated to be generated by the particular asset being tested for impairment as well as to select a discount rate to measure the present value of the anticipated cash flows. when determining future cash flow estimates, we consider historical results adjusted to reflect current and anticipated operating conditions. estimating future cash flows requires significant judgment by management in such areas as future economic conditions, industry-specific conditions, product pricing, and necessary capital expenditures. the use of different assumptions or estimates for future cash flows could produce different impairment amounts (or none at all) for long-lived assets and identifiable intangible assets.
in assessing other intangible assets not subject to amortization for impairment, we have the option to perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether the existence of events or circumstances leads to a determination that it is more likely than not that the fair value of such an intangible asset is less than its carrying amount. if we determine that it is not more likely than not that the fair value of such an intangible asset is less than its carrying amount, then we are not required to perform any additional tests for assessing intangible assets for impairment. however, if we conclude otherwise or elect not to perform the qualitative assessment, then we are required to perform a quantitative impairment test that involves a comparison of the estimated fair value of the intangible asset with its carrying value. if the carrying value of the intangible asset exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess.
if we determine to perform a quantitative impairment test in evaluating impairment of our indefinite lived brands/trademarks, we utilize a "relief from royalty" methodology. the methodology determines the fair value of each brand through use of a discounted cash flow model that incorporates an estimated "royalty rate" we would be able to charge a third party for the use of the particular brand. when determining the future cash flow estimates, we must estimate future net sales and a fair market royalty rate for each applicable brand and an appropriate discount rate to measure the present value of the anticipated cash flows. estimating future net sales requires significant judgment by management in such areas as future economic conditions, product pricing, and consumer trends. in determining an appropriate discount rate to apply to the estimated future cash flows, we consider the current interest rate environment and our estimated cost of capital. as the calculated fair value of our other identifiable intangible assets generally significantly exceeds the carrying value of these assets, a one percentage point increase in the discount rate assumptions used to estimate the fair values of our other identifiable intangible assets would not result in a material impairment charge.
in fiscal 2014, we elected to perform a quantitative impairment test for indefinite lived intangibles. we recognized impairment charges of $72.5 million in our consumer foods segment, primarily for our chef boyardee® brand, and a $3.2 million impairment charge in our private brands segment for two small brands. we also recognized a $3.2 million impairment charge for an amortizable technology license in our corporate expenses in fiscal 2014.
goodwill is tested annually for impairment of value and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of the asset may be impaired. a significant amount of judgment is involved in determining if an indicator of impairment has occurred. such indicators may include deterioration in general economic conditions, adverse changes in the markets in which an entity operates, increases in input costs that have negative effects on earnings and cash flows, or a trend of negative or declining cash flows over multiple periods, among others. the fair value that could be realized in an actual transaction may differ from that used to evaluate the impairment of goodwill.
in testing goodwill for impairment, we have the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events or circumstances leads to a determination that it is more likely than not (more than 50%) that the estimated fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. if we elect to perform a qualitative assessment and determine that an impairment
35
is more likely than not, we are then required to perform a quantitative impairment test, otherwise no further analysis is required. we also may elect not to perform the qualitative assessment and, instead, proceed directly to the quantitative impairment test under the qualitative assessment, various events and circumstances that would affect the estimated fair value of a reporting unit are identified (similar to impairment indicators above). furthermore, management considers the results of the most recent two-step quantitative impairment test completed for a reporting unit and compares the weighted average cost of capital between the current and prior years for each reporting unit.
under the two-step quantitative impairment test, the first step of the evaluation involves comparing the current fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value, including goodwill. fair value is typically estimated using a discounted cash flow analysis, which requires us to estimate the future cash flows anticipated to be generated by the reporting unit being tested for impairment as well as to select a risk-adjusted discount rate to measure the present value of the anticipated cash flows. when determining future cash flow estimates, we consider historical results adjusted to reflect current and anticipated operating conditions. we estimate cash flows for the reporting unit over a discrete period (typically four or five years) and the terminal period (considering expected long term growth rates and trends). estimating future cash flows requires significant judgment by management in such areas as future economic conditions, industry-specific conditions, product pricing, and necessary capital expenditures. the use of different assumptions or estimates for future cash flows or significant changes in risk-adjusted discounts rates due to changes in market conditions could produce substantially different estimates of the fair value of the reporting unit.
if the fair value of a reporting unit determined in the first step of the evaluation is lower than its carrying value, we proceed to the second step, which compares the carrying value of goodwill to its implied fair value. in estimating the implied fair value of goodwill for a reporting unit, we must assign the fair value of the reporting unit (as determined in the first step) to the assets and liabilities associated with the reporting unit as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination. any excess of the carrying value of goodwill of the reporting unit over its implied fair value is recorded as impairment.
we implemented organizational changes during the second quarter of fiscal 2014 that resulted in new reporting segments. as a result, we reassigned goodwill to the new reporting units using a relative fair value allocation approach and performed a goodwill impairment analysis, which did not identify any potential impairments.
in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014, in conjunction with our annual review for impairment, we performed a qualitative analysis of goodwill for each of the reporting units in our segments. because sales and profits for private brands continued to fall below our expectations throughout fiscal 2014 and following preparation of plans for the business for fiscal 2015, we performed a quantitative analysis of goodwill of our private brands segment. estimating the fair value of individual reporting units requires us to make assumptions and estimates regarding our future plans and future industry and economic conditions. we estimated the future cash flows of each reporting unit within the private brands segment and calculated the net present value of those estimated cash flows using a risk adjusted discount rate, in order to estimate the fair value of each reporting unit from the perspective of a market participant. we used discount rates and terminal growth rates of approximately 8.3% and 3%, respectively, to calculate the present value of estimated future cash flows. we then compared the estimated fair value of each reporting unit to the respective historical carrying value (including allocated assets and liabilities of certain shared and corporate functions), and determined that the fair value of the reporting unit was less than the carrying value for five of our reporting units within the private brands segment. with the assistance of a third-party valuation specialist, we estimated the fair value of the assets and liabilities of each of these reporting units in order to determine the implied fair value of goodwill of each reporting unit. we recognized impairment charges for the difference between the implied fair value of goodwill and the historical carrying value of goodwill within each reporting unit. accordingly, during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014, we recorded a $602.2 million charge for the impairment of goodwill. the following reporting units within private brands were impacted: $66.4 million in bars and coordinated, $154.6 million in cereal, $94.2 million in pasta, $231.6 million in snacks, and $55.4 million in retail bakery.
in the case of three of our reporting units within the private brands segment: pasta, snacks, and retail bakery, the estimated fair value of certain amortizing intangible assets (customer relationships) used in step two of our impairment analysis was substantially less than the carrying value of those assets and, as a result, the the carrying value of the pasta, snacks, and retail bakery reporting units exceeded the estimated fair values of those reporting units, even after the previously described goodwill impairment charges were recorded. the carrying value of the private brands amortizing intangible assets are expected to be recovered over their remaining lives (on an undiscounted basis) and, accordingly, no impairments were required to be recognized.
following the impairment charges recorded in fiscal 2014, the carrying value of goodwill in our private brands reporting units included $328.7 million for bars and coordinated, $464.4 million for cereal, $752.1 million for pasta, $816.2 million for snacks, $717.1 million for retail bakery, and $136.1 million for condiments. if the future performance of one or more of the reporting units within the private brands segment falls short of our expectations or if there are significant changes in risk-adjusted discount rates due to changes in market conditions, we could be required to recognize additional, material impairment charges in future periods.

recently issued accounting pronouncements in july 2013, the financial accounting standards board ("fasb") issued accounting standards update ("asu") 2013-11, presentation of an unrecognized tax benefit when a net operating loss carryforward, a similar tax loss, or a tax credit carryforward exists, which states that entities should present the unrecognized tax benefit as a reduction of the deferred tax asset for a net operating loss ("nol") or similar tax loss or tax credit carryforward rather than as a liability when the uncertain tax position would reduce the nol or other carryforward under the tax law. no new disclosures are necessary. this asu will be effective for the first interim reporting period in fiscal 2015.
in april 2014, the fasb issued asu 2014-08, reporting discontinued operations and disclosures of components of an entity, which updates the definition of discontinued operations from current u.s. gaap. going forward only those disposals of components of an entity that represent a strategic shift that has (or will have) a major effect on an entity's operations and financial results will be reported as discontinued operations in the financial statements. currently, a component of an entity that is a reportable segment, an operating segment, a reporting unit, a subsidiary, or an asset group is eligible for discontinued operations presentation. additionally, the existing condition that the entity will not have any significant continuing involvement in the operations of the component after the disposal transaction has been removed. the effective date for the revised standard is for applicable transactions that occur within annual periods beginning on or after december 15, 2014. early adoption is permitted, but only for disposals (or classifications as held for sale) that have not been reported in financial statements previously issued or available for issuance. the company intends to early adopt this standard in the first quarter of fiscal 2015. this will result in the presentation of historical results of our milling business, prior to the creation of the ardent mills joint venture, as discontinued operations, beginning in fiscal 2015. such accounting treatment is precluded prior to the adoption of the new accounting standard.
in may 2014, after our fiscal year end, the fasb issued asu no. 2014-09, revenue from contracts with customers, which requires an entity to recognize the amount of revenue to which it expects to be entitled for the transfer of promised goods or services to customers. the asu will replace most existing revenue recognition guidance in u.s. gaap when it becomes effective. the new standard is effective for the company in our fiscal year 2018. early application is not permitted. the company is evaluating the effect that asu 2014-09 will have on its consolidated financial statements and related disclosures. the standard permits the use of either the retrospective or cumulative effect transition method. the company has not yet selected a transition method nor has it determined the effect of the standard on its ongoing financial reporting.

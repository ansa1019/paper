item 1a.    risk factors.
risks related to eri's capital structure and equity ownership we have significant indebtedness as a result of our existing credit facilities and outstanding secured notes, we have a significant amount of indebtedness. the company's consolidated outstanding aggregate principal amount of notes as of december 31, 2014 was $728.7 million. mtr gaming's $560.7 million outstanding aggregate principal amount of second lien notes is secured by substantially all assets of mtr gaming. resorts' $168.0 million outstanding aggregate principal amount of senior notes are secured by substantially all assets of resorts. this indebtedness may have important negative consequences for us, including:
 limiting our ability to satisfy our obligations;
 increasing our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions;
 limiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in its businesses and the markets in which we operates;
 placing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to competitors that have less debt;
 increasing our vulnerability to, and limiting our ability to react to, changing market conditions, changes in our industry and economic downturns;
 limiting our ability to obtain additional financing to fund working capital requirements, capital expenditures, debt service, general corporate or other obligations;
 subjecting us to a number of restrictive covenants that, among other things, limit our ability to pay dividends and distributions, make acquisitions and dispositions, borrow additional funds, and make capital expenditures and other investments;
 restrictions on making dividend payments and other payments by wholly-owned subsidiaries;
 limiting our ability to use operating cash flow in other areas of its business because we must dedicate a significant portion of these funds to make principal and/or interest payments on its outstanding debt;
 exposing us to interest rate risk due to the variable interest rate on borrowings under our credit facility;
 causing our failure to comply with the financial and restrictive covenants contained in our current or future indebtedness, which could cause a default under such indebtedness and which, if not cured or waived, could have a material adverse effect on us; and
 affecting our ability to renew gaming and other licenses necessary to conduct our business.
our ability to make payments of the principal and interest on and refinance our indebtedness will depend on our future performance, our ability to generate cash flow and market conditions, each of which is subject to economic, financial, competitive and other factors beyond our control. our business may be unable to continue to generate cash flow from operations sufficient to service our debt and make necessary capital expenditures. in addition, because mtr and resorts have separate debt facilities that limit their ability to distribute cash, we will be limited in our ability to move funds from one entity to another to finance debt obligations, capital expenditures or other liquidity needs. if mtr or resorts is unable to generate such cash flow or contribute or distribute cash to finance the liquidity needs of eri or each other, eri, mtr or resorts, as applicable, may be required to adopt one or more alternatives, such as selling assets, restructuring debt, undertaking additional borrowings or issuing additional debt or obtaining additional equity capital on terms that may be onerous or highly dilutive. the failure to comply with the terms of our indebtedness could result in an event of default
18
which, if not cured or waived, could have a material negative effect on us. our ability to refinance all or a portion of our indebtedness will depend on the capital markets, the credit markets and our financial condition at such time. we may not be able to engage in any of these activities or engage in these activities on desirable terms, which could result in increased financing costs or a default on our debt obligations.
our indentures contain, and future debt agreements may contain, covenants that could significantly restrict our operations the agreements governing our indebtedness contain, and any of our future debt agreements might contain, numerous covenants imposing financial and operating restrictions on our business. these restrictions might affect our ability to operate our business, might limit our ability to take advantage of potential business opportunities as they arise and might adversely affect the conduct of our current business, including by restricting our ability to finance future operations and capital needs and limiting our ability to engage in other business activities. these covenants will place restrictions on our ability and the ability of our operating subsidiaries to, among other things:
 incur additional debt;
 create liens or other encumbrances;
 pay dividends or make other restricted payments, including payments by resorts and mtr to eri and to each other;
 agree to payment restrictions affecting our restricted subsidiaries;
 prepay subordinated indebtedness;
 make investments, loans or other guarantees;
 sell or otherwise dispose of a portion of our assets; or
 make acquisitions or merge or consolidate with another entity.
our credit facilities also include certain financial and other covenants, including maintaining certain total leverage and earnings to fixed charge ratios as well as restrictions on capital expenditures. our ability to comply with these provisions may be affected by general economic conditions, industry conditions and other events beyond our control. we cannot assure you that we will be able to comply with these covenants. if we fail to comply with a financial covenant or other restriction contained in the agreements governing our indebtedness, an event of default could occur. an event of default could result in acceleration of some or all of the applicable indebtedness and the inability to borrow additional funds. we do not have, and are not certain we would be able to obtain, sufficient funds to repay any such indebtedness if it is accelerated.
eri is a holding company and will depend on its subsidiaries for dividends, distributions and other payments eri is structured as a holding company, a legal entity separate and distinct from its subsidiaries. eri's only significant asset is the capital stock or other equity interests of its operating subsidiaries. as a holding company, eri conducts all of its business through its subsidiaries. consequently, eri's principal source of cash flow, including cash flow to pay dividends, will be dividends and distributions from its subsidiaries. if eri's subsidiaries are unable to make dividend payments or distributions to it and sufficient cash or liquidity is not otherwise available, eri may not be able to pay dividends. the current indebtedness of resorts and mtr gaming restricts, and any future indebtedness of theirs will likely restrict, the ability of resorts and mtr gaming to make dividends or distributions to eri. in addition, eri's right to participate in a distribution of assets upon a subsidiary's liquidation or reorganization will be subject to the prior claims of the subsidiary's creditors.
19
servicing debt and funding other obligations requires a significant amount of cash, and our ability to generate sufficient cash depends on many factors, some of which are beyond our control our ability to make payments on and refinance our indebtedness and to fund our operations and capital expenditures depends upon our ability to generate cash flow and secure financing in the future. our ability to generate future cash flow depends, among other things, upon:
 our future operating performance;
 the demand for services resorts, mtr and silver legacy provide;
 general economic conditions;
 competition; and
 legislative and regulatory factors affecting our operations and business.
some of these factors are beyond our control. we cannot assure you that our businesses will generate cash flow from operations or that future debt or equity financings will be available to us to enable us to pay our indebtedness or to fund our needs. as a result, we may need to refinance all or a portion of our indebtedness on or before maturity. we cannot assure that we will be able to refinance any indebtedness on favorable terms, or at all. any inability to generate sufficient cash flow or refinance our indebtedness on favorable terms could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition.
if we are unable to finance our expansion, development, investment and renovation projects, as well as other capital expenditures, through cash flow, borrowings under our existing credit facilities and additional financings, our expansion, development, investment and renovation efforts will be jeopardized we intend to finance our current and future development, investment, renovation and expansion projects, as well as our other capital expenditures, primarily with cash flow from operations, and equity or debt financings. if we are unable to finance our current or future expansion, development, investment and renovation projects, or our other capital expenditures, we will have to adopt one or more alternatives, such as reducing, delaying or abandoning planned development, investment, renovation and expansion projects as well as other capital expenditures, selling assets, restructuring debt, obtaining additional equity financing or joint venture partners. these sources of funds may not be sufficient to finance our development, investment, renovation and expansion projects, and other financing may not be available on acceptable terms, in a timely manner, or at all. in addition, the agreements governing our existing indebtedness contains certain restrictions on our ability to incur additional indebtedness.
recently, there were significant disruptions in the global capital markets that adversely impacted the ability of borrowers to access capital. although the financial markets have seen recent signs of recovery and increased availability of capital, the financial markets remain volatile.
to the extent that cash flow from operations are not sufficient to fund our development, investment, renovation and expansion projects, we would be required to seek additional financing, which may not be available to us or, if available, may not be on terms favorable to us.
the operating agreement of silver legacy joint venture contains a buy-sell provision which, if exercised by either partner, could adversely affect us the operating agreement for the entity that owns the silver legacy contains a buy-sell provision pursuant to which either resorts or the wholly owned subsidiary of mgm resorts international that owns its 50% interest in the silver legacy joint venture may sell its membership interest or purchase the interest of the other member, in either case, at the price proposed by the offering member. if
20
either member should make such an offer, the operating agreement requires the other member to either sell its membership interest or purchase the membership interest of the offering member, in either case, at the price proposed by the offering member. an election by either member to exercise its buy-sell right, which would result in the buyout of one of the members, could adversely impact its operations, depending, among other things, on its ability to respond to an offer from the other member and the price at which any offer is made. mgm resorts international has significantly greater resources than we have. if an offer by either member results in the purchase of its interest in the silver legacy joint venture, the sale of the interest could adversely affect, or result in the termination of, any existing arrangements or agreements resorts may have with silver legacy or the other member, or otherwise adversely impact us.
the market price of eri's common stock could fluctuate significantly the u.s. securities markets in general have experienced significant price fluctuations in recent years. the market price of eri's common stock may be volatile and subject to wide fluctuations. in addition, the trading volume of eri's common stock may fluctuate and cause significant price variations to occur. some of the factors that could cause fluctuations in, or have a material adverse effect on, the stock price or trading volume of eri's common stock include:
 general market and economic conditions, including market conditions in the hotel and casino industries;
 actual or expected variations in operating results;
 differences between actual operating results and those expected by investors and analysts;
 changes in recommendations by securities analysts;
 operations and stock performance of competitors;
 accounting charges, including charges relating to the impairment of goodwill;
 significant acquisitions or strategic alliances by eri or by competitors;
 sales of eri's common stock or other securities in the future, including sales by our directors and officers or significant investors;
 recruitment or departure of key personnel;
 conditions and trends in the gaming and entertainment industries;
 changes in the estimate of the future size and growth of our markets; and
 changes in reserves for professional liability claims.
we cannot assure you that the stock price of eri common stock will not fluctuate or decline significantly in the future. in addition, the stock market in general can experience considerable price and volume fluctuations that may be unrelated to eri's performance. if the market price of eri common stock fluctuates significantly, eri may become the subject of securities class action litigation which may result in substantial costs and a diversion of management's attention and resources.
eri has not yet determined its dividend policy and may not pay dividends eri has not yet determined its dividend policy, but it does not currently expect to pay dividends on its common stock. any determination to pay dividends in the future will be at the discretion of the eri board of directors and will depend upon among other factors, eri's earnings, cash requirements, financial condition, requirements to comply with the covenants under its debt instruments, including limitations on the ability of mtr and eldorado to make distributions to eri, legal considerations, and
21
other factors that the eri board of directors deems relevant. if eri does not pay dividends, then the return on an investment in its common stock will depend entirely upon any future appreciation in its stock price. there is no guarantee that eri's common stock will appreciate in value or maintain its value.
the volatility and disruption of the capital and credit markets and adverse changes in the u.s. and global economies may negatively impact our access to financing during recent years, a confluence of many factors has contributed to diminished expectations for the u.s. economy and increased market volatility for publicly traded securities, including the common shares and notes issued by publicly owned companies. these factors include the availability and cost of credit, declining business and consumer confidence and increased unemployment. these conditions have combined to create an unprecedented level of market volatility, which could negatively impact our ability to access capital and financing (including financing necessary to refinance our existing indebtedness), on terms and at prices acceptable to us, that we would otherwise need in connection with the operation of our businesses.
risk factors relating to our operations our business is sensitive to reductions in discretionary consumer spending as a result of downturns in the economy consumer demand for casino hotel and racetrack properties such as ours is particularly sensitive to downturns in the economy and the associated impact on discretionary spending on leisure activities. changes in discretionary consumer spending or consumer preferences brought about by factors such as perceived or actual general economic conditions, effects of declines in consumer confidence in the economy, including the recent housing, employment and credit crisis, the impact of high energy and food costs, the increased cost of travel, the potential for continued bank failures, decreased disposable consumer income and wealth, or fears of war and future acts of terrorism could further reduce customer demand for the amenities that we offer, which have had, and may continue to have, a negative impact on our results of operations. increases in gasoline prices, including increases prompted by global political and economic instabilities, can adversely affect the operations of resorts and mtr because most of their patrons travel to their properties by car or on airlines that may pass on increases in fuel costs to passengers in the form of higher ticket prices. the recent global, national and regional economic downturn, including the housing crisis, credit crisis, lower consumer confidence, and other related factors which impact discretionary consumer spending and other economic activities that have direct effects on resorts' and mtr gaming's business, have resulted in a decline in the tourism industry that has adversely impacted their operations. we cannot be sure how long these factors will continue to impact our operations in the future or the extent of the impact.
we face substantial competition in the hotel and casino industry and expect that such competition will continue the gaming industry is characterized by an increasingly high degree of competition among a large number of participants, including land-based casinos, dockside casinos, riverboat casinos, casinos located on native american reservations and other forms of legalized gaming. there is intense competition among companies in the gaming industry, many of which have significantly greater resources than we do. certain states have legalized casino gaming and other states may legalize gaming in the future. legalized casino gaming in these states and on native american reservations near our markets or changes to gaming laws in states surrounding nevada, louisiana, west virginia, pennsylvania, or ohio could increase competition and could adversely affect our operations. we also compete, to a lesser extent, with gaming facilities in other jurisdictions with dockside gaming facilities, state sponsored lotteries, on-and-off track pari-mutuel wagering, card clubs, riverboat casinos and other
22
forms of legalized gambling. in addition, various forms of internet gaming have been approved in nevada and new jersey and legislation permitting internet gaming has been proposed by the federal government and other states. the expansion of internet gaming in nevada and other jurisdictions could result in significant additional competition.
gaming competition is intense in most of the markets where we operate. recently, there has been additional significant competition in our markets as a result of the expansion of facilities by existing market participants, the entrance of new gaming participants into a market or legislative changes. for example, casino gaming is currently prohibited in several jurisdictions from which the shreveport/bossier city market draws customers, primarily texas. the texas legislature has from time to time considered proposals to legalize gaming, and there can be no assurance that casino gaming will not be approved in texas in the future, which would have a material adverse effect on our business. additionally, since visitors from california comprise a significant portion of our customer base in reno, we also compete with native american gaming operations in california. native american tribes are allowed to operate slot machines, lottery games and banking and percentage games on native american lands. although many existing native american gaming facilities in northern california are modest compared to eldorado reno and silver legacy, a number of native american tribes have established large-scale gaming facilities in california and some native american tribes have announced that they are in the process of expanding, developing, or are considering establishing, large-scale hotel and gaming facilities in northern california. a new 320,000 square foot gaming facility located in sonoma county, california opened on november 5, 2013. additionally, a new 30,000 square foot casino and 400-room hotel in bossier city across the red river from eldorado shreveport opened in june 2013, which includes several restaurants and a 1,000-seat entertainment arena. in december 2014, a new luxury, land-based casino with 1,600 slot machines, 72 gaming tables, a poker room, and a 740-room hotel with a ballroom and spa, opened in lake charles, louisiana approximately 200 miles south of eldorado shreveport, but closer to the houston, texas market. with respect to our mtr gaming facilities, an additional license has been granted for a casino to be located in lawrence county, pennsylvania, approximately 45 miles from mountaineer and 90 miles from presque isle downs, which would result in further competition for both of those properties. further, gaming facilities in ohio that have recently commenced operations, including the horseshoe casino cleveland, hollywood casino columbus, thistledown racino, northfield park and beulah park, present significant competition for mountaineer, presque isle downs and scioto downs.
increased competition may require us to make substantial capital expenditures to maintain and enhance the competitive positions of our properties to increase the attractiveness and add to the appeal of our facilities. because we are highly leveraged, after satisfying our obligations under our outstanding indebtedness, there can be no assurance that we will have sufficient funds to undertake these expenditures or that we will be able to obtain sufficient financing to fund such expenditures. if we are unable to make such expenditures, our competitive position could be materially adversely affected.
we may face integration difficulties and may be unable to integrate mtr gaming's business into eri's business successfully or realize the anticipated benefits of the merger the merger involved the combination of two companies that previously operated as independent companies. mtr gaming is now a wholly-owned subsidiary of eri. we have devoted, and will continue to devote, significant management attention and resources to integrating the companies' business practices and operations. potential difficulties we may encounter as part of the integration process include the following:
 the inability to successfully combine our two businesses in a manner that permits us to achieve the full revenue and other benefits anticipated to result from the merger;
23
 complexities associated with managing the combined businesses, including difficulty addressing possible differences in corporate cultures and management philosophies and the challenge of integrating complex systems, technology, networks and other assets of each of the companies in a seamless manner that minimizes any adverse impact on customers, suppliers, employees and other constituencies; and
 potential unknown liabilities and unforeseen increased expenses associated with the merger.
in addition, it is possible that the integration process could result in:
 the diversion of the attention of management; and
 the disruption of, or the loss of momentum in, each company's ongoing businesses or inconsistencies in standards, controls, procedures and policies, any of which could adversely affect our ability to maintain relationships with customers, suppliers, employees and other constituencies or our ability to achieve the anticipated benefits of the merger, or could reduce our earnings or otherwise adversely affect our business and financial results.
our future results could suffer if we cannot effectively manage our expanded operations following the merger following the merger, the size of the combined businesses is significantly larger than the previous size of either resorts' or mtr gaming's business. our future success depends, in part, upon our ability to manage this expanded business, which will pose substantial challenges for management, including challenges related to the management and monitoring of new operations and associated increased costs and complexity. there can be no assurances that we will be successful or that we will realize any operating efficiencies, cost savings, revenue enhancements or other benefits currently anticipated from the merger.
we may incur additional expenses related to the merger and the integration of our businesses we have already incurred, and may in the future incur, expenses in connection with the merger and the integration of our businesses. there are a large number of processes, policies, procedures, operations, technologies and systems that must be integrated, including purchasing, accounting and finance, sales, payroll, pricing, marketing and benefits. while we have made significant progress in integrating resorts and mtr, we may identify additional steps that should be taken to fully integrate the operation of our businesses. any additional steps we take could affect the total amount or the timing of the integration expenses and any such expenses are difficult to estimate accurately.
we will be subject to extensive state and local regulation and licensing, and gaming authorities have significant control over our operations, which could have an adverse effect on our business the ownership and operation of casino gaming, riverboat and horseracing facilities are subject to extensive federal, state, and local regulation, and regulatory authorities at the federal, state, and local levels have broad powers with respect to the licensing of gaming businesses and may revoke, suspend, condition or limit our gaming or other licenses, impose substantial fines, and take other actions, each of which poses a significant risk to our business, financial condition, and results of operations. we currently hold all state and local licenses and related approvals necessary to conduct our present gaming operations, but we must periodically apply to renew many of our licenses and registrations. we cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain such renewals. any failure to maintain or renew our existing licenses, registrations, permits or approvals would have a material adverse effect on us. furthermore, if additional laws or regulations are adopted or existing laws or regulations are amended, these regulations could impose additional restrictions or costs that could have a significant adverse effect on us. as an example, on august 26, 2014, the board of health of hancock county, west virginia adopted and approved the clean air regulation act of 2014 ("regulation"), which will be
24
effective july 1, 2015. the regulation, as currently adopted, will ban smoking in public places in hancock county including at mountaineer. we are continuing to evaluate the regulation, its impact on our mountaineer facility, and steps to become compliant with the regulation upon its effective date. we expect that the regulation will have a negative impact on our business and results of operations at mountaineer, and such impact may be material.
any of the nevada gaming commission, the louisiana gaming control board, the west virginia alcohol beverage control administration, the west virginia lottery commission, the west virginia racing commission, the pennsylvania gaming control board, the pennsylvania racing commission, the pennsylvania liquor control board, the ohio lottery commission, and the ohio state racing commission (which we refer to collectively as the gaming authorities) may, in their discretion, require the holder of any securities issued by us to file applications, be investigated, and be found suitable to own our securities if it has reason to believe that the security ownership would be inconsistent with the declared policies of their respective jurisdictions. further, the costs of any investigation conducted by any of the gaming authorities under these circumstances must be paid by the applicant, and refusal or failure to pay these charges may constitute grounds for a finding that the applicant is unsuitable to own the securities. if any of the gaming authorities determines that a person is unsuitable to own our securities, then, under the applicable gaming or horse racing laws and regulations, we can be sanctioned, including the loss of their approvals, if, without the prior approval of the applicable gaming authority, we conduct certain business with the unsuitable person.
our officers, directors, and key employees will also be subject to a variety of regulatory requirements and various licensing and related approval procedures in the various jurisdictions in which we operate gaming facilities. if any of the applicable gaming authorities were to find an officer, director or key employee of ours unsuitable for licensing or unsuitable to continue having a relationship with us, we would have to sever all relationships with that person. furthermore, the gaming authorities may require us to terminate the employment of any person who refuses to file appropriate applications. either result could materially adversely affect our gaming operations.
applicable gaming laws and regulations restrict our ability to issue securities, incur debt and undertake other financing activities. such transactions would generally require approval of applicable gaming authorities, and our financing counterparties, including lenders, might be subject to various licensing and related approval procedures in the various jurisdictions in which we operate gaming facilities. if state regulatory authorities were to find any person unsuitable with regard to his, her or its relationship to us or any of our subsidiaries, we would be required to sever our relationships with that person, which could materially adversely affect our business.
in addition, gaming companies are generally subject to significant revenue based taxes and fees in addition to normal federal, state, and local income taxes, and such taxes and fees are subject to increase at any time. we pay substantial taxes and fees with respect to our operations. from time to time, federal, state, and local legislators and officials have proposed changes in tax laws, or in the administration of such laws, affecting the gaming industry. in addition, worsening economic conditions could intensify the efforts of state and local governments to raise revenues through increases in gaming taxes and/or property taxes. it is not possible to determine with certainty the likelihood of changes in tax laws or in the administration of such laws. such changes, if adopted, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. the large number of state and local governments with significant current or projected budget deficits makes it more likely that those governments that currently permit gaming will seek to fund such deficits with new or increased gaming taxes and/or property taxes, and worsening economic conditions could intensify those efforts. any material increase, or the adoption of additional taxes or fees, could have a material adverse effect on our future financial results.
for more information, see "governmental gaming regulations" in item 1.
25
we rely on our key personnel our future success will depend upon, among other things, our ability to keep our senior executives and highly qualified employees. we compete with other potential employers for employees, and we may not succeed in hiring or retaining the executives and other employees that we need. we might not enter into employment contracts with all of our senior executives, and we might not obtain key man insurance policies for any or all of our executives. a sudden loss of or inability to replace key employees could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operation.
we may face difficulties in attracting and retaining qualified employees for our casinos and race tracks the operation of our business requires qualified executives, managers and skilled employees with gaming and horse racing industry experience and qualifications who are able to obtain the requisite licenses and approval from the applicable gaming authorities. while not currently the case, there has from time to time been a shortage of skilled labor in the regions of resorts' and mtr gaming's casinos and race tracks. in addition to limitations that may otherwise exist in the supply of skilled labor, the continued expansion of gaming near resorts' and mtr gaming's casinos and race tracks, including the expansion of native american gaming, may make it more difficult for us to attract qualified individuals. while we believe that we will continue to be able to attract and retain qualified employees, shortages of skilled labor will make it increasingly difficult and expensive to attract and retain the services of a satisfactory number of qualified employees, and we may incur higher costs than expected as a result.
we depend on agreements with our horsemen and pari-mutuel clerks to operate our business the federal interstate horse racing act and the state racing laws in west virginia, ohio and pennsylvania require that, in order to simulcast races, we have written agreements with the horse owners and trainers at those racetracks. in addition, in order to operate slot machines in west virginia, we are required to enter into written agreements regarding the proceeds of the slot machines (a "proceeds agreement") with a representative of a majority of the horse owners and trainers and with a representative of a majority of the pari-mutuel clerks.
if we fail to maintain operative agreements with the horsemen at any of our racetracks, we will not be permitted to conduct live racing and export and import simulcasting at the applicable racetrack. in addition, if we fail to maintain operative agreements with the horsemen at mountaineer, presque isle downs and scioto downs (including if we do not have in place the legally required proceeds agreement with the mountaineer pari-mutuel clerks union), we will not be permitted to continue our gaming operations at those facilities. if we fail to renew or modify existing agreements on satisfactory terms, this failure could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
work stoppages, organizing drives and other labor problems could negatively impact our future profits some of our employees are currently represented by labor unions. a lengthy strike or other work stoppages at any of our casino properties could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations. given the large number of employees, labor unions are making a concerted effort to recruit more employees in the gaming industry. in addition, organized labor may benefit from new legislation or legal interpretations by the current presidential administration. particularly, in light of current support for changes to federal and state labor laws, we cannot provide any assurance that we will not experience additional and more successful union organization activity in the future.
26
because portions of the land on which our facilities are situated are leased, the termination of such leases could adversely affect our business resorts owns the parcel on which eldorado reno is located, except for approximately 30,000 square feet which is leased from c. s. & y. associates, a general partnership of which donald carano, father of gary l. carano, is a general partner (the "csy lease"). the csy lease expires on june 30, 2027. if resorts defaults on a payment under the csy lease or if certain other specified events were to occur, c. s. & y. associates has the right to terminate the lease and take possession of the property located on the premises. if c. s. & y. associates were to exercise these rights, this could adversely affect our business.
a subsidiary of resorts is party to a ground lease with the city of shreveport for the land on which eldorado shreveport was built (the "shreveport lease"). the shreveport lease has a term ending december 20, 2015 with subsequent renewals for up to an additional 35 years. if resorts defaults on a payment under the shreveport lease or if certain other specified events were to occur, the city of shreveport could terminate the lease. if the city of shreveport were to exercise this right, this could adversely affect our business.
because we own real property, we will be subject to extensive environmental regulation, which creates uncertainty regarding future environmental expenditures and liabilities we are subject to various federal, state and local environmental, health and safety laws and regulations that govern activities that may have adverse environmental effects, such as discharges to air and water, as well as the use, storage, discharge, emission and disposal of solid, animal and hazardous wastes and exposure to hazardous materials. these laws and regulations are complex and frequently subject to change. in addition, our horseracing facilities are subject to laws and regulations that address the impacts of manure and wastewater generated by concentrated animal feeding operations ("cafo") on water quality, including, but not limited to, storm water discharges. cafo regulations include permit requirements and water quality discharge standards. enforcement of cafo regulations has been receiving increased governmental attention. compliance with these and other environmental laws can, in some circumstances, require significant capital expenditures. we have from time to time been responsible for investigating and remediating, or contributing to remediation costs related to, contamination located at or near certain of our facilities, including contamination related to underground storage tanks and groundwater contamination arising from prior uses of land on which certain of our facilities are located. in addition, we have been, and may in the future be, required to manage, abate, remove or contain manure and wastewater generated by concentrated animal feeding operations due to our racetrack operations, mold, lead, asbestos-containing materials or other hazardous conditions found in or on our properties. moreover, violations can result in significant fines or penalties and, in some instances, interruption or cessation of operations.
we are also subject to laws and regulations that create liability and cleanup responsibility for releases of regulated materials into the environment. certain of these laws and regulations impose strict, and under certain circumstances joint and several, liability on a current or previous owner or operator of property for the costs of remediating regulated materials on or emanating from its property. the costs of investigation, remediation or removal of those substances may be substantial.
an earthquake, flood, act of terrorism other natural disasters could adversely affect our business although we maintain insurance that is customary and appropriate for our business, each of our insurance policies is subject to certain exclusions. in addition, in some cases our property insurance coverage is combined among certain of our properties and silver legacy or is otherwise in an amount that may be significantly less than the expected replacement cost of rebuilding our facilities in the event of a total loss. such losses may occur as a result of any number of casualty events, including as a result
27
of earthquakes, floods, hurricanes or other severe weather conditions. in particular, the reno area has been, and may in the future be, subject to earthquakes and other natural disasters and eldorado shreveport is located in a designated flood zone. inadequate insurance or lack of available insurance for these and other certain types or levels of risk could expose us to significant losses in the event that a catastrophe occurred for which we are underinsured. in addition to the damage caused to our properties by a casualty loss, we may suffer business disruption as a result of the casualty event or be subject to claims by third parties that may be injured or harmed. while we carry general liability insurance and business interruption insurance, there can be no assurance that insurance will be available or adequate to cover all loss and damage to which our business or our assets might be subjected. in addition, certain casualty events, such as labor strikes, nuclear events, loss of income due to terrorism, deterioration or corrosion, insect or animal damage and pollution, may not be covered under our policies. any losses we incur that are not adequately covered by insurance may decrease our future operating income, require us to fund replacements or repairs for destroyed property and reduce the funds available for payments of our obligations.
eldorado reno and the silver legacy currently have combined insurance coverage for earthquake and flood damage and for any resulting business interruption and eldorado reno, silver legacy and eldorado shreveport have combined insurance coverage for acts of terrorism. under these policies, eldorado reno and the silver legacy have combined per occurrence earthquake coverage of $100 million and combined aggregate flood coverage of $250 million. eldorado reno, silver legacy and eldorado shreveport have combined terrorism coverage of $800 million. in the event that an earthquake, flood or terrorist act causes damage only to eldorado reno's property, eldorado reno is eligible to receive up to the full amount of insurance coverage for the applicable event of loss, depending on the replacement cost. however, in the event that eldorado reno and silver legacy are damaged in an earthquake, eldorado reno is only entitled to receive insurance proceeds only after silver legacy's claims have been satisfied. in addition, in the event that both eldorado reno and silver legacy are damaged in a flood or eldorado reno, eldorado shreveport and silver legacy are damaged as a result of a terrorist act, our properties are entitled to receive an allocated portion of the insurance proceeds and, to the extent that any insurance proceeds remain available after satisfaction of the insurance claims by the other properties, such remaining proceeds. as a result, there is no assurance that our insurance coverage will be sufficient if there is a major event of loss that impacts us and silver legacy, and, in particular, if there is an earthquake that causes significant damage. in addition, upon the expiration of our current policies which expire in august 2015 (subject to annual renewal), we cannot assure that adequate coverage will be available at economically justifiable rates, if at all.
because eldorado shreveport is located in a designated flood zone, it is subject to risks in addition to those risks associated with land-based casinos, including loss of service due to flood, hurricane or other severe weather conditions. we currently maintain flood insurance for eldorado shreveport and for the potential resulting business interruption. however, there is no assurance that this coverage will be sufficient if there is a major flood. reduced patronage, the loss of use of the casino, the inability to use a dockside facility or riverboat for any period of time due to flood, hurricane or other severe weather could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
we are subject to risks relating to mechanical failure all of our facilities will generally be subject to the risk that operations could be halted for a temporary or extended period of time, as the result of casualty, forces of nature, mechanical failure, or extended or extraordinary maintenance, among other causes. in addition, our gaming operations could be damaged or halted due to extreme weather conditions. these risks are particularly pronounced at eldorado shreveport's riverboat and dockside facilities because of their location on and adjacent to water.
28
we are or may become involved in legal proceedings that, if adversely adjudicated or settled, could impact our business and financial condition from time to time, we are named in lawsuits or other legal proceedings relating to our respective businesses. in particular, the nature of our business subjects us to the risk of lawsuits filed by customers, past and present employees, competitors, business partners and others in the ordinary course of business. as with all legal proceedings, no assurances can be given as to the outcome of these matters. moreover, legal proceedings can be expensive and time consuming, and we may not be successful in defending or prosecuting these lawsuits, which could result in settlements or damages that could significantly impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.
our information technology and other systems are subject to cyber security risk including misappropriation of customer information or other breaches of information security our operations require that we collect customer data, including credit card numbers and other personally identifiable information, for various business purposes, including marketing and promotional purposes. the collection and use of personal data are governed by privacy laws and regulations enacted in the united states and other jurisdictions around the world. privacy regulations continue to evolve and on occasion may be inconsistent from one jurisdiction to another. compliance with applicable privacy regulations may increase our operating costs and/or adversely impact our ability to market our products, properties and services to our customers. in addition, non-compliance with applicable privacy regulations by us (or in some circumstances non-compliance by third parties engaged by us) or a breach of security on systems storing our data, including due to cyber-attack, system failure, computer virus or unauthorized or fraudulent use by customers, employees or employees of third party vendors, may result in damage of reputation and/or subject us to fines, payment of damages, lawsuits or restrictions on our use or transfer of data.
operations of resorts and mtr gaming have historically been subject to seasonal variations and quarterly fluctuations in operating results, and we can expect to experience such variations and fluctuation in the future historically, the operations of resorts' and mtr gaming's gaming facilities have typically been subject to seasonal variations.
eldorado reno's strongest operating results have generally occurred in the second and third quarters and the weakest results have generally occurred during the period from november through february when weather conditions adversely affected operating results. in the reno market, excessive snowfall during the winter months can make travel to the reno area more difficult. this often results in significant declines in traffic on major highways, particularly on routes to and from northern california, and causes a decline in customer volume. furthermore, management believes that approximately two-thirds of visitors to the reno market arrive by some form of ground transportation.
in addition, winter conditions can frequently adversely affect transportation routes to mountaineer, presque isle downs and scioto downs and cause cancellations of live horse racing. as a result, unfavorable seasonal conditions could have a material adverse effect on our operations.
in general, it is unlikely that we will be able to obtain business interruption coverage for casualties resulting from severe weather, and there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain casualty insurance coverage at affordable rates, if at all, for casualties resulting from severe weather.
29
because we will be heavily dependent upon hotel/casino and related operations that are conducted in certain limited regions, we will be subject to greater risks than a company that is geographically or otherwise more diversified our business is heavily dependent upon hotel/casino and related operations that are conducted in three discrete markets. as a result, we are still subject to a greater degree of risk than a gaming company that has greater geographical diversity. the risks to which we have a greater degree of exposure include the following:
 local economic and competitive conditions;
 inaccessibility due to weather conditions, road construction or closure of primary access routes;
 changes in local and state governmental laws and regulations, including gaming laws and regulations;
 natural and other disasters, including earthquakes and flooding;
 a decline in the number of residents in or near, or visitors to, our operations; and
 a decrease in gaming activities at any of our facilities.
any of the factors outlined above could adversely affect our ability to generate sufficient cash flow to make payments on our outstanding indebtedness.
significant negative industry or economic trends, reduced estimates of future cash flows, disruptions to our business, slower growth rates or lack of growth in our business may cause us to incur impairments to indefinite lived intangible assets or long-lived assets we test indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment annually or if a triggering event occurs. we will also be required to consider whether the fair values of any of our investments accounted for under the equity method have declined below their carrying value whenever adverse events or changes in circumstances indicate that recorded values may not be recoverable. estimated fair value is determined using a discounted cash flow analysis based on estimated future results of the investee and market indicators of the terminal year capitalization rate. if any such declines are considered to be other than temporary, we will be required to record a write-down to estimated fair value. in 2011, resorts' impairment test in the silver legacy joint venture resulted in the recognition of a non-cash impairment charge of $33.1 million resulting in the elimination of resorts' remaining investment in the silver legacy joint venture at that time.
security concerns, terrorist attacks and other geopolitical events could have a material adverse effect on our future operations security concerns, terrorist attacks and other geopolitical events can have a material adverse effect on leisure and business travel, discretionary spending and other areas of economic behavior that directly impact the gaming and entertainment industries in general and our business in particular. we cannot predict the extent to which any future security alerts, terrorist attacks or other geopolitical events might impact our business, results of operations or financial condition.
item 7.    management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations.
general eldorado resorts, inc. ("eri" or the "company"), a nevada corporation, was formed in september 2014 to be the parent company following the merger of wholly owned subsidiaries of the company into eldorado holdco llc ("holdco"), a nevada limited liability company formed in 2009 that is the parent company of eldorado resorts llc ("resorts"), and mtr gaming group, inc. ("mtr gaming"), a delaware corporation incorporated in 1988 (the "merger"). effective upon the consummation of the merger on september 19, 2014 (the "merger date"), mtr gaming and holdco each became a wholly owned subsidiary of eri and, as a result of such transactions, resorts became an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of eri.
resorts owns and operates eldorado shreveport, a hotel and riverboat gaming complex that includes a 403-room, all suite, art deco-style hotel and a tri-level riverboat dockside casino situated on the red river in shreveport, louisiana ("eldorado shreveport") and the eldorado reno, a premier hotel, casino and entertainment facility in reno, nevada ("eldorado reno"). resorts owns the eldorado shreveport indirectly through two wholly owned subsidiaries which own 100% of the partnership interests in the eldorado shreveport joint venture, a louisiana general partnership ("louisiana partnership"). in addition, resorts owns a 48.1% interest in a joint venture ("silver legacy joint venture") which owns the silver legacy resort casino ("silver legacy"), a major, themed hotel/casino connected via a skywalk to the eldorado reno. resorts also previously owned a 21.3% interest in tamarack junction, a small casino in south reno. on september 1, 2014, and as a condition to closing the merger, resorts distributed to holdco, and holdco subsequently distributed to its members on a pro rata basis, all of resorts' interest in tamarack. the distribution resulted in no gain or loss being recognized in the accompanying consolidated financial statements because the distribution was in the amount of $5.5 million which was the book value of tamarack.
mtr gaming operates as a hospitality and gaming company with racetrack, gaming and hotel properties in west virginia, pennsylvania and ohio. mtr gaming, through its wholly owned subsidiaries, owns and operates mountaineer casino, racetrack & resort in chester, west virginia ("mountaineer"), presque isle downs & casino in erie, pennsylvania ("presque isle downs"), and scioto downs in columbus, ohio. scioto downs, through its subsidiary racelinebet, inc., also operates racelinebet.com, a national account wagering service that offers online and telephone wagering on horse races as a marketing affiliate of twinspires.com, an affiliate of churchill downs, inc.
eri, holdco and mtr gaming are collectively referred to as "we," "us," "our" or the "company." the merger closed on the merger date and has been accounted for as a reverse acquisition of mtr gaming by holdco under accounting principles generally accepted in the united states. as a result, holdco is considered the acquirer of mtr gaming for accounting purposes. the financial information included in this item 7 for periods prior to the merger date are those of resorts and its subsidiaries. the presentation of information herein for periods prior to the merger date and after the merger date are not fully comparable because the results of operations for mtr gaming are not included for periods prior to the merger date. summary financial results of mtr gaming for the years ended december 31, 2013 and 2012 are included in mtr gaming's annual report on form 10-k as filed with the securities and exchange commission ("sec").
management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations ("md&a") is intended to provide information to assist in better understanding and evaluating our financial condition and results of operations. we recommend that you read this md&a in conjunction with our audited consolidated financial statements and the notes to those statements included in this annual report.
37
significant factors impacting operating trends key performance metrics our operating results are highly dependent on the volume of customers visiting and staying at our properties. key performance metrics include volume indicators such as table games drop and slot handle, which refer to amounts wagered by our customers. the amount of volume we retain, which is not fully controllable by us, is recognized as casino revenues and is referred to as our win or hold. in addition, hotel occupancy and price per room designated by average daily rate ("adr") are key indicators for our hotel business. our calculation of adr consists of the average price of occupied rooms per day including the impact of complimentary rooms. complimentary room rates are determined based on an analysis of retail or cash rates for each customer segment and each type of room product to estimate complimentary rates which are consistent with retail rates. complimentary rates are reviewed at least annually and on an interim basis if there are significant changes in market conditions. complimentary rooms are treated as occupied rooms in our calculation of hotel occupancy.
economic impact the economic downturn and the uneven recovery from the downturn continue to adversely influence consumers' confidence, discretionary spending levels and travel patterns. high unemployment and the record number of home foreclosures experienced in the economic downturn, increased competition and volatility of the economy have had, and continue to have, a significant negative impact on the gaming and tourism industries, and, as a result, our operating performance over the past several years. in response to the impact of the economic down turn, increased competition and other market factors on our business, our management has implemented cost savings measures and will continue to review our operations to look for opportunities to further reduce expenses and maximize cash flows. while there has been some improvement in the economy, we believe the impact of the economic downturn and the continuing uneven recovery may continue to negatively affect our operating results for some period of time. we remain uncertain as to the duration and magnitude of the impact of such factors on our operations and the length and sustainability of the recovery from the economic downturn.
expansion of native american gaming and regional gaming our business has been adversely impacted by the expansion of native american gaming and the expansion of gaming in our markets, including ohio. future growth of native american and other gaming establishments, including the addition of hotel rooms and other amenities, would place additional competitive pressure on our operations. while we cannot predict the extent of any future impact, it could be significant.
eldorado reno.    a significant portion of our revenues and operating income are generated from patrons who are residents of northern california and northeastern texas, and as such, our operations have been adversely impacted by the growth in native american gaming in northern california and, to a lesser extent, in oklahoma.
many existing native american gaming facilities in northern california are modest compared to eldorado reno. however, a number of native american tribes have established large-scale gaming facilities in california and some native american tribes have announced that they are in the process of expanding, developing, or are considering establishing, large-scale hotel and gaming facilities in northern california. as northern california native american gaming operations have expanded, we believe the increasing competition generated by these gaming operations has had a negative impact, principally on drive-in, day-trip visitor traffic from our main feeder markets in northern california.
38
under their current compacts, most native american tribes in california may operate up to 2,000 slot machines and up to two gaming facilities on any one reservation. however, under action taken by the national indian gaming commission, gaming devices similar in appearance to slot machines, but which are deemed to be technological enhancements to bingo style gaming, are not subject to such limits and may be used by tribes without state permission. the number of slot machines the tribes may be allowed to operate could increase as a result of any new or amended compacts the tribes may enter into with the state of california that receive the requisite approvals. such increases have occurred with respect to a number of new or amended compacts which have been executed and approved.
eldorado shreveport.    casino gaming is currently prohibited in several jurisdictions from which the shreveport/bossier city market draws customers, primarily texas. although casino gaming is currently not permitted in texas, the texas legislature has from time to time considered proposals to authorize casino gaming and there can be no assurance that casino gaming will not be approved in texas in the future, which would have a material adverse effect on our business. eldorado shreveport competes with several native american casinos located in oklahoma, certain of which are located near our core texas markets. because we draw a significant amount of our customers from the dallas/fort worth area, but are located approximately 190 miles from that area, we believe we will continue to face increased competition from gaming operations in oklahoma, including the winstar and choctaw casinos, and would face significant competition that may have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations if casino gaming is approved in texas. in june 2013, construction was completed on a new 30,000 square foot casino and 400-room hotel in bossier city across the red river from eldorado shreveport. the facility, which also includes several restaurants and a 1,000-seat entertainment arena, received final approval from the louisiana gaming control board and opened on june 15, 2013. in december 2014, a new luxury, land-based casino with 1,600 slot machines, 72 gaming tables, a poker room, and a 740-room hotel with a ballroom and spa, opened in lake charles, louisiana approximately 200 miles south of eldorado shreveport, but closer to the houston, texas market. in addition, a new 320,000 square foot gaming facility located in sonoma county, california opened on november 5, 2013.
mtr gaming.    all of mtr gaming's properties experience varying competitive pressures, from casinos in western pennsylvania, western new york, northern west virginia and eastern ohio. we believe the expansion of gaming in ohio, which includes casinos that opened in cleveland in may 2012 and columbus in october 2012 and additional casinos in cincinnati and toledo, as well as the installation of vlts at existing horse race tracks near cleveland, one of which opened in april 2013 and the other in december 2013 and the relocation of a racetrack to austintown, ohio in 2014, has had and will continue to have a negative impact on our results of operations at all our properties and such impact may be material. we intend to be proactive in our efforts to mitigate the effects of such competition, which include expanding marketing initiatives and proactively managing our cost structures at our properties.
major bowling tournaments in the reno market the national bowling stadium, located one block from eldorado reno, is one of the largest bowling complexes in north america and has been selected to host multi-month tournaments in reno every year through 2018 except for 2017. it has also been selected to host ten united states bowling congress ("usbc") tournaments from 2019 through 2026. during this period, two of the ten usbc tournaments may be held in the same year. through a one-time agreement, the national bowling stadium hosted the usbc open tournament in reno in 2014; usually an off-year for reno. historically, these multi-month bowling tournaments have attracted a significant number of visitors to the reno market and have benefited business in the downtown area, including eldorado reno. the usbc tournaments brought approximately 73,000 bowlers to the reno area during the 2013 tournament period which began on march 1st and continued through july 7th. both tournaments
39
returned to reno in 2014 and brought approximately 62,000 bowlers to the reno area during the 2014 tournament period which began on february 28th and continued through july 12th.
west virginia smoking ban on august 26, 2014, the board of health of hancock county, west virginia adopted and approved the clean air regulation act of 2014 ("regulation"), which will be effective july 1, 2015. the regulation, as currently adopted, will ban smoking in public places in hancock county including at mountaineer. we are continuing to evaluate the regulation, its impact on our mountaineer facility, and steps to become compliant with the regulation upon its effective date. we expect that the regulation will have a negative impact on our business and results of operations at mountaineer, and such impact may be material.
summary financial results year ended december 31, 2014 compared to the year ended december 31, 2013
the following table highlights the results of our operations (dollars in thousands):

net operating revenues                          $361,823                   $247,186           46.4   %

net operating revenues.    mtr gaming contributed $124.2 million of net operating revenues for the period from the merger date through december 31, 2014 consisting primarily of casino revenues. including the incremental mtr gaming revenues, net operating revenues increased 46.4% for the year ended december 31, 2014 compared to the prior year.
excluding incremental mtr gaming revenues of $124.2 million, consolidated net operating revenues decreased 3.9% for the year ended december 31, 2014 compared to the prior year as both eldorado reno and eldorado shreveport experienced declines in all components of operating revenues.
equity in income of unconsolidated affiliates.    income from our unconsolidated affiliate, the silver legacy joint venture and our former unconsolidated affiliate, tamarack, decreased $ 0.7 million for the year ended december 31, 2014 compared to the prior year. our equity in the income of the silver legacy joint venture for the years ended december 31, 2014 and 2013 amounted to $2.0 million and $2.3 million, respectively. equity in the income of tamarack for the year ended december 31, 2014, prior to its disposition on september 1, 2014, amounted to $0.7 million compared to $1.1 million for the year ended december 31, 2013.
operating income and net (loss) income.    consolidated operating income and net (loss) income includes operating income and a net loss of $17.6 million and $14.3. million, respectively, attributable to mtr gaming for the period from the merger date through december 31, 2014.
for the year ended december 31, 2014 compared to the prior year, operating income, excluding operating income attributable to mtr gaming, decreased $12.0 million primarily due to declines in departmental operating margins, increased general and administrative payroll and professional services associated with the merger, and a decline in equity income of unconsolidated affiliates. operating income was also impacted by an increase in acquisition charges of $3.2 million during the year ended december 31, 2014 compared to the prior year. net (loss) income decreased $24.1 million during the
40
year ended december 31, 2014 compared to the prior year due to the same factors negatively impacting operating income, combined with the absence of a $12.0 million gain in 2013 for the extinguishment of debt of silver legacy and a tax provision of $1.1 million. this decrease during the year ended december 31, 2014 compared to 2013 was partially offset by a $0.7 million gain resulting from the termination of silver legacy's supplemental executive retirement plan and a $0.2 million decrease in interest expense.

casino revenues.    mtr gaming contributed $113.6 million of casino revenues for the period from the merger date through december 31, 2014 consisting primarily of net win from slot operations, table games and poker. as a result, consolidated casino revenues increased 55.3% for the year ended december 31, 2014 compared to the prior year.
consolidated casino revenues, excluding mtr gaming revenues, decreased 4.0% for the year ended december 31, 2014 compared to the prior year. the decrease in casino revenues at eldorado reno of 1.7% was primarily due to decreases in slot handle and table games credit drop. casino
41
revenues decreased 4.8% at eldorado shreveport for the year ended december 31, 2014 compared to the prior year due to lower slot handle while the slot hold percentage remained constant. the decrease in casino revenues associated with the decline in slot volume was partially offset by an increase in table games revenues resulting from an increase in the table games hold percentage, which more than offset a decrease in table games drop for the year ended december 31, 2014 compared to the prior year. the results of operations of eldorado shreveport have also been negatively impacted by the addition of a new competitor in the shreveport/bossier city market in june of 2013 that reduced the market share of all of the other casino operators in the market for the year ended december 31, 2014, including eldorado shreveport.

net operating revenues.    net operating revenues decreased 3.0% for the year ended december 31, 2013 compared to the prior year primarily as a result of decreases in casino revenues and increases in promotional activities at both eldorado shreveport and eldorado reno. in addition, decreases in hotel and other revenues at eldorado shreveport were only partially offset by increases in food and beverage revenues at both facilities and in hotel and other revenues at eldorado reno. as more fully explained below, the decrease in casino revenues at eldorado reno resulted primarily from a decrease in the
45
table games hold percentage. the decrease in casino revenues at eldorado shreveport primarily reflects reductions in slot machine wagering in 2013 compared to the prior year.
operating expenses.    operating expenses decreased 2.3% for the year ended december 31, 2013 compared to the prior year primarily as a result of decreases in casino expenses reflecting the decline in the associated revenues at both eldorado shreveport and eldorado reno. also contributing to the decrease were reductions in selling, general and administrative expenses and depreciation and amortization.

operating income and net income (loss).    during 2013, we experienced an increase in operating income of $6.7 million compared to the prior year due primarily to the $12.3 million improvement in our equity in income of unconsolidated affiliates. operating margins decreased during 2013 as consolidated net operating revenues decreased approximately $2.4 million more than the decrease in consolidated operating expenses. also offsetting the improvement from our unconsolidated affiliates were $3.2 million of acquisition charges incurred during 2013 in connection with the merger. net income increased approximately $19.9 million during 2013 compared to the prior year due to the factors positively impacting operating income previously noted combined with the recognition in 2013 of $12.0 million of gain on the extinguishment of debt of the silver legacy as a result of its reorganization, the absence of an $0.8 million loss on property donation incurred in the 2012 period and a $0.4 million reduction in interest expense.

supplemental unaudited presentation of consolidated adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization ("ebitda") for the years ended december 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012
adjusted ebitda (defined below), a non gaap financial measure, has been presented as a supplemental disclosure because it is a widely used measure of performance and basis for valuation of companies in our industry and we believe that this non gaap supplemental information will be helpful in understanding the company's ongoing operating results. adjusted ebitda represents (losses) earnings before interest expense (income), income tax expense (benefit), depreciation and amortization, (loss) gain on the sale or disposal of property, loss on property donation, other regulatory gaming assessment costs, loss on asset impairment, project opening costs, acquisition/strategic transaction costs, loss (gain) on modification, early retirement or extinguishment of debt and equity in (income) loss of unconsolidated affiliate, to the extent that such items existed in the periods presented. adjusted ebitda is not a measure of performance or liquidity calculated in accordance with u.s. gaap, is unaudited and should not be considered an alternative to, or more meaningful than, net income (loss) as an indicator of our operating performance. uses of cash flows that are not reflected in adjusted ebitda include capital expenditures, interest payments, income taxes, debt principal repayments and certain regulatory gaming assessments, which can be significant. as a result, adjusted ebitda should not be considered as a measure of our liquidity. other companies that provide ebitda information may calculate ebitda differently than we do. the definition of adjusted ebitda may not be the same as the definitions used in any of our debt agreements.

the combined basis reflects operations of mtr gaming for periods prior to the merger combined with the operations of resorts. such presentation does not conform with u.s. gaap or the sec's rules for pro forma presentation; however, we have included the combined information because we believe it provides a meaningful comparison for the periods presented.
liquidity and capital resources the primary sources of liquidity and capital resources have been existing cash, cash flow from operations and proceeds from the issuance of debt securities.
we expect that our primary capital requirements going forward will relate to the operation and maintenance of our properties and servicing our outstanding indebtedness. in 2015, we plan to spend approximately $29.2 million, net of reimbursements from west virginia on qualified capital expenditures and approximately $79.0 million to pay interest on the resorts senior secured notes and mtr second lien notes. we expect that cash generated from operations will be sufficient to fund our operations and capital requirements and service our outstanding indebtedness for the foreseeable future; however, we cannot provide assurance that operating cash flows will be sufficient to do so and we cannot be sure that we will be able to refinance our outstanding debt prior to its maturity in 2019 on terms that we find acceptable, or at all.
at december 31, 2014, we had consolidated cash and cash equivalents of $87.6 million, $60.7 million of which was held by mtr gaming and $27.0 million of which was held by resorts.

eri is a holding company and its only significant assets are ownership interests in its subsidiaries, mtr gaming and holdco. eri's ability to fund its obligations depends on the cash flow of its subsidiaries and the ability of its subsidiaries to distribute or otherwise make funds available to eri. the agreements governing the indebtedness of mtr gaming limit mtr gaming's ability to distribute or otherwise make funds available to eri or holdco and its subsidiaries, including resorts, and the agreements governing indebtedness of resorts limit resorts' ability to distribute or otherwise make funds available to eri or mtr gaming and its subsidiaries. the ability of mtr gaming and resorts to make funds available to eri and each other will also depend on, among other things, their earnings, business and tax considerations and applicable law, including regulations of gaming and racing authorities and state laws regulating the payment of dividends and distributions. such limitations could adversely impact the liquidity of eri, mtr gaming, holdco and their respective subsidiaries.
operating cash flow.    for the year ended december 31, 2014, we generated cash flows from operating activities of $33.9 million as compared to $23.6 million in the prior year. the increase in operating cash was primarily due to various changes in balance sheet accounts in conjunction with the merger along with changes in the balance sheet accounts in the normal course of business. these changes were offset by the decline in net income, including the absence of silver legacy's gain on the early retirement of its debt for the year ended december 31, 2014 compared to the prior year.
investing cash flow.    net cash flows provided in investing activities totaled $38.1 million for the year ended december 31, 2014 compared to $7.6 million used for the year ended december 31, 2013. net cash flows provided in investing activities for 2014 primarily consisted of $53.1 million representing acquired cash, including restricted cash, associated with the merger. this increase was partially offset by $10.6 million in capital expenditures for various renovation projects and equipment purchases.
financing cash flow.    net cash flows used in financing activities for the year ended december 31, 2014 totaled $14.2 million compared to $11.5 million during the year ended december 31, 2013. net repayments on our resorts secured credit facility (see below) amounted to $2.5 million compared to $5.0 million of debt payments during the year ended december 31, 2013. other financing activity expenditures included distributions to our members totaling $0.6 million compared to $6.1 million during the prior year. during the year ended december 31, 2014, an increase in restricted cash of $3.2 million due to a decrease in funds related to horsemen's fines and simulcasting funds that are restricted to payments for improving horsemen's facilities and racing purses at scioto downs was offset by a decrease in restricted cash related to the return of $2.5 million of the $5.0 million cash collateral that resorts previously provided as credit support for silver legacy's obligations under its credit agreement.
the repurchase of mtr gaming common stock totaled $5.0 million and represented the amount paid in cash by holdco upon closing of the merger. an additional $30.0 million of mtr gaming common stock was purchased by mtr gaming upon closing of the merger and was reflected as a reduction of the net cash acquired under investing activities. also during the year ended december 31, 2014, mtr gaming used $11.0 million to repurchase $10.0 million in aggregate principal amount of mtr senior lien notes at a price of $110.25 per $100 in principal amount of the purchased notes.
capital expenditures during the year ended december 31, 2014, additions to property and equipment, primarily slot machines, and other capital projects aggregated $10.6 million, which included $3.5 million at eldorado reno, $3.3 million at eldorado shreveport and $3.8 million at the mtr gaming properties.

having a useful life of more than three years and placed into service after july 1, 2011. qualifying capital expenditures include the purchase of slot machines and related equipment to the extent such slot machines are retained by mountaineer at its west virginia location for not less than five years. any unexpended balance from a given fiscal year will be available for one additional fiscal year, after which time the remaining unused balance carried forward will be forfeited. for the period from the merger date to december 31, 2014, mountaineer was reimbursed $1.4 million on qualified capital expenditures. as of december 31, 2014, mountaineer remains eligible for approximately $5.8 million under annual modernization fund grants that expire in varying dates through june 30, 2016. we can make no assurances we will be able to make qualifying capital expenditures purchases sufficient to receive reimbursement of the available funds prior to their expiration.
we anticipate spending up to a total of approximately $32.7 million, or $29.2 after anticipated reimbursements from west virginia on qualified capital expenditures of $3.5 million, on capital expenditures during 2015. gross expenditures for 2015 are expected to include $12.1 million for facility improvements, information technology upgrades and related equipment; $7.7 million for development at scioto downs, including a new brew brothers branded restaurant and bar; $1.6 million for a hotel room remodel project at eldorado reno; $5.5 million for slot machines; $2.3 million on the racing related capital expenditures; and $3.5 million for other equipment and capital expenditures.
silver legacy joint venture loan under the plan of reorganization, each of eldorado limited liability company ("ellc") and galleon retained its 50% interest in the silver legacy, but was required to advance $7.5 million to the silver legacy pursuant to a subordinated loan and provide credit support by depositing $5.0 million of cash into bank accounts that are subject to a security interest in favor of the lender under the silver legacy credit agreement. the $7.5 million note receivable from ellc to the silver legacy was issued on november 16, 2012 with a stated interest rate of 5% per annum and a maturity date of may 16, 2018. payment of any interest or principal under the loan is subordinate to the senior indebtedness of the silver legacy. accrued interest under the loan will be added to the principal amount of the loan and may not be paid unless principal of the loan may be paid in compliance with the terms of the senior indebtedness outstanding or at maturity. in december 2014, silver legacy deposited $5.0 million of cash into a cash collateral account securing its obligations under its credit agreement, which reduced the credit support obligation of each of ellc and galleon to $2.5 million each and resulted in the return of $2.5 million of the $5.0 million of cash collateral that resorts previously provided as credit support for silver legacy's obligations under its credit agreement.
debt obligations resorts' debt obligations on june 1, 2011, resorts issued $180 million of 8.625% resorts senior secured notes due june 15, 2019 (the "resorts senior secured notes"). interest on the resorts senior secured notes is payable semiannually each june 15th and december 15th to holders of record on the preceding june 1st or december 1st, respectively.
the indenture relating to the resorts senior secured notes contains various restrictive covenants including, restricted payments and investments, additional liens, transactions with affiliates, covenants imposing limitations on additional debt, dispositions of property, mergers and similar transactions. as of december 31, 2014, we were in compliance with all of the covenants under the indenture relating to the resorts senior secured notes.
the resorts senior secured notes are unconditionally guaranteed, jointly and severally, by all of resorts' current and future domestic restricted subsidiaries other than eldorado capital corp., an entity that was formed for the exclusive purpose of acting as co-issuer of debt issued by resorts
54
(collectively, the "guarantors"). the silver legacy joint venture is not a subsidiary and did not guarantee the resorts senior secured notes. the resorts senior secured notes are secured by a first priority security interest on substantially all of resorts' current and future assets (other than certain excluded assets, including gaming licenses and resorts' interest in the silver legacy joint venture). in addition, all of the membership interests in resorts and equity interests in the guarantors are subject to a pledge for the benefit of the holders of the resorts senior secured notes.
the company may redeem some or all of the resorts senior secured notes prior to june 15, 2015 at a redemption price of 100% of the principal amount thereof plus a "make whole premium" together with accrued and unpaid interest thereon. on or after june 15, 2015, resorts may redeem the resorts senior secured notes at the following redemption prices (expressed as a percentage of principal amount) plus any accrued and unpaid interest thereon:

2015     104.313   %
2016     102.156   %
2017 and thereafter     100.000   %
on june 1, 2011, resorts entered into a $30 million senior secured revolving credit facility (the "resorts secured credit facility") available until may 30, 2014 consisting of a $15 million term loan and a $15 million revolving credit facility. the term loan was repaid during the second quarter of 2014. at december 31, 2013, the outstanding principal amount under the term loan was $2.5 million. resorts did not renew the resorts secured credit facility when it matured on may 30, 2014.
mtr gaming's debt obligations mtr second lien notes.    on august 1, 2011, mtr gaming completed the offering of $565.0 in aggregate principal amount of senior secured second lien notes (the "mtr second lien notes") due august 1, 2019 at an issue price equal to 97% of the aggregate principal amount of the mtr second lien notes. the mtr second lien notes mature on august 1, 2019, with interest payable semi-annually in arrears on february 1 and august 1 of each year.
the mtr second lien notes and the guarantees are senior secured obligations and are jointly and severally, fully, and unconditionally guaranteed by mtr gaming's current and future domestic restricted subsidiaries, other than mtr gaming's immaterial subsidiaries. the mtr second lien notes are secured by a second priority lien on substantially all of the assets of mtr gaming and the guarantors, other than excluded property, as defined in the senior secured second lien indenture. the mtr second lien notes and the guarantees are effectively junior to any of mtr gaming's and the guarantors' existing and future debt that is secured by senior or prior liens on the collateral to the extent of the value of the collateral securing such obligations.
the indenture governing the mtr second lien notes contains a number of customary covenants, including limitations on restricted payments and investments, additional liens, transactions with affiliates, additional debt, dispositions of property, mergers and similar transactions, and events of default. in addition, if the consolidated total debt ratio of mtr gaming is equal to or greater than 4.0 to 1.0 and such offer is permitted pursuant to the terms of mtr gaming's credit facilities, mtr gaming is required to repay debt under its credit facility or make an offer to purchase mtr second lien notes with the excess cash flow amounts (as such term is defined in the indenture governing the mtr second lien notes). as of december 31, 2014, mtr gaming was in compliance with the covenants under the indenture relating to the mtr second lien notes.
mtr gaming may redeem some or all of the mtr second lien notes prior to august 1, 2015 at a redemption price of 100% of the principal amount thereof plus a "make whole premium" together with accrued and unpaid interest thereon. on or after august 1, 2015, mtr gaming may redeem the
55
mtr second lien notes at the following redemption prices (expressed as a percentage of principal amount) plus any accrued and unpaid interest thereon:

2015      106.00   %
2016      103.00   %
2017 and thereafter      100.00   %
in october 2014, mtr gaming repurchased $10 million in aggregate principal amount of its 11.25% mtr second lien notes, at a price of $110.25 per $100 in principal amount of the purchased notes. the repurchase resulted in a $1.2 million annual savings in interest expense. after giving effect to the repurchase of the bonds in october 2014, the annual interest expense on the mtr second lien notes approximates $64.5 million. additionally, annual amortization of the premium on the mtr second lien notes is approximately $10.9 million.
credit facility.    on august 1, 2011, mtr gaming entered into a senior secured revolving credit facility (the "mtr credit facility") with a borrowing availability of $20.0 million and a maturity date of august 1, 2016. on december 5, 2014, mtr gaming terminated the mtr credit facility. there were no borrowings outstanding under the credit facility at the time of its termination. mtr gaming terminated the credit facility because it determined that it had sufficient capital resources to meet its expected liquidity needs without incurring borrowings under the credit facility. mtr gaming did not incur any fees or penalties in connection with the termination of the credit facility.
contractual commitments the following table summarizes our estimated contractual payment obligations as of december 31, 2014 (in thousands):

these amounts are included in our consolidated balance sheets, which are included elsewhere in this report. see note 9 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information about our debt and related matters.
(2)
our operating lease obligations are described in note 15 to our consolidated financial statements.
(3)
includes an annual table gaming license fee of $2.5 million for mountaineer which is due on july 1st of each year as long as mountaineer operates table games. includes our obligation for gaming taxes at presque isle downs, which is set at a minimum of $10.0 million per year, as required by the pennsylvania gaming control board. also includes our obligation at presque isle downs, as the holder of a category 1 license, to create a fund to be used for the improvement and
56
maintenance of the backside area of the racetrack with an amount of not less than $250,000 or more than $1 million annually for a five-year period beginning in 2017.
(4)
pursuant to an agreement with the mountaineer park horsemen's benevolent and protective association, inc. and/or in accordance with the west virginia racing statute, mountaineer is required to utilize its best efforts to conduct racing for a minimum of 210 days and pay average daily minimum purses established by mountaineer prior to the first live racing date each year ($95,000 for 2015) for the term of the agreement which expires on december 31, 2015.
(5)
in connection with the 2003 purchase of scioto downs, certain shareholders of scioto downs elected the option to receive cash and contingent earn-out payments ("cep rights") in lieu of all cash for their outstanding shares of scioto downs' common stock. the triggering event occurred when scioto downs received its permanent vlt license in may 2012 and commenced gaming operations. as a result, we recorded a liability for the estimated ten year payout to the stockholders who elected to receive the cep rights. the future obligation was calculated based on scioto downs' projected ebitda for the ten calendar years beginning january 1, 2013.
(6)
these amounts are included in our consolidated balance sheets, which are included elsewhere in this report. see note 15 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding our regulatory gaming assessments.
the table above excludes certain commitments as of december 31, 2014, for which the timing of expenditures associated with such commitments is unknown, or contractual agreements have not been executed, or the guaranteed maximum price for such contractual agreements has not been agreed upon.
the repayment of our long-term debt, which consists of indebtedness evidenced by the resorts senior secured notes and the mtr second lien notes, is subject to acceleration upon the occurrence of an event of default under the indentures governing these obligations.
we routinely enter into operational contracts in the ordinary course of our business, including construction contracts for minor projects that are not material to our business or financial condition as a whole. our commitments relating to these contracts are recognized as liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets when services are provided with respect to such contracts.
the company does not currently have any off-balance sheet arrangements.
inflation we do not believe that inflation has had a significant impact on our revenues, results of operations or cash flows since inception.
other liquidity matters the pennsylvania gaming control board (the "pgcb"), the pennsylvania department of revenue and the pennsylvania state police (collectively "the borrowers"), were required to fund the costs they incurred in connection with the initial development of the infrastructure to support gaming operations in pennsylvania as well as the initial ongoing costs of the borrowers. the initial funding of these costs was provided from a loan from the pennsylvania general fund in the amount of approximately $36.1 million, and further funding was provided from additional loans from the pennsylvania property tax reserve fund in the aggregate amount of approximately $63.8 million.
57
the pennsylvania department of revenue will assess all licensees, including presque isle downs, their proportionate share of amounts represented by the borrowings, which are in the aggregate amount of $99.9 million, once the designated number of pennsylvania's slot machine licensees is operational. on july 11, 2011, the pgcb issued an administrative order which established that payments associated with the $63.8 million that was borrowed from the property tax reserve fund would commence on january 1, 2012. the repayment allocation between all current licensees is based upon equal weighting of (i) cumulative gross slot revenue since inception in relation to the combined cumulative gross slot revenue for all licensees and (ii) single year gross slot revenue (during the state's fiscal year ending june 30) in relation to the combined single year gross slot revenue for all licensees; and amounts paid each year will be adjusted annually based upon changes in the licensee's proportionate share of gross slot revenue. we have estimated that our total proportionate share of the aggregate $63.8 million to be assessed to the gaming facilities will be approximately $4.2 million and will be paid quarterly over a ten-year period, which began effective january 1, 2012. for the $36.1 million that was borrowed from the general fund, payment is scheduled to begin after all fourteen licensees are operational. although we cannot determine when payment will begin, we have considered a similar repayment model for the general fund borrowings and estimated that our total proportionate share of the aggregate $36.1 million to all fourteen gaming facilities will be approximately $2.2 million.
the recorded estimate is subject to revision based upon future changes in the revenue assumptions utilized to develop the estimate. our estimated total obligation at december 31, 2014 is $5.0 million. the company paid approximately $0.4 million during the year ended december 31, 2014.
we are faced with certain contingencies involving litigation and environmental remediation and compliance. these commitments and contingencies are discussed in greater detail in "part i, item 3. legal proceedings" and note 15 to our consolidated financial statements, both of which are included elsewhere in this report. in addition, new competition may have a material adverse effect on our revenues, and could have a similar adverse effect on our liquidity. see "part i, item 1a. risk factorsrisks related to our business" which is included elsewhere in this report.
critical accounting policies our significant accounting policies are included in note 2 to our consolidated financial statements, which is included elsewhere in this report. these policies, along with the underlying assumptions and judgments made by our management in their application, have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements. these judgments are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty and actual results could differ from our estimates.
business combinations the company applied the provisions of accounting standards codification ("asc") topic 805, "business combinations", in the accounting for the merger. it required us to recognize the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed at their acquisition date fair values. goodwill as of the acquisition date was measured as the excess of consideration transferred over the net of the acquisition date fair values of the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed. while we used our best estimates and assumptions to accurately value assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date, our estimates were inherently uncertain and subject to refinement. as a result, during the measurement period, which may be up to one year from the acquisition date, we may record adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed with the corresponding offset to goodwill. upon the final determination of the values of assets acquired or liabilities assumed any subsequent adjustments will be recorded in our consolidated statements of operations.
58
accounting for business combinations required our management to make significant estimates and assumptions, including our estimate of intangible assets, such as gaming licenses, trade names and customer loyalty programs. although we believe the assumptions and estimates made have been reasonable and appropriate, they are inherently uncertain. for our gaming license valuation, our properties estimated future cash flows were the primary assumption in the respective intangible valuations. cash flow estimates included assumptions regarding factors such as recent and budgeted operating performance, net win per unit (revenue), patron visits and growth percentages. the growth percentages were developed considering general macroeconomic conditions as well as competitive impacts from current and anticipated competition through a review of customer market data, operating margins, and current regulatory, social and economic climates. the most significant of the assumptions used in the valuations included: (1) revenue growth/decline percentages; (2) discount rates; (3) effective income tax rates; (4) future terminal values and (5) capital expenditure assumptions. these assumptions were developed for each of our properties based on historical trends in the current competitive markets in which they operate, and projections of future performance and competition. the primary assumptions with respect to our trade names and customer loyalty program intangibles primary assumptions were selecting the appropriate royalty rates and cost estimates for replacement cost analyses in addition, uncertain tax positions and tax related valuation allowances assumed in connection with a business combination are initially estimated as of the acquisition date. the company will reevaluate these items quarterly based upon facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date with any adjustments to our preliminary estimates being recorded to goodwill if identified within the measurement period. subsequent to the measurement period or our final determination of the tax allowance's or contingency's estimated value, whichever comes first, changes to these uncertain tax positions and tax related valuation allowances will affect our provision for income taxes in our consolidated statement of operations and could have material impact on our results of operations and financial position.
accounting for unconsolidated affiliates the consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the company and its subsidiaries. investments in unconsolidated affiliates which are 50% or less owned and do not meet the consolidation criteria of asc 810, "consolidation" are accounted for under the equity method. all intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. certain amendments of asc 810 became effective for us beginning january 1, 2010. such amendments include changes to the quantitative approach to determine the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity ("vie"). an enterprise must determine if its variable interest or interests give it a controlling financial interest in a vie by evaluating whether 1) the enterprise has the power to direct activities of the vie that have a significant effect on economic performance, and 2) the enterprise has an obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits from the entity that could potentially be significant to the vie. the amendments to asc 810 also require ongoing reassessments of whether an enterprise is the primary beneficiary of a vie. the company believes the adoption of these amendments did not have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements.
the company considers whether the fair values of any of its equity method investments have declined below their carrying value whenever adverse events or changes in circumstances indicate that recorded values may not be recoverable. if the company considers any such decline to be other than temporary, then a write-down would be recorded to the estimated fair value. estimated fair value is determined using a discounted cash flow analysis based on estimated future results of the investee and market indicators of terminal year capitalization rate. there were no impairments of the company's equity method investments in 2014, 2013 or 2012.
59
revenue recognition gaming revenues consist of the net win from gaming activities, which is the difference between amounts wagered and amounts paid to winning patrons, and is recognized at the time wagers are made net of winning payouts to patrons. base and progressive jackpots are accrued and charged to revenue at the time the obligation to pay the jackpot is established. pari-mutuel commissions consist of commissions earned from thoroughbred and harness racing, and importing of simulcast signals from other race tracks. pari-mutuel commissions are recognized at the time wagers are made. such commissions are a designated portion of the wagering handle as determined by state racing commissions, and are shown net of the taxes assessed by state and local agencies, as well as purses and other contractual amounts paid to horsemen associations. we recognize revenues from fees earned through the exporting of simulcast signals to other race tracks at the time wagers are made. such fees are based upon a predetermined percentage of handle as contracted with the other race tracks. revenues from food and beverage are recognized at the time of sale and revenues from lodging are recognized on the date of stay. other revenues are recorded at the time services are rendered or merchandise sold. we offer certain promotional allowances to our customers, including complimentary lodging, food and beverage, and promotional credits for free play on slot machines. the retail value of these promotional items is shown as a reduction in total revenues on our consolidated statements of operations.
income taxes the company and its subsidiaries file us federal income tax returns and various state and local income tax returns. the company does not have tax sharing agreements with the other members within the consolidated eri group. with few exceptions, the company is no longer subject to us federal or state and local tax examinations by tax authorities for years before 2011.
the company estimates an annual effective income tax rate based on projected results for the year and applies this rate to income before taxes to calculate income tax expense. any refinements made due to subsequent information that affects the estimated annual effective income tax rate are reflected as adjustments in the current period. the income tax provision results in an effective tax rate that has an unusual relationship to the company's pretax income (loss). this is due to the federal and state valuation allowances on the company's deferred tax assets as discussed below.
the difference between the effective rate and the statutory rate is attributed primarily to the federal and state valuation allowances on the company's deferred tax assets as discussed below. as a result of the company's net operating losses and net deferred tax asset position (after exclusion of certain deferred tax liabilities that generally cannot be offset against deferred tax assets, known as "naked credits"), the company expects to continue to provide for a full valuation allowance against substantially all of the net federal and the net state deferred tax assets.
for income tax purposes the company amortizes or depreciates certain assets that have been assigned an indefinite life for book purposes. the incremental amortization or depreciation deductions for income tax purposes result in an increase in certain deferred tax liabilities that cannot be used as a source of future taxable income for purposes of measuring the company's need for a valuation allowance against the net deferred tax assets. therefore, the company expects to record non-cash deferred tax expense as the company amortizes these assets for tax purposes.
prior to the merger date, holdco was taxed as a partnership under the internal revenue code pursuant to which income taxes were primarily the responsibility of the partners. eri is a c corporation subject to the federal and state corporate-level income taxes at prevailing corporate tax rates. while taxed as a partnership, holdco was not subject to federal income tax liability. because holders of membership interests in holdco were required to include their respective shares of holdco's taxable income (including that of resorts) in their individual income tax returns, distributions
60
were made to their respective member(s) to cover such tax liabilities. such distributions were subject to limitation in accordance with the provisions of their respective operating agreements. eldorado shreveport #2, llc has elected as a single member limited liability company to be taxed as a c corporation. current and deferred income taxes associated with eldorado shreveport #2, llc were not material.
under the applicable accounting standards, we may recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more-likely-than-not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the position. the tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position should be measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement. the accounting standards also provide guidance on de-recognition, classification, interest and penalties on income taxes, accounting in interim periods and disclosure requirements for uncertain tax positions. we have recorded no liability associated with uncertain tax positions at december 31, 2014 and 2013.
property and equipment and other long-lived assets property and equipment is recorded at cost, except for mtr which was adjusted for fair value under asc 805, and is depreciated over its estimated useful life or lease term. judgments are made in determining estimated useful lives and salvage values of these assets. the accuracy of these estimates affects the amount of depreciation expense recognized in our financial results and whether we have a gain or loss on the disposal of assets. we review depreciation estimates and methods as new events occur, more experience is acquired, and additional information is obtained that would possibly change our current estimates.
property, equipment and other long-lived assets are assessed for impairment in accordance with asc 360property,  plant, and equipment. the company evaluates its long-lived assets periodically for impairment issues or, more frequently, whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. recoverability of these assets is determined by comparing the net carrying value to the sum of the estimated future net undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by these assets. the amount of impairment loss, if any, is measured by the difference between the net carrying value and the estimated fair value of the asset which is typically measured using a discounted cash flow model (level 3 of the fair value hierarchy). for assets to be disposed of, impairment is recognized based on the lower of carrying value or fair value less costs of disposal, as estimated based on comparable asset sales, offers received, or a discounted cash flow model. based on the results of our periodic reviews we have not recorded any impairment losses during the years ended december 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012.
for undeveloped properties, including non-operating real properties, when indicators of impairment are present, properties are evaluated for impairment and losses are recorded when undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by an asset or market comparisons are less than the asset's carrying amount. the amount of the impairment loss is calculated as the excess of the asset's carrying value over its fair value, which is determined using a discounted cash flow analysis, management estimates or market comparisons. the fair value measurements employed for our impairment evaluations, which are subject to the assumptions and factors as previously discussed, were generally based on a review of comparable activities in the marketplace, which falls within level 3 of the fair value hierarchy.
goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price paid over the fair value of the net assets of the acquired business. intangible assets acquired in business combinations are recorded based upon their fair value at the date of acquisition. goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets are
61
reviewed for impairment annually, during the fourth quarter, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that an asset might be impaired.
goodwill is tested by comparing the carrying value of the reporting unit to its fair value. the company estimates the fair value of the reporting unit utilizing income and market approaches. the income approach is based on projected future cash flow that is discounted to present value using factors that consider the timing and risk of the future cash flows. the market approach is based on the company's market capitalization at the testing date. the aggregate carrying value of the company's goodwill approximated $66.8 million as of december 31, 2014. the company did not have goodwill prior to the merger date.
other indefinite-lived intangible assets are evaluated for impairment by comparing the fair value of the asset to its carrying value. any excess of carrying value over the fair value is recognized as an impairment within the consolidated statement of operations in the period of review. our indefinite-lived intangible assets consist of racing and gaming licenses, trade names and customer loyalty programs.
the gaming and racing licenses of each property were valued in aggregate for each respective property, as these licenses are considered to be the most significant asset of the properties and the gaming licenses could not be obtained without holding the racing licenses. therefore, market participant would consider the licenses in aggregate. the fair value of the licenses is calculated using an excess earnings methodology, which is an income approach methodology that allocates the projected cash flows of the property to the gaming license intangible assets less charges for the use of the other identifiable assets of the property, including working capital, fixed assets, and other intangible assets. we believe this methodology is appropriate as the gaming licenses are the primary asset to the properties, the licenses are linked to each respective facility and it's the lowest level at which discrete cash flows can be directly attributable to the assets. under the gaming legislation applicable to our properties, licenses are property specific and can only be acquired if a buyer acquires the existing facility. because existing licenses may not be acquired and transferred for use at a different facility, the estimated future cash flows of each of our properties was the primary assumption in the valuation of such property. the aggregate carrying value of the company's gaming license intangibles approximated $482.0 million as of december 31, 2014.
assessing the indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment is a process that requires significant judgment and involves detailed quantitative and qualitative business-specific analysis and many individual assumptions which fluctuate between assessments. our properties' estimated future cash flows are a primary assumption in the respective impairment analyses. unforeseen events, changes in circumstances and market conditions and material differences in estimates of future cash flows could negatively affect the fair value of our assets and result in an impairment charge, which could be material. cash flow estimates include assumptions regarding factors such as recent and budgeted operating performance, net win per unit (revenue), patron visits, growth percentages which are developed considering general macroeconomic conditions as well as competitive impacts from current and anticipated competition through a review of customer market data, operating margins, and current regulatory, social and economic climates. these estimates could also be negatively impacted by changes in federal, state, or local regulations, economic downturns or developments and other market conditions affecting travel and access to the properties. the most significant of the assumptions used in our valuations include: (1) revenue growth/decline percentages; (2) discount rates; (3) effective income tax rates; (4) future terminal values and (5) capital expenditure assumptions. these assumptions were developed for each property based on historical trends, the current competitive markets in which they operate, and projections of future performance and competition.
the company values trade names using the relief-from-royalty method. royalty rates range from 0.5% - 1.0%. the customer loyalty program was valued using a combination of a replacement cost and
62
lost profits analysis. trade names are amortized on a straight-line basis over a 3.5 year useful life and the customer loyalty program is being amortized on a straight-line basis over a one year useful life. the aggregate carrying value of trade names and customer loyalty program intangibles as of december 31, 2014 was approximately $6.7 million and $4.8 million, respectively.
we believe we have used reasonable estimates and assumptions to calculate the fair value of our other indefinite-lived intangible assets; however, these estimates and assumptions could be materially different from actual results. if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected, or if events occur or circumstances change that would reduce the fair value of our licensing intangibles below the carrying value reflected on the consolidated balance sheet, we may be required to conduct an interim test or possibly recognize impairment charges, which may be material, in future periods.
no impairment charges were recorded for our other indefinite-lived intangible assets in any of the years presented.
reserve for uncollectible accounts receivable we reserve an estimated amount for receivables that may not be collected. methodologies for estimating bad debt reserves range from specific reserves to various percentages applied to aged receivables. historical collection rates are considered, as are customer relationships, in determining specific reserves. as with many estimates, management must make judgments about potential actions by third parties in establishing and evaluating our reserves for bad debts.
self-insurance reserves eldorado reno and eldorado shreveport are self-insured for their group health programs and eldorado reno is self-insured for its workmen's compensation program. we utilize historical claims information provided by our third party administrators to make estimates for known pending claims as well as claims that have been incurred, but not reported as of the balance sheet date. in order to mitigate our potential exposure, we have an individual claim stop loss policy on our group health claims and a specific claim stop loss policy on our workmen's compensation claims. if we become aware of significant claims or material changes affecting our estimates, we would increase our reserves in the period in which we made such a determination and record the additional expense. at december 31, 2014 and 2013, $1.3 million was accrued for insurance and workmen's compensation medical claims reserves and is included in accrued and other liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets.
frequent players program we offer programs whereby our participating patrons can accumulate points for wagering that can be redeemed for credits for free play on slot machines, lodging, food and beverage, merchandise and in limited situations, cash. based upon the estimated redemptions of frequent player program points, an estimated liability is established for the cost of redemption on earned but unredeemed points. the estimated cost of redemption utilizes estimates and assumptions of the mix of the various product offerings for which the points will be redeemed and costs of such product offerings. changes in the programs, membership levels and redemption patterns of our participating patrons can impact this liability. the aggregate outstanding liability for the frequent players program was $2.4 million and $2.0 million at december 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively, and is included as a component of other accrued liabilities in our accompanying consolidated balance sheets.
litigation, claims and assessments we utilize estimates for litigation, claims and assessments. these estimates are based on our knowledge and experience regarding current and past events, as well as assumptions about future events. if our assessment of such a matter should change, we may have to change the estimates, which

may have an adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. actual results could differ from these estimates.
recently issued accounting pronouncements in may 2014, the financial accounting standards board (the "fasb") issued accounting standards update no. 2014-9,  revenue from contracts with customers (topic 606) ("asu 2014-09"). the standard requires revenue to be recognized when promised goods or services are transferred to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration that is expected to be received for those goods and services. qualitative and quantitative disclosures are also required regarding customer contracts, significant judgments and changes in judgments, and assets recognized from the costs to obtain or fulfill a contract. asu 2014-09 supersedes and replaces nearly all existing revenue recognition guidance under us gaap. this accounting guidance is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after december 15, 2016. early adoption is not permitted. the company is currently evaluating the impact of the adoption of asu 2014-09 on its consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.
in august 2014, the fasb issued asu no. 2014-15, "presentation of financial statementsgoing concern" (subtopic 205-40) which amends the current guidance in asc topic 205 by adding subtopic 40. subtopic 40 requires management to evaluate whether there are conditions or events that in aggregate would raise substantial doubt about an entity's ability to continue as a going concern for one year from the date the financial statements are issued or available to be issued. if substantial doubt existed, management would be required to make certain disclosures related to nature of the substantial doubt and under certain circumstances, how that substantial doubt would be mitigated. this amendment is effective for annual periods ending after december 15, 2016 and for subsequent interim and annual periods thereafter. early adoption is permitted. the company is currently evaluating the effects, if any, adoption of this guidance will have on its consolidated financial statements.
in january 2015, the fasb issued asu no. 2015-1, "income statementextraordinary and unusual items" (subtopic 225-20) which eliminates the concept of accounting of extraordinary items, previously defined as items that are both unusual and infrequent, which were reported as a separate item on the income statement, net of tax, after income from continuing operations. the elimination of this concept is intended to simplify accounting for unusual items and more closely align with international accounting practices. this amendment is effective for annual periods ending after december 15, 2015 and for subsequent interim and annual periods thereafter. early adoption is permitted. the company believes that the effects, if any, of the adoption of this guidance will not have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements.

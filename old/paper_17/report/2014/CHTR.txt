item 1a.     risk factors.
risks related to our indebtedness we have a significant amount of debt and may incur significant additional debt, including secured debt, in the future, which could adversely affect our financial health and our ability to react to changes in our business.
we have a significant amount of debt and may (subject to applicable restrictions in our debt instruments) incur additional debt in the future. as of december 31, 2014, our total principal amount of debt was approximately $21.1 billion, including $7.0 billion of debt for which proceeds are held in escrow pending consummation of the transactions.
our significant amount of debt could have consequences, such as:
•   impact our ability to raise additional capital at reasonable rates, or at all;
•   make us vulnerable to interest rate increases, because approximately 28% of our borrowings are, and may continue to be, subject to variable rates of interest;
•   expose us to increased interest expense to the extent we refinance existing debt with higher cost debt;
•   require us to dedicate a significant portion of our cash flow from operating activities to make payments on our debt, reducing our funds available for working capital, capital expenditures, and other general corporate expenses;
•   limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business, the cable and telecommunications industries, and the economy at large;
•   place us at a disadvantage compared to our competitors that have proportionately less debt; and
•   adversely affect our relationship with customers and suppliers.
if current debt amounts increase, the related risks that we now face will intensify.
the agreements and instruments governing our debt contain restrictions and limitations that could significantly affect our ability to operate our business, as well as significantly affect our liquidity.
our credit facilities and the indentures governing our debt contain a number of significant covenants that could adversely affect our ability to operate our business, our liquidity, and our results of operations. these covenants restrict, among other things, our and our subsidiaries' ability to:
•   incur additional debt;
•   repurchase or redeem equity interests and debt;
•   issue equity;
•   make certain investments or acquisitions;
•   pay dividends or make other distributions;
•   dispose of assets or merge;
•   enter into related party transactions; and
•   grant liens and pledge assets.
additionally, the charter operating credit facilities require charter operating to comply with a maximum total leverage covenant and a maximum first lien leverage covenant. the breach of any covenants or obligations in our indentures or credit facilities, not
18
otherwise waived or amended, could result in a default under the applicable debt obligations and could trigger acceleration of those obligations, which in turn could trigger cross defaults under other agreements governing our long-term indebtedness. in addition, the secured lenders under the charter operating credit facilities could foreclose on their collateral, which includes equity interests in our subsidiaries, and exercise other rights of secured creditors.
we depend on generating sufficient cash flow to fund our debt obligations, capital expenditures, and ongoing operations.
we are dependent on our cash on hand and cash flow from operations to fund our debt obligations, capital expenditures and ongoing operations.
our ability to service our debt and to fund our planned capital expenditures and ongoing operations will depend on our ability to continue to generate cash flow and our access (by dividend or otherwise) to additional liquidity sources at the applicable obligor. our ability to continue to generate cash flow is dependent on many factors, including:
•   our ability to sustain and grow revenues and cash flow from operations by offering video, internet, voice, advertising and other services to residential and commercial customers, to adequately meet the customer experience demands in our markets and to maintain and grow our customer base, particularly in the face of increasingly aggressive competition, the need for innovation and the related capital expenditures;
•   the impact of competition from other market participants, including but not limited to incumbent telephone companies, direct broadcast satellite operators, wireless broadband and telephone providers, dsl providers, video provided over the internet and providers of advertising over the internet;
•   general business conditions, economic uncertainty or downturn, high unemployment levels and the level of activity in the housing sector;
•   our ability to obtain programming at reasonable prices or to raise prices to offset, in whole or in part, the effects of higher programming costs (including retransmission consents);
•   the development and deployment of new products and technologies; and
•   the effects of governmental regulation on our business or potential business combination transactions.
some of these factors are beyond our control. if we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow or we are unable to access additional liquidity sources, we may not be able to service and repay our debt, operate our business, respond to competitive challenges, or fund our other liquidity and capital needs.
restrictions in our subsidiaries' debt instruments and under applicable law limit their ability to provide funds to us and our subsidiaries that are debt issuers.
our primary assets are our equity interests in our subsidiaries. our operating subsidiaries are separate and distinct legal entities and are not obligated to make funds available to their debt issuer holding companies for payments on our notes or other obligations in the form of loans, distributions, or otherwise. charter operating's ability to make distributions to us, ccoh safari or cco holdings, our other primary debt issuers, to service debt obligations is subject to its compliance with the terms of its credit facilities, and restrictions under applicable law. see "part ii. item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations - liquidity and capital resources - limitations on distributions" and "- summary of restrictive covenants of our notes - restrictions on distributions." under the delaware limited liability company act (the "act"), our subsidiaries may only make distributions if the relevant entity has "surplus" as defined in the act. under fraudulent transfer laws, our subsidiaries may not pay dividends if the relevant entity is insolvent or is rendered insolvent thereby. the measures of insolvency for purposes of these fraudulent transfer laws vary depending upon the law applied in any proceeding to determine whether a fraudulent transfer has occurred. generally, however, an entity would be considered insolvent if:
•   the sum of its debts, including contingent liabilities, was greater than the fair saleable value of all its assets;
•   the present fair saleable value of its assets was less than the amount that would be required to pay its probable liability on its existing debts, including contingent liabilities, as they become absolute and mature; or
•   it could not pay its debts as they became due.
while we believe that our relevant subsidiaries currently have surplus and are not insolvent, these subsidiaries may become insolvent in the future. our direct or indirect subsidiaries include the borrowers under the cco safari credit facility and the borrowers and guarantors under the charter operating credit facilities. ccoh safari and cco holdings are each an obligor under their respective senior notes. as of december 31, 2014, our total principal amount of debt was approximately $21.1 billion, including $7.0 billion of debt for which proceeds are held in escrow pending consummation of the transactions.
19
in the event of bankruptcy, liquidation, or dissolution of one or more of our subsidiaries, that subsidiary's assets would first be applied to satisfy its own obligations, and following such payments, such subsidiary may not have sufficient assets remaining to make payments to its parent company as an equity holder or otherwise. in that event:
•   the lenders under charter operating's credit facilities, whose interests are secured by substantially all of our operating assets, and all holders of other debt of ccoh safari, cco holdings, charter operating and cco safari, will have the right to be paid in full before us from any of our subsidiaries' assets; and
•   cch i, the holder of preferred membership interests in our subsidiary, cc viii, would have a claim on a portion of cc viii's assets that may reduce the amounts available for repayment to holders of cco holdings' and ccoh safari's outstanding notes.
all of our outstanding debt is subject to change of control provisions. we may not have the ability to raise the funds necessary to fulfill our obligations under our indebtedness following a change of control, which would place us in default under the applicable debt instruments.
we may not have the ability to raise the funds necessary to fulfill our obligations under our notes and our credit facilities following a change of control. under the indentures governing our notes, upon the occurrence of specified change of control events, the debt issuer is required to offer to repurchase all of its outstanding notes. however, we may not have sufficient access to funds at the time of the change of control event to make the required repurchase of the applicable notes, and charter operating is limited in its ability to make distributions or other payments to any debt issuer to fund any required repurchase. in addition, a change of control under the charter operating credit facilities would result in a default under those credit facilities. because such credit facilities are obligations of charter operating, the credit facilities would have to be repaid before charter operating's assets could be available to cco holdings or ccoh safari to repurchase their notes. any failure to make or complete a change of control offer would place cco holdings or ccoh safari in default under its notes. the failure of our subsidiaries to make a change of control offer or repay the amounts accelerated under their notes and credit facilities would place them in default.
risks related to our business we operate in a very competitive business environment, which affects our ability to attract and retain customers and can adversely affect our business, operations and financial results.
the industry in which we operate is highly competitive and has become more so in recent years. in some instances, we compete against companies with fewer regulatory burdens, better access to financing, greater personnel resources, greater resources for marketing, greater and more favorable brand name recognition, and long-established relationships with regulatory authorities and customers. increasing consolidation in the cable industry and the repeal of certain ownership rules have provided additional benefits to certain of our competitors, either through access to financing, resources, or efficiencies of scale. we could also face additional competition from multi-channel video providers if they began distributing video over the internet to customers residing outside their current territories.
our principal competitors for video services throughout our territory are dbs providers. the two largest dbs providers are directv and dish network. competition from dbs, including intensive marketing efforts with aggressive pricing, exclusive programming and increased hd broadcasting has had an adverse impact on our ability to retain customers. dbs companies have also expanded their activities in the mdu market.
telephone companies, including two major telephone companies, at&t and verizon, offer video and other services in competition with us, and we expect they will increasingly do so in the future. upgraded portions of these networks carry two-way video, data services and provide digital voice services similar to ours. in the case of verizon, fios high-speed data services offer speeds as high as or higher than ours. in addition, these companies continue to offer their traditional telephone services, as well as service bundles that include wireless voice services provided by affiliated companies. based on our internal estimates, we believe that at&t and verizon are offering video services in areas serving approximately 30% and 4%, respectively, of our estimated passings and we have experienced customer losses in these areas. at&t and verizon have also launched campaigns to capture more of the mdu market. at&t has publicly stated that it expects to roll out its video product beyond the territories currently served although it is unclear where and to what extent. when at&t or verizon have introduced or expanded their offering of video products in our market areas, we have seen a decrease in our video revenue as at&t and verizon typically roll out aggressive marketing and discounting campaigns to launch their products. additionally, in may 2014, at&t announced its intention to acquire directv, the nation's largest dbs provider. if completed, this transaction will create an even larger competitor for charter's video services that will have the ability to expand its video service offerings to include bundled wireless offerings.
20
due to consumer electronic innovations, content owners are allowing consumers to watch internet-delivered content on televisions, personal computers, tablets, gaming boxes connected to televisions and mobile devices, some without charging a fee to access the content. technological advancements, such as video-on-demand, new video formats, and internet streaming and downloading, have increased the number of entertainment and information delivery choices available to consumers, and intensified the challenges posed by audience fragmentation. for example, online video services continue to offer consumers alternatives including hulu, netflix, amazon and apple. recently, hbo and cbs announced plans to sell their programming direct to consumers over the internet. dish has also announced sling tv which will include espn among other programming, and sony has announced playstation vue which is expected to include 75 tv channels to be launched in the first quarter of 2015. the increasing number of choices available to audiences could also negatively impact advertisers' willingness to purchase advertising from us, as well as the price they are willing to pay for advertising.
with respect to our internet access services, we face competition, including intensive marketing efforts and aggressive pricing, from telephone companies, primarily at&t and verizon, and other providers of dsl, fiber-to-the-node and fiber-to-the-home services. dsl service competes with our internet service and is often offered at prices lower than our internet services, although often at speeds lower than the speeds we offer. fiber-to-the-node networks can provide faster internet speeds than conventional dsl, but still cannot typically match our internet speeds. fiber-to-the-home networks, however, can provide internet speeds equal to or greater than our current internet speeds. in addition, in many of our markets, dsl providers have entered into co-marketing arrangements with dbs providers to offer service bundles combining video services provided by a dbs provider with dsl and traditional telephone and wireless services offered by the telephone companies and their affiliates. these service bundles offer customers similar pricing and convenience advantages as our bundles.
continued growth in our residential voice business faces risks. the competitive landscape for residential and commercial telephone services is intense; we face competition from providers of internet telephone services, as well as incumbent telephone companies. further, we face increasing competition for residential voice services as more consumers in the united states are replacing traditional telephone service with wireless service. we expect to continue to price our voice product aggressively as part of our triple play strategy which could negatively impact our revenue from voice services to the extent we do not increase volume.
the existence of more than one cable system operating in the same territory is referred to as an overbuild. overbuilds could adversely affect our growth, financial condition, and results of operations, by creating or increasing competition. we are aware of traditional overbuild situations impacting certain of our markets, however, we are unable to predict the extent to which additional overbuild situations may occur.
in order to attract new customers, from time to time we make promotional offers, including offers of temporarily reduced price or free service. these promotional programs result in significant advertising, programming and operating expenses, and also may require us to make capital expenditures to acquire and install customer premise equipment. customers who subscribe to our services as a result of these offerings may not remain customers following the end of the promotional period. a failure to retain customers could have a material adverse effect on our business.
mergers, joint ventures, and alliances among franchised, wireless, or private cable operators, dbs providers, local exchange carriers, and others, may provide additional benefits to some of our competitors, either through access to financing, resources, or efficiencies of scale, or the ability to provide multiple services in direct competition with us.
in addition to the various competitive factors discussed above, our business competes with all other sources of entertainment and information delivery, including broadcast television, movies, live events, radio broadcasts, home video products, console games, print media, and the internet. if we do not respond appropriately to further increases in the leisure and entertainment choices available to consumers, our competitive position could deteriorate, and our financial results could suffer.
our services may not allow us to compete effectively. competition may reduce our expected growth of future cash flows which may contribute to future impairments of our franchises and goodwill and our ability to meet cash flow requirements, including debt service requirements.
our exposure to the economic conditions of our current and potential customers, vendors and third parties could adversely affect our cash flow, results of operations and financial condition.
we are exposed to risks associated with the economic conditions of our current and potential customers, the potential financial instability of our customers and their financial ability to purchase our products. if there were a general economic downtown, we may experience increased cancellations by our customers or unfavorable changes in the mix of products purchased. these events have adversely affected us in the past, and may adversely affect our cash flow, results of operations and financial condition if a downturn were to occur.
21
in addition, we are susceptible to risks associated with the potential financial instability of the vendors and third parties on which we rely to provide products and services or to which we outsource certain functions. the same economic conditions that may affect our customers, as well as volatility and disruption in the capital and credit markets, also could adversely affect vendors and third parties and lead to significant increases in prices, reduction in output or the bankruptcy of our vendors or third parties upon which we rely. any interruption in the services provided by our vendors or by third parties could adversely affect our cash flow, results of operation and financial condition.
we face risks inherent in our commercial business.
we may encounter unforeseen difficulties as we increase the scale of our service offerings to businesses. we sell internet access, data networking and fiber connectivity to cellular towers and office buildings, video and business voice services to businesses and have increased our focus on growing this business. in order to grow our commercial business, we expect to continue investment in technology, equipment and personnel focused on the commercial business. commercial business customers often require service level agreements and generally have heightened customer expectations for reliability of services. if our efforts to build the infrastructure to scale the commercial business are not successful, the growth of our commercial services business would be limited. we depend on interconnection and related services provided by certain third parties for the growth of our commercial business. as a result, our ability to implement changes as the services grow may be limited. if we are unable to meet these service level requirements or expectations, our commercial business could be adversely affected. finally, we expect advances in communications technology, as well as changes in the marketplace and the regulatory and legislative environment. consequently, we are unable to predict the effect that ongoing or future developments in these areas might have on our voice and commercial businesses and operations.
programming costs are rising at a much faster rate than wages or inflation, and we may not have the ability to reduce or moderate the growth rates of, or pass on to our customers, our increasing programming costs, which would adversely affect our cash flow and operating margins.
programming has been, and is expected to continue to be, our largest operating expense item. in recent years, the cable industry has experienced a rapid escalation in the cost of programming. we expect programming costs to continue to increase because of a variety of factors including amounts paid for retransmission consent, annual increases imposed by programmers with additional selling power as a result of media consolidation, incremental programming, including new sports services, out-of-home or non-linear programming and attempts by programmers to replace advertising revenue they are losing to online marketing options and as a result of declining viewership ratings. the inability to fully pass these programming cost increases on to our customers has had an adverse impact on our cash flow and operating margins associated with the video product. we have programming contracts that have expired and others that will expire at or before the end of 2015. there can be no assurance that these agreements will be renewed on favorable or comparable terms. to the extent that we are unable to reach agreement with certain programmers on terms that we believe are reasonable, we may be forced to remove such programming channels from our line-up, which could result in a further loss of customers.
increased demands by owners of some broadcast stations for carriage of other services or payments to those broadcasters for retransmission consent are likely to further increase our programming costs. federal law allows commercial television broadcast stations to make an election between "must-carry" rights and an alternative "retransmission-consent" regime. when a station opts for the latter, cable operators are not allowed to carry the station's signal without the station's permission. in some cases, we carry stations under short-term arrangements while we attempt to negotiate new long-term retransmission agreements. if negotiations with these programmers prove unsuccessful, they could require us to cease carrying their signals, possibly for an indefinite period. any loss of stations could make our video service less attractive to customers, which could result in less subscription and advertising revenue. in retransmission-consent negotiations, broadcasters often condition consent with respect to one station on carriage of one or more other stations or programming services in which they or their affiliates have an interest. carriage of these other services, as well as increased fees for retransmission rights, may increase our programming expenses and diminish the amount of capacity we have available to introduce new services, which could have an adverse effect on our business and financial results.
our inability to respond to technological developments and meet customer demand for new products and services could limit our ability to compete effectively.
our business is characterized by rapid technological change and the introduction of new products and services, some of which are bandwidth-intensive. we may not be able to fund the capital expenditures necessary to keep pace with technological developments, execute the plans to do so, or anticipate the demand of our customers for products and services requiring new technology or bandwidth. the implementation of our network-based user interface, spectrum guide, and downloadable security necessary for our worldbox set-top box strategy, may ultimately be unsuccessful or more expensive than anticipated. in order to realize the
22
benefits of our worldbox technology, we must implement our downloadable conditional access security in our regional video networks. our inability to maintain and expand our upgraded systems and provide advanced services such as a state of the art user interface in a timely manner, or to anticipate the demands of the marketplace, could materially adversely affect our ability to attract and retain customers. consequently, our growth, financial condition and results of operations could suffer materially.
we depend on third party service providers, suppliers and licensors; thus, if we are unable to procure the necessary services, equipment, software or licenses on reasonable terms and on a timely basis, our ability to offer services could be impaired, and our growth, operations, business, financial results and financial condition could be materially adversely affected.
we depend on third party service providers, suppliers and licensors to supply some of the services, hardware, software and operational support necessary to provide some of our services. we obtain these materials from a limited number of vendors, some of which do not have a long operating history or which may not be able to continue to supply the equipment and services we desire. some of our hardware, software and operational support vendors, and service providers represent our sole source of supply or have, either through contract or as a result of intellectual property rights, a position of some exclusivity. if demand exceeds these vendors' capacity or if these vendors experience operating or financial difficulties, or are otherwise unable to provide the equipment or services we need in a timely manner, at our specifications and at reasonable prices, our ability to provide some services might be materially adversely affected, or the need to procure or develop alternative sources of the affected materials or services might delay our ability to serve our customers. these events could materially and adversely affect our ability to retain and attract customers, and have a material negative impact on our operations, business, financial results and financial condition. a limited number of vendors of key technologies can lead to less product innovation and higher costs. our cable systems have historically been restricted to using one of two proprietary conditional access security systems, which we believe has limited the number of manufacturers producing set-top boxes for such systems. as an alternative, charter has developed a conditional access security system which may be downloaded into set-top boxes with features we specify that could be provided by a variety of manufacturers. we refer to our specified set-top box as our worldbox. in order to realize the benefits of our worldbox technology, we must now implement the conditional access security system across our video network. we cannot provide assurances that this implementation will ultimately be successful or completed in the expected timeframe or at the expected budget.
we further depend on patent, copyright, trademark and trade secret laws and licenses to establish and maintain our intellectual property rights in technology and the products and services used in our operating activities. any of our intellectual property rights could be challenged or invalidated, or such intellectual property rights may not be sufficient to permit us to continue to use certain intellectual property, which could result in discontinuance of certain product or service offerings or other competitive harm, our incurring substantial monetary liability or being enjoined preliminarily or permanently from further use of the intellectual property in question.
various events could disrupt our networks, information systems or properties and could impair our operating activities and negatively impact our reputation.
network and information systems technologies are critical to our operating activities, as well as our customers' access to our services. we may be subject to information technology system failures and network disruptions. malicious and abusive activities, such as the dissemination of computer viruses, worms, and other destructive or disruptive software, computer hackings, social engineering, process breakdowns, denial of service attacks and other malicious activities have become more common in industry overall.  if directed at us or technologies upon which we depend, these activities could have adverse consequences on our network and our customers, including degradation of service, excessive call volume to call centers, and damage to our or our customers' equipment and data.  further, these activities could result in security breaches, such as misappropriation, misuse, leakage, falsification or accidental release or loss of information maintained in our information technology systems and networks, and in our vendors' systems and networks, including customer, personnel and vendor data. system failures and network disruptions may also be caused by natural disasters, accidents, power disruptions or telecommunications failures. if a significant incident were to occur, it could damage our reputation and credibility, lead to customer dissatisfaction and, ultimately, loss of customers or revenue, in addition to increased costs to service our customers and protect our network. these events also could result in large expenditures to repair or replace the damaged properties, networks or information systems or to protect them from similar events in the future. system redundancy may be ineffective or inadequate, and our disaster recovery planning may not be sufficient for all eventualities.  any significant loss of customers or revenue, or significant increase in costs of serving those customers, could adversely affect our growth, financial condition and results of operations.
for tax purposes, we could experience a deemed ownership change in the future that could limit our ability to use our tax loss carryforwards.
as of december 31, 2014, we had approximately $9.5 billion of federal tax net operating loss carryforwards resulting in a gross deferred tax asset of approximately $3.3 billion. federal tax net operating loss carryforwards expire in the years 2020 through
23
2034. these losses resulted from the operations of charter holdco and its subsidiaries. in addition, as of december 31, 2014, we had state tax net operating loss carryforwards resulting in a gross deferred tax asset (net of federal tax benefit) of approximately $321 million. state tax net operating loss carryforwards generally expire in the years 2015 through 2034. due to uncertainties in projected future taxable income, valuation allowances have been established against the gross deferred tax assets for book accounting purposes, except for future taxable income that will result from the reversal of existing temporary differences for which deferred tax liabilities are recognized. such tax loss carryforwards can accumulate and be used to offset our future taxable income.
in the past, we have experienced "ownership changes" as defined in section 382 of the internal revenue code of 1986, as amended (the "code"). in general, an "ownership change" occurs whenever the percentage of the stock of a corporation owned, directly or indirectly, by "5-percent stockholders" (within the meaning of section 382 of the code) increases by more than 50 percentage points over the lowest percentage of the stock of such corporation owned, directly or indirectly, by such "5-percent stockholders" at any time over the preceding three years. as a result, we are subject to an annual limitation on the use of our loss carryforwards which existed at november 30, 2009 for the first "ownership change" and those that existed at may 1, 2013 for the second "ownership change." the limitation on our ability to use our loss carryforwards, in conjunction with the loss carryforward expiration provisions, could reduce our ability to use a portion of our loss carryforwards to offset future taxable income, which could result in us being required to make material cash tax payments. our ability to make such income tax payments, if any, will depend at such time on our liquidity or our ability to raise additional capital, and/or on receipt of payments or distributions from charter holdco and its subsidiaries.
if we were to experience a third ownership change in the future (as a result of purchases and sales of stock by our "5-percent stockholders," new issuances or redemptions of our stock, certain acquisitions of our stock and issuances, redemptions, sales or other dispositions or acquisitions of interests in our "5-percent stockholders"), our ability to use our loss carryforwards could become subject to further limitations. our common stock is subject to certain transfer restrictions contained in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation. these restrictions, which are designed to minimize the likelihood of an ownership change occurring and thereby preserve our ability to utilize our loss carryforwards, are not currently operative but could become operative in the future if certain events occur and the restrictions are imposed by our board of directors. however, there can be no assurance that our board of directors would choose to impose these restrictions or that such restrictions, if imposed, would prevent an ownership change from occurring.
if we are unable to retain key employees, our ability to manage our business could be adversely affected.
our operational results have depended, and our future results will depend, upon the retention and continued performance of our management team. our ability to retain and hire new key employees for management positions could be impacted adversely by the competitive environment for management talent in the broadband communications industry. the loss of the services of key members of management and the inability or delay in hiring new key employees could adversely affect our ability to manage our business and our future operational and financial results.
our inability to successfully acquire and integrate other businesses, assets, products or technologies could harm our operating results.
we continuously evaluate and pursue small and large acquisitions and strategic investments in businesses, products or technologies that we believe could complement or expand our business or otherwise offer growth or cost-saving opportunities. from time to time, including in the near term, we may enter into letters of intent with companies with which we are negotiating for potential acquisitions or investments, or as to which we are conducting due diligence. an investment in, or acquisition of, complementary businesses, products or technologies in the future could materially decrease the amount of our available cash or require us to seek additional equity or debt financing. we may not be successful in negotiating the terms of any potential acquisition, conducting thorough due diligence, financing the acquisition or effectively integrating the acquired business, product or technology into our existing business and operations. our due diligence may fail to identify all of the problems, liabilities or other shortcomings or challenges of an acquired business, product or technology, including issues related to intellectual property, product quality or product architecture, regulatory compliance practices, revenue recognition or other accounting practices, or employee or customer issues.
additionally, in connection with any acquisitions we complete, we may not achieve the growth, synergies or other benefits we expected to achieve, and we may incur write-downs, impairment charges or unforeseen liabilities that could negatively affect our operating results or financial position or could otherwise harm our business. further, contemplating or completing an acquisition and integrating an acquired business, product or technology, individually or across multiple opportunities, could divert management and employee time and resources from other matters.

risks related to ownership position of liberty broadband corporation liberty broadband corporation owns a significant amount of charter's common stock, giving it influence over corporate transactions and other matters.
members of our board of directors include directors who are also officers and directors of our principal stockholder. dr. john malone is the chairman of liberty broadband corporation, and mr. greg maffei is the president and chief executive officer of liberty broadband corporation. as of december 31, 2014, liberty broadband corporation beneficially held approximately 25.75% of our class a common stock. liberty broadband corporation has the right to designate up to four directors as nominees for our board of directors through our 2015 annual meeting of stockholders with one designated director to be appointed to each of the audit committee, the nominating and corporate governance committee and the compensation and benefits committee. liberty broadband corporation may be able to exercise substantial influence over all matters requiring stockholder approval, including the election of directors and approval of significant corporate action, such as mergers and other business combination transactions should liberty broadband corporation retain a significant ownership interest in us.  liberty broadband corporation and its affiliates are not restricted from investing in, and have invested in, and engaged in, other businesses involving or related to the operation of cable television systems, video programming, internet service, voice or business and financial transactions conducted through broadband interactivity and internet services.  liberty broadband corporation and its affiliates may also engage in other businesses that compete or may in the future compete with us.
liberty broadband corporation's substantial influence over our management and affairs could create conflicts of interest if liberty broadband corporation faced decisions that could have different implications for it and us.
risks related to the transactions as a result of the transactions, current charter stockholders' ownership interest in charter will be diluted from 100% to approximately 92%.
immediately following the transactions, it is expected that the current stockholders of charter, who presently own 100% of charter, will own approximately 92% of the outstanding common stock of charter. the transactions therefore will result in substantial dilution of the ownership interest of the current charter stockholders. additionally, due to the ownership dilution, charter's current stockholders as a group will be able to exercise less influence after the transactions than they currently exercise over the management, operations and policies for charter. if greatland connections raises less proceeds in the related financing transactions than currently contemplated, charter is obligated pursuant to the merger agreement and the financing arrangements to increase its stock consideration paid in the charter merger, which would further dilute existing charter stockholders. also, pursuant to the merger agreement, if the price at which shares of charter trade were to be lower during the 60 days leading up to the closing of the transactions, charter would have to issue more shares further diluting existing charter stockholders.
completion of the transactions is subject to a number of conditions and if these conditions are not satisfied or waived, the transactions will not be completed.
our obligation and the obligation of comcast to complete the transactions are subject to satisfaction or waiver of a number of conditions, including, among others:
•   completion of comcast's acquisition of twc;
•   expiration or termination of the hart-scott-rodino antitrust improvements act ("hsr act") waiting period and receipt of certain regulatory approvals for the transactions, in most cases without the imposition of a burdensome condition;
•   unless not required under applicable law, approval by our stockholders;
•   receipt of opinions of counsel as to the tax-free nature of certain of the transactions;
•   absence of injunction or legal impediment on any of the transactions;
•   effectiveness of a registration statement for greatland connections shares to be issued in the transactions and approval for the listing on nasdaq of the shares of greatland connections' common stock to be issued in the transactions;
•   effectiveness of the registration statement filed by cch i, which will become new charter upon the closing of the transactions ("new charter") and approval for listing on nasdaq of the shares of new charter's common stock;
•   accuracy of the representations and warranties with respect to each of the transactions, subject to certain materiality thresholds;
•   performance of covenants with respect to each of the transactions, subject to certain materiality thresholds;
•   with respect to charter's obligations, absence of a material adverse change with respect to the assets and liabilities transferred to greatland connections and the assets and liabilities transferred by comcast to us, taken as a whole, and
25
with respect to comcast's obligations, absence of a material adverse change with respect to the assets and liabilities transferred by us to comcast and absence of a material adverse effect with respect to us, and also with respect to charter's obligations, absence of the assertion by charter's financing sources of a material adverse effect with respect to us; and
•   completion of the debt-for-debt exchange contemplated in connection with the greatland connections spin-off from comcast.
there can be no assurance that the conditions to closing of the transactions will be satisfied or waived or that the transactions will be completed.
in order to complete the transactions, we along with comcast must obtain certain governmental authorizations, and if such authorizations are not granted or are granted with conditions to the parties, completion of the transactions may be jeopardized or the anticipated benefits of the transactions could be reduced.
completion of the transactions is conditioned upon the expiration or early termination of the waiting periods relating to the transactions under the hsr act and the required governmental authorizations, including an order of the fcc, having been obtained and being in full force and effect. although we and comcast have agreed in the transactions agreement to use reasonable best efforts, subject to certain limitations, to obtain the required governmental authorizations, there can be no assurance that the relevant waiting periods will expire or that the relevant authorizations will be obtained. in addition, the governmental authorities with or from which these authorizations are required have broad discretion in administering the governing regulations. as a condition to authorization of the transactions, these governmental authorities may impose requirements, limitations or costs or require divestitures or place restrictions on the conduct of our business after completion of the transactions. there can be no assurance that regulators will not impose conditions, terms, obligations or restrictions and that such conditions, terms, obligations or restrictions will not have the effect of delaying completion of the transactions or imposing additional material costs on or materially limiting the revenues of new charter following the transactions, or otherwise adversely affect our business and results of operations after completion of the transactions. in addition, we can provide no assurance that these conditions, terms, obligations or restrictions will not result in the delay or abandonment of the transactions.
we have relied on publicly available information and ongoing diligence on the systems being acquired by charter and by greatland connections.
we have relied on publicly available information and ongoing diligence regarding the systems being acquired by charter and by greatland connections. the transactions accordingly provide for assumption by charter and by greatland connections of only those liabilities that are primarily related to the systems acquired by each of them respectively, and for valuation terms that will depend on actual carveout 2014 ebitda (as defined in the transactions agreement) produced by such systems, including true-up adjustment payments related to ebitda and, in some cases, working capital. however, it is possible that significant liabilities, present, future or contingent, may be assumed by charter or greatland connections that are not fully reflected in the valuation terms, and accordingly could have a material adverse effect on charter and/or its investment in greatland connections. similarly, it is possible that certain assets required to operate the systems acquired by greatland connections and/or charter, such as licenses, technologies and/or employees, may not be transferred in the transactions, requiring greatland connections and/or charter to incur additional costs and invest additional resources to procure such assets and/or hire employees with expertise in the transferred business, which may adversely affect charter's ability to realize the anticipated benefits of the transactions. as we have already entered into the agreement for the transactions without any diligence conditions, our ongoing diligence is not expected to give rise to any material adjustments in the transactions, and our ongoing diligence continues to focus on the transition of the to be acquired systems to our ownership or the provision of services in the case of greatland connections.
we may not realize anticipated cost synergies and growth opportunities.
we expect that we will realize cost synergies, growth opportunities and other financial and operating benefits as a result of the transactions. our success in realizing these cost synergies, growth opportunities and other financial and operating benefits, and the timing of this realization, depends on the successful integration of the business operations obtained in the asset exchange and the asset purchase and our ability to provide certain services to greatland connections effectively pursuant to a services agreement. even if we are able to integrate the business operations obtained in the asset exchange and the asset purchase successfully, we cannot predict with certainty if or when these cost synergies, growth opportunities and benefits will occur, or the extent to which they actually will be achieved. for example, the benefits from the transactions may be offset by costs incurred in integrating the new business operations or in obtaining or attempting to obtain regulatory approvals for the transactions, or negatively impacted by potential programming dis-synergies that we may experience as a result of the transactions. realization of any benefits and cost synergies could be affected by the factors described in other risk factors and a number of factors beyond our control, including, without limitation, general economic conditions, increased operating costs, the response of competitors and regulatory developments.
26
in addition, certain license and customer contracts which are required to be transferred to greatland connections or charter by comcast require the consent of the licensor or customer party to the contract to effect this assignment. comcast, greatland connections and charter may be unable to obtain these consents on terms favorable to greatland connections or charter, respectively, or at all, which could have a material adverse impact on greatland connections' (and hence on us) or on our business, financial condition and results of operations after the transactions. there can be no assurance that third-party consents will be obtained prior to completion of the transactions or at all.
the integration of the business acquired in the asset exchange and asset purchase with the businesses we operated prior to the asset exchange and asset purchase may not be successful or the anticipated benefits from the asset exchange and asset purchase may not be realized.
after consummation of the asset exchange and asset purchase, we will have significantly more systems, assets, investments, businesses, customers and employees than we did prior to the asset exchange and asset purchase. the process of integrating these assets with the businesses we operated prior to the asset exchange and asset purchase will require us to expend significant capital and significantly expand the scope of our operations and operating and financial systems. our management will be required to devote a significant amount of time and attention to the process of integrating the operations of the acquired assets with our operations before the asset exchange and asset purchase. there is a significant degree of difficulty and management involvement inherent in that process. these difficulties include:
•   integrating the operations of the acquired assets while carrying on the ongoing operations of the businesses we operated prior to the asset exchange and asset purchase;
•   integrating information, purchasing, provisioning, accounting, finance, sales, billing, payroll, reporting and regulatory compliance systems;
•   integrating and unifying the product offerings and services available to customers, including customer premise equipment and video user interfaces;
•   completing the conversion of analog systems to all-digital for the systems to be acquired;
•   managing a significantly larger company than before consummation of the asset exchange and asset purchase;
•   integrating separate business cultures;
•   attracting and retaining the necessary personnel associated with the acquired assets; and
•   creating uniform standards, controls, procedures, policies and information systems and controlling the costs associated with such matters; and
•   the impact on our business of providing services to greatland connections which will also face the foregoing difficulties.
charter and comcast have agreed to provide each other with transition services in connection with the transferred systems and relevant assets. providing such services could divert management attention and result in additional costs, particularly as charter starts up infrastructure and staff to take over transition services and provides transition services to comcast for former charter systems. in addition, the inability to procure such services could negatively impact our expected results of operations.
there is no assurance that the assets acquired in the asset exchange and asset purchase will be successfully or cost-effectively integrated into the businesses we operated prior to the asset exchange and asset purchase. the process of integrating the acquired assets into our operations prior to the asset exchange and asset purchase may cause an interruption of, or loss of momentum in, the activities of our business. if our management is not able to effectively manage the integration process, or if any significant business activities are interrupted as a result of the integration process, our business could suffer and our liquidity, results of operations and financial condition may be materially adversely impacted.
even if we are able to successfully integrate the new assets, it may not be possible to realize the benefits that are expected to result from the asset exchange and asset purchase, or realize these benefits within the time frame that is expected. for example, the elimination of duplicative costs may not be possible or may take longer than anticipated, or the benefits from the asset exchange and asset purchase may be offset by costs incurred or delays in integrating the companies. programming dis-synergies could also be larger than expected. if we fail to realize the benefits we anticipate from the acquisition, our liquidity, results of operations or financial condition may be adversely affected.
the value of our interests in greatland connections following the transactions may fluctuate from time to time based on factors beyond our control.
following the transactions, the value of our interests in greatland connections will depend on greatland connections' operational performance and fluctuations in its share price. we will not control the management and operations of greatland connections, and we will therefore not be able to prevent or address any decline in the operational performance or trading value of greatland connections. in addition, the operational performance and trading value of greatland connections may be influenced by other
27
factors outside our control, including risks resulting from the separation of the cable systems from comcast; changes in earnings estimated by securities analysts or greatland connections' ability to meet those estimates; and domestic and foreign economic conditions.
if the operating results for greatland connections following the transactions are poor, we may not achieve the increases in revenues and earnings per share that we expect as a result of the transactions.
we have projected that we will derive a portion of our revenues and earnings per share from greatland connections after the transactions, through receipt of a services fee of 4.25% of greatland connections' revenues pursuant to a services agreement. in addition, we will record 33% of greatland connections' net income, which will also have an impact on our operating results. therefore, any negative impact on greatland connections or the operations of greatland connections' business could harm our operating results. some of the significant factors that could harm greatland connections and the operations of the greatland connections' business, and therefore harm our future operating results after the transactions, include competitive pressure from existing or new companies and a decline in the markets served by greatland connections.
if the operating results of the twc assets acquired in the asset exchange and the asset purchase are less than our expectations, or an increase in the capital expenditures to upgrade and maintain those assets as well as to keep pace with technological developments is necessary, charter may not achieve the expected level of financial results from the transactions.
we have projected that we will derive a portion of our revenues and earnings per share from the operation of the twc assets that we will acquire in the asset exchange and the asset purchase. therefore, any negative impact on the twc assets to be acquired by us or the operating results derived from such exchanged and purchased assets could harm our operating results.
our business is characterized by rapid technological change and the introduction of new products and services. we intend to make all-digital investments in the twc assets acquired in the asset exchange and asset purchase and transition toward only using two-way interactive set-top boxes. the increase in capital expenditures necessary for the all-digital investment and the transition toward two-way set-top boxes in the twc assets may negatively impact the expected financial results from the transactions. we may not be able to fund the capital expenditures necessary to keep pace with technological developments, execute the plans to do so, or anticipate the demand of our customers for products and services requiring new technology or bandwidth. our inability to maintain, expand and upgrade our existing or acquired assets, including through all-digital initiatives for the twc assets, could materially adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.
because of high debt levels, we may not be able to service our debt obligations in accordance with our terms after the transactions.
our ability to meet our expense and debt service obligations contained in the agreements governing our indebtedness will depend on our future performance, which will be affected by financial, business, economic and other factors, including potential changes in customer preferences, the success of product and marketing innovation and pressure from competitors. should our sales decline after the transactions, we may not be able to generate sufficient cash flow to pay our debt service obligations when due. if we are unable to meet our debt service obligations after the transactions or should we fail to comply with our financial and other restrictive covenants contained in the agreements governing our indebtedness, we may be required to refinance all or part of our debt, sell important strategic assets at unfavorable prices or borrow more money. we may not be able to, at any given time, refinance our debt, sell assets or borrow more money on terms acceptable to us or at all. our inability to refinance our debt could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results from operations after the transactions.
we may have difficulty attracting, motivating and retaining executives and other employees in light of the transactions.
uncertainty about the effect of the transactions on our employees may have an adverse effect on us. this uncertainty may impair our ability to attract, retain and motivate personnel until the transactions are completed. employee retention may be particularly challenging during the pendency of the transactions, as employees may feel uncertain about their future roles with us after the transactions. if our employees depart because of issues relating to the uncertainty and difficulty of integration, our ability to realize the anticipated benefits of the transactions could be reduced. similar challenges exist for us in retaining employees being transferred to charter in the transactions and in attracting any additional personnel we may need after the transactions.
a delay in the completion of the transactions may diminish the anticipated benefits of the transactions.
completion of the transactions is conditioned upon the receipt of certain governmental consents and approvals, orders, authorizations, and rulings, including the expiration or termination of any applicable waiting period (or extension thereof) under the hsr act and the adoption of an order by the fcc granting its consent to the transfer of control or assignment of certain licenses and authorizations issued by the fcc. the requirement to receive these consents and approvals, orders, authorizations and rulings
28
before the transactions could delay the completion of the transactions if, for example, government agencies request additional information from the parties in order to facilitate their review of the transactions or require any conditions precedent to granting their approval of the transactions. in addition, these governmental agencies may attempt to condition their approval of the transactions on the imposition of conditions that could have a material adverse effect on us after the transactions, including but not limited to our operating results or the value of charter class a common stock. any delay in the completion of the transactions could diminish the anticipated benefits of the transactions or result in additional transaction costs, loss of revenue or other effects associated with uncertainty about the transactions. any uncertainty over the ability of the companies to complete the transactions could make it more difficult for us and greatland connections to retain key employees or to pursue business strategies. in addition, until the transactions are completed, the attention of our management may be diverted from ongoing business concerns and regular business responsibilities to the extent management is focused on matters relating to the transactions.
failure to complete the transactions could negatively impact our stock price and our future business and financial results.
if the transactions are not completed for any reason, our ongoing business may be adversely affected and, without realizing any of the benefits of having completed the transactions, we would be subject to a number of risks:
•   we may experience negative reactions from the financial markets, including negative impacts on our stock price;
•   we may experience negative reactions from our customers, regulators and employees;
•   we may be required to pay significant costs relating to the transactions, and will have paid significant costs related to the transactions such as interest on the $7.0 billion of debt incurred to fund the transactions;
•   the transactions agreement places certain restrictions on the conduct of our business with respect to our assets being transferred to comcast prior to completion of the transactions. such restrictions, the waiver of which is subject to the consent of the other party (in certain cases, not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), may have prevented us from taking certain specified actions or otherwise pursuing business opportunities during the pendency of the transactions; and
•   matters relating to the transactions (including integration planning) will require substantial commitments of time and resources by our management and expenditures, which would otherwise have been devoted to day-to-day operations and other opportunities that may have been beneficial to us in the absence of the transactions.
if the transactions are not completed, the risks described above may materialize and they may adversely affect our business, financial condition, financial results and stock price.
in addition, we could be subject to litigation related to any failure to complete the transactions or related to any enforcement proceeding commenced against us to perform our obligations under the transactions agreement.
if the spin-off does not qualify as a tax-free reorganization under sections 368(a)(1)(d) and 355 of the code, including as a result of subsequent acquisitions of stock of greatland connections, then comcast may recognize a very substantial amount of taxable gain and greatland connections (and in certain circumstances, charter) may be obligated to indemnify comcast for these taxes.
the completion of the transactions is conditioned upon the receipt of opinions from counsel as to the tax free nature of certain of the transactions, including the spin-off.  the opinions of counsel will be based on, among other things, current law and certain assumptions and representations as to factual matters made by comcast, greatland connections and charter.  any change in currently applicable law, which may be retroactive, or the failure of any representation to be true, correct and complete, could adversely affect the conclusions reached by counsel in the opinions.  moreover, the opinions will not be binding on the internal revenue service ("irs") or the courts, and the irs or the courts may not agree with the conclusions reached in the opinions.
even if the spin-off otherwise qualifies as a tax-free spin-off for u.s. federal income tax purposes, the spin-off will be taxable to comcast pursuant to section 355(e) of the code if 50% or more of the stock of either comcast or greatland connections is acquired, directly or indirectly (taking into account the stock of greatland connections acquired by new charter in the merger and the stock of comcast and greatland connections acquired by twc shareholders in the transaction between comcast and twc and in the spin-off), as part of a plan or series of related transactions that includes the spin-off. because greatland connections stockholders that are former comcast shareholders (exclusive of former twc shareholders) will own more than 50% of the common stock of greatland connections following the merger, the merger standing alone is not expected to cause the spin-off to be taxable to comcast under section 355(e) of the code. however, if the irs were to determine that other acquisitions of greatland connections common stock or comcast common stock, either before or after the spin-off are part of a plan or series of related transactions that includes the spin-off, such determination could result in the recognition of gain by comcast under section 355(e) of the code. if section 355(e) of the code applied, comcast might recognize a very substantial amount of taxable gain.
29
under the tax sharing agreement that will be entered into by comcast, greatland connections and, to a limited extent, new charter, in certain circumstances, and subject to certain limitations, greatland connections will be required to indemnify comcast against taxes on the spin-off that arise as a result of certain actions or failures to act by greatland connections or as a result of certain changes in ownership of the stock of greatland connections after the completion of the transactions. greatland connections will be unable to take certain actions after the transactions because such actions could adversely affect the tax-free status of the spin-off, and such restrictions could be significant. if greatland connections is required to indemnify comcast in the event the spin-off is taxable, this indemnification obligation would be substantial and could have a material adverse effect on greatland connections.
moreover, under the tax sharing agreement, in certain circumstances, and subject to certain limitations, new charter will be required to indemnify comcast against taxes on the spin-off that arise from new charter taking any actions that would result in new charter holding greatland connections shares in excess of the percentage of greatland connections shares acquired in the merger during the two year period following the spin-off.  if new charter is required to indemnify comcast in the event the spin-off is taxable, this indemnification obligation would be substantial and could have a material adverse effect on new charter.
new charter and greatland connections will be unable to take certain actions after the transactions because such actions could adversely affect the tax-free status of the spin-off, and such restrictions could be significant.
the tax sharing agreement will prohibit new charter, charter and greatland connections from taking actions that could cause the spin-off to be taxable to comcast. in particular, for two years after the completion of the transactions, new charter and greatland connections will not be permitted to take actions that would result in new charter holding (or being treated as holding) greatland connections shares in excess of the percentage of greatland connections shares acquired by new charter in the merger. these actions could include entering into certain merger or consolidation transactions, certain stock issuances and certain other desirable strategic transactions.
because of these restrictions, greatland connections may be limited in the amount of stock that it can issue to make acquisitions or raise additional capital in the two years subsequent to the completion of the charter merger, which could have a material adverse effect on greatland connections' liquidity and financial condition.
the tax sharing agreement will also provide that in certain circumstances, and subject to certain limitations, greatland connections and new charter will be required to indemnify comcast against taxes on the spin-off that arise as a result of actions in violation of the prohibitions and limitations described above. if greatland connections or new charter is required to indemnify comcast in the event the spin-off is taxable, this indemnification obligation would be substantial and could have a material adverse effect on greatland connections or new charter, as applicable.
we will incur significant transaction-related costs in connection with the transactions.
we expect to incur a number of non-recurring costs associated with the transactions before, at, and after closing the transactions. we also will incur transaction fees and costs related to formulating and implementing integration plans, including facilities and systems implementation costs and employment-related costs. we continue to assess the magnitude of these costs, and additional unanticipated costs may be incurred in the transactions and integration. although we expect that the elimination of duplicative costs, as well as the realization of other efficiencies related to the integration of the businesses, should allow us to offset integration-related costs over time, this net benefit may not be achieved in the near term, or at all. in addition, if the transactions are not consummated, we would bear some or all of these costs without the benefit of efficiencies from the integration of the businesses. such costs could have a material adverse impact on our financial results.
sales of our common stock after the transactions may negatively affect the market price of new charter common stock.
the shares of our common stock to be issued in the transactions to holders of greatland connections common stock (initially, the comcast shareholders) will generally be eligible for immediate resale. the market price of our common stock could decline as a result of sales of a large number of shares of our common stock in the market after the consummation of the transactions or even the perception that these sales could occur.
currently, comcast shareholders may include index funds that have performance tied to the standard & poor's 500 index or other stock indices, and institutional investors subject to various investing guidelines. because new charter may not be included in these indices following the consummation of the transactions or may not meet the investing guidelines of some of these institutional investors, these index funds and institutional investors may decide to or may be required to sell the common stock that they receive
30
in the transactions. these sales, or the possibility that these sales may occur, may also make it more difficult for new charter to obtain additional capital by selling equity securities in the future at a time and at a price that it deems appropriate.
risks related to regulatory and legislative matters our business is subject to extensive governmental legislation and regulation, which could adversely affect our business.
regulation of the cable industry has increased cable operators' operational and administrative expenses and limited their revenues. cable operators are subject to various laws and regulations including those covering the following:
•   the provisioning and marketing of cable equipment and compatibility with new digital technologies;
•   subscriber and employee privacy and data security;
•   limited rate regulation of video service;
•   copyright royalties for retransmitting broadcast signals;
•   when a cable system must carry a particular broadcast station and when it must first obtain retransmission consent to carry a broadcast station;
•   the provision of channel capacity to unaffiliated commercial leased access programmers;
•   limitations on our ability to enter into exclusive agreements with multiple dwelling unit complexes and control our inside wiring;
•   the provision of high-speed internet service, including net neutrality rules;
•   the provision of voice communications;
•   cable franchise renewals and transfers;
•   equal employment opportunity, emergency alert systems, disability access, technical standards, marketing practices, customer service, and consumer protection; and
•   approval for mergers and acquisitions often accompanied by the imposition of restrictions and requirements on an applicant's business in order to secure approval of the proposed transaction.
additionally, many aspects of these laws and regulations are often the subject of judicial proceedings and administrative or legislative proposals. there are also ongoing efforts to amend or expand the federal, state, and local regulation of some of the services offered over our cable systems, which may compound the regulatory risks we already face, and proposals that might make it easier for our employees to unionize. some states are considering adopting energy efficiency regulations governing the operation of equipment (such as broadband modems) that we use to deliver internet services, which could constrain innovation in broadband services and equipment. congress is considering whether to rewrite the entire communications act to account for changes in the communications marketplace. congress and various federal agencies are also considering more focused changes, such as new privacy restrictions and new restrictions on the use of personal and profiling information for behavioral advertising. in response to recent global data breaches, malicious activity and cyber threats, as well as the general increasing concerns regarding the protection of consumers' personal information, congress and various federal agencies are also considering the adoption of new data security and cybersecurity legislation and regulation that could result in additional network and information security requirements for our business. these new laws, as well as existing legal and regulatory obligations, could affect our operations and require significant expenditures. in addition, federal, state, and local regulators could deny necessary approval of the transactions or impose additional regulatory conditions in connection with their review of the transactions that could affect our operations.
our cable system franchises are subject to non-renewal or termination. the failure to renew a franchise in one or more key markets could adversely affect our business.
our cable systems generally operate pursuant to franchises, permits, and similar authorizations issued by a state or local governmental authority controlling the public rights-of-way. many franchises establish comprehensive facilities and service requirements, as well as specific customer service standards and monetary penalties for non-compliance. in many cases, franchises are terminable if the franchisee fails to comply with significant provisions set forth in the franchise agreement governing system operations. franchises are generally granted for fixed terms and must be periodically renewed. franchising authorities may resist granting a renewal if either past performance or the prospective operating proposal is considered inadequate. franchise authorities often demand concessions or other commitments as a condition to renewal. in some instances, local franchises have not been renewed at expiration, and we have operated and are operating under either temporary operating agreements or without a franchise while negotiating renewal terms with the local franchising authorities.
the traditional cable franchising regime has recently undergone significant change as a result of various federal and state actions. some state franchising laws do not allow incumbent operators like us to opt into favorable statewide franchising as quickly as
31
new entrants, and often require us to retain certain franchise obligations that are more burdensome than those applied to new entrants.
we cannot assure you that we will be able to comply with all significant provisions of our franchise agreements and certain of our franchisers have from time to time alleged that we have not complied with these agreements. additionally, although historically we have renewed our franchises without incurring significant costs, we cannot assure you that we will be able to renew, or to renew as favorably, our franchises in the future. a termination of or a sustained failure to renew a franchise in one or more key markets could adversely affect our business in the affected geographic area.
our cable system franchises are non-exclusive. accordingly, local and state franchising authorities can grant additional franchises and create additional competition for our products, resulting in overbuilds, which could adversely affect results of operations.
our cable system franchises are non-exclusive. consequently, local and state franchising authorities can grant additional franchises to competitors in the same geographic area or operate their own cable systems. in some cases, local government entities and municipal utilities may legally compete with us on more favorable terms. as a result, competing operators may build systems in areas in which we hold franchises.
the fcc has adopted rules that streamline entry for new competitors (particularly those affiliated with telephone companies) and reduce franchising burdens for these new entrants. at the same time, a substantial number of states have adopted new franchising laws, principally designed to streamline entry for new competitors, and often provide advantages for these new entrants that are not immediately available to existing operators. broadband delivery of video content is not necessarily subject to the same franchising obligations applicable to our traditional cable systems.
the fcc administers a program that collects universal service fund contributions from telecommunications service providers and uses them to subsidize the provision of telecommunications services in high-cost areas and to low-income consumers and the provision of internet and telecommunications services to schools, libraries and certain health care providers. a variety of regulatory changes may lead the fcc to expand the collection of universal service fund contributions to encompass internet service providers.
the fcc already has begun to redirect the expenditure of some universal service funding to broadband deployment in ways that could assist competitors in competing with our services.
local franchise authorities have the ability to impose additional regulatory constraints on our business, which could further increase our expenses.
in addition to the franchise agreement, cable authorities in some jurisdictions have adopted cable regulatory ordinances that further regulate the operation of cable systems. this additional regulation increases the cost of operating our business. local franchising authorities may impose new and more restrictive requirements. local franchising authorities who are certified to regulate rates in the communities where they operate generally have the power to reduce rates and order refunds on the rates charged for basic service and equipment.
tax legislation and administrative initiatives or challenges to our tax positions could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.
we operate cable systems in locations throughout the united states and, as a result, we are subject to the tax laws and regulations of federal, state and local governments. from time to time, various legislative and/or administrative initiatives may be proposed that could adversely affect our tax positions. there can be no assurance that our effective tax rate or tax payments will not be adversely affected by these initiatives. certain states and localities have imposed or are considering imposing new or additional taxes or fees on our services or changing the methodologies or base on which certain fees and taxes are computed. the federal internet tax freedom act, which prohibits many taxes on internet access service, will expire october 1, 2015, unless it is renewed by congress. potential changes include additional taxes or fees on our services which could impact our customers, combined reporting and other changes to general business taxes, central/unit-level assessment of property taxes and other matters that could increase our income, franchise, sales, use and/or property tax liabilities. in addition, federal, state and local tax laws and regulations are extremely complex and subject to varying interpretations. there can be no assurance that our tax positions will not be challenged by relevant tax authorities or that we would be successful in any such challenge.
32
further regulation of the cable industry could impair our ability to raise rates to cover our increasing costs, resulting in increased losses.
currently, rate regulation of cable systems is strictly limited to the basic service tier and associated equipment and installation activities. however, the fcc and congress continue to be concerned that cable rate increases are exceeding inflation. it is possible that either the fcc or congress will further restrict the ability of cable system operators to implement rate increases for our video services or even for our high-speed internet and voice services. should this occur, it would impede our ability to raise our rates. if we are unable to raise our rates in response to increasing costs, our losses would increase.
there has been legislative and regulatory interest in requiring companies that own multiple cable networks to make each of them available on a standalone, rather than a bundled basis to cable operators, and in requiring cable operators to offer historically bundled programming services on an á la carte basis to consumers. while any new regulation or legislation designed to enable cable operators to purchase programming on a standalone basis could be beneficial to charter, any regulation or legislation that limits how we sell programming could adversely affect our business.
actions by pole owners might subject us to significantly increased pole attachment costs.
pole attachments are cable wires that are attached to utility poles. cable system attachments to investor-owned public utility poles historically have been regulated at the federal or state level, generally resulting in favorable pole attachment rates for attachments used to provide cable service. in contrast, utility poles owned by municipalities or cooperatives are not subject to federal regulation and are generally exempt from state regulation. in 2011, the fcc amended its pole attachment rules to promote broadband deployment. the order overall strengthens the cable industry's ability to access investor-owned utility poles on reasonable rates, terms and conditions. it also allows for new penalties in certain cases involving unauthorized attachments that could result in additional costs for cable operators. the new rules were affirmed in 2013. future regulatory changes in this area could impact the pole attachment rates we pay utility companies.
increasing regulation of our internet service product could adversely affect our ability to provide new products and services.
on may 15, 2014, the fcc initiated a rulemaking to issue new "network neutrality" regulations, potentially including a reclassification of broadband services as title ii common carrier services, which could subject our services to far more extensive and burdensome federal and state regulation. on february 4, 2015, the chairman of the fcc released a fact sheet describing his proposed new rules. the chairman's proposal reclassifies wireline and wireless broadband services as title ii common carrier services. the new rules would prohibit isps from engaging in blocking, throttling, and paid prioritization, and the existing transparency rules compelling the disclosure of network management policies would be enhanced. the fcc would also have authority under the proposed rules to hear complaints and take enforcement action if it determines that the interconnection of isps are not just and reasonable, or if isps fail to meet a new general obligation not to harm consumers or edge providers. we do not know at the current time whether the regulations proposed by the chairman will be adopted by the full commission at a meeting scheduled for february 26, 2015, whether any rules adopted actually will go into effect or be struck down by a legal appeal, or how any new rules actually would be administered by the fcc, but such rules could limit our ability to efficiently manage our cable systems and respond to operational and competitive challenges.
changes in channel carriage regulations could impose significant additional costs on us.
cable operators also face significant regulation of their video channel carriage. we can be required to devote substantial capacity to the carriage of programming that we might not carry voluntarily, including certain local broadcast signals; local public, educational and governmental access ("peg") programming; and unaffiliated, commercial leased access programming (required channel capacity for use by persons unaffiliated with the cable operator who desire to distribute programming over a cable system). the fcc adopted revised commercial leased access rules which would dramatically reduce the rate we can charge for leasing this capacity and dramatically increase our administrative burdens, but these remain stayed while under appeal. legislation has been introduced in congress in the past that, if adopted, could impact our carriage of broadcast signals by simultaneously eliminating the cable industry's compulsory copyright license and the retransmission consent requirements governing cable's retransmission of broadcast signals. the fcc also continues to consider changes to the rules affecting the relationship between programmers (including broadcasters) and multichannel video distributors. future regulatory changes could disrupt existing programming commitments, interfere with our preferred use of limited channel capacity, increase our programming costs, and limit our ability to offer services that would maximize our revenue potential. it is possible that other legal restraints will be adopted limiting our discretion over programming decisions.

our voice service is subject to regulatory burdens which may increase, causing us to incur additional costs.
we offer voice communications services over our broadband network using voip services. the fcc has ruled that competitive telephone companies that support voip services, such as those we offer our customers, are entitled to interconnect with incumbent providers of traditional telecommunications services, which ensures that our voip services can compete in the market. the scope of these interconnection rights are being reviewed in a current fcc proceeding, which may affect our ability to compete in the provision of voice services or result in additional costs. the fcc has also declared that certain voip services are not subject to traditional state public utility regulation. the full extent of the fcc preemption of state and local regulation of voip services is not yet clear. telecommunications companies generally are subject to other significant regulation which could also be extended to voip providers. if additional telecommunications regulations are applied to our voip service, it could cause us to incur additional costs. the fcc has already extended certain traditional telecommunications carrier requirements to many voip providers such as us, including e911, universal service fund collection, calea, privacy of customer proprietary network information, number porting, network outage reporting, rural call completion reporting, disability access and discontinuance of service requirements. in november 2011, the fcc released an order significantly changing the rules governing intercarrier compensation payments for the origination and termination of telephone traffic between carriers, including voip service providers like us. the united states court of appeals for the tenth circuit upheld the rules in may 2014. the new rules will result in a substantial decrease in intercarrier compensation payments over a multi-year period. we received intercarrier compensation of approximately $23 million, $21 million and $19 million for the years ended december 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively.
item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations.
reference is made to "part i. item 1a. risk factors" and "cautionary statement regarding forward-looking statements," which describe important factors that could cause actual results to differ from expectations and non-historical information contained herein. in addition, the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and
39
accompanying notes thereto of charter communications, inc. and subsidiaries included in "part ii. item 8. financial statements and supplementary data."
overview we are a cable operator providing services in the united states with approximately 6.2 million residential and commercial customers at december 31, 2014. we offer our customers traditional cable video programming, internet services, and voice services, as well as advanced video services such as video on demand, hd television and dvr service. we also sell local advertising on cable networks and provide fiber connectivity to cellular towers. see "part i. item 1. business - products and services" for further description of these services, including "customers."
our most significant competitors are dbs providers and certain telephone companies that offer services that provide features and functions similar to our video, high-speed internet, and voice services, including in some cases wireless services, and they also offer these services in bundles similar to ours.  customers have been more willing to consider our competitors' products, partially because of increased marketing highlighting perceived differences between competitive video products, especially when those competitors are often offering significant incentives to switch providers. some consumers have chosen to receive video over the internet rather than through pay television services including from us, thereby reducing our video revenues. see "part i. item 1. business - competition."  in the recent past, we have grown revenues by offsetting basic video customer losses with price increases and sales of incremental services such as high-speed internet, video on demand, dvr and hd television.  we expect to continue to grow revenues by increasing the number of products in our current customer homes and obtaining new customers with an improved value offering. in addition, we expect to increase revenues by expanding the sales of services to our commercial customers.  however, we cannot assure you that we will be able to grow revenues or maintain our margins at recent historical rates.
our business plans include goals for increasing customers and revenue. to reach our goals, we have actively invested in our network and operations, and have improved the quality and value of the products and packages that we offer. we have enhanced our video product by moving to an all-digital platform, offering more hd channels and increasing digital and hd-dvr penetration. we simplified our offers and pricing and improved our packaging of products to bring more value to new and existing customers. as part of our effort to create more value for customers, we have focused on driving penetration of our triple play offering, which includes more than 200 hd channels in most of our markets, video on demand, internet service, and fully-featured voice service. in addition, we have implemented a number of changes to our organizational structure, selling methods and operating tactics. we have fully insourced our direct sales workforce and are increasingly insourcing our field operations and call center workforces and modifying the way our sales workforce is compensated, which we believe positions us for better customer service and growth. we expect that our enhanced product set combined with improved customer service will lead to lower customer churn and longer customer lifetimes, allowing us to grow our customer base and revenue more quickly and economically. we expect our capital expenditures to remain elevated as we strive to increase digital and hd-dvr penetration and place higher levels of customer premise equipment per transaction.
in july 2013, charter and charter operating acquired bresnan from a wholly owned subsidiary of cablevision, for $1.625 billion in cash, as well as a working capital adjustment and a reduction for certain funded indebtedness of bresnan (the "bresnan acquisition"). bresnan managed cable operating systems in colorado, montana, wyoming and utah that passed approximately 670,000 homes and served approximately 375,000 residential and commercial customer relationships at the time they were acquired.
total revenue growth was 12% for the year ended december 31, 2014 compared to the corresponding period in 2013, and 9% for the year ended december 31, 2013 compared to the corresponding period in 2012, due to the bresnan acquisition and growth in our video, internet and commercial businesses. total revenue growth on a pro forma basis for the bresnan acquisition as if it had occurred on january 1, 2012 was 8% for the year ended december 31, 2014 compared to the corresponding period in 2013, and 5% for the year ended december 31, 2013 compared to the corresponding period in 2012. for the years ended december 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, adjusted ebitda was $3.2 billion, $2.9 billion and $2.7 billion, respectively.  adjusted ebitda is defined as net loss plus net interest expense, income tax expense, depreciation and amortization, stock compensation expense, loss on extinguishment of debt, gain (loss) on derivative instruments, net, and other operating expenses, such as merger and acquisition costs, special charges and (gain) loss on sale or retirement of assets. see "-use of adjusted ebitda and free cash flow" for further information on adjusted ebitda.  adjusted ebitda increased 12% for the year ended december 31, 2014 compared to the corresponding period in 2013 and 6% for the year ended december 31, 2013 compared to the corresponding period in 2012 as a result of the bresnan acquisition, which contributed $96 million and $90 million, respectively, and an increase in residential and commercial revenues offset by increases in programming costs and other operating costs. for the years ended december 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, our income from operations was $971 million, $909 million and $915 million, respectively. in addition to the factors discussed above, income from operations was affected by increases in depreciation and amortization primarily due to the bresnan acquisition and current capital expenditures.
40
in connection with the transactions, in 2014 we have incurred approximately $14 million in operating costs and expenses and $27 million of capital expenditures related to incremental transition costs required to position charter to double its service footprint. we also incurred $38 million of incremental expenses related to advisory, legal and accounting fees which are reflected in other operating expenses, as well as approximately $75 million of interest expense associated with term loan g that was entered into in september 2014 and the issuance of the ccoh safari notes in november 2014. see "part i. item 1. business - transactions with comcast."
approximately 90%, 89% and 87% of our revenues for years ended december 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively, are attributable to monthly subscription fees charged to customers for our video, internet, voice, and commercial services provided by our cable systems. generally, these customer subscriptions may be discontinued by the customer at any time subject to a fee for certain commercial customers. the remaining 10%, 11% and 13% of revenue for fiscal years 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively, is derived primarily from advertising revenues, franchise and other regulatory fee revenues (which are collected by us but then paid to local authorities), pay-per-view and video on demand programming, installation, processing fees or reconnection fees charged to customers to commence or reinstate service, and commissions related to the sale of merchandise by home shopping services.
our expenses primarily consist of operating costs, depreciation and amortization expense and interest expense. operating costs primarily include programming costs, connectivity, franchise and other regulatory costs, the cost to service our customers such as field, network and customer operations costs and marketing costs.
we have a history of net losses.  our net losses are principally attributable to insufficient revenue to cover the combination of operating expenses, interest expenses that we incur because of our debt, depreciation expenses resulting from the capital investments we have made and continue to make in our cable properties, amortization expenses related to our customer relationship intangibles and non-cash taxes resulting from increases in our deferred tax liabilities.
critical accounting policies and estimates certain of our accounting policies require our management to make difficult, subjective and/or complex judgments. management has discussed these policies with the audit committee of charter's board of directors, and the audit committee has reviewed the following disclosure. we consider the following policies to be the most critical in understanding the estimates, assumptions and judgments that are involved in preparing our financial statements, and the uncertainties that could affect our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows:
•   property, plant and equipment
•   capitalization of labor and overhead costs
•   valuation and impairment of property, plant and equipment
•   useful lives of property, plant and equipment
•   intangible assets
•   valuation and impairment of franchises
•   valuation and impairment and amortization of customer relationships
•   valuation and impairment of goodwill
•   impairment of trademarks
•   income taxes
•   litigation
•   programming agreements in addition, there are other items within our financial statements that require estimates or judgment that are not deemed critical, such as the allowance for doubtful accounts and valuations of our derivative instruments, but changes in estimates or judgment in these other items could also have a material impact on our financial statements.
property, plant and equipment the cable industry is capital intensive, and a large portion of our resources are spent on capital activities associated with extending, rebuilding, and upgrading our cable network. as of december 31, 2014 and 2013, the net carrying amount of our property, plant and equipment (consisting primarily of cable network assets) was approximately $8.4 billion (representing 34% of total assets) and $8.0 billion (representing 46% of total assets), respectively. total capital expenditures for the years ended december 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012 were approximately $2.2 billion, $1.8 billion and $1.7 billion, respectively.
41
capitalization of labor and overhead costs. costs associated with network construction, initial customer installations, installation refurbishments, and the addition of network equipment necessary to provide new or advanced video services, are capitalized. while our capitalization is based on specific activities, once capitalized, we track these costs by fixed asset category at the cable system level, and not on a specific asset basis. for assets that are sold or retired, we remove the estimated applicable cost and accumulated depreciation. costs capitalized as part of initial customer installations include materials, direct labor, and certain indirect costs. these indirect costs are associated with the activities of personnel who assist in connecting and activating the new service, and consist of compensation and overhead costs associated with these support functions. the costs of disconnecting service at a customer's dwelling or reconnecting service to a previously installed dwelling are charged to operating expense in the period incurred. costs for repairs and maintenance are charged to operating expense as incurred, while equipment replacement, including replacement of certain components, and betterments, including replacement of cable drops from the pole to the dwelling, are capitalized.
we make judgments regarding the installation and construction activities to be capitalized. we capitalize direct labor and overhead using standards developed from actual costs and applicable operational data. we calculate standards annually (or more frequently if circumstances dictate) for items such as the labor rates, overhead rates, and the actual amount of time required to perform a capitalizable activity. for example, the standard amounts of time required to perform capitalizable activities are based on studies of the time required to perform such activities. overhead rates are established based on an analysis of the nature of costs incurred in support of capitalizable activities, and a determination of the portion of costs that is directly attributable to capitalizable activities. the impact of changes that resulted from these studies were not material in the periods presented.
labor costs directly associated with capital projects are capitalized. capitalizable activities performed in connection with customer installations include such activities as:
•   dispatching a "truck roll" to the customer's dwelling or business for service connection;
•   verification of serviceability to the customer's dwelling or business (i.e., determining whether the customer's dwelling is capable of receiving service by our cable network and/or receiving advanced or internet services);
•   customer premise activities performed by in-house field technicians and third-party contractors in connection with customer installations, installation of network equipment in connection with the installation of advanced services, and equipment replacement and betterment; and
•   verifying the integrity of the customer's network connection by initiating test signals downstream from the headend to the customer's digital set-top box.
judgment is required to determine the extent to which overhead costs incurred result from specific capital activities, and therefore should be capitalized. the primary costs that are included in the determination of the overhead rate are (i) employee benefits and payroll taxes associated with capitalized direct labor, (ii) direct variable costs associated with capitalizable activities, consisting primarily of installation and construction vehicle costs, (iii) the cost of support personnel, such as dispatchers, who directly assist with capitalizable installation activities, and (iv) indirect costs directly attributable to capitalizable activities.
while we believe our existing capitalization policies are appropriate, a significant change in the nature or extent of our system activities could affect management's judgment about the extent to which we should capitalize direct labor or overhead in the future. we monitor the appropriateness of our capitalization policies, and perform updates to our internal studies on an ongoing basis to determine whether facts or circumstances warrant a change to our capitalization policies. we capitalized internal direct labor and overhead of $277 million, $219 million and $202 million, respectively, for the years ended december 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012.
valuation and impairment. we evaluate the recoverability of our property, plant and equipment upon the occurrence of events or changes in circumstances indicating that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. such events or changes in circumstances could include such factors as the impairment of our indefinite life franchises, changes in technological advances, fluctuations in the fair value of such assets, adverse changes in relationships with local franchise authorities, adverse changes in market conditions, or a deterioration of current or expected future operating results. a long-lived asset is deemed impaired when the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the projected undiscounted future cash flows associated with the asset. no impairments of long-lived assets to be held and used were recorded in the years ended december 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012.
we utilize the cost approach as the primary method used to establish fair value for our property, plant and equipment in connection with business combinations.  the cost approach considers the amount required to replace an asset by constructing or purchasing a new asset with similar utility, then adjusts the value in consideration of all forms of depreciation as of the appraisal date for physical depreciation and function and economic obsolescence. the cost approach relies on management's assumptions regarding current material and labor costs required to rebuild and repurchase significant components of our property, plant and equipment along with assumptions regarding the age and estimated useful lives of our property, plant and equipment.
42
useful lives of property, plant and equipment. we evaluate the appropriateness of estimated useful lives assigned to our property, plant and equipment, based on annual analysis of such useful lives, and revise such lives to the extent warranted by changing facts and circumstances. any changes in estimated useful lives as a result of this analysis are reflected prospectively beginning in the period in which the study is completed. our analysis of useful lives in 2014 did not indicate a change in useful lives.  the effect of a one-year decrease in the weighted average remaining useful life of our property, plant and equipment as of december 31, 2014 would be an increase in annual depreciation expense of approximately $83 million.  the effect of a one-year increase in the weighted average remaining useful life of our property, plant and equipment as of december 31, 2014 would be a decrease in annual depreciation expense of approximately $224 million.
depreciation expense related to property, plant and equipment totaled $1.8 billion, $1.6 billion and $1.4 billion for the years ended december 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively, representing approximately 22%, 22% and 21% of costs and expenses, respectively. depreciation is recorded using the straight-line composite method over management's estimate of the useful lives of the related assets as listed below:
cable distribution systems....................................           7-20 years customer equipment and installations.......................     3-8 years vehicles and equipment.......................................               3-6 years buildings and leasehold improvements.....................     15-40 years furniture, fixtures and equipment............................      6-10 years intangible assets valuation and impairment of franchises. the net carrying value of franchises as of december 31, 2014 and 2013 was approximately $6.0 billion (representing 24% of total assets) and $6.0 billion (representing 35% of total assets), respectively. for more information and a complete discussion of how we test franchise assets for impairment, see note 6 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements contained in "part ii. item 8. financial statements and supplementary data."
in 2014, 2013 and 2012, we concluded that it is more likely than not that the fair value of the franchise assets in each unit of accounting exceeds the carrying value of such assets and therefore did not perform a quantitative analysis. at our last quantitative assessment, the fair value of franchises exceeded the book values for each unit of accounting by 24% to 89%.
valuation and impairment of goodwill. the net carrying value of goodwill as of december 31, 2014 and 2013 was approximately $1.2 billion (representing 5% of total assets) and $1.2 billion (representing 7% of total assets), respectively. for more information and a complete discussion on our valuation methodology, see note 6 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements contained in "part ii. item 8. financial statements and supplementary data."
as with our franchise impairment testing, in 2014, 2013 and 2012, we elected to perform a qualitative assessment for our goodwill impairment testing and concluded that our goodwill is not impaired.
valuation, impairment and amortization of customer relationships. the net carrying value of customer relationships as of december 31, 2014 and 2013 was approximately $1.1 billion (representing 5% of total assets) and $1.4 billion (representing 8% of total assets), respectively. amortization expense related to customer relationships for the years ended december 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012 was approximately $282 million, $284 million and $280 million, respectively. for more information and a complete discussion on our valuation methodology, see note 6 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements contained in "part ii. item 8. financial statements and supplementary data."
impairment of trademarks. the net carrying value of trademarks as of both december 31, 2014 and 2013 was approximately $159 million and $158 million, respectively (representing 1% of total assets for both periods). for more information and a complete discussion on our valuation methodology, see note 6 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements contained in "part ii. item 8. financial statements and supplementary data." the qualitative analysis in 2014, 2013 and 2012 did not identify any factors that would indicate that it was more likely than not that the fair value of trademarks were less than the carrying value and thus resulted in no impairment.
income taxes all of charter's operations are held through charter holdco and its direct and indirect subsidiaries. charter holdco and the majority of its subsidiaries are generally limited liability companies that are not subject to income tax. however, certain of these
43
limited liability companies are subject to state income tax. in addition, the indirect subsidiaries that are corporations are subject to federal and state income tax. all of the remaining taxable income, gains, losses, deductions and credits of charter holdco pass through to charter and its direct subsidiaries.
as of december 31, 2014, charter and its indirect corporate subsidiaries had approximately $9.5 billion of federal tax net operating loss carryforwards resulting in a gross deferred tax asset of approximately $3.3 billion. federal tax net operating loss carryforwards expire in the years 2020 through 2034. these losses resulted from the operations of charter holdco and its subsidiaries. in addition, as of december 31, 2014, charter and its indirect corporate subsidiaries had state tax net operating loss carryforwards, resulting in a gross deferred tax asset (net of federal tax benefit) of approximately $321 million. state tax net operating loss carryforwards generally expire in the years 2015 through 2034.  due to uncertainties in projected future taxable income, valuation allowances have been established against the gross deferred tax assets for book accounting purposes, except for future taxable income that will result from the reversal of existing temporary differences for which deferred tax liabilities are recognized.  such tax loss carryforwards can accumulate and be used to offset charter's future taxable income.
as of december 31, 2014, $5.3 billion of federal tax loss carryforwards are unrestricted and available for charter's immediate use, while approximately $4.2 billion of federal tax loss carryforwards are still subject to section 382 and other restrictions. pursuant to these restrictions, charter estimates that approximately $2.0 billion and $400 million in the years 2015 and 2016, respectively, and an additional $226 million annually over each of the next eight years of federal tax loss carryforwards, should become unrestricted and available for charter's use. both charter's indirect corporate subsidiary and state tax loss carryforwards are subject to similar but varying restrictions.
in addition to its tax loss carryforwards, charter also has tax basis of $4.5 billion in intangible assets and $4.6 billion in property, plant, and equipment as of december 31, 2014. the tax basis in these assets is not subject to section 382 limitations and therefore is currently deductible as depreciated or amortized. for illustrative purposes, charter expects to reflect tax-deductible amortization and depreciation on assets owned as of december 31, 2014, beginning at approximately $1.9 billion in 2015 and $3.9 billion between 2016 through 2019, decelerating annually. the foregoing projected deductions do not include any amortization or depreciation related to future capital spend or potential acquisitions. in addition, the deductions assume charter does not dispose of a material portion of its business or make modifications to the underlying partnerships it owns, all of which may materially affect the timing or amount of its existing amortization and depreciation deductions. any one of these factors including pending transactions, future legislation or adjustments by the irs upon examination could also affect the projected deductions.
as of december 31, 2014 and 2013, we have recorded net deferred income tax liabilities of $1.6 billion and $1.4 billion, respectively. net deferred tax liabilities included approximately $236 million and $226 million at december 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively, relating to certain indirect subsidiaries of charter holdco that file separate federal or state income tax returns.  the remainder of our net deferred tax liability arose from charter's investment in charter holdco, and was largely attributable to the characterization of franchises for financial reporting purposes as indefinite-lived. as part of our net liability, on december 31, 2014 and 2013, we had gross deferred tax assets of $4.4 billion and $3.9 billion, respectively, which primarily relate to tax losses allocated to charter from charter holdco. in assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets, management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will be realized. due to our history of losses and limitations imposed by section 382 of the code discussed above, we were unable to assume future taxable income in our analysis and accordingly valuation allowances have been established except for deferred benefits available to offset certain deferred tax liabilities that will reverse over time.  accordingly, our gross deferred tax assets have been offset with a corresponding valuation allowance of $3.1 billion and $3.0 billion at december 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. the amount of the deferred tax assets considered realizable and, therefore, reflected in the consolidated balance sheet, would be increased at such time that it is more-likely-than-not future taxable income will be realized during the carryforward period. we periodically evaluate the facts and circumstances surrounding this assessment and, at the time this consideration is met, an adjustment to reverse some portion of the existing valuation allowance would result.
in determining our tax provision for financial reporting purposes, charter establishes a reserve for uncertain tax positions unless such positions are determined to be "more likely than not" of being sustained upon examination, based on their technical merits. in evaluating whether a tax position has met the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold, we presume the position will be examined by the appropriate taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information. a tax position that meets the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold is measured to determine the amount of benefit to be recognized in our financial statements. the tax position is measured as the largest amount of benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized when the position is ultimately resolved. there is considerable judgment involved in determining whether positions taken on the tax return are "more likely than not" of being sustained.
charter adjusts its uncertain tax reserve estimates periodically because of ongoing examinations by, and settlements with, the various taxing authorities, as well as changes in tax laws, regulations and interpretations.
44
no tax years for charter or charter holdco, for income tax purposes, are currently under examination by the irs.  tax years ending 2011 through 2014 remain subject to examination and assessment. years prior to 2011 remain open solely for purposes of examination of charter's loss and credit carryforwards.
litigation legal contingencies have a high degree of uncertainty. when a loss from a contingency becomes estimable and probable, a reserve is established. the reserve reflects management's best estimate of the probable cost of ultimate resolution of the matter and is revised as facts and circumstances change. a reserve is released when a matter is ultimately brought to closure or the statute of limitations lapses. we have established reserves for certain matters. although certain matters are not expected individually to have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition, results of operations or liquidity, such matters could have, in the aggregate, a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition, results of operations or liquidity.
programming agreements we exercise significant judgment in estimating programming expense associated with certain video programming contracts. our policy is to record video programming costs based on our contractual agreements with our programming vendors, which are generally multi-year agreements that provide for us to make payments to the programming vendors at agreed upon market rates based on the number of customers to which we provide the programming service. if a programming contract expires prior to the parties' entry into a new agreement and we continue to distribute the service, we estimate the programming costs during the period there is no contract in place. in doing so, we consider the previous contractual rates, inflation and the status of the negotiations in determining our estimates. when the programming contract terms are finalized, an adjustment to programming expense is recorded, if necessary, to reflect the terms of the new contract. we also make estimates in the recognition of programming expense related to other items, such as the accounting for free periods, timing of rate increases and credits from service interruptions, as well as the allocation of consideration exchanged between the parties in multiple-element transactions.
significant judgment is also involved when we enter into agreements that result in us receiving cash consideration from the programming vendor, usually in the form of advertising sales, channel positioning fees, launch support or marketing support. in these situations, we must determine based upon facts and circumstances if such cash consideration should be recorded as revenue, a reduction in programming expense or a reduction in another expense category (e.g., marketing).

advertising sales revenues consist primarily of revenues from commercial advertising customers, programmers and other vendors. advertising sales revenues increased in 2014 primarily as a result of an increase in revenue from the political sector of $30 million. advertising sales revenues decreased in 2013 primarily as a result of a decrease in revenue from the political and retail sectors of $30 million and $20 million, respectively. the bresnan acquisition increased advertising sales revenue by approximately $7 million in each of 2014 and 2013 compared to the corresponding prior year periods.
other revenues consist of home shopping, late payment fees, wire maintenance fees and other miscellaneous revenues. the decrease in 2014 was primarily due to a decrease in wire maintenance fees. the increase in 2013 was primarily the result of increases in late payment fees. the bresnan acquisition increased other revenues in each of 2014 and 2013 compared to the corresponding prior year periods by approximately $2 million.
operating costs and expenses. the increases in our operating costs and expenses are attributable to the following (dollars in millions):
2014 compared to 2013             2013 compared to 2012
programming                                               $234                              $108

programming costs were approximately $2.5 billion, $2.1 billion and $2.0 billion, representing 41%, 40% and 40% of operating costs and expenses for each of the years ended december 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. programming costs consist primarily of costs paid to programmers for basic, digital, premium, video on demand, and pay-per-view programming. the increase in programming costs is primarily a result of annual contractual rate adjustments, including increases in amounts paid for retransmission consents, broader carriage of certain networks as a result of our all-digital initiative and the introduction of new networks to charter's video offering. we expect programming expenses to continue to increase due to a variety of factors, including annual increases imposed by programmers with additional selling power as a result of media consolidation, increased demands by owners of broadcast stations for payment for retransmission consent or linking carriage of other services to retransmission consent, and additional programming, particularly new sports services. we have been unable to fully pass these increases on to our customers nor do we expect to be able to do so in the future without a potential loss of customers.
costs to service customers include residential and commercial costs related to field operations, network operations and customer care including internal and third party labor for installations, service and repair, maintenance, billing and collection, occupancy and vehicle costs. the increase in costs to service customers was primarily the result of higher spending on labor to deliver
48
improved products and service levels and higher collection costs. during 2013, the increase was also the result of greater reconnect expense.
the increase in marketing costs during 2014 and 2013 was the result of heavier sales activity and sales channel development.
the increases in other expense are attributable to the following (dollars in millions):
2014 compared to 2013            2013 compared to 2012
administrative labor                          $46                              $(4         )

the increase in administrative labor in 2014 compared to 2013 relates primarily to increases in the number of employees. commercial sales expense and advertising sales expenses increased in 2014 and 2013 compared to the corresponding prior periods primarily related to growth in these businesses. the increase in bad debt in 2014 compared to 2013 is primarily related to a third quarter change in our collections policy and lower recoveries. the increase in property tax and insurance in 2013 compared to 2012 relates primarily to increases in the number of employees and vehicles.
depreciation and amortization. depreciation and amortization expense increased by $248 million and $141 million in 2014 and 2013, respectively, which primarily represents depreciation on more recent capital expenditures and the bresnan acquisition offset by certain assets becoming fully depreciated.
other operating expenses, net. the changes in other operating expenses, net are attributable to the following (dollars in millions):
2014 compared to 2013            2013 compared to 2012
increases in merger and acquisitions costs                    $22                              $15

interest expense, net.  net interest expense increased by $65 million in 2014 from 2013 and decreased by $61 million in 2013 from 2012. net interest expense increased in 2014 compared to 2013 primarily as a result of an increase in our weighted average debt outstanding from $13.6 billion for the year ended december 31, 2013 to $15.8 billion for the year ended december 31, 2014 offset by a decrease in our weighted average interest rate from 5.8% for the year ended december 31, 2013 to 5.5% for the year ended december 31, 2014. during the year ended december 31, 2014, we incurred approximately $75 million of interest expense associated with debt which proceeds are currently held in escrow pending consummation of the transactions. net interest expense decreased in 2013 compared to 2012 primarily as a result of a decrease in our weighted average interest rate from 6.5% for the year ended december 31, 2012 to 5.8% for the year ended december 31, 2013 offset by an increase in our weighted average debt outstanding from $13.0 billion for the year ended december 31, 2012 to $13.6 billion for the year ended december 31, 2013.

gain (loss) on derivative instruments, net. interest rate derivative instruments are held to manage our interest costs and reduce our exposure to increases in floating interest rates. we recognized a loss of $7 million and a gain of $11 million during the years ended december 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively, which represents the amortization of accumulated other comprehensive loss for interest rate derivative instruments no longer designated as hedges for accounting purposes offset by their change in fair value. for more information, see note 11 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements contained in "part ii. item 8. financial statements and supplementary data."
income tax expense. income tax expense of $236 million, $120 million and $257 million was recognized for the years ended december 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively, primarily through increases in deferred tax liabilities related to our investment in charter holdco and certain of our indirect subsidiaries, in addition to $3 million, $8 million and $7 million of current federal and state income tax expense, respectively. income tax expense for the year ended december 31, 2013 decreased compared to the corresponding prior period, primarily as a result of step-ups in basis of indefinite-lived assets for tax, but not gaap purposes, including the effects of partnership gains related to financing transactions and a partnership restructuring, which decreased our net deferred tax liability related to indefinite-lived assets by $137 million. our tax provision in future periods will vary based on various factors including changes in our deferred tax liabilities attributable to indefinite-lived intangibles, as well as future operating results, however we do not anticipate having such a large reduction in income tax expense attributable to these items unless we enter into restructuring transactions or similar future financing. the ultimate impact on the tax provision of such future financing and restructuring activities, if any, will be dependent on the underlying facts and circumstances at the time.
net loss. we incurred net loss of $183 million, $169 million and $304 million for the years ended december 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively, primarily as a result of the factors described above.
loss per common share. during 2014 and 2013, net loss per common share increased by $0.05 and decreased by $1.40, respectively, as a result of the factors described above.
use of adjusted ebitda and free cash flow we use certain measures that are not defined by gaap to evaluate various aspects of our business. adjusted ebitda and free cash flow are non-gaap financial measures and should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for, net loss and net cash flows from operating activities reported in accordance with gaap. these terms, as defined by us, may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies. adjusted ebitda and free cash flow are reconciled to net loss and net cash flows from operating activities, respectively, below.
adjusted ebitda is defined as net loss plus net interest expense, income taxes, depreciation and amortization, stock compensation expense, loss on extinguishment of debt, (gain) loss on derivative instruments, net and other operating expenses, such as merger and acquisition costs, special charges and (gain) loss on sale or retirement of assets. as such, it eliminates the significant non-cash depreciation and amortization expense that results from the capital-intensive nature of our businesses as well as other non-cash or special items, and is unaffected by our capital structure or investment activities. adjusted ebitda is used by management and charter's board of directors to evaluate the performance of our business. however, this measure is limited in that it does not reflect
50
the periodic costs of certain capitalized tangible and intangible assets used in generating revenues and our cash cost of financing. management evaluates these costs through other financial measures.
free cash flow is defined as net cash flows from operating activities, less capital expenditures and changes in accrued expenses related to capital expenditures.
we believe that adjusted ebitda and free cash flow provide information useful to investors in assessing our performance and our ability to service our debt, fund operations and make additional investments with internally generated funds. in addition, adjusted ebitda generally correlates to the leverage ratio calculation under our credit facilities or outstanding notes to determine compliance with the covenants contained in the facilities and notes (all such documents have been previously filed with the united states securities and exchange commission). for the purpose of calculating compliance with leverage covenants, we use adjusted ebitda, as presented, excluding certain expenses paid by our operating subsidiaries to other charter entities. our debt covenants refer to these expenses as management fees, which fees were in the amount of $253 million, $201 million and $191 million for the years ended december 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively.

liquidity and capital resources introduction this section contains a discussion of our liquidity and capital resources, including a discussion of our cash position, sources and uses of cash, access to credit facilities and other financing sources, historical financing activities, cash needs, capital expenditures and outstanding debt.
overview of our contractual obligations and liquidity we have significant amounts of debt, including approximately $7.0 billion which proceeds are currently held in escrow pending consummation of the transactions.  the accreted value of our debt as of december 31, 2014 was $21.0 billion, consisting of $7.2 billion of credit facility debt and $13.8 billion of high-yield notes. our business requires significant cash to fund principal and interest payments on our debt.  as of december 31, 2014, $91 million of our long-term debt matures in 2015, $127 million in 2016, $1.1 billion in 2017, $967 million in 2018, $1.5 billion in 2019 and $17.3 billion thereafter. as of december 31, 2014, we had other contractual obligations, including interest on our debt, totaling $9.3 billion.
our projected cash needs and projected sources of liquidity depend upon, among other things, our actual results, and the timing and amount of our expenditures. free cash flow was $171 million, $409 million and $144 million for the years ended december 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. as of december 31, 2014, the amount available under our credit facilities was approximately
51
$817 million. in addition, a $500 million revolver extension is currently committed and available to charter. the availability of this revolver is not contingent or related to the closing of the transactions. we expect to utilize free cash flow and availability under our credit facilities as well as future refinancing transactions to further extend the maturities of or reduce the principal on our obligations. the timing and terms of any refinancing transactions will be subject to market conditions. additionally, we may, from time to time, depending on market conditions and other factors, use cash on hand and the proceeds from securities offerings or other borrowings, to retire our debt through open market purchases, privately negotiated purchases, tender offers, or redemption provisions. we believe we have sufficient liquidity from cash on hand, free cash flow and charter operating's revolving credit facility as well as access to the capital markets to fund our projected operating cash needs.
we continue to evaluate the deployment of our anticipated future free cash flow including to reduce our leverage, and to invest in our business growth and other strategic opportunities, including mergers and acquisitions as well as stock repurchases and dividends. as possible acquisitions, swaps or dispositions arise in our industry, we actively review them against our objectives including, among other considerations, improving the operational efficiency, clustering or technology capabilities of our business and achieving appropriate return targets, and we may participate to the extent we believe these possibilities present attractive opportunities. however, there can be no assurance that we will actually complete any acquisition, disposition or system swap, including the transactions with comcast, or that any such transactions will be material to our operations or results. see "part i. item 1a. risk factors - our inability to successfully acquire and integrate other businesses, assets, products or technologies could harm our operating results."
free cash flow free cash flow was $171 million, $409 million and $144 million for the years ended december 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. the decrease in free cash flow in 2014 compared to 2013 is primarily due to an increase of $396 million in capital expenditures primarily driven by our all-digital transition, an increase of $87 million in cash paid for interest, changes in operating assets and liabilities, excluding the change in accrued interest, that provided $52 million less cash during 2014 and an increase of $22 million in merger and acquisition costs. the increase in cash paid for interest includes approximately $52 million related to debt which proceeds are currently held in escrow pending consummation of the transactions. the decrease in free cash flow was offset by an increase of $332 million in adjusted ebitda.
the increase in free cash flow in 2013 compared to 2012 is primarily due to an increase of $164 million in adjusted ebitda, a decrease of $141 million in cash paid for interest due to a decrease in our average interest rate and timing of interest payments with the completion of refinancings, and changes in operating assets and liabilities, excluding the change in accrued interest, that provided $31 million more cash during 2013. the increase in free cash flow was offset by an increase of $80 million in capital expenditures of which $30 million was related to bresnan.

(b)   interest payments on variable debt are estimated using amounts outstanding at december 31, 2014 and the average implied forward london interbank offering rate ("libor") rates applicable for the quarter during the interest rate reset based on the yield curve in effect at december 31, 2014. actual interest payments will differ based on actual libor rates and actual amounts outstanding for applicable periods.
(c)   we lease certain facilities and equipment under noncancelable operating leases. leases and rental costs charged to expense for the years ended december 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, were $43 million, $34 million and $28 million, respectively.
(d)   we pay programming fees under multi-year contracts ranging from three to ten years, typically based on a flat fee per customer, which may be fixed for the term, or may in some cases escalate over the term. programming costs included in the accompanying statement of operations were approximately $2.5 billion, $2.1 billion and $2.0 billion, for the years ended december 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. certain of our programming agreements are based on a flat fee per month or have guaranteed minimum payments. the table sets forth the aggregate guaranteed minimum commitments under our programming contracts.
(e)   "other" represents other guaranteed minimum commitments, which consist primarily of commitments to our customer premise equipment vendors.
the following items are not included in the contractual obligations table because the obligations are not fixed and/or determinable due to various factors discussed below. however, we incur these costs as part of our operations:
•   we rent utility poles used in our operations. generally, pole rentals are cancelable on short notice, but we anticipate that such rentals will recur. rent expense incurred for pole rental attachments for the years ended december 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012 was $49 million, $49 million and $47 million, respectively.
•   we pay franchise fees under multi-year franchise agreements based on a percentage of revenues generated from video service per year. we also pay other franchise related costs, such as public education grants, under multi-year agreements. franchise fees and other franchise-related costs included in the accompanying statement of operations were $208 million, $190 million and $176 million for the years ended december 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively.
•   we also have $85 million in letters of credit, primarily to our various worker's compensation, property and casualty, and general liability carriers, as collateral for reimbursement of claims.
limitations on distributions distributions by charter's subsidiaries to a parent company for payment of principal on parent company notes are restricted under indentures and credit facilities governing our indebtedness, unless there is no default under the applicable indenture and credit facilities, and unless each applicable subsidiary's leverage ratio test is met at the time of such distribution. as of december 31, 2014, there was no default under any of these indentures or credit facilities and each subsidiary met its applicable leverage ratio
54
tests based on december 31, 2014 financial results. such distributions would be restricted, however, if any such subsidiary fails to meet these tests at the time of the contemplated distribution. in the past, certain subsidiaries have from time to time failed to meet their leverage ratio test. there can be no assurance that they will satisfy these tests at the time of the contemplated distribution. distributions by charter operating for payment of principal on cco holdings' notes or ccoh safari notes are further restricted by the covenants in its credit facilities.
in addition to the limitation on distributions under the various indentures discussed above, distributions by our subsidiaries may be limited by applicable law, including the delaware limited liability company act, under which our subsidiaries may only make distributions if they have "surplus" as defined in the act.
historical operating, investing, and financing activities cash and cash equivalents. we held $3 million and $21 million in cash and cash equivalents as of december 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. we held $7.1 billion in restricted cash and cash equivalents as of december 31, 2014.
operating activities.  net cash provided by operating activities increased $201 million from $2.2 billion for the year ended december 31, 2013 to $2.4 billion for the year ended december 31, 2014, primarily due to an increase in adjusted ebitda of $332 million offset by an $87 million increase in cash paid for interest and a $22 million increase in merger and acquisition costs.
net cash provided by operating activities increased $282 million from $1.9 billion for the year ended december 31, 2012 to $2.2 billion for the year ended december 31, 2013, primarily due to an increase in adjusted ebitda of $164 million and a $141 million decrease in our cash paid for interest offset by changes in operating assets and liabilities, excluding the change in accrued interest and in liabilities related to capital expenditures, that provided $32 million less cash during 2013.
investing activities. net cash used in investing activities for the years ended december 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, was $9.3 billion, $2.4 billion and $1.7 billion, respectively. the increase in 2014 compared to 2013 is primarily due to the investment of $7.1 billion of net proceeds from the issuance of the term loan g and ccoh safari notes in long-term restricted cash and cash equivalents and higher capital expenditures offset by $676 million cash paid for the bresnan acquisition (net of debt assumed) in 2013. the increase in 2013 compared to 2012 is primarily due to $676 million cash paid for the bresnan acquisition (net of debt assumed) and higher capital expenditures.
financing activities. net cash provided by financing activities was $6.9 billion and $299 million for the years ended december 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively, and net cash used in financing activities was $134 million for the year ended december 31, 2012. the increase in cash provided during the year ended december 31, 2014 as compared to the corresponding period in 2013, was primarily due to the issuance of the term loan g and ccoh safari notes in 2014. the increase in cash provided during the year ended december 31, 2013 as compared to the corresponding period in 2012, was primarily the result of an increase in the amount by which borrowings of long-term debt exceeded repayments of long-term debt and an increase in proceeds from the exercise of options and warrants.
capital expenditures we have significant ongoing capital expenditure requirements.  capital expenditures were $2.2 billion, $1.8 billion and $1.7 billion for the years ended december 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively.  the increase was driven by approximately $410 million related to our all-digital transition, investment in cpe to support customer growth, higher product development investments and ongoing insourcing initiative and the acquisition of bresnan. see the table below for more details.
we currently expect capital expenditures in 2015 to be approximately $1.7 billion excluding potential expenditures related to the transactions. we anticipate 2015 capital expenditures to be driven by growth in residential and commercial customers along with further spend related to product development. our expected capital expenditures for 2015 are lower than capital expenditures in 2014 due to the completion of our all-digital initiative in 2014. the actual amount of our capital expenditures in 2015 will depend on a number of factors including the pace of transition planning to service a larger customer base upon closing of the transactions.
our capital expenditures are funded primarily from cash flows from operating activities and borrowings on our credit facility. in addition, our liabilities related to capital expenditures increased by $33 million, $76 million and $13 million for the years ended december 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively.

description of our outstanding debt overview as of december 31, 2014 and 2013, the blended weighted average interest rate on our debt was 5.4% and 5.6%, respectively. the interest rate on approximately 72% and 84% of the total principal amount of our debt was effectively fixed, including the effects of our interest rate hedge agreements as of december 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively, and including $7.0 billion of debt which proceeds are currently held in escrow pending consummation of the transactions as of december 31, 2014. the fair value of our high-yield notes was $14.2 billion and $10.4 billion at december 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. the fair value of our credit facilities was $7.2 billion and $3.8 billion at december 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. the fair value of our high-yield notes and credit facilities were based on quoted market prices.
the following description is a summary of certain provisions of our credit facilities and our note indentures (the "debt agreements"). the summary does not restate the terms of the debt agreements in their entirety, nor does it describe all the terms of the debt agreements. the agreements and instruments governing each of the debt agreements are complicated and you should consult such agreements and instruments for more detailed information regarding the debt agreements.
charter operating credit facilities - general the charter operating credit facilities have an outstanding principal amount of $3.7 billion at december 31, 2014 as follows:
•   a term loan a with a remaining principal amount of $684 million, which is repayable in quarterly installments and aggregating $38 million in 2015, $66 million in 2016 and $75 million in 2017, with the remaining balance due at final maturity on april 22, 2018;
•   a term loan e with a remaining principal amount of approximately $1.5 billion, which is repayable in equal quarterly installments and aggregating $15 million in each loan year, with the remaining balance due at final maturity on july 1, 2020;
56
•   a term loan f with a remaining principal amount of approximately $1.2 billion, which is repayable in equal quarterly installments and aggregating $12 million in each loan year, with the remaining balance due at final maturity on january 3, 2021; and
•   a revolving loan with an outstanding balance of $399 million at december 31, 2014 and allowing for borrowings of up to $1.3 billion, maturing on april 22, 2018.
amounts outstanding under the charter operating credit facilities bear interest, at charter operating's election, at a base rate or libor, as defined, plus a margin. the applicable libor margin for the term loan a is currently 2.00%. the term loans e and f bear interest at libor plus 2.25%, with a libor floor of 0.75%. charter operating pays interest equal to libor plus 2.00% on amounts borrowed under the revolving credit facility and pays a revolving commitment fee of 0.30% per annum on the daily average available amount of the revolving commitment, payable quarterly.
the charter operating credit facilities also allow us to enter into incremental term loans in the future (including the incremental term loan a-2 described below), with amortization as set forth in the notices establishing such term loans. although the charter operating credit facilities allow for the incurrence of a certain amount of incremental term loans subject to pro-forma compliance with its financial maintenance covenants, no assurance can be given that we could obtain additional incremental term loans in the future if charter operating sought to do so or what amount of incremental term loans would be allowable at any given time under the terms of the charter operating credit facilities.
as previously announced in july 2014, charter operating received a commitment from certain lenders to provide up to $1.0 billion in an incremental term loan a-2. the incremental term loan a-2 loan forms a portion of the incremental facilities commitments that would be used to fund the purchase of certain assets pursuant to the transaction. if issued, such term loan a-2 loan would be issued under the charter operating credit facilities, would have a five year maturity and would bear interest at libor plus 2.00%.
the obligations of charter operating under the charter operating credit facilities are guaranteed by charter operating's immediate parent company, cco holdings, and subsidiaries of charter operating. the obligations are also secured by (i) a lien on substantially all of the assets of charter operating and its subsidiaries (excluding cco safari), to the extent such lien can be perfected under the uniform commercial code by the filing of a financing statement, and (ii) a pledge by cco holdings of the equity interests owned by it in charter operating or any of charter operating's subsidiaries, as well as intercompany obligations owing to it by any of such entities.
cco safari credit facility - general in september 2014, charter operating entered into a new term loan g facility pursuant to the terms of the charter operating credit agreement providing for a $3.5 billion term loan maturing in 2021. pricing on the term loan g was set at libor plus 3.50% with a libor floor of 0.75% and issued at a price of 99.50% of the aggregate principal amount. the term loan g forms a portion of the incremental facilities commitments as announced by us in july 2014 that will be used to fund the purchase of certain assets pursuant to the transactions. charter operating assigned all of its obligations with respect to the term loan g and transferred all of the proceeds from the term loan g to a newly-created subsidiary, cco safari, which is considered a non-recourse subsidiary under charter operating's credit agreement, and cco safari placed the funds in an escrow account pending closing of the transactions over which the administrative agent has a perfected first priority security interest on behalf of the lenders that are a party to the cco safari credit facility. the amounts borrowed under the term loan g facility are not considered when calculating the leverage ratio on the cco holdings indentures as cco safari has been designated as an unrestricted subsidiary under the cco holdings indenture. at closing of the transactions, subject to certain conditions, charter operating will re-assume the obligations in respect of the term loan g under the charter operating credit agreement and the term loan g will be subject to the terms and conditions of the charter operating credit facilities. such amounts, along with required original issuance discount and one month of interest, were placed in escrow and classified as noncurrent restricted cash and cash equivalents in our consolidated balance sheet as of december 31, 2014. to the extent the transactions do not close, such amounts placed in escrow must be used to settle amounts outstanding under the term loan g. see "part i. item i. business - transactions with comcast."
charter operating credit facilities - restrictive covenants the charter operating credit facilities contain representations and warranties, and affirmative and negative covenants customary for financings of this type. the financial covenants measure performance against standards set for leverage to be tested as of the end of each quarter. the charter operating credit facilities contain provisions requiring mandatory loan prepayments under specific circumstances, including in connection with certain sales of assets, so long as the proceeds have not been reinvested in the business. additionally, the charter operating credit facilities provisions contain an allowance for restricted payments so long as the consolidated leverage ratio at charter operating (excludes debt of cco safari since it is a non-recourse subsidiary) is no greater
57
than 3.5 after giving pro forma effect to such restricted payment. the charter operating credit facilities permit charter operating and its subsidiaries to make distributions to pay interest on the currently outstanding subordinated and parent company indebtedness, provided that, among other things, no default has occurred and is continuing under the charter operating credit facilities.
the events of default under the charter operating credit facilities include, among other things:
•   the failure to make payments when due or within the applicable grace period;
•   the failure to comply with specified covenants including the covenant to maintain the consolidated leverage ratio at charter operating (excluding debt of cco safari since it is a non-recourse subsidiary) at or below 5.0 to 1.0 and the consolidated first lien leverage ratio at or below 4.0 to 1.0;
•   the failure to pay or the occurrence of events that cause or permit the acceleration of other indebtedness owing by cco holdings, charter operating, or charter operating's subsidiaries in aggregate principal amounts in excess of $100 million; and
•   similar to provisions contained in the note indentures, the consummation of any change of control transaction resulting in any person or group having power, directly or indirectly, to vote more than 50% of the ordinary voting power for the management of charter operating on a fully diluted basis and the occurrence of a ratings event including a downgrade in the corporate family rating during a ratings decline period.
at december 31, 2014, charter operating had a consolidated leverage ratio of approximately 1.3 to 1.0 and a consolidated first lien leverage ratio of 1.0 to 1.0. both ratios are in compliance with the ratios required by the charter operating credit facilities. a failure by charter operating to maintain the financial covenants would result in an event of default under the charter operating credit facilities and the debt of cco holdings. see "- cross acceleration" and "part i. item 1a. risk factors - the agreements and instruments governing our debt contain restrictions and limitations that could significantly affect our ability to operate our business, as well as significantly affect our liquidity."
cco safari credit facility - restrictive covenants the term loan g is subject to the terms and conditions of a separate credit facility and escrow agreement until charter operating reassumes its obligations for the loan. the cco safari credit facility contains customary representations and warranties and affirmative covenants with limited negative covenants prohibiting cco safari from engaging in any material activities other than performing its obligations under the credit facility and the escrow agreement or otherwise issuing other indebtedness pursuant to escrow arrangements similar to the cco safari credit facility and escrow agreement. as required by the cco safari credit facility, cco safari, bank of america, n.a., and u.s. bank, n.a., as escrow agent, entered into an escrow agreement pursuant to which, cco safari is required to maintain an escrow account over which the administrative agent has a perfected first priority security interest on behalf of the cco safari credit facility lenders. the events of default under the cco safari credit facility include, among others:
•   the failure to make payments when due or within the applicable grace period;
•   any acceleration of the loans and termination of the commitments under the charter operating credit facilities; and
•   the escrow agreement shall cease to be in full force and effect or the lien in the escrow account shall cease to be enforceable with the same effect and priority.
ccoh safari notes in october 2014, charter created ccoh safari as a 100% wholly-owned indirect finance subsidiary of charter. in november 2014, ccoh safari, closed on transactions in which it issued $1.5 billion aggregate principal amount of 5.50% senior notes due 2022 and $2.0 billion aggregate principal amount of 5.75% senior notes due 2024. the net proceeds of the offering and sale of the ccoh safari notes and the next semi-annual interest payment will be held in escrow to fund a portion of the purchase of certain assets pursuant to the transactions. the release of the proceeds from the escrow will be subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions, including the closing of the transactions. substantially concurrently with the escrow release, the ccoh safari notes will become obligations of cco holdings and cco holdings capital. ccoh safari will merge into cco holdings. should the transactions agreement be terminated prior to the consummation of the transactions, or upon expiration of the escrow agreement on november 5, 2015, such amounts placed in escrow must be used to settle amounts outstanding under the ccoh safari notes at par value. the amounts held in escrow are classified as noncurrent restricted cash and cash equivalents in our consolidated balance sheet as of december 31, 2014. see "part i. item i. business - transactions with comcast."
initially, the ccoh safari notes are senior debt obligations of ccoh safari. upon release of the proceeds from escrow, the ccoh safari notes will be senior debt obligations of cco holdings and cco holdings capital corp. and rank equally with all other current and future unsecured, unsubordinated obligations of cco holdings and cco holdings capital corp.  the ccoh

summary of restrictive covenants of our note indentures the following description is a summary of certain restrictions of our note indentures. the summary does not restate the terms of the note indentures in their entirety, nor does it describe all restrictions. the agreements and instruments governing each of the notes issued are complicated and you should consult such agreements and instruments for more detailed information regarding the notes issued.
the ccoh safari notes were issued pursuant to a base indenture and a first and second supplemental indenture to that base all dated november 5, 2014 (the "ccoh safari indentures"). the ccoh safari indentures provide that, with limited exceptions of covenants regarding compliance certificates and stay, extension and usury laws, covenants restricting the activities of the note issuer and its subsidiaries do not apply until such time as the ccoh safari note proceeds are released from escrow. as stated previously, substantially concurrently with the escrow release, the ccoh safari notes will become obligations of cco holdings and cco holdings capital, ccoh safari will merge with cco holdings and the terms and conditions of the ccoh safari indentures will apply to cco holdings and cco holdings capital.
the notes issued by cco holdings and cco holdings capital were issued pursuant to certain indentures referred to in this section as the "cco holdings indentures." the cco holdings indentures and the ccoh safari indentures (following the release of proceeds from escrow) contain covenants that restrict the ability of cco holdings and its subsidiaries to, among other things:
•   incur indebtedness;
•   pay dividends or make distributions in respect of capital stock and other restricted payments;
•   issue equity;
•   make investments;
•   create liens;
•   sell assets;
•   consolidate, merge, or sell all or substantially all assets;
•   create restrictions on the ability of restricted subsidiaries to make certain payments; or
•   enter into transactions with affiliates.
however, such covenants are subject to a number of important qualifications and exceptions. below we set forth a brief summary of certain of the restrictive covenants.
60
restrictions on additional debt the limitations on incurrence of debt and issuance of preferred stock contained in the cco holdings indentures and the ccoh safari indentures permit cco holdings and its restricted subsidiaries to incur additional debt or issue preferred stock, so long as, after giving pro forma effect to the incurrence, the leverage ratio would be below a specified level for cco holdings. the leverage ratio under the indentures is 6.0 to 1.
in addition, regardless of whether the leverage ratio could be met, so long as no default exists or would result from the incurrence or issuance, cco holdings and its restricted subsidiaries are permitted to issue among other permitted indebtedness:
•   up to $1.5 billion of debt under credit facilities not otherwise allocated;
•   up to the greater of $300 million (or $600 million in the case of the notes issued under the ccoh safari indentures)
and 5% of consolidated net tangible assets to finance the purchase or capital lease of new assets;
•   up to the greater of $300 million (or $600 million in the case of the notes issued under the ccoh safari indentures)
and 5% of consolidated net tangible assets of additional debt for any purpose; and
•   other items of indebtedness for specific purposes such as intercompany debt, refinancing of existing debt, and interest rate swaps to provide protection against fluctuation in interest rates.
indebtedness under a single facility or agreement may be incurred in part under one of the categories listed above and in part under another, and generally may also later be reclassified into another category including as debt incurred under the leverage ratio. accordingly, indebtedness under our credit facilities may be incurred under a combination of the categories of permitted indebtedness listed above. the restricted subsidiaries of cco holdings are generally not permitted to issue subordinated debt securities.
restrictions on distributions generally, under the indentures governing notes issued by cco holdings and ccoh safari, cco holdings and its respective restricted subsidiaries are permitted to pay dividends on or repurchase equity interests, or make other specified restricted payments, only if it can incur $1.00 of new debt under the 6.0 to 1.0 leverage ratio test after giving effect to the transaction and if no default exists or would exist as a consequence of such incurrence. if those conditions are met, restricted payments may be made in a total amount of up to the sum of 100% of cco holdings' consolidated ebitda, as defined, minus 1.3 times its consolidated interest expense, as defined, cumulatively from april 1, 2010, plus 100% of new cash and appraised non-cash equity proceeds received by cco holdings and not allocated to certain investments, cumulatively from the issue date, plus $2 billion.
in addition, cco holdings may make distributions or restricted payments, so long as no default exists or would be caused by transactions among other distributions or restricted payments:
•   to repurchase management equity interests in amounts not to exceed $10 million per fiscal year (or $50 million per fiscal year in the case of notes issued under the ccoh safari indentures);
•   to pay pass-through tax liabilities in respect of ownership of equity interests in the applicable issuer or its restricted subsidiaries; or
•   to make other specified restricted payments including merger fees up to 1.25% of the transaction value, repurchases using concurrent new issuances, and certain dividends on existing subsidiary preferred equity interests.
restrictions on investments cco holdings and its respective restricted subsidiaries may not make investments except (i) permitted investments or (ii) if, after giving effect to the transaction, their leverage would be above the applicable leverage ratio.
permitted investments include, among others:
•   investments in and generally among restricted subsidiaries or by restricted subsidiaries in the applicable issuer;
•   investments aggregating up to $750 million (or $1.1 billion in the case of notes issued under cco holdings indentures for the year 2011 through the date of this filing and for notes issued under the ccoh safari indentures) at any time outstanding; and
•   investments aggregating up to 100% of new cash equity proceeds received by cco holdings since the issue date to the extent the proceeds have not been allocated to the restricted payments covenant.

restrictions on liens the restrictions on liens for cco holdings only apply to liens on assets of the issuer itself and do not restrict liens on assets of cco holdings' subsidiaries. permitted liens include liens securing indebtedness and other obligations under credit facilities, liens securing the purchase price of financed new assets, liens securing indebtedness of up to the greater of $50 million (or $90 million in the case of notes issued under the ccoh safari indentures) and 1.0% of consolidated net tangible assets and other specified liens.
restrictions on the sale of assets; mergers cco holdings is generally not permitted to sell all or substantially all of its assets or merge with or into other companies unless its leverage ratio after any such transaction would be no greater than its leverage ratio immediately prior to the transaction, or unless after giving effect to the transaction, leverage would be below 6.0 to 1.0, no default exists, and the surviving entity is a u.s. entity that assumes the applicable notes.
cco holdings and its restricted subsidiaries may generally not otherwise sell assets or, in the case of restricted subsidiaries, issue equity interests, in excess of $100 million unless they receive consideration at least equal to the fair market value of the assets or equity interests, consisting of at least 75% in cash, assumption of liabilities, securities converted into cash within 60 days, or productive assets. cco holdings and its restricted subsidiaries are then required within 365 days after any asset sale either to use or commit to use the net cash proceeds over a specified threshold to acquire assets used or useful in their businesses or use the net cash proceeds to repay specified debt, or to offer to repurchase the issuer's notes with any remaining proceeds.
prohibitions on restricting dividends cco holdings' restricted subsidiaries may generally not enter into arrangements involving restrictions on their ability to make dividends or distributions or transfer assets to cco holdings unless those restrictions with respect to financing arrangements are on terms that are no more restrictive than those governing the credit facilities existing when they entered into the applicable indentures or are not materially more restrictive than customary terms in comparable financings and will not materially impair cco holdings' ability to make payments on the notes.
affiliate transactions the cco holdings indentures and ccoh safari indentures also restrict the ability of cco holdings and its restricted subsidiaries to enter into certain transactions with affiliates involving consideration in excess of $25 million without a determination by the board of directors that the transaction complies with this covenant, or transactions with affiliates involving over $100 million without receiving an opinion as to the fairness to the holders of such transaction from a financial point of view issued by an accounting, appraisal or investment banking firm of national standing.
cross acceleration the cco holdings indentures and ccoh safari indentures include various events of default, including cross acceleration provisions. under these provisions, a failure by cco holdings or any of its restricted subsidiaries to pay at the final maturity thereof the principal amount of other indebtedness having a principal amount of $100 million or more (or any other default under any such indebtedness resulting in its acceleration) would result in an event of default under the indenture governing the applicable notes. as a result, an event of default related to the failure to repay principal at maturity or the acceleration of the indebtedness under the notes issued under the cco holdings indentures or the ccoh safari indentures or the charter operating credit facilities could cause cross-defaults under all outstanding indentures.
recently issued accounting standards in april 2014, the financial accounting standards board issued accounting standards update no. 2014-08, presentation of financial statements and property, plant, and equipment: reporting discontinued operations and disclosures of disposals of components of an entity ("asu 2014-08"). asu 2014-08 changes the criteria for reporting a discontinued operation. under the new guidance, a disposed component of an organization that represents a strategic shift that has (or will have) a major effect on its operations and financial results is a discontinued operation. for disposals of individually significant components that do not qualify for discontinued operations presentation, an entity must disclose pre-tax profit or loss of the disposed component. asu 2014-08 requires prospective application to all disposals that are classified as held for sale and that occur within annual and interim periods beginning on or after december 15, 2014, with earlier application permitted for disposals that have not been reported in

previously issued financial statements. we adopted asu 2014-08 on january 1, 2015. the adoption of asu 2014-8 did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.
in may 2014, the fasb issued asu no. 2014-09, revenue from contracts with customers ("asu 2014-09"), which requires an entity to recognize the amount of revenue to which it expects to be entitled for the transfer of promised goods or services to customers. the asu will replace most existing revenue recognition guidance in u.s. gaap when it becomes effective. the effective date of asu 2014-09 is fiscal years beginning after december 15, 2016, and interim periods within those years, with earlier adoption prohibited. companies can transition to the standard either retrospectively or as a cumulative-effect adjustment as of the date of adoption. we have not yet selected a transition method nor have we determined the effect of asu 2014-09 to our consolidated financial statements.

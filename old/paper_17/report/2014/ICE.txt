recent developments nyse acquisition and related transactions on november 13, 2013, we completed our acquisition of 100% of nyse for $11.1 billion, comprised of cash consideration of $2.7 billion and 42.4 million shares of our common stock, and their results are included in our consolidated results effective from the acquisition date. refer to note 3 to our consolidated financial statements and related notes, which are included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10-k, for more information on this acquisition.
initial public offering and sale of euronext on june 24, 2014, we sold an aggregate 65.8 million shares of common stock of euronext, representing 94% of all outstanding shares, in three transactions. the three transactions include our sale of 42.2 million shares of euronext common stock in an initial public offering, or ipo, at €20 per share, 23.4 million shares of euronext common stock to a group of european institutional investors at €19.20 per share, and 0.2 million shares of euronext common stock to eligible euronext employees at €16 per share. on december 9, 2014, we sold our remaining 4.2 million shares of euronext common stock, representing 6% of the outstanding shares of euronext, for €95 million ($118 million). we no longer hold any shares of euronext stock and these four transactions generated an aggregate €1.5 billion ($2.1 billion) of net cash proceeds for us. the net cash proceeds received included cash of $220 million distributed from euronext as part of the separation of euronext from us. euronext was comprised of the continental european-based exchanges acquired by us as part of the nyse acquisition.
due to the sale of a controlling interest in euronext in june 2014, we de-consolidated the assets and liabilities of euronext as of the ipo date and included the financial results of euronext in discontinued operations in the consolidated financial statements. see "- discontinued operations" below. we used the cash proceeds from the ipo and sale of euronext shares to repay debt. see "- debt" below. also, refer to note 16 to our consolidated financial statements and related notes, which are included elsewhere in this annual

report on form 10-k, for more information on the ipo and sale of euronext and the presentation of the results as discontinued operations.
liffe transition to ice futures europe we successfully transitioned all of the liffe futures and options contracts to ice futures europe during the year ended december 31, 2014. these products are now made available for trading on ice futures europe via the ice trading platform. the clearing transition of the liffe products to ice clear europe was completed in july 2013.
nyse technologies divestitures nyse previously operated a commercial technology business, nyse technologies, which offered transaction, data and infrastructure services, and managed solutions for market participants. during the year ended december 31, 2014, we sold nyfix, metabit and wombat, three companies that comprised nyse technologies. these sales completed our previously announced intention to divest non-core nyse technologies assets.
the results of nyfix, metabit and wombat are reflected as discontinued operations in the consolidated financial statements. see "- discontinued operations" below. we used the net cash proceeds from the sales to repay debt, invest in growth initiatives, pursue strategic investments and return capital to shareholders via dividends and share repurchases. refer to note 16 to our consolidated financial statements and related notes, which are included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10-k, for more information on the sales and the presentation of the results as discontinued operations.
other acquisitions during the year ended december 31, 2014, we acquired 100% of the outstanding common stock of singapore mercantile exchange, or smx, superderivatives and true office and acquired 75% of the outstanding common stock of holland clearing house, or hch. smx operated commodity futures markets and a clearing house in singapore. superderivatives is a leading provider of risk management analytics, financial market data and valuation services. true office is a developer of interactive technology-driven training services used for compliance and risk management, sales training, customer support and professional development. hch is a continental european clearing house. refer to note 3 to our consolidated financial statements and related notes, which are included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10-k, for more information on these acquisitions.

•   total revenues, less transaction-based expenses, increased $1.494 billion, or 93%, for the year ended december 31, 2014, from the comparable period in 2013, primarily due to an increase of $1.461 billion in revenues, less transaction-based expenses, recognized relating to the inclusion of nyse, including $1.669 billion in nyse revenues, less transaction-based expenses, for the year ended december 31, 2014 versus $208 million in nyse revenues, less transaction-based expenses, for the period from november 13, 2013 to december 31, 2013. total revenues, less transaction-based expenses, increased $235 million, or 17%, for the year ended december 31, 2013, from the comparable period in 2012, primarily due to $208 million in revenues, less transaction-based expenses, recognized relating to the inclusion of nyse subsequent to our acquisition on november 13, 2013. see "- revenues" below for further information on the nyse revenues as well as a discussion of the other changes in revenues. total revenues, less transaction-based expenses, exclude euronext and nyse technologies revenues which are included in income from discontinued operations discussed below.
•   total operating expenses increased $836 million, or 103%, for the year ended december 31, 2014, from the comparable period in 2013, primarily due to an increase of $756 million in expenses recognized relating to the inclusion of nyse, net of integration costs ($1.007 billion in nyse expenses for the year ended december 31, 2014, including $123 million in integration costs, versus $171 million in nyse expenses for the period from november 13, 2013 to december 31, 2013, including $43 million in integration costs). total operating expenses increased $272 million, or 51%, for the year ended december 31, 2013, from the comparable period in 2012, primarily due to $171 million in expenses recognized relating to the inclusion of nyse subsequent to its acquisition on november 13, 2013. acquisition-related transaction and integration costs also increased $124 million for the year ended december 31, 2013, from the comparable period in 2012, primarily relating to our acquisition and integration of nyse (including $43 million in acquisition-related transaction and integration costs incurred directly at nyse and included in the $171 million nyse expense number discussed above). see "- operating expenses" below for further information on the nyse expenses as well as a discussion of the other increases in expenses. total operating expenses exclude euronext and nyse technologies operating expenses which are included in income from discontinued operations discussed below.
•   other income (expense), net includes a $4 million net gain on the remaining sale of our 6% ownership in euronext and $25 million in equity income from our equity investment in the options clearing corporation, or occ, during the year ended december 31, 2014. other income (expense), net includes a $190 million impairment loss on our cetip investment and a $51 million expense relating to the early payoff of outstanding debt during the year ended december 31, 2013. other expense, net, also increased in each of the last two years primarily due to increases in our interest expense resulting from increases in our total debt outstanding during the years ended december 31, 2014 and 2013. the increases in the other expenses was partially offset by an increase in dividend income received relating to our investment in cetip. see "- non-operating income (expenses)" below.
•   income (loss) from discontinued operations, net of tax, for the years ended december 31, 2014 and 2013 include the results of euronext and nyse technologies subsequent to the nyse acquisition on november 13, 2013. see "- discontinued operations" below.
factors affecting our results the business environments in which we operate directly affect our results of operations. our results have been and will continue to be affected by many factors, including the level of trading activity in our markets, which during any period is significantly influenced by general market conditions; competition; price volatility; market share and the pace of industry consolidation; broad trends in the brokerage and finance industry; price levels and price volatility; the number and financial health of companies listed on nyse's cash markets; geopolitical events; weather and disasters; real and perceived supply and demand imbalances; availability of capital; changing technology in the financial services industry; and legislative and regulatory changes; among other factors. in particular, in recent years, the business environment has been characterized by increasing competition among global markets for trading volumes and listings; the globalization of exchanges, customers and competitors; market participants' demand for speed, capacity and reliability, which requires continuing investment in technology; and increasing competition for market data revenues. price volatility increases the need to hedge price risk and creates the need for the exchange of risk between market participants. market liquidity is one of the primary market attributes for attracting and maintaining customers and is an important indicator of a market's strength. the maintenance and growth of our revenues could also be impacted if we face increased pressure on pricing.
the implementation of new regulations may impact participation in our markets. generally, legislative and regulatory bodies in the united states and europe have expressed increased concern regarding derivatives markets when underlying commodity prices rise. as a result, legislative and regulatory actions may change the way we conduct our business and may create uncertainty for market participants, which could affect trading volumes. in particular, many of the proposed changes are still being implemented, and final regulations have not yet been adopted or significant uncertainties and ambiguities remain around adopted regulations. in addition, many market participants are still determining how they will respond to these regulations. as a result, it is
45
difficult to predict all of the effects that the legislation and its implementing regulations will have on us. however, it may possibly result in increased costs and the expenditure of significant resources.
low interest rates and uncertainty in the u.s. financial markets continued to reflect the impact of a slow economic recovery. equity market indices became increasingly volatile in the later part of 2014. economic uncertainty in the european union may also continue to negatively affect global financial markets. in addition, economic uncertainty has continued to affect our clients' activities, business models and technology spending over the last several years. we expect that all of these factors will continue to impact our businesses. we have diversified our business so that we are less subject to the reduction in volatility, trading activity or participation in any one asset class. in addition, we have increased our portion of non-transaction and clearing revenues from 13% in 2012 to 39% in 2014. we continue to focus on our strategy to broaden and diversify our revenue streams, as well as on our company-wide expense reduction initiatives in connection with our acquisition of nyse in order to mitigate these uncertainties.
we also periodically make adjustments to our contract specifications. changes to contracts are generally aimed at making the contracts more relevant to more customers and their evolving hedging needs or are required based on changes to the underlying commodity and may result in fluctuations in trading volume in the near term, with the objective of making the contract more relevant to our customers over the long term. in 2014, we transitioned our gasoil contract to a low-sulphur gasoil contract, and that transition was completed in january 2015. these and other factors could cause our revenues to fluctuate from period to period and these fluctuations may affect the reliability of period to period comparisons of our revenues and operating results.
segment reporting we previously operated as a single reportable business segment as of december 31, 2013, the ice segment. as of march 31, 2014, we operated as two business segments, the ice segment and the euronext segment, which was reflective of how our chief operating decision maker reviewed and operated the business. following the ipo and de-consolidation of euronext in june 2014, we reverted to one business segment as this is reflective of how our chief operating decision maker reviewed and operated the business as of june 30, 2014 and for all subsequent periods.

transaction and clearing fees, net a majority of our revenue is derived from transaction and clearing fees. our transaction and clearing fees are reported on a net basis, except for the transaction-based expenses discussed below, and consist of fees collected from our derivatives trading and clearing and, subsequent to our acquisition of nyse on november 13, 2013, from our u.s. cash trading and u.s. equity options businesses. in our derivatives markets, we earn transaction and clearing fees from both counterparties to each contract that is traded and/or cleared. revenues for per-contract fees are driven by the number of trades executed and fees charged per contract. the amount of our per-contract transaction and clearing fees will depend upon many factors, including, but not limited to, market conditions, transaction and clearing volume, pricing, product mix and new product introductions. because transaction and clearing fees are assessed on a per-contract or notional value basis, revenues and profitability fluctuate with changes in contract volume but not to the same degree due to product mix and pricing. see "- factors affecting our results" above.
in our derivatives markets, following our acquisition of nyse, we recognize transaction and clearing fee revenues from executing and clearing trades based on interest rate, agriculture and equity derivatives futures and options. trading volume in european interest rate products is primarily driven by volatility resulting from expectations for changes in the level and term structure of short-term interest rates and in economic data, and trading in equity derivatives, including equity indexes and single stock futures, is primarily driven by volatility.
we also receive transaction fee revenues from u.s. equity and equity options markets, including the new york stock exchange, nyse arca, nyse mkt and nyse amex options. this revenue includes routing fees related to orders in our markets which are routed to other market for execution.
our u.s. equities markets pay fees to the sec pursuant to section 31 of the exchange act. these section 31 fees are designed to recover the government's costs of supervising and regulating the securities markets and securities professionals. we (or occ on our behalf), in turn, collect activity assessment fees, which are included in transaction and clearing fees in our

consolidated statements of income, from member organizations clearing or settling trades on the u.s. equities and options exchanges and recognize these amounts when invoiced. the activity assessment fees are designed so that they are equal to the section 31 fees which are included in transaction-based expenses in our consolidated statements of income. as a result, activity assessment fees and section 31 fees do not have an impact on our net income. activity assessment fees received are included in cash at the time of receipt and, as required by law, the amount due to the sec is remitted semi-annually and recorded as an accrued liability until paid. as of december 31, 2014, the accrued liability related to the un-remitted sec section 31 fees was $137 million.
certain energy futures and options volumes and related revenues have declined or remained flat for the year ended december 31, 2014, from the comparable period in 2013. these energy contracts include north american natural gas and power futures and options contracts and gasoil futures and options contracts. gasoil is a key refined oil products benchmark in europe and asia, which underwent transition to a new specification during 2014.
natural gas revenue declined 6% and volume declined 22% for the year ended december 31, 2014, from the comparable period in 2013, and natural gas revenue declined 15% and volume declined 18% for the year ended december 31, 2013, from the comparable period in 2012. the relatively lower decreases in revenues, compared to the volume decreases, was driven by growth in european natural gas volume, which has a higher transaction fee as compared to the north american natural gas contract, where volume declined significantly year over year. decreased north american natural gas volume was primarily due to continued low volatility and low price levels, which produced muted trading activity in comparison to the record volume levels established during the year ended december 31, 2012. in addition, moderate commodity demand due to muted economic growth, regulatory uncertainty and strong natural gas supply reduced the demand for trading and hedging during 2014 and 2013.
in 2014, ice brent crude futures and options contracts produced the eighteenth consecutive year of record volume. the brent crude futures contract is relied upon by a broad range of global market participants, including oil producing nations and multinational companies, to price and hedge their crude oil production and consumption. based on traded volume in our brent and wti crude futures contracts, we had 54%, 55% and 56% market share of the global crude futures contracts volume for the years ended december 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. other oil revenue and volume grew due to the launch of new global oil and refined product contracts as demand for clearing oil contracts rose.
power futures and options volumes decreased 11% for the year ended december 31, 2014, from the comparable period in 2013, and decreased 8% for the year ended december 31, 2013, compared with the comparable period in 2012. the 3% increase in power futures and options revenues for the year ended december 31, 2014, compared to the volume decreases, were driven by increased european power volume, which has a higher transaction fee as compared to the north american power contract, where volume declined due to low price volatility.
cds trade execution revenues at creditex and ice swap trade were $64 million, $66 million and $78 million for the years ended december 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. the notional value of the underlying cds traded was $1.0 trillion, $904.4 billion and $1.1 trillion for the years ended december 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. the cds execution business remains muted due to financial reform implementation and a general lack of volatility in corporate credit markets.
total cds clearing revenues at ice clear credit and ice clear europe were $97 million, $79 million and $66 million for the years ended december 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. during the years ended december 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, ice clear credit and ice clear europe cleared $13.7 trillion, $10.7 trillion and $10.2 trillion, respectively, of cds notional value. cds clearing activity by investment funds, asset managers, and other buy side market participants has continued to increase due to regulatory mandates, the expansion of products made available for clearing and the benefits derived from portfolio margining.
our transaction and clearing fees are presented net of rebates. we recorded rebates of $631 million, $511 million and $372 million for the years ended december 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. we offer rebates in certain of our markets primarily to support market liquidity and trading volume by providing qualified participants in those markets a discount to the applicable commission rate. such rebates are calculated based on volumes traded. the increase in the rebates is due primarily to the rebates relating to the addition of liffe derivatives markets following the nyse acquisition, an increase in the number of participants in the rebate programs offered on various contracts and an increase in the number of rebate programs.

(1) the north american monthly power futures and options contracts included in the table above (and in the open interest table below) have been adjusted for all periods presented to be sized in megawatts, which resulted in a larger post-conversion contract size for each futures and options contract, a decrease in volume of contracts traded and included in open interest, and a higher rate per contract.

open interest is the aggregate number of contracts (long or short) that clearing members hold either for their own account or on behalf of their clients. open interest refers to the total number of contracts that are currently open - in other words, contracts that have been traded but not yet liquidated by either an offsetting trade, exercise, expiration or assignment. open interest is also a measure of the future activity remaining to be closed out in terms of the number of contracts that members and their clients continue to hold in the particular contract and by the number of contracts held for each contract month listed by the exchange. the following table presents our year-end open interest for our futures and options contracts (in millions, except for percentages).

data services fees we generate revenues from the dissemination of our market data to a variety of users. subscribers can obtain access to our market data services either directly or through third-party distributors. in our derivatives markets, market data fees primarily relate to subscription fees charged for user and license access from data vendors and from the end users, view only market data access, direct access services, terminal access, daily indexes and end of day reports. in addition, we provide a service in our derivatives markets to independently establish market price validation curves whereby participant companies subscribe to receive consensus market valuations.
we earn user and license revenues that we receive from data vendors through the distribution of real-time and historical futures prices and other futures market data derived from trading in our futures markets. during the years ended december 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, we recognized $88 million, $62 million and $64 million, respectively, in market data user and license fees from data vendors. during the years ended december 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, we recognized $87 million, $85 million and $69 million, respectively, in market data access fees. we charge a market data access fee for access to our electronic platform and the increases for the last two years relate to more users and fee increases implemented in 2012 and 2013 related to enhanced data offerings. with the addition of liffe's markets, we also offer real-time and historical futures prices and other futures market data in additional markets, including interest rate futures.
50
our data services fee revenues also increased during the year ended december 31, 2014 following our october 7, 2014 acquisition of superderivatives, a leading provider of risk management analytics, financial market data and valuation services. we recognized $12 million in superderivatives data services revenues during the year ended december 31, 2014, subsequent to our acquisition. the acquisition is intended to accelerate our multi-asset class clearing, risk management and market data strategy.
we now earn data services fees relating to our u.s. equity market data services. we collect cash trading market data fees principally for consortium-based data products and, to a lesser extent, for nyse proprietary data products. consortium-based data fees are dictated as part of the securities industry plans and charged to vendors based on their redistribution of data. consortium-based data revenues from the dissemination of market data (net of administrative costs) are distributed to participating markets on the basis of a formula set by the sec under regulation nms. last sale prices and quotes in new york stock exchange-listed, nyse mkt-listed, and nyse arca-listed securities are disseminated through "tape a" and "tape b," which constitute the majority of our u.s. revenues from consortium-based market data revenues. we also receive a share of the revenues from "tape c," which represents data related to trading of certain securities that are listed on nasdaq. our proprietary products make market data available to subscribers covering activity that takes place solely on our u.s. markets, independent of activity on other markets, and includes depth of book information, historical price information and corporate action information. we also offer nyse realtime reference prices, which allows internet and media organizations to buy real-time, last-sale market data from nyse and provide it broadly and free of charge to the public.
nyse data services fees include fees from secured financial transaction infrastructure, or sfti, which is a physical network infrastructure that connects our markets and other major market centers with numerous market participants in the united states and europe and allows those participants to receive data feeds. sfti is a redundant network that supports a range of nyse services and third-party content and connects all nms market centers in the united states.
during the year ended december 31, 2014 and for the period from november 13, 2013 to december 31, 2013, we recognized data services fee revenues from nyse derivative market data services, u.s. securities trading market data services and sfti fees of $430 million and $57 million, respectively. data services fee revenues exclude euronext data services fee revenues, which are included in income from discontinued operations. see "- discontinued operations" below.
listing fees following our nyse acquisition, we recognize listing fee revenues in our securities markets from two types of fees applicable to companies listed on our u.s. securities exchanges - listing fees and annual fees. listing fees consist of two components: original listing fees and fees related to other corporate-related actions. original listing fees, subject to a minimum and maximum amount, are based on the number of shares that a company initially lists. original listing fees, however, are generally not applicable to companies that transfer to one of our u.s. securities exchanges from another market, except for companies transferring to nyse mkt from the over-the-counter market. other corporate action related fees are paid by listed companies in connection with corporate actions involving the issuance of new shares to be listed, such as stock splits, rights issues and sales of additional securities, as well as mergers and acquisitions, which are subject to a minimum and maximum fee.
original listing fees are recognized as revenue on a straight-line basis over estimated service periods of nine years for nyse and five years for nyse arca and nyse mkt. other corporate action listing fees are recognized as revenue on a straight-line basis over estimated service periods of six years for nyse and three years for nyse arca and nyse mkt. unamortized balances are recorded as deferred revenue in our consolidated balance sheet. we have determined that, at the time of our acquisition of nyse, we did not have a legal performance obligation relating to these listing fees. therefore, in connection with purchase accounting and in accordance with u.s. generally accepted accounting principles, or u.s. gaap, we assigned a fair value of zero to the nyse unamortized deferred revenue balances relating to the listing fees as of the acquisition date of november 13, 2013 (the historical original listing fees deferred revenue balance as of that date was $486 million). the listing fees unamortized deferred revenue balance as of december 31, 2014 of $81 million relates to original and other corporate action listing fees incurred and billed and not yet recognized as revenue subsequent to the november 13, 2013 acquisition through december 31, 2014.
annual fees are charged based on the number of outstanding shares of listed u.s. companies at the end of the prior year. non-u.s. companies pay fees based on the number of listed securities issued or held in the united states. annual fees are recognized as revenue on a pro rata basis over the calendar year.
fees we receive from nyse governance services are included in listing fee revenues. nyse governance services is a leading provider of corporate governance, risk and compliance services to a diverse set of customers, including a number of those listed on the nyse. the true office acquisition is included in with nyse governance services.
listing fees revenues exclude euronext listing fee revenues, which are included in income from discontinued operations. see "- discontinued operations" below.
51
other revenues prior to our acquisition of nyse, other revenues related to various fees for services provided to our customers, including ice chat and ice options analytics subscription fees, ice endex membership fees, agricultural grading and certification fees, regulatory penalties and fines, interest income on certain clearing margin deposits and, during 2013 it included liffe clearing fees (liffe clearing fees are now recorded in transaction and clearing revenues). following our acquisition, other revenues also primarily include technology services revenues, fees for facilities, regulatory fees charged to member organizations of our u.s. securities exchanges, listed company service fees, and designated market maker service fees.
we recognized $163 million and $27 million in other revenues from nyse for the year ended december 31, 2014 and for the period from november 13, 2013 to december 31, 2013, respectively. other revenues exclude euronext and nyse technologies other revenues, which are included in income from discontinued operations. see "- discontinued operations" below.
in addition to the nyse other revenues, the increase in other revenues for the year ended december 31, 2013, from the comparable period in 2012, is primarily due to revenues that we recorded following the whentech acquisition in september 2012 and the ice endex acquisition in march 2013, a reduction in the net interest paid to clearing members for their cash margin deposits at ice clear europe and the fees that we recognized relating to the clearing services agreement for ice clear europe to provide clearing services to nyse liffe from july 1, 2013 to november 12, 2013. the interest paid to clearing members is recorded as a reduction to other revenues. effective january 1, 2013, ice clear europe no longer pays clearing members basis points on certain cash margin deposits.
for the years ended december 31, 2014 and 2013, we have reclassified certain revenues in other revenues to data services fee revenues and to listing fee revenues. the revenues reclassified to data services fees include our sfti network revenues and our colocation service revenues and were $202 million and $32 million for the years ended december 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. the revenues reclassified to listing fees include our nyse governance services revenues and were $30 million and $4 million for the years ended december 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively.
transaction-based expenses see "- revenues - transaction and clearing fees, net" above, for information on the section 31 fees that are included in transaction-based expenses. we incur liquidity payments made to cash trading customers and routing charges made to other exchanges that are included in transaction-based expenses.
we incur routing charges when we do not have the best bid or offer in the market for a security that a customer is trying to buy or sell on one of our u.s. securities exchanges. in that case, we route the customer's order to the external market center that displays the best bid or offer. the external market center charges us a fee per share (denominated in tenths of a cent per share) for routing to its system. additionally, we include costs incurred due to erroneous trade execution within routing as transaction-based expenses. furthermore, nyse arca incurs clearance, brokerage and related transaction expenses and per trade service fees paid to exchanges for trade execution. section 31 fees and routing fees collected from customers are recorded on a gross basis as a component of transaction and clearing fee revenue. refer to note 2 to our consolidated financial statements and related notes, which are included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10-k, for more information on our revenue recognition policies.
operating expenses total operating expenses exclude euronext and nyse technologies operating expenses, which are included in income from discontinued operations. see "- discontinued operations" below. the majority of our operating expenses do not vary directly with changes in our contract volume, except for certain technology and communication expenses and a portion of our compensation expense that is tied directly to our financial performance, as discussed below.

we expect our operating expenses to decrease in the near term from the year ended december 31, 2014 operating expense level in connection with our integration of nyse, and then to increase in absolute terms in future periods in connection with the growth of our business and to vary from year to year based on the type and level of our acquisitions and other investments.
compensation and benefits expenses compensation and benefits expense is our most significant expense and includes non-capitalized employee wages, bonuses, non-cash or stock compensation, certain severance costs, benefits and employer taxes. the bonus component of our compensation and benefits expense is based on both our financial performance and the individual employee performance and the performance-based restricted stock compensation expense is also based on our financial performance. therefore, our compensation and benefits expense will vary year to year based on our financial performance and by fluctuations in the number of employees.
compensation and benefits expenses increased for the last two years primarily due to increases in employee headcount. our employee headcount increased primarily due to the nyse acquisition, internal hiring relating to the nyse integration, our other acquisitions and hiring for clearing, technology, regulation and compliance. headcount increased from 1,077 employees as of december 31, 2012 to 1,133 employees as of december 31, 2013 (excluding the nyse employees), an increase of 5% compared to the prior year, and increased to 1,650 employees as of december 31, 2014 (excluding the nyse employees), an increase of 46% compared to the prior year.
as of december 31, 2014, we had 1,252 nyse employees, compared to 3,099 nyse employees as of december 31, 2013. the decrease in the nyse employees during the year ended december 31, 2014 is primarily related to the reduction of the euronext employees following the ipo on june 24, 2014, of which there were 1,049 euronext employees as of december 31, 2013, the sale of nyse technologies and employee terminations in connection with the integration of nyse. we recognized $290 million and $46 million in compensation and benefits expenses relating to nyse during the years ended december 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively, subsequent to our acquisition on november 13, 2013.
non-cash compensation expenses recognized in our consolidated financial statements for employee stock options and restricted stock were $82 million, $56 million and $52 million for the years ended december 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. the increase for the year ended december 31, 2014 primarily relates to a greater number of employees receiving non-cash awards due to the headcount increases discussed above.
we incurred non-nyse related employee severance costs of $4 million, $7 million and $7 million for the years ended december 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. the higher employee severance during 2013 and 2012 primarily related to broker severance at creditex and severance during 2012 relating to our closure of the ice futures u.s. open outcry trading floor. in addition, we recorded $99 million and $44 million in nyse employee severance costs during the years ended december 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively, with such costs included in the acquisition-related transaction and integration costs discussed below.
technology and communication expenses technology support services consist of costs for running our wholly-owned data centers, hosting costs paid to third-party data centers, and maintenance of our computer hardware and software required to support our technology. these costs are driven by system capacity, functionality and redundancy requirements. communication expenses consist of costs for network connection for our electronic platforms, telecommunications costs, and fees paid for access to external market data. this expense also includes licensing and other fee agreement expenses which may be impacted by growth in electronic contract volume, our capacity
53
requirements, changes in the number of telecommunications hubs and connections with customers to access our electronic platforms directly.
technology and communication expenses increased the last two years, compared to the prior year, primarily due to the inclusion of nyse expenses following our acquisition, acquisitions and growth in various contract volumes. we recognized $132 million and $13 million in technology and communication expenses relating to nyse during the years ended december 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively.
professional services expenses this expense includes fees for consulting services received on strategic and technology initiatives, temporary labor as well as regulatory, legal and accounting fees. this expense may fluctuate as a result of changes in consulting and technology services and regulatory, accounting and legal proceedings.
professional services expenses increased the last two years, compared to the prior year, primarily due to the inclusion of nyse expenses following our acquisition. we recognized $135 million and $23 million in professional services expenses relating to nyse during the years ended december 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. professional services expenses also increased for the year ended december 31, 2014 due to costs incurred at ice futures singapore as we transitioned the exchange and clearing infrastructures to our trading and clearing platforms, and professional fees incurred for emir implementation.
the increases in professional services expenses during the year ended december 31, 2014 were partially offset by decreases in professional services expenses during the fourth quarter of 2014 relating to a credit we received from the financial industry regulatory authority, or finra, and a reduction in expenses related to the termination of certain services agreements and related agreements, or slas, with euronext.
financial, operational and sales practice oversight of the members of our u.s. securities exchanges is generally conducted by finra. in addition, finra performs the market surveillance and related enforcement functions for our u.s. securities exchanges, pursuant to an agreement with us, although our u.s. securities exchanges retain ultimate regulatory responsibility for the regulatory functions performed by finra under that agreement. finra charges our u.s. securities exchanges throughout the year based on their estimated costs for these services and then trues up the charge at year end to actual costs incurred. based on the actual finra charges incurred to us during 2014 versus what we were accruing, we recorded a credit of $7 million during the fourth quarter of 2014. in january 2016, nyse regulation plans to take over market surveillance, investigation and enforcement functions for nyse equity and options markets from finra.
in connection with the euronext ipo, euronext and ice entered into a series of slas to ensure that euronext and ice (including liffe) had continuity in operating their respective businesses through the separation. the majority of the slas relating to euronext operational support and transition services provided to liffe until its transition to ice futures europe were terminated in november 2014.
rent and occupancy expenses this expense consists of costs related to leased and owned property including rent, maintenance, real estate taxes, utilities and other related costs. we have significant operations located in atlanta, new york and london with smaller offices located throughout the world. rent and occupancy expenses increased the last two years, compared to the prior year, primarily due to the inclusion of nyse expenses following our acquisition. we recognized $56 million and $10 million in rent and occupancy expenses relating to nyse during the years ended december 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively . additionally, we incurred $7 million in duplicate rent expenses and lease termination costs relating to the consolidation of multiple new york office locations that occurred during the year ended december 31, 2013.
acquisition-related transaction and integration costs we incurred $129 million in acquisition-related transaction and integration costs during the year ended december 31, 2014, primarily relating to our integration of nyse and the acquisitions of smx, superderivatives, hch and true office. see "- recent developments" above. of this amount, $6 million was related to fees for investment banking advisors, lawyers, accountants, tax advisors and public relations firms, and other external costs directly related to the transactions. the remaining $123 million was for nyse integration costs incurred during the year ended december 31, 2014, primarily relating to employee termination costs, costs incurred relating to the euronext ipo and sale, costs incurred relating to the sale of nyse technologies, and professional services costs.

we incurred $143 million in acquisition-related transaction and integration costs during the year ended december 31, 2013, primarily relating to our acquisition and integration of nyse and ice endex. of this amount, $97 million was related to fees for investment banking advisors, lawyers, accountants, tax advisors and public relations firms, and other external costs directly related to the transactions. the remaining $46 million was for nyse integration costs incurred during the year ended december 31, 2013, primarily relating to employee termination costs, costs incurred relating to the euronext ipo, deal-related bonuses and professional services costs. we incurred acquisition-related transaction costs during the year ended december 31, 2012 primarily relating to our pending acquisitions of nyse and ice endex and our acquisition of whentech.
we expect to continue to explore and pursue various potential acquisitions and other strategic opportunities to strengthen our competitive position and support our growth. as a result, we will incur acquisition-related transaction costs in future periods. see "- non-u.s. gaap financial measures" below.
selling, general and administrative expenses this expense relates to expenses from marketing, advertising, public relations, insurance, dues and subscriptions, travel and entertainment, taxes other than income taxes and other general and administrative costs. selling, general and administrative expenses increased the last two years, compared to the prior year, primarily due to the inclusion of nyse expenses following our acquisition. we recognized $88 million and $11 million in selling, general and administrative expenses relating to nyse during the years ended december 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. selling, general and administrative expenses also increased for the year ended december 31, 2014, from the comparable period in 2013, primarily related to costs from our other acquisitions, due to an accrual made in anticipation of the outcome of certain regulatory proceedings, and increases in certain expenses related to taxes other than income taxes, travel and entertainment and insurance.
depreciation and amortization expenses depreciation and amortization expense results from depreciation of long-lived assets such as buildings, leasehold improvements, planes, furniture, fixtures and equipment over their estimated useful lives. this expense includes amortization of intangible assets obtained in our acquisitions of businesses, as well as on various licensing agreements, over their estimated useful lives. intangible assets subject to amortization consist primarily of customer relationships, trading products with finite lives, technology and the russell licensing rights. this expense also includes amortization of internally developed and purchased software over their estimated useful lives.
we recorded amortization expenses on the intangible assets acquired as part of our acquisitions, as well as on the russell licensing agreement intangible assets, of $151 million, $76 million and $69 million for the years ended december 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. the increases during the years ended december 31, 2014 and 2013 primarily relate to amortization expenses recorded on the nyse intangible assets. we recognized $84 million and $10 million in amortization expenses on the nyse intangible assets during the years ended december 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively.
we recorded depreciation expenses on our fixed assets of $182 million, $80 million and $62 million for the years ended december 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. the increases during the years ended december 31, 2014 and 2013 primarily relate to depreciation expenses recorded on the nyse fixed assets. we recognized $98 million and $16 million in depreciation expenses on the nyse fixed assets during the years ended december 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. depreciation expenses also increased for each of the past two years primarily due to additional depreciation expenses recorded on increased fixed asset additions and capitalized internally developed software, including the building we purchased in atlanta, georgia in july 2013 for $38 million and real estate expenditures during 2014 relating to the atlanta and new york headquarters. see "- cash flow - investing activities" below.

the increases in interest expense over the last two years are primarily due to an increase in the overall amount of debt outstanding during each of the periods, primarily relating to debt incurred for and from the nyse acquisition. see "- debt" below.
we recognized interest and investment income of $7 million, $3 million and $2 million for the years ended december 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. interest and investment income is recorded in other income and the increase primarily relates to an increase in our short-term investments during the year ended december 31, 2014.
we account for our investment in cetip as an available-for-sale investment and it is classified as a long-term investment in our consolidated balance sheet. during the year ended december 31, 2013, we recorded an impairment of our cetip investment for $190 million, which was recorded as other expense. refer to note 5 to our consolidation financial statements and related notes, which are included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10-k, for more information on this impairment. we recognized dividend income received relating to our cetip investment in other income, which was $23 million, $8 million and $5 million for the years ended december 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively.
on october 16, 2013, following the issuance of $1.4 billion in senior notes (as defined below), we prepaid our private senior notes (as defined below) representing $400 million aggregate principal amount. in connection with the early payoff of the private senior notes, we incurred $51 million in expenses, which was recorded as other expense during the year ended december 31, 2013. see "- debt" below.
in connection with our acquisition of nyse, we obtained a 40% ownership in occ and we recorded our investment in occ as an equity method investment. we recognized $25 million in equity income related to this investment during the year ended december 31, 2014 as other income. for a description of this investment, see note 15 to our consolidated financial statements and related notes, which are included elsewhere is this annual report on form 10-k and see "- future capital requirements" below.
we incurred foreign currency transaction losses of $2 million, $2 million and $4 million for the years ended december 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. foreign currency gains and losses are recorded in other income (expense) and relate to the settlement of foreign currency assets, liabilities and payables that occur through our foreign operations that are received in non-functional currencies due to the increase or decrease in the period-end foreign currency exchange rates between periods.
on june 24, 2014, we sold 94% of all outstanding shares of euronext in an ipo. on december 9, 2014, we sold the remaining 4.2 million shares of euronext common stock, representing 6% of the outstanding shares of euronext, for €95 million ($118 million), including a realized net gain of $4 million, which was recognized in other income for the year ended december 31, 2014. the $4 million net gain included a stock price gain of $15 million based on the difference in the euronext stock price from the ipo date to the date of sale on december 9, 2014, less $11 million in foreign currency translation losses relating to the decrease in the value of the euro relative to the u.s. dollar during this same period of time. see "- discontinued operations" below.
during the year ended december 31, 2013, we incurred $3 million in settlements and accruals for various outstanding legal matters, which were recorded as other expense.
for consolidated subsidiaries in which our ownership is less than 100%, and for which we have control over the assets, liabilities and management of the entity, the outside stockholders' interests are shown as non-controlling interests. as of december 31, 2012, non-controlling interest related to the operating results of our cds clearing subsidiaries in which non-ice limited partners held a 45.5% net profit sharing interest. during the year ended december 31, 2013, we purchased 3% of the net profit sharing interest in our cds clearing subsidiaries from various non-ice limited partners and the remaining non-ice limited partners hold a 42.5% net profit sharing interest as of december 31, 2014 and 2013. in connection with our acquisition of nyse,
56
we have non-controlling interest related to various minority ownership interests held in our majority owned subsidiary, nyse amex options. in connection with our 79% acquisition of the derivatives and spot gas business of the former apx-endex in march 2013, gasunie's 21% ownership is included in the non-controlling interest line subsequent to the acquisition date. in connection with our 75% acquisition of hch in december 2014, abn amro clearing bank n.v.'s 25% ownership is included in the non-controlling interest line subsequent to the acquisition date. the increase in the net income attributable to non-controlling interests for the last two years, compared to the prior year, is primarily related to these new non-controlling interests and the increase in the cds clearing revenues the last two years. see "- revenues - transaction and clearing fees" above.
income tax provision consolidated income tax expense was $402 million, $184 million and $228 million for the years ended december 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. the change in consolidated income tax expense between years is primarily due to the change in our pre-tax income and the change in our effective tax rate each year. our effective tax rate was 29%, 37% and 29% for the years ended december 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. the effective tax rates for the years ended december 2014 and 2012 are lower than the statutory federal rate primarily due to favorable foreign tax rate differentials, partially offset by state income taxes. favorable foreign income tax rate differentials result primarily from lower tax rates in the united kingdom, the netherlands and various other lower tax jurisdictions. the effective tax rate for the year ended december 31, 2013 is higher than the statutory federal rate primarily due to the non-tax deductible impairment loss on the cetip investment along with state income taxes and other items. other items are primarily driven by non-tax deductible transaction costs relating to the nyse acquisition.
discontinued operations due to the sale of a controlling interest in euronext and the sales of the three companies comprising nyse technologies (nyfix, metabit and wombat), we de-consolidated the assets and liabilities of euronext (as of the june 24, 2014 ipo date) and nyse technologies (as of the sales dates) and included the financial results of these entities in discontinued operations in our consolidated financial statements effective from the nyse acquisition date of november 13, 2013. see "- recent developments" above and refer to note 16 to our consolidated financial statements and related notes, which are included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10-k, for more information on our discontinued operations disclosures.
the results below include external advisory costs and professional services costs related to the sales of euronext and nyse technologies of $51 million and $2 million for the years ended december 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively, which have been included with acquisition-related transaction and integration costs, below, from discontinued operations. the results below also include deal-related compensation and severance costs related to the sales of euronext and nyse technologies of $42 million and $19 million for the years ended december 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively, which have also been included with acquisition-related transaction and integration costs, below, from discontinued operations. further, the income tax provision for discontinued operations for the year ended december 31, 2013 is primarily from the impact of certain foreign tax law changes that occurred after our acquisition of nyse on euronext's tax assets and liabilities.
we used the cash proceeds from the sale of euronext to repay debt. we used the net cash proceeds from the sale of nyse technologies to repay debt, invest in growth initiatives, pursue strategic investments and return capital to shareholders via dividends and share repurchases. results of discontinued operations were as follows for the years ended december 31, 2014 and 2013 (in millions):

(1) we acquired nyse on november 13, 2013 and have included their financial results in our results of operations for all periods subsequent to the acquisition date. the consolidated statements of income data for euronext, nyfix, metabit and wombat for the periods subsequent to the acquisition of nyse, through their disposition, are included in income from discontinued operations, net of tax. see "- discontinued operations" above.
(2) for the first three quarters of 2014, we have reclassified section 31 fees related to our u.s. equity options revenues to show them gross, with a corresponding offset in transaction-based expenses.
(3) for the years ended december 31, 2014 and 2013, we have reclassified certain revenues in other revenues to data services fee revenues and to listing fee revenues. the revenues reclassified to data services fees include our sfti network revenues and our colocation service revenues and the revenues reclassified to listing fees include our nyse governance services revenues.
(4) for the first three quarters of 2014, we have reclassified certain costs related to nyse to better represent our views on operating expenses.
(5) other income (expense), net for the three months ended december 31, 2014 includes a net $4 million gain on the remaining sale of our 6% ownership in euronext and $25 million in other income from our occ equity method investment. other expense, net for the three months ended december 31, 2013 includes a $190 million impairment loss on our cetip investment and a $51 million expense relating to the early payoff of outstanding debt. see "- non-operating income (expense)" above.
liquidity and capital resources we have financed our operations, growth and cash needs primarily through income from operations and borrowings under our various debt facilities. our principal capital requirements have been to fund capital expenditures, working capital, strategic

acquisitions and investments, stock repurchases and the continued development of our electronic trading and clearing platforms. we believe that our cash on hand and cash flows from operations will be sufficient to repay our outstanding debt as it matures. in the future, we may need to incur additional debt or issue additional equity securities, which we may be unable to do or to do on favorable terms. we used the cash proceeds from the euronext ipo and sale to repay debt and we used the net cash proceeds from the sale of nyse technologies to repay debt, invest in growth initiatives, pursue strategic investments and return capital to shareholders via dividends and share repurchases. see "- recent developments" above and "- debt" and "- future capital requirements" below.
on november 13, 2013, we acquired nyse in a stock and cash transaction. we paid cash consideration of $2.7 billion and issued an aggregate number of shares of common stock of 42.4 million shares to nyse stockholders. the cash consideration was funded from cash on hand, $1.4 billion of net proceeds received in october 2013 in connection with our public offering and sale of senior notes and $400 million of borrowings under our revolving facility (as defined below). we refinanced the new borrowings under our revolving facility and the $450 million borrowed under the 364 day facility (as defined below) through the issuance of a commercial paper program. see "- debt" below.
upon maturity of old issuances of commercial paper and to the extent old issuances are not repaid by cash on hand, we are exposed to the rollover risk of not being able to issue new commercial paper. in order to mitigate the rollover risk, we maintain an undrawn backstop bank revolving credit facility for an aggregate amount equaling at any time the amount issued under our commercial paper program. in case we would not be able to issue new commercial paper, we could draw on the backstop revolving facility, which would result in higher interest expense. see "- debt" below.
consolidated cash and cash equivalents were $652 million and $961 billion as of december 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively, and short term investments were $1.2 billion and $74 million as of december 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. we had $379 million and $324 million in long-term investments as of december 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively, and $626 million and $438 million in short-term and long-term restricted cash and investments as of december 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. we consider all short-term, highly liquid investments with remaining maturity dates of three months or less at the time of purchase to be cash equivalents. we classify all investments with original maturity dates in excess of three months but less than one year as short-term investments and all investments that we intend to hold for more than one year as long-term investments. cash and investments that are not available for general use, either due to regulatory requirements or through restrictions in specific agreements, are classified as restricted cash and investments.
the €969 million ($1.2 billion) in short-term investments as of december 31, 2014 represented euro-denominated term deposit investments at various banks each with a maturity date of june 25, 2015 to cover the maturity of the nyse eur notes on june 30, 2015. see "- debt" below. the increase in the long-term investments is due to an increase in our cetip investment's fair value. the restricted cash and investments increase primarily related to a contribution to the ice clear u.s. guaranty fund as of january 1, 2014 in connection with ice clear u.s.'s recognition as a third party qccp, cash escrow set aside for the superderivatives acquisition and increases in the regulatory capital of ice clear europe and ice futures europe due to additional costs incurred at both of these companies due to growth of these businesses.
as of december 31, 2014, the amount of unrestricted cash held by our non-u.s. subsidiaries was $426 million. while we consider our non-u.s. earnings to be indefinitely reinvested overseas, if these cash balances are needed for our operations in the united states, any repatriation by way of dividend may be subject to both u.s. federal and state income taxes, as adjusted for any non-u.s. tax credits. however, we do not have any current needs or foreseeable plans to repatriate cash by way of dividends from our non-u.s. subsidiaries.
our cash and cash equivalents and financial investments are managed as a global treasury portfolio of non-speculative financial instruments that are readily convertible into cash, such as overnight deposits, term deposits, money market funds, mutual funds for treasury investments, short duration fixed income investments and other money market instruments, thus ensuring high liquidity of financial assets. we may invest a portion of our cash in excess of short-term operating needs in investment-grade marketable debt securities, including government or government sponsored agencies and corporate debt securities.
certain of these investments, with an original maturity of greater than three months, will be classified as available-for-sale in accordance with relevant accounting standards. available-for-sale investments are carried at their fair values with unrealized gains and losses, reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income. realized gains and losses, and declines in value deemed to be other-than-temporary on available-for-sale investments, are recognized currently in earnings. we do not have any investments classified as held-to-maturity or trading.
during the years ended december 31, 2014 and 2012, we repurchased 3,231,484 shares and 416,858 shares, respectively, of our outstanding common stock at a cost of $645 million and $53 million, respectively. these repurchases were completed under a stock repurchase plan authorized by our board of directors. the shares repurchased are held in treasury stock. we did not repurchase any shares during the year ended december 31, 2013. as of december 31, 2014, the remaining board authorization permits repurchases of up to $405 million of our common stock with no fixed expiration date.
60
in september 2014, we entered into a rule 10b5-1 trading plan permitting open market repurchases of our common stock based on certain parameters described in the trading plan. we expect to fund any remaining share repurchases with a combination of cash on hand, future cash flows and by borrowing under our credit facilities and our commercial paper program. the timing and extent of any future repurchases that are not made pursuant to the trading plan under rule 10b5-1 are at our discretion and will depend upon market conditions, amount authorized by our board of directors, our stock price, our target debt ratio and corporate debt rating, and our strategic growth initiatives at that time. we may discontinue the stock repurchases at any time or may enter into a new rule 10b5-1 trading plan in the future. in addition, our board of directors may increase or decrease the amount of capacity we have for repurchases from time to time.

operating activities net cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations primarily consists of net income adjusted for certain non-cash items, including depreciation and amortization and the effects of changes in working capital. fluctuations in net cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations is primarily attributable to increases and decreases in our net income between periods and, to a lesser extent, due to fluctuations in working capital. the $749 million increase in net cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations for the year ended december 31, 2014, from the comparable period in 2013, is primarily due to the $685 million increase in our net income from continuing operations, primarily relating to the increase of $435 million in net income from the inclusion of nyse ($465 million in nyse net income from continuing operations for the year ended december 31, 2014 versus $30 million in nyse net income from continuing operations for the period from november 13, 2013 to december 31, 2013). see "- consolidated financial highlights" above.
investing activities consolidated net cash provided by (used in) investing activities from continuing operations for the years ended december 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012 primarily relates to cash paid for acquisitions, cash proceeds from the ipo and sale of euronext and the sale of nyse technologies, purchases of term deposits and available-for-sale investments, increases in the restricted cash and investment balances, and capital expenditures and capitalized software development costs.

we had net increases in restricted cash and investments of $161 million, $75 million and $32 million for the years ended december 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. the restricted cash increase in 2014 primarily related to a contribution to the ice clear u.s. guaranty fund as of january 1, 2014 in connection with ice clear u.s.'s status as a qccp, cash escrow set aside for the superderivatives acquisition, regulatory capital from hch after our acquisition, and increases in the regulatory capital of ice clear europe and ice futures europe due to additional costs incurred at both of these companies due to growth of these businesses. the restricted cash increase in 2013 primarily related to increases in the regulatory capital of ice futures europe, ice clear europe and ice futures u.s., resulting from adjustments to the regulatory capital calculations to no longer allow for certain deductions in the
61
calculations of the six months of operating expenditures. the restricted cash increase in 2012 primarily related to mandated changes in the calculations of regulatory capital at ice futures europe and ice clear europe as well as additional costs incurred at both of these companies due to growth of these businesses.
capital expenditures were $172 million, $134 million and $32 million for the years ended december 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively, and we had capitalized software development expenditures of $78 million, $45 million and $36 million for the years ended december 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. the capital expenditures primarily relate to hardware purchases to continue the development and expansion of our electronic platforms and clearing houses, the purchase of a corporate aircraft, the purchase of a building in atlanta georgia to serve as our headquarters and leasehold improvements associated with the new and renovated office spaces in atlanta, new york and london. the software development expenditures primarily relate to the continued development and expansion of our electronic platforms and clearing houses.

2014 credit facility on april 3, 2014, we entered into a $3.0 billion senior unsecured revolving credit facility, or the 2014 credit facility. the 2014 credit facility matures on april 3, 2019. no amounts were outstanding under the 2014 credit facility as of december 31, 2014. of the $3.0 billion that is available for borrowing under the 2014 credit facility, $905 million is required to back-stop the amount outstanding under our commercial paper program as of december 31, 2014 and $303 million is reserved for our clearing houses. the amount required to back stop the commercial paper program will fluctuate as we increase or decrease our commercial paper borrowings. the remaining $1.8 billion as of december 31, 2014 is available to us to use for working capital and general corporate purposes.
revolving facility and term loan facility (2011 credit facilities)
in november 2011, we entered into senior unsecured credit facilities in the aggregate amount of $2.6 billion, or the 2011 credit facilities. the 2011 credit facilities consisted of (i) an aggregate $500 million five-year senior unsecured term loan facility, or the term loan facility, and (ii) an aggregate $2.1 billion five-year senior unsecured multicurrency revolving credit facility, or the revolving facility. in october 2013, we borrowed $900 million under the revolving facility, of which $400 million was used to pay
62
the cash portion of the purchase price for our acquisition of nyse while the remaining $500 million was used to pay off the outstanding commercial paper obligations of nyse, as well as to fund certain deal related fees and expenses. in december 2013, we repaid the $900 million borrowed under the revolving facility with the proceeds from the issuance of commercial paper and with cash on hand. in connection with us entering into the 2014 credit facility on april 3, 2014, the 2011 credit facilities were terminated and the $367 million outstanding under the term loan facility was repaid through the issuance of new commercial paper.
private senior notes simultaneous with entering into the 2011 credit facilities, we also entered into a note purchase agreement providing for the sale of $400 million aggregate principal amount of senior notes, consisting of $200 million of our 4.13% senior notes, tranche a, due november 9, 2018 and $200 million of our 4.69% senior notes, tranche b, due november 9, 2021, or collectively, the private senior notes. in october 2013, following the issuance of the senior notes, we prepaid the $400 million aggregate principal amount of private senior notes. in connection with the early payoff of the private senior notes, we incurred $51 million in expenses relating to a $49 million pre-payment to the private senior notes investors and an associated $2 million write off of the related debt issuance costs. the $51 million expense was recorded as other expense in the accompanying consolidated statement of income for the year ended december 31, 2013. to fund the pre-payment of the private senior notes and the associated pre-payment expenses, we borrowed $450 million in october 2013 under the 364 day facility.
364 day facility in july 2013, we entered into a $600 million 364 day senior unsecured revolving credit facility, or the 364 day facility. the 364 day facility was available for working capital and general corporate purposes. in october 2013, we borrowed $450 million under the 364 day facility to fund the pre-payment of the private senior notes. in december 2013, we repaid the $450 million borrowed under the 364 day facility with the proceeds from the issuance of commercial paper. in connection with us entering into the 2014 credit facility, the 364 day facility was terminated in april 2014, at which time no amounts were outstanding under the 364 day facility.
senior notes in october 2013, we issued $600 million aggregate principal amount of 2.50% senior unsecured fixed rate notes due october 2018, or the 2018 senior notes, and $800 million aggregate principal amount of 4.00% senior unsecured fixed rate notes due october 2023, or the 2023 senior notes, together with the 2018 senior notes, the senior notes. we used the net proceeds from the senior notes offering to finance, together with cash on hand and $400 million borrowed in october 2013 under the revolving facility, the $2.7 billion cash portion of the purchase price of the acquisition of nyse.
nyse notes in connection with the acquisition of nyse, we assumed the outstanding nyse debt instruments, which included $850 million of 2.0% senior unsecured fixed rate notes due in october 2017, or the nyse usd notes, and €920 million ($1.1 billion) of 5.375% senior unsecured fixed rate notes due in june 2015, or the nyse eur notes, and together with the nyse usd notes, the nyse notes. upon closing of the euronext ipo, we elected to set aside sufficient euro-denominated cash from the proceeds to effectively pre-fund the maturity of the nyse eur notes and the related final interest coupon payment, both due on june 30, 2015. in connection with this, in july 2014, we placed €969 million ($1.2 billion) of the cash proceeds from the euronext ipo in term deposits at various banks each with a maturity date of june 25, 2015 to cover the €920 million ($1.1 billion) principal and the €49 million ($60 million) final interest coupon payment due on june 30, 2015. these deposits are classified as short-term investments in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet as of december 31, 2014. the balance of the cash proceeds received in connection with the euronext ipo were converted to u.s. dollars and used to repay outstanding commercial paper.
commercial paper program in december 2013, we entered into a u.s. dollar commercial paper program, or the commercial paper program. the commercial paper program is currently backed by the borrowing capacity available under the 2014 credit facility, equal to the amount of the commercial paper that is issued and outstanding at any given point in time. the effective interest rate of commercial paper issuances does not materially differ from short term interest rates (such as usd libor). the fluctuation of these rates due to market conditions may impact our interest expense. as of december 31, 2014, the weighted average interest rate on the $905 million outstanding under the commercial paper program was 0.26% per annum, with a weighted average maturity of 24 days.
we used the net proceeds from the notes issued under the commercial paper program, along with cash on hand, to repay the $900 million borrowed under the revolving facility and the $450 million borrowed under the 364 day facility during the year ended december 31, 2013. we used net proceeds from notes issued under the commercial paper program during the year ended december 31, 2014 to repay the $367 million that was outstanding under the term loan facility upon termination of the term loan facility in april 2014, to fund certain of our acquisitions, and to repurchase our common stock during the year ended december 31, 2014. we repaid a portion of the amounts outstanding under the commercial paper program during the year ended december 31, 2014 using a
63
combination of the cash proceeds received from the ipo and sale of euronext, the sale of nyse technologies and cash flows from operations.
guarantees in connection with our acquisition of nyse on november 13, 2013, ice, intercontinental exchange holdings, inc. and nyse established various guarantees to protect against structural subordination of each entities' existing indebtedness. each of intercontinental exchange holdings, inc. and nyse are our wholly-owned subsidiaries, and each fully and unconditionally guaranteed, on an unsecured and unsubordinated basis, the payment of principal, premium, if any, and interest of ice's senior notes and, following its establishment, the commercial paper program. similarly, ice and intercontinental exchange holdings, inc. each fully and unconditionally guaranteed, on an unsecured and unsubordinated basis, the payment of principal, premium, if any, and interest of the nyse notes. finally, ice and nyse each fully and unconditionally guaranteed, on an unsecured and unsubordinated basis, the payment of principal, premium, if any, and interest of the 2011 credit facilities and the 364 day facility. all of the guarantees are joint and several with all other guarantees and indebtedness. ice's guarantees, as a standalone entity, will remain in place until each applicable debt obligation has been satisfied.
upon the termination of the 2011 credit facilities and the 364 day facility, intercontinental exchange holdings, inc.'s guarantees were no longer required and therefore intercontinental exchange holdings, inc.'s guarantees were automatically released in accordance with their terms on april 3, 2014. in connection with our entry into the 2014 credit facility, nyse agreed to guarantee the 2014 credit facility as a subsidiary guarantor. for as long as nyse remains a guarantor of the 2014 credit facility, it will remain a guarantor of the senior notes and the commercial paper program. we expect that nyse's guarantee of the 2014 credit facility, the senior notes and the commercial paper program will be released when the nyse notes have been repaid, as the 2014 credit facility provides that nyse's guarantee will be released in accordance with their terms if certain conditions are satisfied, including compliance with the covenant limiting the amount of indebtedness of non-obligor subsidiaries and an investment-grade credit rating.
committed repo to provide a tool to liquidate margin and guaranty fund deposits held in the form of high quality sovereign debt, ice clear europe, ice clear credit and ice clear u.s. have entered into committed repurchase agreement facilities, or committed repo. each of these clearing houses is seeking to increase both the amount and the number of counterparties to its existing committed repo facilities. as of december 31, 2014, ice clear europe had $350 million in committed repo, ice clear credit had $100 million and ice clear u.s. had $200 million. as of january 9, 2015, ice clear europe increased its committed repo to $450 million and ice clear u.s. increased its committed repo to $250 million. the ice clear europe committed repo is available in u.s. dollars, euro and pound sterling, the ice clear credit committed repo is available in u.s. dollars and euro and the ice clear u.s. committed repo is available in u.s. dollars.
the committed repo arrangements provide these three clearing houses with an additional liquidity tool that may be utilized in the event there is a need to convert high quality sovereign debt into cash on a same-day basis during a market disruption that makes it difficult to sell and settle such sovereign debt on a same-day basis.
multicurrency payment facility ice clear u.s. requires its clearing members to meet non-u.s. dollar payment obligations in the currency of the obligation. ice clear u.s. also accepts foreign currencies as collateral to satisfy original margin requirements for those contracts which are denominated in a foreign currency. in addition, in order to meet its obligation to make settlement payments in all relevant currencies, ice clear u.s. uses its own capital to purchase the relevant foreign currencies as determined by its daily liquidity calculations. in the event a clearing member were to fail to make payment in a non-usd currency, ice clear u.s. will use the applicable foreign currency posted to satisfy original margin requirements in addition to the applicable foreign currency held by ice clear u.s. in order to meet its settlement obligations in such currency.
future capital requirements our future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including the rate of our trading and clearing volume growth, strategic plans and acquisitions, required technology and clearing initiatives, regulatory requirements, the timing and introduction of new products and enhancements to existing products, the geographic mix of our business, and the continuing market acceptance of our electronic trading and clearing platforms. we currently expect to make aggregate operational capital expenditures and to incur capitalized software development costs ranging between $165 million and $175 million for the year ended december 31, 2015, which we believe will support the enhancement of our technology and the continued expansion of our businesses. in addition, we currently expect between $70 million to $80 million in capital expenditures during 2015, on leasehold improvement expenditures, primarily associated with our nyse headquarters in new york.

our board of directors has adopted a quarterly dividend declaration policy providing that the declaration of any dividends will be determined quarterly by the board or audit committee of the board of directors taking into account such factors as our evolving business model, prevailing business conditions and our financial results and capital requirements, without a predetermined annual net income payout ratio. during the year ended december 31, 2014, we paid a quarterly dividend of $0.65 per share per quarter of our common stock for an aggregate payout of $299 million, which includes the payment of dividend equivalents. on february 5, 2015, we announced a $0.65 per share dividend for the first quarter of 2015 with the dividend payable on march 31, 2015 to shareholders of record as of march 17, 2015 (the ex-dividend date will be march 13, 2015).
as of december 31, 2014, we had $4.3 billion in outstanding debt. we currently have $3.0 billion available for borrowing under our 2014 credit facility. after factoring in the $905 million currently required to backstop the commercial paper program and the $303 million reserved for our clearing houses as discussed above, $1.8 billion of our 2014 credit facility is currently available for general corporate purposes. see "- debt" above.
the 2014 credit facility and the commercial paper program are currently the only significant agreements or arrangements that we have with third parties for liquidity and capital resources. in the event of any strategic acquisitions, mergers or investments, or if we are required to raise capital for any reason or desire to return capital to our stockholders, we may incur additional debt, issue additional equity to raise the necessary funds, repurchase additional shares of our common stock or pay a dividend. however, we cannot provide assurance that such financing or transactions will be available or successful, or that the terms of such financing or transactions will be favorable to us. we have used and intend to use the cash proceeds from the euronext ipo to repay debt. we have used the net cash proceeds from the sales of nyfix, metabit and wombat to invest in growth initiatives, pursue strategic investments, return capital to shareholders via dividends and share repurchases and repay debt. see "- recent developments" above.
in connection with our acquisition of nyse, we assumed nyse's pension plans covering its u.s. and certain european operations. the benefit accrual for the u.s. operations pension plan is frozen. following the euronext ipo in june 2014, there are no longer any nyse european operations covered by the pension plans. during the year ended december 31, 2014, we contributed $51 million to our pension plans. our practice is to fund our frozen defined benefit pension plan each year at a level above the minimum required contribution but within tax deductible limits. based on actuarial projections, we estimate that a contribution of $10 million in 2015 will allow us to meet our funding goal. however, the actual contribution is contingent on the actual plan performance relative to assumptions.
prior to our acquisition, nyse completed the sale of a significant equity interest in nyse amex options, one of its two u.s. options exchanges, to seven external investors. under the terms of the sale, the external investors have the option to require us to repurchase a portion of its equity interest on an annual basis over the course of five years, which began in 2011. we currently own 84% of nyse amex options and the remaining 16% of the outstanding shares of nyse amex options, currently valued at $125 million, can be put back to us by the external investors in 2015 and these shares are recorded as redeemable non-controlling interest as of december 31, 2014.
we are obligated to contribute an aggregate of $100 million to the ice clear credit guaranty fund and the ice clear europe cds guaranty fund and have already contributed $50 million to the ice clear credit guaranty fund and $28 million to the ice clear europe cds guaranty fund as of december 31, 2014. we are obligated to contribute an additional $22 million to the ice clear europe cds guaranty fund as of october 7, 2015, two years from the launch of cds client clearing at ice clear europe.
we own ice futures europe, and in connection with the nyse acquisition, liffe administration and management, or liffe, both of which operate as u.k. recognized investment exchanges. as u.k. recognized investment exchanges, ice futures europe and liffe are required by the financial conduct authority in the united kingdom to restrict the use of the equivalent of six months of operating expenditures, subject to certain deductions, in cash or cash equivalents or investments at all times. as of december 31, 2014 the regulatory capital for ice futures europe and liffe was $57 million and $114 million, respectively. such amounts are reflected as short-term restricted cash and investments in the consolidated balance sheet as of december 31, 2014. in november 2014, we completed the transition of liffe's contracts to ice futures europe. while liffe still has a regulated status, we expect to apply for a de-recognition order in 2015, which will result in the release of the $114 million in regulatory capital and an increase in our cash and cash equivalents. at this time, we do not expect the regulatory capital at ice futures europe to increase during 2015 from $57 million as this balance already takes into account the higher post-liffe migration cost base.
as a u.k. recognized clearing house, ice clear europe is required by the bank of england in the united kingdom to restrict the use of the equivalent of six months of operating expenditures, subject to certain deductions, in cash or cash equivalents or investments at all times. as of december 31, 2014, this amount for ice clear europe was $87 million and is reflected as short-term restricted cash and investments in the consolidated balance sheet as of december 31, 2014. when emir becomes effective, which is currently anticipated during the first half of 2015, the bank of england restricted cash capital requirements for ice clear europe will be superseded by the emir capital requirements, which would require an increase in the liquid regulatory capital requirements of $136 million. we also expect ice clear europe's regulatory capital to increase by an additional $45 million to $50 million during the second quarter of 2015 in connection with the growth of our clearing business and costs at ice clear europe. these regulatory capital increases will be satisfied by way of additional restricted cash through our cash on hand.

in connection with our acquisition of nyse, we obtained a 40% ownership in occ. occ serves as a clearing house for securities options, security futures, commodity futures and options on futures traded on various independent exchanges. occ clears securities options traded on nyse arca and nyse mkt. occ is regulated by the sec as a registered clearing agency and by the cftc as a derivatives clearing organization. occ is developing a new capital plan, which is scheduled to be finalized during the first quarter of 2015, subject to regulatory and occ shareholders' approvals, which would potentially raise $150 million in equity capital from occ's shareholders, including $60 million to be contributed by nyse. in exchange for the equity capital from its shareholders, occ would, subject to determination by its board of directors and compliance with legal requirements, commit to pay an annual dividend to its shareholders equal to the after-tax income of occ, in excess of the amount required to maintain its target capital requirement and satisfy other capital requirements, and after refunds to its clearing members equal to 50% of distributable earnings before tax. in addition, under the occ new capital plan, the occ shareholders would commit to contribute up to $200 million in additional equity capital if certain capital thresholds are breached, including up to $80 million to be contributed by nyse. unless and until such $200 million capital contribution is repaid to the shareholders, occ would not declare any dividends and would not pay refunds to its clearing members. see "- non-operating income (expenses)" above.
non-u.s. gaap financial measures we use non-u.s. gaap measures internally to evaluate our performance and in making financial and operational decisions. when viewed in conjunction with our u.s. gaap results and the accompanying reconciliation, we believe that our presentation of these measures provides investors with greater transparency and a greater understanding of factors affecting our financial condition and results of operations than u.s. gaap measures alone. in addition, we believe the presentation of these measures is useful to investors for period-to-period comparison of results because the items described below are not reflective of our core business performance. these financial measures are not in accordance with, or an alternative to, u.s. gaap financial measures and may be different from non-u.s. gaap measures used by other companies. we use these adjusted results because we believe they more clearly highlight trends in our business that may not otherwise be apparent when relying solely on u.s. gaap financial measures, since these measures eliminate from our results specific financial items that have less bearing on our core operating performance. we strongly recommend that investors review the u.s. gaap financial measures included in this annual report on form 10-k, including our consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto.
adjusted total operating expenses, adjusted operating income, adjusted operating margin, adjusted income from continuing operations, adjusted net income attributable to ice and adjusted earnings per share for the periods presented below are calculated by adding or subtracting the adjustments described below, which are not reflective of our cash operations and core business performance, and their related income tax effect (in millions, except per share amounts):

we include acquisition-related transaction costs as part of our core business expenses, except for those that are directly related to the announcement, closing, financing or termination of a transaction. however, we are including all of the acquisition-related transaction and integration costs relating to our acquisition of nyse as non-u.s. gaap adjustments given the size of the acquisition,

including a loss of $4 million for the year ended december 31, 2014 in connection with pension plan settlements made for early termination lump-sum payments made in 2014. we are also showing as non-u.s. gaap adjustments our amortization of acquisition-related intangibles, as excluding these non-cash expenses provides greater clarity regarding our financial strength and cash operating results.
during the year and three months ended december 31, 2014, in addition to the adjustments for the nyse acquisition-related integration costs and the amortization of the acquisition-related intangibles, we also include as adjustments the net gain on the sale of our 6% remaining ownership in euronext and the income recognized on our occ equity investment. during the year and three months ended december 31, 2013, in addition to the adjustments for the nyse acquisition-related transaction and integration costs and the amortization of the acquisition-related intangibles, we also include as adjustments the impairment loss recorded on our equity investment in cetip, the banker success fee relating to the acquisition of ice endex, the expense relating to the early payoff of outstanding debt, the impact of certain foreign tax law changes that occurred during the fourth quarter of 2013 and the duplicate rent expenses and lease termination costs we incurred as we consolidated multiple new york office locations in the current year. during the year and three months ended december 31, 2012, we include as adjustments the nyse acquisition-related transaction costs and amortization of the acquisition-related intangibles. for additional information on these items, refer to our consolidated financial statements and related notes, which are included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10-k and "- operating expenses" and "-non-operating income (expenses)" above.
off-balance sheet arrangements we do not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities, which have been established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes.

we have excluded from the contractual obligations and commercial commitments table above $47.5 billion in cash margin deposits and guaranty fund liabilities. clearing members of ice clear europe, ice clear u.s., ice clear credit, ice clear canada, tcc and hch are required to deposit original margin and variation margin and to make deposits to a guaranty fund. the cash deposits made to these margin accounts and to the guaranty fund are recorded in the consolidated balance sheet as current assets with corresponding current liabilities to the clearing members that deposited them. see note 12 to our consolidated financial statements and related notes that are included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10-k for additional information on our clearing houses and the margin deposits and guaranty funds' liabilities.
we have also excluded unrecognized tax benefits, or utbs, from the contractual obligations and commercial commitments table above. as of december 31, 2014, our cumulative utbs were $145 million. interest and penalties related to utbs were $45 million as of december 31, 2014. we are under continuous examination by various tax authorities. we are unable to make a reasonable estimate of the periods of cash settlement because it is not possible to reasonably predict, the amount of tax, interest and penalties, if any, that might be assessed by a tax authority or the timing of an assessment or payment. it is also not possible to reasonably predict whether or not the applicable statutes of limitations might expire without us being examined by any particular tax authority. see note 11 to our consolidated financial statements and related notes that are included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10-k for additional information on our utbs.
68
as of december 31, 2014, in connection with our acquisition of nyse, we have obligations related to our pension and other benefit programs. the date of payment under these obligations cannot be determined and have been excluded from the table above. see note 14 to our consolidated financial statements and related notes that are included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10-k for additional information on our pension and other benefit programs.
prior to our acquisition, nyse completed the sale of a significant equity interest in nyse amex options, one of its two u.s. options exchanges, to seven external investors. under the terms of the sale, the external investors have the option to require us to repurchase a portion of their equity interest on an annual basis over the course of five years, which began in 2011. since the likelihood of us acquiring the non-controlling interest in the future is probable, the full redemption fair value has been recorded as mezzanine equity and we have classified the related balance as "redeemable non-controlling interest" in our consolidated balance sheet. we currently own 84% of nyse amex options and the remaining 16% of the outstanding shares of nyse amex options, currently valued at $125 million, can be put back to us by the external investors in 2015 and these shares are recorded as redeemable non-controlling interest as of december 31, 2014. however, we cannot estimate whether the external investors will elect to exercise their remaining put options and it has been excluded from the table above. see note 13 to our consolidated financial statements and related notes that are included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10-k for additional information on the redeemable non-controlling interest.
in connection with our acquisition of nyse, we obtained a 40% ownership in occ. occ is developing a new capital plan, which is scheduled to be finalized during the first quarter of 2015, subject to occ's regulatory and occ shareholders' approvals, which would potentially raise $150 million in equity capital from occ's shareholders, including $60 million to be contributed by nyse. in addition, under the occ new capital plan, the occ shareholders would commit to contribute up to $200 million in additional equity capital if certain capital thresholds are breached, including up to $80 million to be contributed by nyse. however, we cannot estimate whether the occ new capital plan will be approved and for how much and the $60 million initial contribution and the potential $80 million additional contribution from us has been excluded from the table above. see "- future capital requirements" above.
new and recently adopted accounting pronouncements refer to note 2 to our consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10-k for information on the new and recently adopted accounting pronouncements that are applicable to us.
critical accounting policies we have identified the policies below as critical to our business operations and the understanding of our results of operations. the impact of, and any associated risks related to, these policies on our business operations is discussed throughout "management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations". for a detailed discussion on the application of these and other accounting policies, see note 2 to our consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10-k. our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with u.s. gaap. the preparation of financial statements in conformity with these accounting principles requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities, and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities, at the date of our financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.
we evaluate our estimates and judgments on an ongoing basis, including those related to the accounting matters described below. we base our estimates and judgments on our historical experience and other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances when we make these estimates and judgments. based on these factors, we make estimates and judgments about, among other things, the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from market prices or other independent sources and about the recognition and characterization of our revenues and expenses. the values and results based on these estimates and judgments could differ significantly under different assumptions or conditions and could change materially in the future.
we believe that the following critical accounting policies, among others, affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements and could materially increase or decrease our reported results, assets and liabilities.
goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets we have significant intangible assets related to goodwill and other acquired intangible assets. in connection with our acquisitions, assets acquired and liabilities assumed are recorded at their estimated fair values. goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price of our acquisitions over the fair value of identifiable net assets acquired, including other identified intangible assets. we recognize specifically identifiable intangibles when a specific right or contract is acquired. our determination of the fair value of the intangible assets and whether or not these assets are impaired requires us to make significant judgments and requires us to use
69
significant estimates and assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows. if we change our strategy or if market conditions shift, our judgments may change, which may result in adjustments to recorded asset balances. as of december 31, 2014, we had goodwill of $8.5 billion and net other intangible assets of $7.8 billion relating to our acquisitions, our purchase of trademarks and internet domain names from various third parties, and the russell licensing agreement. of these amounts, $6.1 billion in goodwill and $7.0 billion of other intangible assets relates to our acquisition of nyse on november 13, 2013. we do not amortize goodwill or other intangible assets with indefinite useful lives. intangible assets with finite useful lives are amortized over their estimated useful lives.
in performing the purchase price allocation, we consider, among other factors, the intended future use of acquired assets, analysis of historical financial performance and estimates of future performance of the acquired business. at the acquisition date, a preliminary allocation of the purchase price is recorded based upon a preliminary valuation. we continue to review and validate estimates, assumptions and valuation methodologies underlying the preliminary valuation during the measurement period. accordingly, these estimates and assumptions are subject to change, which could have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. the measurement period ends as soon as we receive the information about facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date or we learn that more information is not obtainable, which usually does not exceed one year from the date of acquisition.
our goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets are evaluated for impairment annually in our fiscal fourth quarter or more frequently if conditions exist that indicate that the value may be impaired. we test our goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level. these impairment evaluations are performed by comparing the carrying value of the goodwill reporting unit or other indefinite-lived intangibles to its estimated fair value. we allocate goodwill to reporting units based on the reporting unit expected to benefit from the business combination. subsequent to our acquisition of nyse, we identified five reporting units: our futures reporting unit, our cds reporting unit, our cash listings reporting unit, our euronext reporting unit and our technology reporting unit. the cash listings, euronext and technology reporting units were added as part of our nyse acquisition on november 13, 2013. as a result of the ipo of euronext and the sale of nyse technologies during the year ended december 31, 2014, we currently have three reporting units: our futures reporting unit, our cds reporting unit and our cash listings reporting unit.
goodwill impairment testing consists of a two-step methodology. the initial step requires us to determine the fair value of each reporting unit and compare it to the carrying value, including goodwill and other intangible assets, of such reporting unit. if the fair value exceeds the carrying value, no impairment loss is recognized and the second step, which is a calculation of the impairment, is not performed. however, if the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value, an impairment charge is recorded equal to the extent that the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value. for annual goodwill impairment testing, we have the option to first perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, including goodwill and other intangible assets. if we conclude that this is the case, we must perform the two-step methodology described above. otherwise, we can skip the two-step methodology and do not need to perform any further testing. for annual indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment testing, we also have the option to first perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible assets is less than its carrying amount.
application of the impairment test requires judgment, including the identification of reporting units, assignment of assets and liabilities to reporting units, assignment of goodwill to reporting units, and determination of the fair value of each reporting unit. we have historically determined the fair value of our reporting units based on various valuation techniques, including discounted cash flow analysis and a multiple of earnings approach. in assessing whether goodwill and other intangible assets are impaired, we must make estimates and assumptions regarding future cash flows, long-term growth rates of our business, operating margins, discount rates, weighted average cost of capital and other factors to determine the fair value of our assets. these estimates and assumptions require management's judgment, and changes to these estimates and assumptions, as a result of changing economic and competitive conditions, could materially affect the determination of fair value and/or impairment. the cash flows employed in the discounted cash flow analysis are based on our most recent budgets and business plans and, when applicable, various growth rates have been assumed for years beyond the current business plan period. future events could cause us to conclude that indicators of impairment exist for goodwill or other intangible assets. impairment may result from, among other things, deterioration in the performance of our business, adverse market conditions, adverse changes in applicable laws and regulations, competition, or the sale or disposition of a reporting unit. any resulting impairment loss could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations.
our impairment analysis has not resulted in any impairment of goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets through december 31, 2014. among our reporting units, the fair value of our cds reporting unit has been the closest to its carrying value in prior goodwill impairment analyses. our cds reporting unit includes the financial results and net assets of creditex, ice clear credit and the cds clearing business at ice clear europe. cds trade execution revenues at creditex have decreased the last several years. the cds execution business remains pressured due to financial reform implementation and a general lack of volatility in the corporate credit markets. however, the decline in cds trading revenues was offset by an increase in ice cds clearing, the listing of additional cleared cds products, and signing on new clearing members, along with a decrease in expenses at creditex. also, with the advent of mandatory clearing during 2013, cds clearing activity by investment funds, asset managers, and similar buy side market participants has increased significantly.
70
during the first step of the cds impairment review in the fourth quarter of 2014, we performed a discounted cash flow valuation to estimate the fair value of our cds reporting unit. the valuation of our cds reporting unit concluded that the fair value exceeded carrying value by $751 million, or 132% of the carrying value in the fourth quarter of 2014. as of december 31, 2014, the cds goodwill and other intangible assets balances were $476 million. the discount rate used in the cds discounted cash flow valuation is intended to reflect the risks inherent in the future cash flows of the cds reporting unit and was 9.2% in the fourth quarter 2014 review. a 10 basis point increase in the discount rate used would not have a material impact on our fair value of the cds reporting unit. a 10% decrease in the estimated discounted cash flows for the cds reporting unit would result in the fair value of the reporting unit exceeding the carrying value by $548 million.
given the current market conditions and continued economic and regulatory uncertainty, the fair value of our cds reporting unit may deteriorate and could result in the need to record an impairment charge in future periods. we continue to monitor potential triggering events in our cds reporting unit, including changes in the business and regulatory climate in which it operates, the current volatility in the capital markets, our recent operating performance and our financial projections. any changes in these factors could result in an impairment charge.
we are also required to evaluate other finite-lived intangible assets and property and equipment for impairment by determining whether events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of these assets to be held and used may not be recoverable. if impairment indicators are present, then an estimate of undiscounted future cash flows produced by these long-lived assets is compared to the carrying value of those assets to determine if the asset is recoverable. if an asset is not recoverable, the loss is measured as the difference between fair value and carrying value of the impaired asset. fair value of these assets is based on various valuation techniques, including discounted cash flow analysis. our evaluation has not resulted in any impairment of other finite-lived intangible assets and property and equipment through december 31, 2014.
income taxes we are subject to income taxes in the united states and other foreign jurisdictions where we operate. the determination of our provision for income taxes and related accruals, deferred tax assets and liabilities requires significant judgment, the use of estimates, and the interpretation and application of complex tax laws. we recognize a current tax liability or tax asset for the estimated taxes payable or refundable on tax returns for the current year. we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax bases of our assets and liabilities. we establish valuation allowances if we believe that it is more likely than not that some or all of our deferred tax assets will not be realized. deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using current enacted tax rates in effect for the years in which those temporary differences and carryforwards are expected to reverse.
we do not recognize a tax benefit unless we conclude that it is more likely than not that the benefit will be sustained on audit by the taxing authority based solely on the technical merits of the associated tax position. if the recognition threshold is met, we recognize a tax benefit measured at the largest amount of the tax benefit that, in our judgment, is greater than 50 percent likely to be realized. we recognize accrued interest and penalties related to uncertain income tax positions as income tax expense in the consolidated statements of income.
the undistributed earnings from our non-u.s. subsidiaries are considered to be indefinitely reinvested and, accordingly, no provision for u.s. federal and state income taxes has been made in our consolidated financial statements. a distribution of these non-u.s. earnings in the form of dividends, or otherwise, could subject us to both u.s. federal and state income taxes, as adjusted for non-u.s. tax credits, and withholding taxes payable to the various non-u.s. countries. determination of the amount of any unrecognized deferred income tax liability on these undistributed earnings is not practicable.
we operate within multiple domestic and foreign taxing jurisdictions and are subject to audit in these jurisdictions by domestic and foreign tax authorities. these audits include questions regarding our tax filing positions, including the timing and amount of deductions taken and the allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions. we record accruals for the estimated outcomes of these audits, and the accruals may change in the future due to new developments in each matter. at any point in time, many tax years are subject to or in the process of being audited by various taxing authorities. to the extent our estimates of settlements change or the final tax outcome of these matters is different from the amounts recorded, such differences will impact the income tax provision in the period in which such determinations are made. our income tax expense includes changes in our estimated liability for exposures associated with our various tax filing positions. determining the income tax expense for these potential assessments requires management to make assumptions that are subject to factors such as proposed assessments by tax authorities, changes in facts and circumstances, issuance of new regulations, and resolution of tax audits.
we believe the judgments and estimates discussed above are reasonable. however, if actual results are not consistent with our estimates or assumptions, we may be exposed to losses or gains that could be material.
71
pension and other post-retirement employee benefits in connection with our acquisition of nyse, we assumed nyse's pension plans and other post-retirement employee benefit plans covering its u.s. and certain european operations. following the euronext ipo in june 2014, there are no longer any nyse european operations covered by the pensions plans and other post-retirement employee benefit plans. pension and other post-retirement employee benefits costs and liabilities are dependent on assumptions used in calculating such amounts. these assumptions include discount rates to measure future obligation and interest expense, mortality rates, health care cost trend rates, benefits earned, interest cost, expected return on assets, and other factors. in accordance with u.s. gaap, actual results that differ from the assumptions are accumulated and amortized over future periods and, therefore, generally affect recognized expense and the recorded obligation in future periods. while we believe that the assumptions used are appropriate, differences in actual experience or changes in assumptions may affect our pension and other post-retirement obligations and future expense.
item 7 (a).     quantitative    and qualitative disclosures about market risk as a result of our operating and financing activities, we are exposed to market risks such as interest rate risk, foreign currency exchange rate risk and credit risk. we have implemented policies and procedures designed to measure, manage, monitor and report risk exposures, which are regularly reviewed by the appropriate management and supervisory bodies.
interest rate risk we have exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relating to our cash and cash equivalents, short-term and long-term investments, short-term and long-term restricted cash and investments, and indebtedness. as of december 31, 2014 and 2013, our cash and cash equivalents, short-term and long-term investments and short-term and long-term restricted cash and investments were $2.9 billion and $1.8 billion, respectively, of which $1.9 billion and $819 million, respectively, were denominated in brazilian reais, pounds sterling, euros or canadian dollars. of the $1.9 billion as of december 31, 2014, €969 million ($1.2 billion) represents euro-denominated cash that was placed in term deposits at various banks with a maturity date of june 25, 2015 to cover the maturity of the nyse euro notes on june 30, 2015. see item 7 "management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations - debt" included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10-k. our investment in cetip, which is recorded as an available-for-sale, long-term investment and was recorded in and is held in brazilian reais, was valued at $379 million as of december 31, 2014, including an unrealized gain of $55 million. changes in the fair value of the cetip investment is reflected in accumulated other comprehensive income and do not impact earnings, except to the extent that unrealized losses are deemed to be other than temporary. the remaining investments are denominated in u.s. dollars. we do not use our investment portfolio for trading or other speculative purposes. a hypothetical decrease in long-term interest rates to zero basis points would decrease annual pre-tax earnings by $3 million as of december 31, 2014, assuming no change in the amount or composition of our cash and cash equivalents, short-term and long-term investments and short-term and long-term restricted cash and investments.
as of december 31, 2014, we had $4.3 billion in outstanding debt, of which $1.4 billion relates to the senior notes and $2.0 billion relates to the nyse notes, both of which bear interest at fixed interest rates. the remaining amount outstanding of $905 million relates to the commercial paper program, which bears interest at fluctuating rates and, therefore, subjects us to interest rate risk. a hypothetical 100 basis point increase in interest rates relating to the amounts outstanding under the commercial paper program as of december 31, 2014 would decrease annual pre-tax earnings by $9 million, assuming no change in the volume or composition of our outstanding indebtedness and no hedging activity. the interest rates on our commercial paper program are currently reset on a daily, weekly or monthly basis. see item 7 "management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations - debt" included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10-k.
foreign currency exchange rate risk as an international business, we are subject to foreign currency exchange rate risk. we may experience gains or losses from foreign currency transactions in the future given that a significant part of our assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses are recorded in euros or pounds sterling. certain assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses of foreign subsidiaries are denominated in the local functional currency of such subsidiaries.

(1)   represents the impact of currency fluctuation for the year ended december 31, 2014 compared to the same period in the prior year.
nyse, which we acquired in november 2013, has a significant part of its assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses recorded in pounds sterling or euros. for the year ended december 31, 2014, 19% of our consolidated revenues, less transaction-based expenses, were denominated in pounds sterling or euros, and 18% of our consolidated expenses were denominated in pounds sterling or euros, respectively. these percentages do not include the euronext revenues and expenses, as they are included in discontinued operations. as the pound sterling or euro exchange rate changes, the u.s. equivalent of revenues and expenses denominated in foreign currencies changes accordingly.
we have foreign currency transaction risk related to the settlement of foreign currency denominated assets, liabilities and payables that occur through our operations, which are received in or paid in pounds sterling or euros, due to the increase or decrease in the foreign currency exchange rates between periods. we had foreign currency transaction losses of $2 million, $2 million and $4 million for the years ended december 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively, primarily attributable to the fluctuations of the pound sterling and euro relative to the u.s. dollar, which strengthened. a 10% adverse change in the underlying foreign currency exchange rates as of december 31, 2014 would result in a foreign currency transaction loss of $6 million, assuming no change in the composition of the foreign currency denominated assets, liabilities and payables and assuming no hedging activity.
we entered into foreign currency hedging transactions during the years ended december 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012 as economic hedges to hedge a portion of our foreign currency transaction exposure and may enter into additional hedging transactions in the future to help mitigate our foreign exchange risk exposure.
we have foreign currency translation risk equal to our net investment in our foreign subsidiaries. the financial statements of these subsidiaries are translated into u.s. dollars using a current rate of exchange, with gains or losses included in the cumulative translation adjustment account, a component of equity. our exposure to the net investment in foreign currencies is presented by primary foreign currencies in the table below (in millions):

the nyse eur notes of €920 million ($1.1 billion) no longer constitute a partial hedge of nyse's net euro investment in foreign entities following the ipo of euronext. the transaction gain or loss from the revaluation of the nyse eur notes on the u.s. dollar balance sheet of nyse holdings llc will be offset by the transaction gain or loss from the cash held in euros to repay the notes upon their maturity in june 2015, as discussed above.

as of december 31, 2014 and 2013, the portion of our equity attributable to accumulated other comprehensive income from foreign currency translation was $13 million and $143 million, respectively. as of december 31, 2014, we had net exposure of euro and pounds sterling of €601 million ($731 million) and £2.1 billion ($3.2 billion), respectively. based on december 31, 2014 net currency positions, a hypothetical 10% decrease of euro against u.s. dollar would negatively impact our equity by $73 million and a hypothetical 10% decrease of pound sterling against u.s. dollar would negatively impact our equity by $325 million. for the year ended december 31, 2014, currency exchange rate differences had a negative impact of $130 million on our consolidated equity.
credit risk we are exposed to credit risk in our operations in the event of a counterparty default. we limit our exposure to credit risk by rigorously selecting the counterparties with which we make our investments and execute agreements. credit risk is monitored by using exposure limits depending on ratings assigned by rating agencies as well as the nature and maturity of transactions. our investment objective is to invest in securities that preserve principal while maximizing yields, without significantly increasing risk. we seek to substantially mitigate credit risk associated with investments by ensuring that these financial assets are placed with governments, well-capitalized financial institutions and other creditworthy counterparties.
an ongoing review is performed to evaluate changes in the status of counterparties. in addition to the intrinsic creditworthiness of counterparties, our policies require diversification of counterparties (banks, financial institutions, bond issuers and funds) so as to avoid a concentration of risk.
clearing house cash deposits credit risk our clearing houses hold material amounts of clearing member cash deposits which are invested primarily to provide security of capital, but also which may generate interest income for our clearing members. refer to note 12 to our consolidated financial statements and related notes, which are included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10-k, for more information on the clearing houses cash deposits, which were $47.5 billion as of december 31, 2014. the following is a summary of the risks associated with this investment activity and how these risks are mitigated.
interest rate risk interest rate risk is the risk that interest rates rise causing the value of the purchased security to decline. if we were required to sell the security prior to its maturity, and interest rates had risen, the sale of the security might be made at a loss relative to its original purchase price. our clearing houses seek to manage this risk by making all of our cash deposit investments in sovereign debt reverse repurchase agreements that mature within 1 to 37 days. our clearing house investment guidelines require that a minimum of 50% of clearing member cash deposits are invested in sovereign debt reverse repurchase agreements that mature within one business day. efforts are made to invest the remaining 50% in sovereign debt reverse repurchase agreements that mature within 37 business days. if this is not possible, our policy allows for the investment of up to 50% of clearing member cash deposits in high quality sovereign debt (for example, u.s. treasury securities) and supranational debt instruments (euro cash deposits only) with the shortest possible time to maturity provided that no such direct investment in a sovereign debt or supranational instrument will have a time to maturity greater than 397 days (1.09 years).
security issuer risk security issuer risk is the risk that an issuer of a security defaults on its payment when the security matures. this risk is mitigated by investing clearing member cash deposits in high quality sovereign debt reverse repurchase agreements or direct investments in high quality sovereign and supranational debt issues. thus, the risk is mitigated because, in the event of a security issuer default, we are left with a highly marketable, liquid security.
investment counterparty risk investment counterparty risk is the risk that a reverse repurchase agreement counterparty or an investment adviser might become insolvent and, thus, fail to meet its obligations to our clearing houses. we mitigate this risk by only engaging in transactions with high credit quality reverse repurchase agreement counterparties and investment advisors.
when engaging in reverse repurchase agreements, our clearing houses take delivery of the underlying reverse repurchase securities in custody accounts that are under the control of our clearing house. additionally, the securities purchased subject to reverse repurchase have a market value greater than the reverse repurchase amount. the typical haircut received for high quality sovereign debt is 2% of the reverse repurchase amount. thus, in the event that a reverse repurchase counterparty defaults on its obligation to repurchase the underlying reverse repurchase securities, our clearing house will have possession of a security with a value greater than the reverse repurchase counterparty's obligation to our clearing house.
our clearing houses do not hold clearing member cash deposits or the underlying investments with any of our investment advisors. our clearing house property is held in custody accounts controlled by our clearing houses. our clearing houses' property is
74
held with credit worthy custodians which include jpmorgan chase bank n.a., citibank n.a., bny mellon, bmo harris n.a. and euroclear bank brussels (for non-u.s. dollar deposits).
each clearing house employs (or will employ) multiple investment advisors and custodians to ensure that in the event that a single investment adviser or custodian becomes unable to fulfill its role, additional investment advisors or custodians are available as back-ups.
cross-currency margin deposit risk each of our clearing houses, pursuant to their rules, may permit posting of cross-currency collateral to satisfy margin requirements (for example, accepting original margin deposits denominated in u.s. dollars to secure a japanese yen variation margin obligation). the risk exists that the value of the original margin currency provided to satisfy margin obligations declines in value resulting in an inability to make required variation margins in the appropriate currency. this risk is mitigated by applying a "haircut" to the original margin currency at a level sufficiently high enough to weather periods of high currency volatility. cross-currency balances are marked-to-market on a daily basis. should the value of the currency posted to satisfy margin requirements decline in value, the clearing member is required to increase its original margin deposit on a same-day basis.
impact of inflation we have not been adversely affected by inflation as technological advances and competition have generally caused prices for the hardware and software that we use for our electronic platforms to remain constant or to decline. in the event of inflation, we believe that we will be able to pass on any price increases to our participants, as the prices that we charge are not governed by long-term contracts.

report of independent registered public accounting firm on internal  control over financial reporting board of directors and shareholders intercontinental exchange, inc.
we have audited intercontinental exchange, inc. and subsidiaries' internal control over financial reporting as of december 31, 2014, based on criteria established in internal control - integrated framework issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission (2013 framework) (the coso criteria). intercontinental exchange, inc. and subsidiaries' management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying "report of management on internal control over financial reporting". our responsibility is to express an opinion on the company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.
we conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the public company accounting oversight board (united states). those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. we believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
a company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. a company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
in our opinion, intercontinental exchange, inc. and subsidiaries maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of december 31, 2014, based on the coso criteria.
we also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the public company accounting oversight board (united states), the consolidated balance sheets of intercontinental exchange, inc. and subsidiaries as of december 31, 2014 and 2013, and the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, changes in equity, accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) and redeemable non-controlling interest, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended december 31, 2014 of intercontinental exchange, inc. and subsidiaries, and our report dated february 5, 2015 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

intercontinental exchange, inc. and subsidiaries notes to consolidated financial statements
1.   description of business nature of business and organization at the directive of the securities and exchange commission ("sec") to use "plain english" in public filings, intercontinental exchange, inc. will use such terms as "we," "our," "us" or "ice" in place of intercontinental exchange, inc. and its subsidiaries. when such terms are used in this manner throughout the notes to the consolidated financial statements, they are in reference only to the corporation, intercontinental exchange, inc. and its subsidiaries, and are not used in reference to the board of directors, corporate officers, management, or any individual employee or group of employees.
we were previously known as intercontinentalexchange group, inc. and changed our name to intercontinental exchange, inc. on june 2, 2014. we were organized on march 6, 2013 as a direct, wholly-owned subsidiary of intercontinental exchange holdings, inc. (formerly known as intercontinentalexchange, inc.) for the purpose of effecting the acquisition of nyse holdings llc (formerly known as nyse euronext holdings llc) ("nyse"), which occurred on november 13, 2013 (note 3). upon the completion of the acquisition, intercontinental exchange holdings, inc. and nyse each became our wholly-owned subsidiaries. the predecessor entity to intercontinental exchange holdings, inc. was established in may 2000.
we are a leading global operator of regulated exchanges, clearing houses and data services for financial and commodity markets. we operate global marketplaces for trading and clearing a broad array of securities and derivatives contracts across major asset classes, including energy and agricultural commodities, interest rates, equities, equity derivatives, credit derivatives, bonds and currencies.
our regulated exchanges include: futures exchanges in the united states, united kingdom, canada, singapore and europe, three securities exchanges and two equity options exchanges. we operate over-the-counter ("otc") markets for physical energy and credit default swaps ("cds"). we also currently own or operate seven central counterparty clearing houses (note 12). through our widely-distributed electronic trading, clearing and post-trade platforms, we bring together buyers and sellers by offering liquid markets, benchmark products, access to capital markets, and a range of services to support market participants' trading and risk management activities.
2.   summary of significant accounting policies basis of presentation the accompanying consolidated financial statements are presented in accordance with united states ("u.s.") generally accepted accounting principles ("u.s. gaap"). the consolidated financial statements include the accounts of ice and our wholly-owned and controlled subsidiaries. all intercompany balances and transactions between ice and our wholly-owned and controlled subsidiaries have been eliminated in consolidation. as discussed in note 3, we completed several acquisitions during the years ended december 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012 and have included the financial results of these companies in the consolidated financial statements effective from the respective acquisition dates. as discussed in note 16, we completed the initial public offering ("ipo") of our wholly-owned subsidiary euronext n.v. ("euronext") on june 24, 2014 and completed the sales of wombat on july 23, 2014 and nyfix and metabit on september 19, 2014, and have included the financial results of these companies in discontinued operations in the consolidated financial statements.
use of estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with u.s. gaap requires our management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements. estimates also affect the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. actual amounts could differ from those estimates.
comprehensive income other comprehensive income includes changes in unrealized gains and losses on financial instruments classified as available-for-sale, changes in fair value of net investment hedges, foreign currency translation adjustments and amortization of the difference in the projected benefit obligation and the accumulated benefit obligation associated with benefit plan liabilities, net of tax.
non-controlling interest for those consolidated subsidiaries in which our ownership is less than 100% and for which we have control over the assets and liabilities and the management of the entity, the outside stockholders' interests are shown as non-controlling interests. for instances
85
where outside stockholders' hold an option to require us to repurchase the outside stockholders' interest, these interests are shown as redeemable non-controlling interests.
segment and geographic information we operate as a single reportable business segment as this is reflective of how our chief operating decision maker reviews and operates the business. substantially all of our identifiable assets are located in the united states, united kingdom, continental europe, israel, canada and singapore.
cash and cash equivalents we consider all short-term, highly liquid investments with original maturities at the purchase date of three months or less to be cash equivalents.
short-term and long-term restricted cash and investments we classify all cash and cash equivalents that are not available for general use by us, either due to regulatory requirements or through restrictions in specific agreements, as restricted in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets (note 4).
short-term and long-term investments we periodically invest a portion of our cash in excess of short-term operating needs in term deposits and investment-grade marketable debt securities, including government or government sponsored agencies and corporate debt securities (note 5). these investments are classified as available-for-sale in accordance with u.s. gaap. we do not have any investments classified as held-to-maturity or trading. additionally, we classify equity and fixed income mutual funds, held for the purpose of providing future payments for the supplemental executive savings plan and a component of the supplemental executive retirement plan, as available-for-sale securities. available-for-sale investments are carried at their fair value using primarily quoted prices in active markets for identical securities, with unrealized gains and losses, net of deferred income taxes, reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income. realized gains and losses, and declines in value deemed to be other-than-temporary on available-for-sale investments, are recognized currently in earnings. the cost of securities sold is based on the specific identification method. investments that we intend to hold for more than one year are classified as long-term investments in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.
cost and equity method investments we use the cost method to account for a non-marketable equity investment in an entity that we do not control and for which we do not have the ability to exercise significant influence over an entity's operating and financial policies. when we do not have a controlling financial interest in an entity but exercise significant influence over the entity's operating and financial policies, such investment is accounted for using the equity method. we recognize dividend income when declared. we recognized $23 million, $8 million, and $5 million in dividend income for the years ended december 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively, related to our investment in cetip (note 15).
margin deposits and guaranty funds original margin, variation margin and guaranty funds held by our clearing houses for clearing members may be in the form of cash, government obligations, letters of credit or gold (note 12). cash original margin, variation margin and guaranty fund deposits are reflected in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets as current assets and current liabilities. the amount of margin deposits on hand will fluctuate over time as a result of, among other things, the extent of open positions held at any point in time by market participants in contracts and the margin rates then in effect for such contracts. non-cash original margin and guaranty fund deposits are not reflected in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. these non-cash assets are held in safekeeping and our clearing houses do not take legal ownership of the assets as the risks and rewards remain with the clearing members, unless and until such time as a clearing member defaults on its obligations to the clearing house.
property and equipment property and equipment is recorded at cost, reduced by accumulated depreciation (note 6). depreciation and amortization expense related to property and equipment is computed using the straight-line method based on estimated useful lives of the assets, or in the case of leasehold improvements, the shorter of the initial lease term or the estimated useful life of the improvement. we review the remaining estimated useful lives of our property and equipment at each balance sheet date and will make adjustments to the estimated remaining useful lives whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the remaining useful lives have changed.
86
gains on disposals of property and equipment are included in other income and losses on disposals of property and equipment are included in depreciation expense. maintenance and repair costs are expensed as incurred.
allowance for doubtful accounts the allowance for doubtful accounts is maintained at a level that we believe to be sufficient to absorb probable losses in our accounts receivable portfolio. the allowance is based on several factors, including a continuous assessment of the collectability of each account. in circumstances where a specific customer's inability to meet its financial obligations is known, we record a specific provision for bad debts against amounts due to reduce the receivable to the amount we reasonably believe will be collected. accounts receivable are written off against the allowance for doubtful accounts when collection efforts cease. a reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of allowance for doubtful accounts is as follows for the years ended december 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012 (in millions):
year ended december 31,
2014                                                                               2013   2012
beginning balance of allowance for doubtful accounts        $1                  $1                  $3
bad debt expense                                             1                   1                  (1    )
charge-offs                                                 (1    )             (1    )             (1    )
ending balance of allowance for doubtful accounts           $1                  $1                  $1
bad debt expense in the table above is based on our historical collection experiences and our assessment of the collectability of specific accounts. charge-offs in the table above represent the write-off of uncollectible receivables, net of recoveries. these lines also include the impact of foreign currency translation adjustments.
software development costs we capitalize costs, both internal and external direct and incremental costs, related to software developed or obtained for internal use in accordance with u.s. gaap. software development costs incurred during the preliminary or maintenance project stages are expensed as incurred, while costs incurred during the application development stage are capitalized and are amortized using the straight-line method over the useful life of the software, not to exceed three years. amortization of these capitalized costs begins only when the software becomes ready for its intended use. general and administrative costs related to developing or obtaining such software are expensed as incurred.
accrued employee benefits in connection with our acquisition of nyse on november 13, 2013, we assumed the nyse defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans (collectively "benefit plans"). we recognize the funded status of the benefit plans in the consolidated balance sheets, measure the fair value of plan assets and benefit obligations as of the date of our fiscal year-end, and provide additional disclosures in the footnotes to the consolidated financial statements (note 14).
benefit plan costs and liabilities are dependent on assumptions used in calculating such amounts. these assumptions include discount rates, health care cost trend rates, benefits earned, interest cost, expected return on assets, mortality rates and other factors. actual results that differ from the assumptions are accumulated and amortized over future periods and, therefore, generally affect recognized expense and the recorded obligation in future periods. we immediately recognize in the consolidated statements of income certain of these unrecognized amounts when triggering events occur, such as when a settlement of pension obligations in excess of total interest and service costs occurs. while we believe that the assumptions used are appropriate, differences in actual experience or changes in assumptions may affect our pension and other post-retirement obligations and future expense recognized.
goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price of our acquisitions over the fair value of identifiable net assets acquired, including other identified intangible assets (note 7). we recognize specifically identifiable intangibles when a specific right or contract is acquired. goodwill has been allocated to reporting units for purposes of impairment testing based on the portion of synergy, cost savings and other expected future cash flows expected to benefit the reporting units at the time of the acquisition. we test our goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level. the reporting units identified for our goodwill testing are the futures, cash listings and credit default swaps reporting units. goodwill impairment testing is performed annually in the fiscal fourth quarter or more frequently if conditions exist that indicate that the asset may be impaired.
we also evaluate indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment annually in our fiscal fourth quarter or more frequently if conditions exist that indicate that the asset may be impaired. such evaluation includes determining the fair value of the asset and
87
comparing the fair value of the asset with its carrying value. if the fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible asset is less than its carrying value, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to the difference.
for both goodwill and indefinite lived impairment testing, we have the option to first perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit or indefinite lived intangible asset is less than its carrying amount. if we conclude that this is the case, we must perform additional testing of the asset or reporting unit. otherwise, no further testing is necessary.
we did not record an impairment charge related to goodwill or indefinite-lived intangible assets during the years ended december 31, 2014, 2013 or 2012.
impairment of long-lived assets and finite-lived intangible assets we review our property and equipment and finite-lived intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be fully recoverable. to analyze recoverability, we project undiscounted net future cash flows over the remaining life of such assets. if these projected cash flows are less than the carrying amount, an impairment indicator would exist. the impairment loss is measured based upon the difference between the carrying amount and the fair value of the assets. finite-lived intangible assets are generally amortized on a straight-line basis or using an accelerated method over the lesser of their contractual or estimated useful lives. we did not record an impairment charge related to long-lived assets and finite-lived intangible assets during the years ended december 31, 2014, 2013 or 2012.
derivatives and hedging activity we may use derivative instruments to limit exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. all derivatives are required to be recorded at fair value in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. changes in the fair value of such derivative financial instruments are recognized in net income as they are not designated as hedges under u.s. gaap.
we may hedge the foreign currency translation of certain net investments by designating all or a portion of certain financial liabilities denominated in the same currency in accordance with u.s. gaap. in such cases, the gain or loss on the currency translation of the designated financial instruments is recorded in other comprehensive income. gains and losses on financial liabilities designated as hedging items under net investment hedging relationships are recognized in other comprehensive income, and we recorded a loss of $19 million for the year ended december 31, 2013 related to these items. the total unrealized loss of $21 million (inclusive of $2 million in unrealized losses recorded during the year ended december 31, 2014) was recognized in earnings as a component of income from discontinued operations during the year ended december 31, 2014 upon discontinuance of the net investment hedge in connection with the ipo of euronext.
intellectual property all costs related to internally developed patents and trademarks are expensed as incurred. all costs related to purchased patents, trademarks and internet domain names are recorded as other intangible assets and are amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives. all costs related to licensed patents are capitalized and amortized on a straight-line basis over the term of the license.
income taxes we recognize income taxes under the liability method. we recognize a current tax liability or tax asset for the estimated taxes payable or refundable on tax returns for the current year. we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax bases of assets and liabilities. we establish valuation allowances if we believe that it is more likely than not that some or all of our deferred tax assets will not be realized. deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using current enacted tax rates in effect.
we do not recognize a tax benefit unless we conclude that it is more likely than not that the benefit will be sustained on audit by the taxing authority based solely on the technical merits of the associated tax position. if the recognition threshold is met, we recognize a tax benefit measured at the largest amount of the tax benefit that, in our judgment, is greater than 50 percent likely to be realized. we recognize accrued interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions as a component of income tax expense.
we are subject to tax in numerous domestic and foreign jurisdictions primarily based on our operations in these jurisdictions. significant judgment is required in assessing the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements or tax returns. fluctuations in the actual outcome of these future tax consequences could have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations.
revenue recognition
88
our revenues primarily consist of transaction and clearing fee revenues for transactions executed and/or cleared through our global electronic derivatives trading and clearing platforms and revenues relating to cash equities trading and listing fees.
derivatives trading and clearing revenues are recognized over the period in which the services are provided, which is typically the date the transactions are executed or are cleared, except for a portion of clearing revenues related to cleared contracts which have an ongoing clearing obligation that extends beyond the execution date. the transaction and clearing fee revenues are determined on the basis of the transaction and clearing fee charged for each contract traded on the exchanges. derivatives transaction and clearing fees are recorded net of rebates of $631 million, $511 million and $372 million for the years ended december 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. we offer rebates in certain of our markets primarily to support market liquidity and trading volumes by providing qualified trading participants in those markets a discount to the applicable commission rate. these rebates reduce revenue that we would have generated had we charged full transaction fees and had we generated the same volume without the rebate program. the increase in rebates is due primarily to rebates relating to nyse derivatives trading and clearing following our acquisition, an increase in the number of participants in the rebate programs offered on various contracts, an increase in the number of rebate programs offered and from higher contract volume traded under these programs during the periods.
cash trading fee revenues are paid by organizations based on their trading activity. fees are assessed on a per share basis for trading in equity securities. the fees are applicable to all transactions that take place on any of our equity trading venues, and the fees vary based on the size and type of trade that is consummated and trading venue. the securities exchanges earn transaction fees for customer orders of equity securities matched internally, as well as for customer orders routed to other exchanges. cash trading fees are recognized as earned, which is generally upon execution of the trade. cash trading fees are recorded gross of liquidity rebates and routing charges. liquidity payments made to cash trading customers and routing charges made to other exchanges are included in transaction-based expenses in the consolidated statements of income.
listing fee revenues consist of original listing fees paid by issuers to list the initial securities on the various cash markets, other listing fees related to other corporate actions (including stock splits, sales of additional securities and merger and acquisitions), annual listing fees paid by companies whose financial instruments are listed on the cash markets, and other services provided to our listed companies and other companies. original listing fees are assessed primarily based on the number of shares that the issuer initially lists. original listing fees are recognized as revenue on a straight-line basis over the estimated service periods ranging from five to nine years. other corporate action listing fees are recognized as revenue on a straight-line basis over the estimated service periods ranging from three to six years. the service periods are determined separately for each of our listing venues. annual listing fees are billed at the beginning of the year and are recognized on a pro rata basis over the calendar year. we determined that at the time of the acquisition of nyse, we did not have a legal performance obligation relating to the original and other listing fees. therefore, in connection with purchase accounting rules under u.s. gaap, we assigned a fair value of zero to the nyse unamortized deferred revenue balances relating to the original and other listing fees as of the acquisition date of november 13, 2013. the listing fees unamortized deferred revenue balances as of december 31, 2014 relate to original and other corporate action listing fees received but not yet recognized as revenue subsequent to the november 13, 2013 acquisition through december 31, 2014.
data services fee revenues in our derivatives markets primarily include terminal and license fees received from data vendors in exchange for the provision of real-time futures price information and market data access fees. market data fees are charged to data vendors on a monthly basis based on the number and type of terminals they have carrying futures data. each data vendor also pays an annual license fee, which is deferred and recognized as revenue ratably over the period of the annual license. data services fee revenues also include market data access fees charged to customers that trade on the electronic platform. the market data access amount for each company is based on the number of users at each company trading on the electronic platform. the excess of the market data access fee total for each company over the actual amount of commissions paid for trading activity is recognized as market data access revenues. the actual amount of commissions paid that month for trading activity is recognized as transaction and clearing fee revenues.
following our nyse acquisition, we collect market data revenues for consortium-based data products and, to a lesser extent, for new york stock exchange proprietary data products. consortium-based data fees are determined by securities industry plans. consortium-based data revenues that coordinated market data distribution generates (net of administration costs) are distributed to participating markets on the basis of the regulation nms formula. we collect annual license fees from vendors for the right to distribute market data to third parties and a service fee from vendors for direct connection to market data. these fees are recognized as revenue as services are rendered. we also charge customers for accessing our data services through secured financial transaction infrastructure ("sfti") and colocation services. sfti is a physical network infrastructure that connects our markets and other major market centers with market participants and allows those participants to receive data feeds.
other revenues primarily consist of technology services revenues, regulatory fees charged to member organizations of the securities markets, facility and other fees provided to specialists, brokers and clerks physically located on the securities markets that enable them to engage in the purchase and sale of securities on the trading floor. these fees are recognized as revenue as services are rendered.
89
activity assessment fees and section 31 fees following our acquisition of nyse in november 2013, we pay the sec fees pursuant to section 31 of the securities exchange act of 1934 for transactions executed on our u.s. equities and options exchanges. these section 31 fees are designed to recover the costs to the government for supervising and regulating the securities markets and securities professionals. we (or the options clearing corporation on our behalf), in turn, collect activity assessment fees, which are included in transaction and clearing fees in the accompanying consolidated statements of income, from member organizations clearing or settling trades on the u.s. equities and options exchanges and recognize these amounts as revenue when invoiced. fees received are included in cash at the time of receipt and, as required by law, the amount due to the sec is remitted semiannually and recorded as an accrued liability until paid. the activity assessment fees are designed so that they are equal to the section 31 fees paid by us to the sec. as a result, section 31 fees do not have an impact on our net income.
stock-based compensation we currently sponsor employee and director stock option and restricted stock plans (note 10). u.s. gaap requires the measurement and recognition of compensation expenses for all share-based payment awards made to employees and directors, including employee stock options and restricted stock, based on estimated fair values. u.s. gaap requires companies to estimate the fair value of stock option awards on the date of grant using an option-pricing model. the value of the portion of the award that is ultimately expected to vest is recognized as stock-based compensation expense over the requisite service period in our consolidated financial statements.
we use the black-scholes option pricing model for purposes of valuing stock option awards. our determination of fair value of stock option awards on the date of grant using the black-scholes option pricing model is affected by our stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of subjective variables. these variables include interest rates, our expected dividend yield, our expected share price volatility over the term of the awards and actual and projected employee stock option exercise behavior.
treasury stock we record treasury stock activities under the cost method whereby the cost of the acquired stock is recorded as treasury stock (note 10). our accounting policy upon the formal retirement of treasury stock is to deduct the par value from common stock and to reflect any excess of cost over par value as a deduction from additional paid-in capital (to the extent created by previous issuances of the shares) and retained earnings.
credit risk and significant customers our clearing houses have credit risk for maintaining certain of the clearing member cash deposits at various financial institutions (note 12). cash deposit accounts are established at larger money center banks and structured to restrict the rights of offset or liens by the banks. our clearing houses monitor the cash deposits and mitigate credit risk by keeping such deposits in several financial institutions, ensuring that its overall credit risk exposure to any individual financial institution remains within acceptable concentration limits, and by ensuring that the financial institutions have strong or high investment grade ratings. we also limit our risk of loss by holding the majority of the cash deposits in high quality short-term sovereign debt reverse repurchase agreements with several different counterparty banks or direct investments in short-term high quality sovereign and supranational debt issues. if the cash deposits decrease in value, our clearing houses would be liable for the losses. however, any negative returns are passed on to the clearing members. our clearing houses historically have not experienced losses related to these clearing member cash deposits.
when engaging in reverse repurchase agreements, our clearing houses take delivery of the underlying securities in custody accounts that are under the control of the clearing house. additionally, the securities purchased subject to reverse repurchase have a market value greater than the reverse repurchase amount. the typical haircut received for high quality sovereign debt is 2% of the reverse repurchase amount. thus, in the event that a reverse repurchase counterpart defaults on its obligation to repurchase the underlying reverse repurchase securities, our clearing house will have possession of securities with a value greater than the reverse repurchase counterparty's obligation to the clearing house our futures businesses have minimal credit risk as all of their transaction revenues are currently cleared through our clearing houses. our accounts receivable related to market data revenues, cash trading and listing revenues, technology revenues, cds transaction revenues and bilateral over-the-counter energy transaction revenues subjects us to credit risk, as we do not require these customers to post collateral. we limit our risk of loss by terminating access to trade to entities with delinquent accounts. the concentration of risk on accounts receivable is also mitigated by the large number of entities comprising our customer base.
our accounts receivable are stated at cost. excluding clearing members, there were no individual accounts receivable balances greater than 10% of total consolidated accounts receivable as of december 31, 2014 or december 31, 2013. no single customer accounted for more than 10% of total consolidated revenues during any of the years ended december 31, 2014, 2013 or 2012.
90
leases we expense rent from non-cancellable operating leases, net of sublease income, on a straight-line basis based on future minimum lease payments. the net costs are included in rent and occupancy expenses and technology and communication expenses in the accompanying consolidated statements of income (note 13).
acquisition-related transaction and integration costs we incur incremental direct acquisition-related transaction costs relating to various completed and potential acquisitions and other strategic opportunities to strengthen our competitive position and support growth. the acquisition-related transaction costs include fees for investment banking advisors, lawyers, accountants, tax advisors and public relations firms, deal-related bonuses to certain of our employees, as well as costs associated with credit facilities and other external costs directly related to the proposed or closed transactions. we also incurred integration costs during the years ended december 31, 2014 and 2013 relating to our nyse acquisition, primarily related to employee termination costs, costs incurred relating to the ipo and sale of euronext in europe and the sale of nyse technologies, deal related bonuses and professional services costs incurred relating to the nyse integration. the acquisition-related transaction and integration costs incurred during the year ended december 31, 2014 primarily relate to the integration costs incurred for our nyse integration and the acquisition-related transaction costs related to our superderivatives, singapore mercantile exchange, holland clearing house and true office acquisitions. the acquisition-related transaction and integration costs incurred during the year ended december 31, 2013 primarily relate to the costs incurred for our nyse acquisition and integration and our ice endex acquisition. see note 3 for additional information on our acquisitions.
fair value of financial instruments we apply fair value accounting for all financial assets and liabilities and non-financial assets and liabilities that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis (note 15). fair value is the price that would be received from selling an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. our financial instruments consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents, short-term and long-term restricted cash and investments, short-term and long-term investments, customer accounts receivable, margin deposits and guaranty funds, cost and equity method investments, short-term and long-term debt and other short-term assets and liabilities.
foreign currency translation adjustments and foreign currency transaction gains and losses our functional and reporting currency is the u.s. dollar. we have foreign currency translation risk equal to our net investment in certain united kingdom ("u.k."), european, canadian and singapore subsidiaries. the revenues, expenses and financial results of these u.k., european, canadian and singapore subsidiaries are denominated in pounds sterling, euros, canadian dollars or singapore dollars, which are the functional currencies of certain of these subsidiaries. the financial statements of these subsidiaries are translated into u.s. dollars using a current rate of exchange, with gains or losses, net of tax, included in the cumulative translation adjustment account, a component of equity. as of december 31, 2014 and 2013, the portion of our equity attributable to accumulated other comprehensive income from foreign currency translation adjustments was $13 million and $143 million, respectively.
we have foreign currency transaction gains and losses related to the settlement of foreign currency denominated assets, liabilities and payables that occur through our operations, which are received in or paid in pounds sterling or euros. the transaction gain and losses are due to the increase or decrease in the foreign currency exchange rates between periods. forward contracts on foreign currencies are entered into to manage the foreign currency exchange rate risk. gains and losses from foreign currency transactions are included in other income (expense) in the accompanying consolidated statements of income and resulted in net losses of $2 million, $2 million and $4 million for the years ended december 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively.
earnings per common share basic earnings per common share is calculated using the weighted average common shares outstanding during the year. common equivalent shares from stock options and restricted stock awards, using the treasury stock method, are included in the diluted per share calculations unless the effect of inclusion would be antidilutive (note 19).
recently adopted and new accounting pronouncements in april 2014, the financial accounting standards board ("fasb") issued accounting standards update  ("asu") no. 2014-08, presentation of financial statements (topic 205) and property, plant, and equipment (topic 360): reporting discontinued operations and disclosures of disposals of components of entity, which changes the criteria for reporting discontinued operations while enhancing disclosure requirements. this amendment clarifies the financial reporting of discontinued operations. the guidance defines a discontinued operation as a disposal of a component or group of components that is disposed of or is classified as held for
91
sale and represents a strategic shift that has a major effect on an entity's operations and financial results. this amendment will be effective in the first quarter of 2015 and early adoption is permitted. we adopted the guidance as of january 1, 2015 and this standard is not expected to have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements.
in may 2014, the fasb issued asu no. 2014-09, revenue from contracts with customers (topic 606), which amended revenue recognition guidance. the amendment's core principle is that a company will recognize revenue when it transfers promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the company expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. this amendment will be effective for interim and annual periods beginning after december 15, 2016 and early adoption is not permitted. we are currently in the process of evaluating the impact of adoption of this amendment but we currently do not expect the adoption to have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements.
reclassifications certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current year's financial statement presentation. as discussed in note 16, we completed the ipo of euronext on june 24, 2014, the sale of wombat on july 23, 2014 and the sale of nyfix and metabit on september 19, 2014, and have included the financial results of these companies in discontinued operations in the consolidated financial statements, including the results for the period from the acquisition date of november 13, 2013 through december 31, 2013.
3.   acquisitions nyse acquisition on november 13, 2013, we acquired 100% of nyse in a stock and cash transaction. the total purchase price was $11.1 billion comprised of cash consideration of $2.7 billion and 42.4 million shares of our common stock. the fair value of the shares issued was $8.3 billion based on the closing share price of our common stock of $197.80 per share on november 12, 2013. the cash consideration was funded from cash on hand, $1.4 billion of net proceeds received on october 8, 2013 in connection with the offering of the senior notes (as defined below) and $400 million of borrowings on october 31, 2013 under the revolving facility (as defined below) (note 9). the acquisition has been accounted for as a purchase business combination with ice considered the acquirer of nyse for accounting purposes.
under purchase accounting, the total purchase price was allocated to nyse's tangible and identifiable intangible assets and liabilities based on the estimated fair values of those assets as of november 13, 2013, as set forth below. the excess of the purchase price over the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets was recorded as goodwill. goodwill represents potential revenue synergies related to clearing and new product development, expense synergies related to technology and clearing, and opportunities to enter new markets. the purchase price allocation is as follows (in millions):
property and equipment                                            $636
goodwill                                                         7,208
identifiable intangible assets                                   8,516
other assets and liabilities, net                                  286
deferred tax liabilities on identifiable intangible assets      (2,701   )
short-term and long-term debt                                   (2,529   )
non-controlling interests                                         (327   )
total purchase price                                           $11,089
in performing the purchase price allocation, we considered, among other factors, the intended future use of acquired assets, analysis of historical financial performance and estimates of future performance of nyse's business. the allocation of the purchase price was finalized upon the completion of the analysis of the acquired assets and liabilities during the year ended december 31, 2014. we adjusted the purchase price allocation based on updated fair value analyses of the nyse tangible and intangible assets and liabilities, with the offset of these changes to goodwill. we identified changes to the fair value of certain customer relationships intangible assets, acquired deferred tax asset and liabilities, valuation allowances, liabilities for uncertain income tax and indirect tax positions, and accrued liabilities during the measurement period. these adjustments were based on information obtained during the measurement period about facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date. the fair value adjustments reflected in the tables above and below, primarily result in an increase in the customer relationships intangible assets of $60 million, a decrease in the deferred tax liabilities on identifiable intangible assets of $33 million, an increase in other assets and liabilities, net, of $127 million, and a corresponding decrease to goodwill of $214 million. these changes to the consolidated balance sheet amounts have been reflected on the december 31, 2013 consolidated balance sheet retroactively. the statement of income impact for the year ended december 31, 2013 relating to these fair value adjustments is not material to our consolidated financial statements.

the following table sets forth the components of the intangible assets associated with the acquisition as of december 31, 2014 (in millions, except years):

the acquisition-date identifiable intangible assets consist of intangibles derived from national securities and futures exchange registrations, licenses and contracts, customer relationships, trade names and developed technology, of which customer relationships, certain trade names and developed technology are being amortized using the straight-line method over their estimated useful lives. indefinite useful lives were assigned for exchange registrations, licenses and contracts since the registrations, licenses and contracts represent rights to operate the exchanges and trade the contracts in perpetuity based on the long history of the exchanges acquired and the contracts traded and the expectation that a market participant would continue to operate them indefinitely. an average 20-year useful life for customer relationships has been estimated based on the projected economic benefits associated with this asset. the average 20-year estimated useful life represents the approximate point in the projection period in which a majority of the asset's cash flows are expected to be realized based on assumed attrition rates. indefinite useful lives for the $310 million nyse and euronext trade names have been determined based on their long history in the marketplace, their continued use following the acquisition, and their importance to the business of nyse and euronext and prominence in the industry. a one-year useful life for the $5 million liffe trade name has been estimated based on the period in which we expect a market participant would use the name prior to rebranding and the length of time the name is expected to maintain recognition and value in the marketplace. developed technology represents both internally and externally developed software related to nyse's and euronext's internal and trading operations. the exchange registrations and licenses and customer relationships intangible assets were valued using the multi-period excess earnings income approach, the trade names intangible assets were valued using the relief from royalty income approach and the developed technology intangible assets were valued using the multi-period excess earnings income approach and the replacement cost method.
of the goodwill amount above, $2.5 billion is included in the futures reporting unit and $3.6 billion is included in the u.s. cash listings reporting unit for purposes of impairment testing as this is consistent with how it is reported internally to our chief operating decision maker. the $948 million in goodwill originally included in the euronext reporting unit and $123 million originally included in the technology reporting unit were de-recognized upon the ipo of euronext and sale of nyse technologies (note 16).
the accompanying consolidated financial statements include the nyse results of operations and cash flows for the year ended december 31, 2014 and for the period from november 13, 2013 through december 31, 2013. total revenues, less transaction-based expenses of $208 million and nyse income from continuing operations of $30 million are included in our consolidated statement of income for the year ended december 31, 2013. we have incurred employee termination costs following the acquisition, which are included in acquisition-related transaction and integration costs, including $99 million and $44 million for the years ended december 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively.
the financial information in the table below summarizes the combined results of operations of ice and nyse, on a pro forma basis, as though the companies had been combined as of the beginning of the period presented. the pro forma financial information is presented for informational purposes only and is not indicative of the results of operations that would have been achieved if the acquisition had taken place at the beginning of the period presented. such pro forma financial information is based on the historical financial statements of ice and nyse. this pro forma financial information is based on estimates and assumptions that have been made solely for purposes of developing such pro forma information, including, without limitation, purchase accounting adjustments. the pro forma financial information presented below also includes depreciation and amortization based on the valuation of nyse's tangible assets and identifiable intangible assets resulting from the acquisition. the pro forma financial information does not reflect any synergies or operating cost reductions that have been and may be achieved from the combined operations. pro forma financial information for the year ended december 31, 2012 is not provided below, as doing so would be impracticable. such information would require significant estimates of discontinued operations amounts, which would not provide accurate evidence of circumstances that existed in 2012, and for which discrete financial information of the disposed entity was not available when the 2012 financial statements were issued. the pro forma financial information combines the historical results for us and nyse for the year ended december 31, 2013 in the following table (in millions, except per share amounts).

ice endex acquisition on march 26, 2013, we acquired 79% of the derivatives and spot business of the energy exchange formerly known as apx-endex. gasunie, a european natural gas infrastructure company and a former stockholder of apx-endex, retained the remaining 21% stake. we renamed the acquired business ice endex and it is based on the derivatives and spot gas business of the former apx-endex. ice endex offers a liquid, transparent and accessible continental european trading hub for natural gas and power derivatives, gas balancing markets and gas storage services. the trade execution and clearing of ice endex derivatives products transitioned to our trading platform and to ice clear europe, respectively, on october 7, 2013. ice endex is based in amsterdam and one of its subsidiaries retains a license to operate a regulated market in the netherlands. ice endex expands our ability to serve participants in the continental european natural gas and power markets.
the ice endex purchase price was allocated to the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets based on the fair value of those assets as of march 26, 2013. the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired were $43 million. we have recorded intangible assets of $52 million for exchange traded contracts, which have been assigned an indefinite useful life. the excess of the purchase price over the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets was $23 million and was recorded as goodwill and assigned to the futures reporting unit.
4.   short-term and long-term restricted cash and investments we own ice futures europe, and in connection with the nyse acquisition, liffe administration and management ("liffe"), both of which operate as u.k. recognized investment exchanges. as u.k. recognized investment exchanges, ice futures europe and liffe are required by the financial conduct authority in the united kingdom to restrict the use of the equivalent of six months of operating expenditures, subject to certain deductions, in cash or cash equivalents or investments at all times. as of december 31, 2014 and 2013, this amount for ice futures europe was $57 million and $37 million, respectively, and this amount for liffe was $114 million for both periods. such amounts are reflected as short-term restricted cash and investments in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.
in november 2014, we completed the transition of liffe's contracts to ice futures europe. while liffe still has a regulated status, we expect to apply for a de-recognition order in 2015, which will result in the release of the $114 million in regulatory capital and an increase in our unrestricted cash and cash equivalents. at this time, we do not expect the regulatory capital at ice futures europe to increase during 2015 from $57 million as this balance already takes into account the higher post-liffe migration cost base.
as a u.k. recognized clearing house, ice clear europe limited ("ice clear europe") is required by the bank of england to restrict the use of the equivalent of six months of operating expenditures, subject to certain deductions, in cash or cash equivalents or investments at all times. as of december 31, 2014 and 2013, this amount for ice clear europe was $87 million and $75 million, respectively, and such amounts are reflected as short-term restricted cash and investments in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. the aggregate $32 million increase in the regulatory capital of ice futures europe and ice clear europe during the year ended december 31, 2014 was primarily due to additional costs incurred at these companies due to growth of these businesses.
our commodity futures trading commission ("cftc") regulated u.s. designated contract market ("dcm"), ice futures u.s., inc. ("ice futures u.s."), and our cftc regulated u.s. derivatives clearing organizations ("dcos"), ice clear u.s., inc. ("ice clear u.s."), ice clear europe, ice clear credit llc ("ice clear credit") and the clearing corporation ("tcc"), are
95
required to maintain financial resources with a value at least equal to the amount that would cover certain operating costs for a one-year period, including maintaining cash or a committed line of credit, subject to certain deductions, to satisfy six months of such operating costs at all times. as of december 31, 2014 and 2013, the financial resources necessary to satisfy six months of such operating costs for our dcm and dcos were $155 million and $154 million, respectively, in the aggregate, of which $114 million and $116 million, respectively, was satisfied by our revolving credit facility. a portion of such revolving credit facility is reserved for use by certain of our dcos for liquidity purposes (note 9). the remaining $41 million and $38 million as of december 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively, was recorded as short-term restricted cash and investments in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.
consistent with the other clearing houses that we own, ice clear europe requires that each clearing member make deposits to a fund known as the guaranty fund. the amounts in the guaranty fund will serve to secure the obligations of a clearing member to ice clear europe and may be used to cover losses in excess of the margin and clearing firm accounts sustained by ice clear europe in the event of a default of a clearing member. ice clear europe has committed $100 million of its own cash as part of its energy guaranty fund and this cash is reflected as long-term restricted cash in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets as of december 31, 2014 and 2013. we also contributed $50 million to the ice clear credit guaranty fund and $28 million to the ice clear europe cds guaranty fund as of december 31, 2014, along with the contributions by clearing members. our combined cds guaranty fund contributions of $78 million and $60 million in cash as of december 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively, which is not available for general use by us, has been reflected as long-term restricted cash and investments in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets (note 12).
in connection with ice clear u.s.'s election to be subject to subpart c of the cftc's regulation (which accordingly, permits recognition as a qualified central counter party ("qccp")), we contributed $50 million to ice clear u.s.'s guaranty fund on january 1, 2014. the $50 million is reflected as long-term restricted cash and investments in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet as of december 31, 2014.
hch, as a continental european derivatives clearing house, is regulated and supervised in the netherlands by the authority for the financial markets and the dutch central bank and is required to maintain regulatory capital (note 3). as of december 31, 2014, the regulatory capital for hch was $12 million and is reflected as short-term restricted cash and investments in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet and our contribution to the guaranty fund of hch was $24 million and is reflected as long-term restricted cash and investments.
as of december 31, 2014, there is $44 million of cash held as escrow for the superderivatives acquisition that is reflected as long-term restricted cash and investments in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet as the escrow could be held for up to 18 months from the date of our acquisition.

we acquired 31.6 million shares, or 12%, of the common stock of cetip, s.a. ("cetip") for an aggregate consideration of $514 million in cash in july 2011. we account for our investment in cetip as an available-for-sale investment and we classify it as a long-term investment in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. as of december 31, 2014 and 2013, the fair value of the equity
96
security investment was $379 million and $324 million, respectively. the balance as of december 31, 2014 includes an unrealized gain of $55 million. our investment in cetip was made in, and the shares are valued in, brazilian reais. changes in the fair value of available-for-sale securities are reflected in accumulated other comprehensive income, and include the effects of both stock price and foreign currency translation fluctuations. the unrealized holding gains and losses are excluded from earnings and reported in other comprehensive income until realized. realized gains and losses, and declines in value deemed to be other-than-temporary, are recognized in earnings.
during the year ended december 31, 2013, we recognized an impairment loss on our cetip investment of $190 million, which was equal to the difference between the $324 million fair value as of december 31, 2013 and the original investment cost of $514 million. the $324 million fair value of the cetip investment as of december 31, 2013 became the new cost basis of the investment and the new cost basis will not be adjusted for subsequent recoveries in fair value. the $190 million impairment loss was reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive loss and was recognized in other expense in the accompanying consolidated statement of income for the year ended december 31, 2013.
the accumulated losses of $190 million as of december 31, 2013 included $162 million in foreign currency translation losses relating to the decrease in value of the brazilian real relative to the u.s. dollar from the investment date in july 2011 through december 31, 2013 and by a $28 million decrease in the stock price of cetip through december 31, 2013. because the cetip fair value as of december 31, 2013 had been below the original investment cost for an extended period of time and recovery of the accumulated losses relating to the foreign currency translation losses was not likely in the near term, we were required to record an other-than-temporary impairment charge as of december 31, 2013. under u.s. gaap, the impairment loss shall be recognized in earnings in an amount equal to the entire difference between the investment's cost and its fair value at the balance sheet date for which the assessment is made.
upon closing of the euronext ipo, we received €1.4 billion ($1.9 billion) in net cash proceeds. we elected to set aside sufficient euro-denominated cash from the proceeds to effectively pre-fund the maturity of the nyse eur notes and the related final interest coupon payment, both due on june 30, 2015 (note 9). in connection with this, in july 2014, we placed €969 million ($1.2 billion) of the cash proceeds from the euronext ipo in term deposits at various banks each with a maturity date of june 25, 2015 to cover the €920 million ($1.1 billion) principal and the €49 million ($60 million) final interest coupon payment due on june 30, 2015. these deposits are classified as short-term investments in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet as of december 31, 2014.
equity and fixed income mutual funds are held for the purpose of providing future payments for the supplemental executive savings plan and the supplemental executive retirement plan (note 14) are classified as available-for-sale securities.
as of december 31, 2013, we were holding $100 million in u.s. treasury securities, all of which had original maturities of less than one year from the date of purchase. of these securities, $37 million were recorded as short-term investments and $63 million were recorded as short-term restricted cash and investments in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet as of december 31, 2013. as of december 31, 2014, we were holding $374 million in u.s. treasury securities, all of which had original maturities of less than one year from the date of purchase. of these securities, $159 million were recorded as cash and cash equivalents (all of which have original maturities of less than 90 days), $87 million were recorded as short-term restricted cash and investments and $128 million were recorded as long-term restricted cash and investments in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet as of december 31, 2014. we account for the u.s. treasury securities held using the available-for-sale method.
after the ipo of euronext on june 24, 2014, we held 4.2 million shares of euronext common stock, representing 6% of the outstanding shares of euronext, with an original cost of $114 million. our investment in euronext was recorded as an available-for-sale, long-term investment and was recorded in and was held in euros. on december 9, 2014, we sold the remaining 4.2 million shares of euronext common stock for $118 million, and a realized net gain of $4 million was recognized in other income in the accompanying consolidated statement of income for the year ended december 31, 2014 (note 16).

2014 credit facility on april 3, 2014, ice, as parent borrower, and our subsidiary ice europe parent limited, as subsidiary borrower, entered into a $3.0 billion senior unsecured revolving credit facility (the "2014 credit facility") pursuant to a credit agreement with wells fargo bank, national association ("wells fargo"), as administrative agent, issuing lender and swing line lender, bank of america, n.a., as syndication agent, and the lenders party thereto. the 2014 credit facility includes an option for us to propose an increase in the aggregate amount by up to $1.0 billion, subject to the consent of the lenders funding the increase and certain other conditions.
the 2014 credit facility matures on april 3, 2019. amounts borrowed under the 2014 credit facility may be prepaid at any time without premium or penalty. the 2014 credit facility provides for a $3.0 billion multi-currency revolving facility, with sub-limits for non-dollar borrowings, swing line borrowings and letters of credit. no amounts were outstanding under the 2014 credit facility as of december 31, 2014. of the $3.0 billion that is available for borrowing under the 2014 credit facility, $905 million is required to back-stop the amount outstanding under our commercial paper program as of december 31, 2014 and $303 million is reserved for our clearing houses. the amount required to back stop the commercial paper program will fluctuate as we increase or decrease our commercial paper borrowings. the remaining $1.8 billion as of december 31, 2014 is available to us to use for working capital and general corporate purposes, and any portion of the revolving credit facility no longer necessary in the future to be reserved for the foregoing purposes will be available to us to use for working capital and general corporate purposes.
borrowings under the 2014 credit facility will bear interest on the principal amount outstanding at either (a) libor plus an applicable margin rate or (b) a "base rate" plus an applicable margin rate; provided, however, that all loans denominated in a foreign currency will bear interest at libor plus an applicable margin rate. the "base rate" equals the higher of (i) wells fargo's prime rate, (ii) the federal funds rate plus 0.50%, or (iii) the one month libor rate plus 1.00%. the applicable margin rate is based upon our public long term debt ratings and ranges from 0.875% to 1.5% on libor borrowings and from 0.00% to 0.50% on base rate borrowings.
100
the 2014 credit facility includes an unutilized revolving credit commitment fee that is equal to the unused maximum revolver amount, multiplied by an applicable commitment fee rate and is payable in arrears on a quarterly basis. the applicable commitment fee rate ranges from 0.080% to 0.200% and is determined based on our long term debt rating. as of december 31, 2014, the applicable commitment fee rate was 0.125% based on our current long term debt ratings.
of the amounts available under the 2014 credit facility: (i) $150 million of such amounts has been reserved to provide liquidity or required financial resources for the operations of ice clear europe, (ii) $100 million of such amounts has been reserved to provide liquidity or required financial resources for the operations of ice clear credit, (iii) $50 million of such amounts has been reserved to provide liquidity or required financial resources for the operations of ice clear u.s., and (iv) $3 million of such amounts has been reserved to provide liquidity or required financial resources for the operations of ice clear canada. from time to time, we may agree to provide additional liquidity to our subsidiaries to meet regulatory capital requirements, general corporate purposes or short term liquidity needs.
the 2014 credit facility contains customary representations and warranties, covenants and events of default, including a leverage ratio, as well as limitations on liens on our assets, indebtedness of non-obligor subsidiaries, the sale of all or substantially all of our assets, and other matters.
revolving facility and term loan facility (2011 credit facilities)
in november 2011, we entered into senior unsecured credit facilities in the aggregate amount of $2.6 billion (the "2011 credit facilities"). the 2011 credit facilities consisted of (i) an aggregate $500 million five-year senior unsecured term loan facility (the "term loan facility") and (ii) an aggregate $2.1 billion five-year senior unsecured multicurrency revolving credit facility (the "revolving facility").
in october 2013, we borrowed $900 million under the revolving facility, of which $400 million was used to pay the cash portion of the purchase price for our acquisition of nyse while the remaining $500 million was used to pay off the outstanding commercial paper obligations of nyse, as well as to fund certain deal related fees and expenses (note 3). in december 2013, we repaid the $900 million borrowed under the revolving facility with the proceeds from the issuance of commercial paper and with cash on hand.
in connection with us entering into the 2014 credit facility on april 3, 2014, the 2011 credit facilities were terminated and the $367 million outstanding under the term loan facility (which had a stated interest rate of 2.0275%) was repaid through the issuance of new commercial paper. no amounts were outstanding under the revolving facility when it was terminated on april 3, 2014.
private senior notes simultaneous with entering into the credit facilities in november 2011, we also entered into a note purchase agreement with various institutional investors providing for the sale of $400 million aggregate principal amount of senior notes, consisting of $200 million of our 4.13% senior notes, tranche a, due november 9, 2018 and $200 million of our 4.69% senior notes, tranche b, due november 9, 2021 (collectively, the "private senior notes").
in october 2013, following the issuance of the senior notes, we prepaid the $400 million aggregate principal amount of private senior notes. in connection with the early payoff of the private senior notes, we incurred $51 million in expenses relating to a $49 million pre-payment to the private senior notes investors and an associated $2 million write off of the related debt issuance costs. the $51 million expense was recorded as other expense in the accompanying consolidated statement of income for the year ended december 31, 2013. to fund the prepayment of the private senior notes and the associated pre-payment, we borrowed $450 million in october 2013 under the 364 day facility.
364 day facility in july 2013, we entered into a $600 million 364 day senior unsecured revolving credit facility (the "364 day facility"). the 364 day facility was available for working capital and general corporate purposes. in october 2013, we borrowed $450 million under the 364 day facility to fund the prepayment of the private senior notes. in december 2013, we repaid the $450 million borrowed under the 364 day facility with the proceeds from the issuance of commercial paper. in connection with us entering into the 2014 credit facility, the 364 day facility was terminated in april 2014, at which time no amounts were outstanding under the 364 day facility.
senior notes in october 2013, we issued $600 million aggregate principal amount of 2.50% senior unsecured fixed rate notes due october 2018 (the "2018 senior notes") and $800 million aggregate principal amount of 4.00% senior unsecured fixed rate notes due october 2023 (the "2023 senior notes", together with the 2018 senior notes, the "senior notes"). we used the net proceeds from the senior notes offering to finance, together with cash on hand and $400 million borrowed in october 2013 under the revolving facility, the $2.7 billion cash portion of the purchase price of the acquisition of nyse. the senior notes contain affirmative and negative
101
covenants, including, but not limited to, certain redemption rights, limitations on liens and indebtedness, limitations on certain mergers, sales, dispositions and lease-back transactions.
nyse notes in connection with the acquisition of nyse, one of our subsidiaries assumed the outstanding nyse debt instruments, which included $850 million of 2.0% senior unsecured fixed rate notes due in october 2017 (the "nyse usd notes") and €920 million ($1.1 billion) of 5.375% senior unsecured fixed rate notes due in june 2015 (the "nyse eur notes", and together with the nyse usd notes, the "nyse notes").
upon closing of the euronext ipo, we received €1.4 billion ($1.9 billion) in net cash proceeds. we elected to set aside sufficient euro-denominated cash from the proceeds to effectively pre-fund the maturity of the nyse eur notes and the related final interest coupon payment, both due on june 30, 2015. in connection with this, in july 2014, we placed €969 million ($1.2 billion) of the cash proceeds from the euronext ipo in term deposits at various banks each with a maturity date of june 25, 2015 to cover the €920 million ($1.1 billion) principal and the €49 million ($60 million) final interest coupon payment due on june 30, 2015. these deposits are classified as short-term investments in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet as of december 31, 2014. the balance of the cash proceeds received in connection with the euronext ipo were converted to u.s. dollars and used to repay outstanding commercial paper.
in accordance with purchase accounting, we recorded the nyse notes at fair value on the november 13, 2013 acquisition date. based on public debt prices, as of this date, the nyse usd notes had a fair value of $854 million (an increase of $4 million from its november 13, 2013 face value) and the nyse eur notes had a fair value of $1.3 billion (an increase of $89 million from its november 13, 2013 face value). the increase in the carrying amount of the nyse notes to record them at fair value is amortized as a reduction to the interest expense recorded by us in the consolidated statements of income over the remaining maturities of the nyse notes. during the years ended december 31, 2014 and 2013, the amortization of the increase in the fair value of the nyse notes was $55 million and $7 million, respectively.
the terms of the bonds do not contain any financial covenants. the bonds may be redeemed by us or the bond holders under certain customary circumstances, including a change in control accompanied by a downgrade of the bonds below an investment grade rating. the terms of the bonds also provide for customary events of default and a negative pledge covenant.
commercial paper program in december 2013, we entered into a u.s. dollar commercial paper program (the "commercial paper program"). the commercial paper program is currently backed by the borrowing capacity available under the 2014 credit facility, equal to the amount of the commercial paper that is issued and outstanding at any given point in time. the effective interest rate of commercial paper issuances does not materially differ from short term interest rates (such as usd libor). the fluctuation of these rates due to market conditions may impact our interest expense.
we used the net proceeds from the notes issued under the commercial paper program, along with cash on hand, to repay the $900 million borrowed under the revolving facility and the $450 million borrowed under the 364 day facility during the year ended december 31, 2013. we used net proceeds from notes issued under the commercial paper program during the year ended december 31, 2014 to repay the $367 million that was outstanding under the term loan facility upon termination of the term loan facility in april 2014, to fund certain of our acquisitions (note 3), and to repurchase our common stock during the year ended december 31, 2014 (note 10). we repaid a portion of the amounts outstanding under the commercial paper program during the year ended december 31, 2014 using a combination of the cash proceeds received from the ipo and sale of euronext, the sale of nyse technologies (note 16) and cash flows from operations.
commercial paper notes of $905 million with original maturities ranging from 2 to 82 days were outstanding as of december 31, 2014 under the commercial paper program. as of december 31, 2014, the weighted average interest rate on the $905 million outstanding under the commercial paper program was 0.26% per annum, with a weighted average maturity of 24 days. commercial paper notes of $1.1 billion with original maturities ranging from 1 to 97 days were outstanding as of december 31, 2013 under the commercial paper program. as of december 31, 2013, the weighted average interest rate on the $1.1 billion outstanding under the commercial paper program was 0.28% per annum, with a weighted average maturity of 33 days.

10.   equity we currently sponsor employee and director stock option and restricted stock plans. employee and director stock-based compensation expenses and the related income tax benefit recognized for both stock options and restricted stock in the accompanying consolidated statements of income for the year ended december 31, 2014 was $82 million and $28 million, respectively, was $56 million and $17 million, respectively, for the year ended december 31, 2013, and was $52 million and $16 million, respectively, for the year ended december 31, 2012. the amount expensed for the years ended december 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012 is net of $7 million, $7 million and $6 million, respectively, of stock-based compensation that was capitalized as software development costs.
during the years ended december 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, we recognized excess tax benefits of $26 million, $8 million and $9 million, respectively, as an increase to the additional paid-in capital balance. of that amount, $26 million, $8 million and $9 million for the years ended december 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively, were qualifying excess tax benefits that are eligible to absorb future write-offs, if any, of unrealized deferred tax assets related to stock options. the $26 million, $8 million and $9 million are reported as financing cash flows in the accompanying consolidated statements of cash flows for the years ended december 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. regarding the ordering of tax benefits to determine whether an excess tax benefit is realized, as well as to measure that excess tax benefit, we follow applicable tax laws and disregard indirect effects of the excess tax benefit.
in connection with the acquisition of nyse, we assumed the obligations of the intercontinental exchange holdings, inc. and nyse employee and director equity plans. as of december 31, 2014, we had 4.4 million shares in total under various equity plans that are available for future issuance of our stock option and restricted stock awards.
stock option plans stock options are granted at the discretion of the compensation committee of the board of directors. all stock options are granted at an exercise price equal to the fair value of the common stock on the date of grant. the grant date fair value is based on the closing stock price on the date of grant as well as certain other assumptions. the fair value of the stock options on the date of grant is recognized as expense ratably over the vesting period, net of estimated forfeitures. we may grant, under provisions of the plans, both incentive stock options and nonqualified stock options. the options generally vest over three years, but can vest at different intervals based on the compensation committee's determination. generally, options may be exercised up to ten years after the date of grant, but expire either 14 or 60 days after termination of employment. the shares of common stock issued under our stock option plans are made available from authorized and unissued common stock or treasury shares. the following is a summary of stock options for the years ended december 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, which includes 3,644 stock options issued in connection with the nyse acquisition:

the total intrinsic value of stock options exercised during the years ended december 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012 were $39 million, $24 million and $20 million, respectively. as of december 31, 2014, there were $6 million in total unrecognized compensation costs related to stock options. these costs are expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of 1.7 years as the stock options vest.
of the options outstanding at december 31, 2014, 561,844 were exercisable at a weighted-average exercise price of $116.64. of the options outstanding at december 31, 2013, 689,046 were exercisable at a weighted-average exercise price of $90.43. of the options outstanding at december 31, 2012, 794,264 were exercisable at a weighted-average exercise price of $80.29.
we use the black-scholes option pricing model for purposes of valuing stock option awards. during the years ended december 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, we used the weighted-average assumptions in the table below to compute the value of all options for shares of common stock granted to employees:

the risk-free interest rate is based on the zero-coupon u.s. treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant. the expected life computation is derived from historical exercise patterns and anticipated future patterns. expected volatilities are based on historical volatility of our stock. in 2012 and 2013, expected dividend yields were 0% since prior to the november 2013 acquisition of nyse, we had not contemplated paying dividends. our current dividend policy will impact the expected dividend yield on all stock options granted post-acquisition.
restricted stock plans restricted stock units are granted at the discretion of the compensation committee of the board of directors. excluding our restricted stock issued in connection with the nyse acquisition in 2013, discussed below, we granted 560,380, 586,317 and 493,922 time-based and performance-based restricted stock units during the years ended december 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively, including 385,897, 249,670 and 295,615 time-based restricted stock units during the years ended december 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. the grant date fair value of each award is based on the closing stock price at the date of grant. the fair value of the time-
104
based restricted stock units on the date of grant is recognized as expense ratably over the vesting period, which is typically three years, net of forfeitures. granted but unvested shares are generally forfeited upon termination of employment. when restricted stock is forfeited, compensation costs previously recognized for unvested shares are reversed. until the shares vest and are issued, the participants have no voting or dividend rights and the shares may not be sold, assigned, transferred, pledged or otherwise encumbered. following the nyse acquisition and in connection with our dividend declaration policy, unvested restricted stock is now subject to earn dividend equivalents which are paid in cash on the vesting date.
we recognize compensation costs, net of forfeitures, using an accelerated attribution method over the vesting period for awards with performance conditions. compensation costs for such awards are recognized only if it is probable that the condition will be satisfied. if we initially determine that it is not probable that the performance condition will be satisfied and later determine that it is probable that the performance condition will be satisfied, or vice versa, the effect of the change in estimate is accounted for in the period of change by recording a cumulative catch-up adjustment to retroactively apply the new estimate. we recognize the remaining compensation costs over the remaining vesting period. our compensation committee, pursuant to the terms of the equity plans and the authority delegated to it by our board of directors, can make equitable adjustments to the performance condition in recognition of unusual or non-recurring events.
in january 2015, we reserved a maximum of 429,468 restricted shares for potential issuance as performance-based restricted shares to certain of our employees. the number of shares that will ultimately be granted under the performance awards will be based on our actual financial performance as compared to financial performance targets set by our board of directors and compensation committee for the year ending december 31, 2015. these restricted shares are also subject to a market condition that could reduce the number of shares that are ultimately granted. the reduction would occur if our 2015 total shareholder return falls below the 2015 return of the s&p 500 index and we achieve an above "target" financial performance level threshold. if our 2015 total shareholder return were to fall below the 2015 return of the s&p 500 index, the reduction would be either 10% or 20% of the number of shares granted, depending on the difference in the aforementioned returns (the "market condition").
the grant date of this award was january 20, 2015, which was the date when we and our employees reached a mutual understanding of award terms. january 20, 2015 is also the service inception date as that is the date when the requisite service period began. the maximum compensation expense to be recognized under these performance-based restricted shares is $86 million if the maximum financial performance target is met and all 429,468 shares vest. the compensation expense to be recognized under these performance-based restricted shares will be $43 million if the target financial performance is met, which would result in 214,734 shares vesting. we will recognize expense on an accelerated basis over the three-year vesting period based on our quarterly assessment of the probable 2015 actual financial performance as compared to the 2015 financial performance targets. if the market condition is not achieved, compensation cost will not be affected since the grant date fair value of the award gave consideration to the probability of market condition achievement.
in february 2014, we reserved a maximum of 351,310 restricted shares for potential issuance as performance-based restricted shares for certain of our employees. these restricted shares were subject to a market condition that could have reduced the number of shares that were granted if our 2014 total shareholder return fell below that of the 2014 return of the s&p 500 index and if we achieved a "target" financial performance level or above. our total shareholder return for the year ended december 31, 2014 was lower than the 2014 return of the s&p 500 index, but we achieved slightly below the "target" financial performance level based on our actual 2014 financial performance compared to our financial performance level thresholds. therefore, no additional share reduction was taken. based on our actual 2014 financial performance as compared to the 2014 financial performance targets, 159,177 restricted shares were granted, which resulted in $33 million in compensation expenses that will be expensed over the three-year accelerated vesting period, including $17 million that was expensed during the year ended december 31, 2014.
during the fourth quarter of 2013, we reserved a maximum of 154,912 restricted shares for potential issuance as performance-based restricted shares for certain of our employees. the number of shares granted under the performance awards will be based on our actual financial performance as compared to financial performance targets set by our board of directors and compensation committee for the three years ending december 31, 2016. the maximum compensation expense to be recognized under these performance-based restricted shares is $31 million if the maximum financial performance target is met and 154,912 shares vest. the compensation expense to be recognized under these performance-based restricted shares will be $30 million if the target financial performance is met and 147,535 shares vest. we will recognize expense on a straight-line basis over the three-year vesting period based on our quarterly assessment of the probable three-year actual financial performance as compared to the financial performance targets. through december 31, 2014, we determined that it is probable that the target financial performance will be met, and based on this assessment, we recorded non-cash compensation expense of $9 million for the year ended december 31, 2014.
the grant date fair values of the awards with a market condition were estimated based on our stock price on the grant date, the valuation of historical awards with market conditions, the relatively low likelihood that the market condition will affect the number of shares granted (as the market condition only affects shares granted in excess of certain financial performance targets), and our expectation of achieving the financial performance targets. the grant date fair value of the awards, when considering the impact of the market condition on fair value, was determined to not be materially different from our stock price on the respective grant dates.
105
we assumed the nyse equity plans, including certain unvested restricted stock awards of nyse into our stock award plans as of the date of the nyse acquisition in november 2013. as a result, we exchanged our restricted stock for nyse restricted stock. we issued 239,488 unvested time-based restricted stock awards to nyse employees and will recognize non-cash compensation expense on a straight-line basis as the awards vest based on the fair value of the awards on the consummation date of the transaction. these 239,488 restricted stock shares issued are included in the table below as being granted during the year ended december 31, 2013, at a weighted average grant-date fair value of $197.80 per share.
restricted shares are used as an incentive to attract and retain qualified employees and to increase shareholder returns with actual performance-based awards based on enhanced shareholder value. our equity plans include a change in control provision that may accelerate vesting on both the time-based and performance-based restricted shares if the awards are not assumed by an acquirer in the case of a change in control. the following is a summary of the nonvested restricted shares under all plans discussed above for the years ended december 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012:

restricted stock shares granted in the table above include both time-based and performance-based grants. performance-based shares have been adjusted to reflect the actual shares to be issued based on the achievement of past performance targets. as of december 31, 2014, there were $98 million in total unrecognized compensation costs related to the time-based restricted stock and the performance-based restricted stock. these costs are expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 2 years as the restricted stock vests. during the years ended december 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, the total fair value of restricted stock vested under all restricted stock plans was $138 million, $62 million and $51 million, respectively.
treasury stock during the years ended december 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, we received 240,676 shares, 430,677 shares and 154,242 shares, respectively, of common stock from certain of our employees related to tax withholdings made by us on our employee's behalf for restricted stock and stock option exercises. we recorded the receipt of the shares as treasury stock. treasury stock activity is presented in the accompanying consolidated statements of changes in equity, accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) and redeemable non-controlling interest.
in connection with the acquisition of nyse on november 13, 2013, all shares of common stock held by intercontinental exchange holdings, inc. immediately prior to the acquisition as treasury shares were canceled and extinguished and no consideration was delivered for the treasury shares. therefore, on november 13, 2013, 7,560,480 treasury stock shares were retired. in connection with the retirement, of the $741 million value assigned to the treasury stock shares, $541 million was allocated to additional paid-in capital and $200 million was allocated to retained earnings. the amount allocated to additional paid-in capital was determined based on the paid-in capital per share generated from the historical issuances of these treasury shares.
stock repurchase program during the years ended december 31, 2014 and 2012, we repurchased 3,231,484 shares and 416,858 shares, respectively, of our outstanding common stock at a cost of $645 million and $53 million, respectively. these repurchases were completed under a stock repurchase plan authorized by our board of directors. the shares repurchased are held in treasury stock. we did not repurchase any
106
shares during the year ended december 31, 2013. as of december 31, 2014, the remaining board authorization permits repurchases of up to $405 million of our common stock with no fixed expiration date.
in september 2014, we entered into a rule 10b5-1 trading plan permitting open market repurchases of our common stock based on certain parameters described in the trading plan. we expect to fund any remaining share repurchases with a combination of cash on hand, future cash flows and by borrowing under our credit facilities and the commercial paper program. the timing and extent of any future repurchases that are not made pursuant to the trading plan under rule 10b5-1 are at our discretion and will depend upon market conditions, amount authorized by our board of directors, our stock price, our target debt ratio and corporate debt rating, and our strategic growth initiatives at that time. we may discontinue the stock repurchases at any time or may enter into a new rule 10b5-1 trading plan in the future. in addition, our board of directors may increase or decrease the amount of capacity we have for repurchases from time to time.

the effective tax rates for the years ended december 31, 2014 and 2012 are lower than the federal statutory rate primarily due to the favorable foreign tax rate differential, partially offset by state income taxes. the effective tax rate for the year ended december 31, 2013 is higher than the statutory federal rate primarily due to the non-tax deductible impairment loss on the cetip investment (note 5) along with state income taxes and other items. other items are primarily driven by non-tax deductible transaction costs relating to the nyse acquisition.
deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes. the following table summarizes the significant components of our deferred tax liabilities and assets as of december 31, 2014 and 2013 (in millions):

ending balance of deferred income tax valuation allowance          $75                 $95                 $11
we recognize valuation allowances on deferred tax assets if, based on the weight of the evidence, we believe that it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. we recorded a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets of $75 million and $95 million as of december 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. increases charged to income tax expense in the table above relate to state research and development tax credits and loss carryforwards that we do not expect to be realizable in future periods. increases charged against goodwill in the table above relate to loss carryforwards acquired that we do not expect to be realizable in future periods. decreases in the table above relate to net operating loss carryforwards that we determined would be available to offset income in future periods. the decreases in the year ended december 31, 2012 include the write-off of state research and development tax credit assets against valuation allowances that only have a remote likelihood to be utilized.
our non-u.s. subsidiaries had $2.2 billion in cumulative undistributed earnings as of december 31, 2014. this amount represents the post-income tax earnings under u.s. gaap adjusted for previously taxed income. the earnings from our non-u.s. subsidiaries are considered to be indefinitely reinvested. accordingly, no provision for u.s. federal and state income taxes has been made in the accompanying consolidated financial statements. further, a determination of the unrecognized deferred tax liability is not practicable. any future distribution by way of dividend of these non-u.s. earnings may subject us to both u.s. federal and state income taxes, as adjusted for non-u.s. tax credits, and withholding taxes payable to various non-u.s. countries.
108
as of december 31, 2014 and 2013, we have gross u.s. federal net operating loss carryforwards of $126 million and $109 million, respectively, and gross state and local net operating loss carryforwards of $611 million and $775 million, respectively. these carryforwards are available to offset future taxable income until they begin to expire in 2018. in addition, as of december 31, 2014, we have gross foreign net operating loss carryforwards of $77 million related primarily to net operating loss carryforwards acquired which have an indefinite life. as of december 31, 2013, we have gross foreign net operating loss carryforwards of $152 million also related primarily to net operating loss carryforwards acquired which are not expected to be utilized against future taxable income.

as of december 31, 2014 and 2013, the balance of unrecognized tax benefits which would, if recognized, affect our effective tax rate was $106 million and $193 million, respectively. it is reasonably possible, as a result of settlements of ongoing audits or statute of limitations expirations, unrecognized tax benefits could increase as much as $17 million and decrease as much as $61 million within the next twelve months. of the $145 million in unrecognized tax benefits as of december 31, 2014, $129 million is recorded as other non-current liabilities and $16 million is recorded as other current liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet.
we recognize interest accrued on income tax uncertainties and accrued penalties as a component of income tax expense. for the years ended december 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, we recognized $4 million, $3 million and $2 million, respectively, of income tax expense for interest and penalties. accrued interest and penalties were $45 million and $39 million as of december 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively.
we or one of its subsidiaries files income tax returns in the u.s. federal jurisdiction and various state and foreign jurisdictions. the following table summarizes open tax years by major jurisdiction:
jurisdiction     open tax years u.s. federal        2009 - 2014
u.s. states         2006 - 2014
united kingdom      2011 - 2014
netherlands         2010 - 2014
although the outcome of tax audits is always uncertain, we believe that adequate amounts of tax, including interest and penalties, have been provided for any adjustments expected to result from open years.
12.   clearing organizations we currently own or operate seven regulated central counterparty clearing houses for the settlement and clearance of derivative contracts. the seven clearing houses include ice clear europe, ice clear u.s., ice clear canada, inc. ("ice clear canada"), ice clear credit, hch, tcc and ice clear singapore. ice clear europe performs the clearing and settlement for all futures and options contracts traded through ice futures europe and ice endex, for cds contracts submitted for clearing in europe, for energy futures and options contracts trading through ice futures u.s. and beginning july 1, 2013, for london-based derivatives contracts traded through liffe. ice clear u.s. performs the clearing and settlement of agricultural and financial futures and options contracts traded through ice futures u.s. and ice clear canada performs the clearing and settlement for all futures and options contracts traded through ice futures canada. ice clear credit performs the clearing and settlement for cds contracts submitted for clearing in north america. hch offers clearing for tom (note 3). tcc offers clearing services for ice futures u.s., which may include mini-sized, financially settled versions of current ice futures u.s. contracts. ice clear u.s., ice clear europe, ice clear canada, ice clear

credit, hch and tcc are referred to herein collectively as the "ice clearing houses". ice clear singapore is not yet operational due to the transition to our technology that is underway that is scheduled to be completed in the first half of 2015 (note 3).
each of the ice clearing houses requires all clearing members to maintain cash on deposit or pledge certain assets, which may include government obligations, letters of credit or gold to guarantee performance on the clearing members' open positions. such amounts in total are known as "original margin." the ice clearing houses may make intraday original margin calls in circumstances where market conditions require additional protection. the daily profits and losses from and to the ice clearing houses in respect of marking to market open contracts is known as "variation margin". the ice clearing houses mark all outstanding contracts to market, and therefore pay and collect variation margin, at least once daily, and in some cases multiple times throughout the day. marking-to-market allows the ice clearing houses to identify any clearing members that may be unable to satisfy the financial obligations resulting from changes in the prices of their open contracts before those financial obligations become exceptionally large and jeopardize the ability of the ice clearing houses to ensure financial performance of clearing members' open positions.
each of the ice clearing houses requires that each clearing member make deposits into a fund known as a guaranty fund ("guaranty fund"), which is maintained by the relevant ice clearing house. these amounts serve to secure the obligations of a clearing member to the ice clearing house to which it has made the guaranty fund deposit and may be used to cover losses sustained by the respective ice clearing house in the event of a default of a clearing member.
for ice clear canada, a portion of all income earned from clearing members' cash deposits for the guaranty fund and margin deposits, and for ice clear u.s., all income earned from clearing members' cash deposits for the guaranty fund and from the cash variation margin deposits, is retained by the respective ice clearing house and is included in other revenues in the accompanying consolidated statements of income. all other interest earned on the cash margin deposits, less costs incurred by the ice clearing houses, is remitted by the ice clearing houses to the clearing members.
each of the ice clearing houses has equal and offsetting claims to and from their respective clearing members on opposite sides of each cleared contract. this arrangement allows the ice clearing houses to serve as the central financial counterparty on every cleared contract. each ice clearing house bears financial counterparty credit risk in the event that market movements create conditions that lead to its clearing members failing to meet their financial obligations to that ice clearing house. accordingly, the ice clearing houses account for this central counterparty guarantee as a performance guarantee. given that each contract is margined and marked or settled on at least a daily basis for each clearing member, the ice clearing houses' maximum estimated exposure for this guarantee, excluding the effects of original and variation margin requirements and mandatory deposits to the applicable guaranty fund by clearing members, is $65.3 billion as of december 31, 2014, which represents the maximum estimated value by the ice clearing houses of a hypothetical one day movement in pricing of the underlying unsettled contracts. this amount is based on calculations determined using proprietary risk management software that simulates gains and losses based on historical market prices, volatility and other factors present at that point in time for those particular unsettled contracts. future actual market price volatility could result in the exposure being significantly different than the amount estimated by the ice clearing houses. the net notional value of unsettled contracts was $2.6 trillion as of december 31, 2014. we performed calculations to determine the fair value of our counterparty performance guarantee taking into consideration factors such as daily settlement of contracts, margining requirements, other elements of our risk management program, historical evidence of default payments, and estimated probability of potential default payouts by the ice clearing houses. based on these analyses, the estimated counterparty performance guaranty liability was determined to be nominal and no liability was recorded as of december 31, 2014 and 2013.
the ice clearing houses seek to reduce their exposure through a risk management program that includes initial and ongoing financial standards for clearing member admission and continued membership, original and variation margin requirements, and mandatory deposits to the guaranty fund. the amounts that the clearing members are required to maintain in the original margin and guaranty fund accounts are determined by standardized parameters established by the margin or risk committees, risk management departments and the boards of directors of each of the ice clearing houses and may fluctuate over time. as of december 31, 2014 and 2013, the ice clearing houses have received or have been pledged $77.0 billion and $68.2 billion, respectively, in cash and non-cash collateral in original margin and guaranty fund deposits to cover price movements of underlying contracts. the ice clearing houses also have powers of assessment that provide the ability to collect additional funds from their clearing members to cover a defaulting member's remaining obligations up to the limits established under the respective rules of each ice clearing house.
should a particular clearing member fail to deposit original margin, or to make a variation margin payment, when and as required, the relevant ice clearing house may liquidate or hedge the clearing member's open positions and use the clearing member's margin and guaranty fund deposits to make up the amount owed. in the event that those deposits are not sufficient to pay the amount owed in full, the ice clearing houses may utilize the respective guaranty fund deposits of their respective clearing members on a pro-rata basis for that purpose. we have contributed $128 million, $50 million and $50 million to the ice clear europe, ice clear credit and ice clear u.s. guaranty funds, respectively, as of december 31, 2014, and such amounts are at risk and could be used in the event of a clearing member default where the amount of the defaulting clearing member's original margin and guaranty fund deposits are insufficient. the $228 million combined contributions as of december 31, 2014 are included in long-term restricted cash in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet (note 4).
110
for ice clear europe, if a futures and options clearing member's deposits are depleted and a default occurs, then a $100 million contribution made by us to ice clear europe would be utilized. the $100 million is solely available in the event of an ice clear europe futures and options clearing member default, and $50 million of the $100 million will be utilized after the available funds of the defaulting member but before all other amounts within the ice clear europe futures and options guaranty fund. if additional cash is required to settle positions, the remaining $50 million will be called pro rata along with other non-defaulting ice clear europe futures and options clearing members' deposits in the ice clear europe options and futures guaranty fund.
we have contributed $50 million to the ice clear credit guaranty fund and $28 million to the ice clear europe cds guaranty fund as of december 31, 2014. we are obligated to contribute an additional $22 million to the ice clear europe cds guaranty fund as of october 7, 2015, two years from the from the launch of cds client clearing at ice clear europe. the first $25 million contributed to each of the ice clear credit guaranty fund and ice clear europe cds guaranty fund will be utilized after the available funds of the defaulting cds clearing member but before all other amounts within the guaranty funds. the additional $25 million, to the extent required to be contributed at such time, contributed to each of the ice clear credit guaranty fund and ice clear europe cds guaranty funds will be utilized pro-rata along with other non-defaulting cds clearing members' deposits in the respective guaranty funds.
in connection with ice clear u.s.'s election to be subject to subpart c of the cftc's regulation, we contributed $50 million to ice clear u.s.'s guaranty fund on january 1, 2014. of the $50 million contribution, which is included in long-term restricted cash, $25 million is available on a priority basis in the event a clearing member defaults and ice clear u.s. has utilized all such clearing member's other default resources to settle the position. this amount will then be used to settle the position before other funds in the guaranty fund are used. if additional cash is still required to settle the positions, then the remaining $25 million of our contribution will be utilized pro-rata along with the other non-defaulting ice clear u.s. clearing members' deposits in the guaranty fund.
as of december 31, 2014, original margin and guaranty fund cash deposits are as follows for the ice clearing houses (in millions):

we have recorded these cash deposits in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets as current assets with corresponding current liabilities to the clearing members of the relevant ice clearing house. all cash, securities and letters of credit are available only to meet the financial obligations of that clearing member to the relevant ice clearing house. ice clear u.s., ice clear europe, ice clear canada, ice clear credit and tcc are separate legal entities and are not subject to the liabilities of the other ice clearing houses or the obligations of the members of the other ice clearing houses. the amount of these cash deposits may fluctuate due to the types of margin collateral choices available to clearing members and the change in the amount of deposits required. as a result, these assets and corresponding liabilities may vary significantly over time.
of the $16.5 billion of ice clear credit cash deposits as of december 31, 2014, $12.0 billion represent funds invested under reverse repurchase agreements with several counterparty banks, which are all large commercial financial institutions. under these arrangements, ice clear credit purchases u.s. treasury securities and other u.s. securities and the various counterparties agree to repurchase the instruments the following business day at a set price, plus interest. the remaining $4.5 billion in ice clear credit cash deposits represent primarily euro cash in demand deposit accounts at large, highly-rated financial institutions.
of the $26.3 billion of ice clear europe cash deposits as of december 31, 2014, which are primarily held in u.s. dollars, euros and pounds sterling, $7.0 billion relates to futures and options products and $19.3 billion relates to cleared otc european cds instruments. ice clear europe offers a separate clearing platform, risk model and risk pool for futures and options products, which includes the liffe products, that is distinct from those associated with cleared otc european cds instruments.
of the $26.3 billion of ice clear europe cash deposits as of december 31, 2014, $19.4 billion represent funds invested under reverse repurchase agreements through two third party investment and custody agents, with several different counterparty banks, some of which are also our clearing members and are large commercial financial institutions, and $6.7 billion represent funds invested

directly in sovereign debt. under these arrangements, ice clear europe primarily purchases u.s. treasury securities and certain sovereign debt obligations from the seven largest industrialized nations, and the various counterparties agree to repurchase the instruments on the set repurchase date at the set repurchase price, plus interest. the carrying value of these securities approximates their fair value due to the short-term nature of the instruments and repurchase agreements. the remaining cash deposits at the ice clearing houses are held in demand deposit accounts at large, highly rated financial institutions and directly in u.s. treasury securities with original maturities of less than 12 months.
in addition to the cash deposits for original margin and the guaranty fund, the ice clearing houses have also received other assets from clearing members, which may include government obligations, letters of credit or gold to mitigate credit risk. these assets are not reflected in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets as the risks and rewards of these assets remain with the clearing members. these assets are held in safekeeping and any interest and gain or loss accrues to the clearing member. for certain non-cash deposits, the ice clearing houses may impose discount or "haircut" rates to ensure adequate collateral levels to account for fluctuations in the market value of these deposits. as of december 31, 2014 and 2013, the assets pledged by the clearing members as original margin and guaranty fund deposits for each of the ice clearing houses are detailed below (in millions):

ice clear u.s. and the options clearing corporation ("occ") have entered into a cross-margin agreement, whereby a common clearing firm, or a pair of affiliated clearing firms, may maintain a cross-margin account in which positions in certain of ice clear u.s.'s futures and options are combined with certain positions cleared by occ for purposes of calculating margin requirements of the clearing firms. the margin deposits are held jointly by ice clear u.s. and occ. cross-margin cash, securities and letters of credit jointly held with occ under the cross-margin agreement are reflected at 50% of the total, or ice clear u.s.'s proportionate share, in accordance with the agreement. as of december 31, 2014, the margin deposits in the joint account were $61 million of which $31 million is ice clear u.s.'s proportionate share and is reflected above in the pledged asset margin balance. clearing firms maintain separate margin requirements with each clearing house. depending on the impact resulting from offsetting positions between ice clear u.s. and occ, each clearing house may reduce that firm's margin requirements. cross margin deposits are held in a joint custody account controlled by ice clear u.s. and occ. if a participating firm defaults, the gain or loss on the liquidation of the firm's open position and the proceeds from the liquidation of the cross-margin account will be split 50% each to ice clear u.s. and occ. the cross-margining arrangement reduces capital costs for clearing firms and eligible customers. the agreement permits a participating clearing house to recognize a clearing firm's open positions at another participating clearing house, and clearing firms are able to offset risks of positions held at one clearing house against those held at another participating clearing house, with respect to particular accounts.
13.   commitments and contingencies leases we lease office space, equipment facilities and certain computer equipment under lease agreements that expire at various dates through 2029. our leases typically contain terms which may include renewal options, rent escalations, rent holidays and leasehold improvement incentives. we had no capital leases as of december 31, 2014 and 2013. rental expense under these leases, included in the accompanying consolidated statements of income in rent and occupancy and technology and communication expenses, totaled $82 million, $47 million and $23 million for the years ended december 31, 2014, 2013, and 2012, respectively. as of december 31, 2014, future minimum lease payments under these non-cancelable operating agreements are as follows (in millions):

russell licensing agreement we have an exclusive license agreement (the "license agreement") with the russell investment group ("russell") to offer futures and options on futures contracts based on the full range of russell's benchmark u.s. equity indexes through june 2017. in exchange for its license rights, we will make annual cash payments based on the annual traded contract volumes, subject to certain minimum annual royalty payments through the expiration of the agreement in june 2017. we have recorded the license rights as intangible assets, which were valued based on the net present value of all minimum annual royalty payments that we are required to make to russell throughout the term of the agreement. as of december 31, 2014 and 2013, the net assets related to the license agreement are $48 million and $67 million, respectively, and are included in other intangible assets in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. the intangible assets are being amortized on a straight-line basis over their contractual life. amortization expense related to the license agreement was $19 million for each of the years ended december 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012.
because we are required to make minimum annual royalty payments to maintain the russell license rights, we have recorded a liability based on the net present value of the total required minimum royalty payments as of the effective date of the license agreement. as of december 31, 2014, the current and non-current liabilities relating to the minimum annual royalty payments under the license agreement are $19 million and $32 million, respectively, and $19 million and $48 million as of december 31, 2013, respectively, and are reflected as other current and non-current liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. the difference between the present value of the minimum annual payments and the actual minimum annual payments is recorded as interest expense using the effective interest method over the term of the license agreement. for the years ended december 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, interest expense related to the license agreement was $3 million, $4 million and $5 million, respectively.
redeemable non-controlling interest as part of the ice endex purchase agreement (note 3), gasunie has a put option to sell to us, and we have a call option to purchase from gasunie, gasunie's entire remaining stake in ice endex at fair market value provided that the fair value falls between a stated cap and floor. both the call and put option become exercisable two years from the date of closing of the acquisition and expire five years from the date of closing. since the likelihood of us acquiring the non-controlling interest in the future is probable, we have recorded the full redemption fair value of $24 million as of december 31, 2014 as mezzanine equity and classified the related balance as "redeemable non-controlling interest" in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet. changes in the redemption value of the non-controlling interest are recorded to the redeemable non-controlling interest balance in full as they occur.
as part of the hch acquisition (note 3), abn amro has a put option to sell to us, and we have a call option to purchase from abn amro, abn amro's entire remaining 25% stake in hch at fair market value subject to a stated floor. both the call and put option become exercisable after the third anniversary of the date of closing of the acquisition. since the likelihood of us acquiring the non-controlling interest in the future is probable, we have recorded the full redemption fair value of $16 million as of december 31, 2014 as mezzanine equity and classified the related balance as "redeemable non-controlling interest" in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet. changes in the redemption value of the non-controlling interest are recorded to the redeemable non-controlling interest balance in full as they occur.
prior to the our acquisition of nyse, nyse completed the sale of a significant equity interest in nyse amex options, one of our two u.s. options exchanges, to seven external investors. under the terms of the sale, the external investors have the option to require us to repurchase a portion of the equity interest on an annual basis over the course of five years, which began in 2011. since the likelihood of us acquiring the non-controlling interest in the future is probable, the full redemption fair value has been recorded as mezzanine equity and the related balance as "redeemable non-controlling interest" in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. in july 2014, we repurchased half of the 32% interest held by the seven external investors in nyse amex options for $128 million in cash. after the repurchase, we own 84% of nyse amex options and the remaining 16% of the outstanding shares of nyse amex options, valued at $125 million as of december 31, 2014, can be put back to us by the external investors in 2015.

legal proceedings we are subject to legal proceedings and claims, like the ones described below, that arise in the ordinary course of business. typically, we do not believe that the resolution of these ordinary course matters, including those described below, will have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition, results of operations, or liquidity. it is possible, however, that future results of operations for any particular quarterly or annual period could be materially and adversely affected by any developments relating to the legal proceedings and claims. a range of possible losses related to the cases below cannot be reasonably estimated at this time.
in april 2014, the first of four purported class action lawsuits was filed in the u.s. district court for the southern district of new york (the "southern district") by the city of providence, rhode island, against more than 40 defendants, including "exchange defendants", "brokerage defendants" and "hft (high frequency trading) defendants" (the "city of providence lawsuit"). new york stock exchange llc and nyse arca, inc., two of our subsidiaries, were among the named exchange defendants. on july 2, 2014, the court ordered the cases consolidated for all purposes, and appointed lead plaintiffs. on september 3, 2014, the lead plaintiffs filed an amended complaint asserting claims against only a subset of the original exchange defendants, including new york stock exchange llc and nyse arca, inc., and also asserting claims against barclays plc ("barclays"), a subsidiary of which operates an alternative trading system known as barclays lx. the lead plaintiffs are suing on behalf of a class of "all public investors" who bought or sold stock from april 18, 2009 to the present on the u.s.-based equity exchanges operated by the remaining exchange defendants or on barclays lx. the amended complaint asserts violations by all remaining exchange defendants of sections 10(b) and 6(b) of the exchange act, and seeks unspecified compensatory damages against all defendants, jointly and severally, as well as various forms of equitable relief. the defendants filed a motion on november 3, 2014 to dismiss the amended complaint. on november 24, 2014, the plaintiffs filed a second amended complaint asserting the same legal claims and substantially the same factual allegations. on january 23, 2015, the defendants filed a motion to dismiss the second amended complaint.
on october 2, 2014, barclays filed a motion before the u.s. judicial panel on multidistrict litigation (the "mdl panel") requesting that a separate lawsuit filed against barclays in the u.s. district court for the central district of california be transferred to the southern district judge handling the city of providence lawsuit for consolidated or coordinated pre-trial proceedings. on december 12, 2014, the mdl panel entered an order granting barclays's motion and transferring the matter to the southern district. depending on the outcome of further pre-trial proceedings to occur in the southern district, the scope of this litigation could be expanded.
in may 2014, three purported class action lawsuits were filed in the southern district by harold lanier against the securities exchanges that are participants in each of the three national market system data distribution plans - the consolidated tape association/consolidated quotation plan, the nasdaq utp plan, and the options price reporting authority (the "plans") - which are established under the exchange act and regulated by the sec. on august 15, 2014, lanier filed amended complaints in each of the three lawsuits but did not alter the named defendants. new york stock exchange llc, nyse arca, inc. and nyse mkt llc, which are our subsidiaries, are among the defendants named in one or more of the suits. lanier is claiming to sue on behalf of him and all other similarly situated subscribers to the market data disseminated by the plans. lanier's allegations include that the exchange participants in the plans breached agreements with subscribers by disseminating market data in a discriminatory manner in that other "preferred" customers allegedly received their data faster than the proposed class. the complaints seek, among other relief, unspecified compensatory damages, restitution of the putative class's subscription fees paid to the defendants, disgorgement of the fees paid by the so-called preferred customers, and injunctive and declaratory relief. on september 29, 2014, the defendants moved to dismiss the amended complaint, and the motion remains pending.
one of our subsidiaries, nyse brazil holdings, b.v. ("nyse bv"), is a party to a pending arbitration proceeding initiated by an arbitration demand dated june 4, 2014 in brazil, filed by atg americas trading group, s.a. ("atg") and ats brasil s.a. ("ats"). nyse bv and atg own 20% and 80%, respectively, of the equity in ats, a company with a prospective cash equity trading platform in brazil, which is not yet operational. atg and ats allege nyse bv breached certain obligations and assert damages of at least 100 million brazilian reais ($38 million based on the brazilian real/u.s. dollar exchange rate of 0.3763 as of december 31, 2014). the case has not yet proceeded to a point where atg and ats would be required to provide factual support for its damages demand, whether $100 million brazilian reais, or a materially higher amount. nyse bv has served atg and ats with a responsive statement which denies liability in connection with the claims, and we are defending the proceeding. the arbitration panel has been appointed and is first deciding a threshold issue presented by atg/ats - whether to expand the arbitration to include other of our subsidiaries as parties - before scheduling further proceedings in the matter. because this arbitration is in an unfamiliar forum under foreign law, we have less ability to predict results than we would in a u.s. proceeding.
tax audits we are engaged in ongoing discussions and audits with taxing authorities on various tax matters, the resolutions of which are uncertain. currently, there are matters that may lead to assessments involving us or one of our subsidiaries, some of which may not be resolved for several years. based on currently available information, we believe we have adequately provided for any assessments that
114
could result from those proceedings where it is more likely than not that we will be assessed. we continuously review our positions as these matters progress.
14.   pension and other benefit programs defined benefit pension plans in connection with our acquisition of nyse on november 13, 2013, we assumed nyse's pension plans covering its u.s. and certain european operations, as well as other benefit plans. the benefit accrual for the u.s. operations pension plan is frozen. following the euronext ipo (note 16) in june 2014, there are no longer any european operations covered by a pension plan.
retirement benefits are derived from a formula, which is based on length of service and compensation. based on this calculation, we may contribute to our pension plans to the extent such contributions may be deducted for income tax purposes. during the year ended december 31, 2014, we contributed $51 million to our pension plans. we did not contribute to our pension plans during the period from november 13, 2013 to december 31, 2013. our practice is to fund our frozen defined benefit pension plan each year at the level above the minimum required contribution but within tax deductible limits. based on actuarial projections, we estimate that a contribution of $10 million during the year ended december 31, 2015 will allow us to meet our funding goal. however, the actual contribution is contingent on the actual plan performance relative to assumptions.
during year ended december 31, 2014, as part of certain plan amendments, lump sum payments were offered to certain terminated vested participants as part of a de-risking strategy in the pension plans. the offer was made to 2,725 participants, of whom 935, or 34%, elected to receive a lump sum. the total amount paid to this group was $55 million and when combined with other lump sum payments made during the year, it exceeded the total interest cost and service cost for the year. we recognized a loss of $4 million for the year ended december 31, 2014 in connection with these plan settlements, which is included in acquisition-related transaction and integration cost in our consolidated statement of income.
consistent with prior practice by nyse, we base our investment policy and objectives on a review of the actuarial and funding characteristics of the retirement plan, the demographic profile of plan participants, and our business and financial characteristics. capital market risk/return opportunities and tradeoffs also are considered as part of the determination. the primary investment objective of our plan is to achieve a long-term rate of return that meets the actuarial funding requirements of the plan and maintain an asset level sufficient to meet all benefit obligations of the plan. the target allocations for the u.s. plan assets are 65 percent equity securities and 35 percent u.s. fixed income securities. equity securities primarily include investments in large-cap and small-cap companies primarily located in the united states. u.s. fixed income securities include corporate bonds of companies from diversified industries and u.s. treasuries. based on the valuation techniques described in note 15, the fair values of our pension plans assets as of december 31, 2014, by asset category, are as follows (in millions):

we use a market-related value of plan assets when determining the estimated return on plan assets. gains/losses on plan assets are amortized over a four year period and accumulate in other comprehensive income. we recognize deferred gains and losses in future net income based on a "corridor" approach, where the corridor is equal to 10% of the greater of the benefit obligation or the market-related value of plan assets at the beginning of the year.

supplemental executive retirement plan we assumed nyse's u.s. nonqualified supplemental executive retirement plan ("serp"), which provides supplemental retirement benefits for certain employees. the future benefit accrual of the serp plan is frozen. to provide for the future payments of these benefits, we have purchased insurance on the lives of certain of the participants through company-owned policies. as of december 31, 2014 and 2013, the cash surrender value of such policies was $54 million and $51 million, respectively, and is included in other non-current assets in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. the following table provides a summary of the changes in the serp benefit obligations (in millions):

pension and serp plan assumptions the weighted average assumptions used to develop the actuarial present value of the projected benefit obligation and net periodic pension/serp costs for year ended december 31, 2014 and for the period from november 13, 2013 to december 31, 2013 are set forth below:

the assumed discount rate reflects the market rates for high-quality corporate bonds currently available. the discount rate was determined by considering the average of pension yield curves constructed on a large population of high quality corporate bonds. the resulting discount rates reflect the matching of plan liability cash flows to yield curves. to develop the expected long-term rate of return on assets assumption, we considered the historical returns and the future expectations for returns for each asset class as well as the target asset allocation of the pension portfolio.
post-retirement benefit plans nyse's defined benefit plans provide certain health care and life insurance benefits for eligible retired u.s. employees. these post-retirement benefit plans, which may be modified in accordance with their terms, were fully frozen in 2009. the net periodic post-retirement benefit costs were $9 million and $1 million for the year ended december 31, 2014 and for the period from november 13, 2013 to december 31, 2013, respectively. the defined benefit plans are unfunded and we currently do not expect to fund the post-retirement benefit plans. the discount rate as of december 31, 2014 and 2013 is 3.8% and 4.6%, respectively. the following table shows the actuarial determined benefit obligation, interest costs, employee contributions, actuarial loss, benefits paid during the period and the accrued employee benefits (in millions):

accumulated other comprehensive income the accumulated other comprehensive loss as of december 31, 2014 was primarily a result of a decline in the discount rate and changes to mortality tables used to measure the benefit obligations of the pension, serp and post-retirement benefit plans. accumulated other comprehensive loss, after tax, as of december 31, 2014 consisted of the following amounts that have not yet been recognized in net periodic benefit cost (in millions):

the amount of prior actuarial loss included in accumulated other comprehensive income related to the pension, serp and postretirement plans as of december 31, 2014, which are expected to be recognized in net periodic benefit cost in the coming year, is estimated to be (in millions):

as of the acquisition date of november 13, 2013, the pension, serp and postretirement plans were recorded at fair value and the accumulated unrecognized net actuarial loss prior to the acquisition was written off in accordance with purchase accounting rules under u.s. gaap.
other benefit plans and defined contribution plans we assumed nyse's defined contribution plans for which most nyse's employees contribute a portion of their salary within legal limits. our u.s. operations match an amount equal to 100% of the first 6% of eligible contributions. the u.k. operations contribute an equivalent of 7% of the employee's salary for all employees who are active in the savings plan. total contributions made by us for the years ended december 31, 2014 and 2013 were $20 million and $2 million, respectively, related to the nyse's defined contribution plans. the u.s. operations also provide benefits under a supplemental executive savings plan ("sesp") to which eligible employees may contribute. sesp employee contributions were $2 million for both the year ended december 31, 2014 and for the period from november 13, 2013 to december 31, 2013, respectively. included in accrued employee benefits payable was $13 million and $23 million as of december 31, 2014, and 2013, respectively, relating to the sesp plan.

our historical ice u.k.-based subsidiaries have a defined contribution pension plan for eligible employees. we contribute a percentage of the employee's base salary to the plan each month and employees are also able to make additional voluntary contributions, subject to plan and statutory limits. our contribution ranges from 10% to 20% of the employee's base salary. total contributions made by us for the years ended december 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012 were $4 million, $3 million and $2 million respectively, related to the historical ice u.s. defined contribution pension plan.
the employees of our historical ice u.s.-based subsidiaries are eligible to participate in our 401(k) and profit sharing plan (the "401(k) plan"). we have historically offered a match of 100% of the first 5% of the eligible employee's compensation contributed to the 401(k) plan, subject to plan and statutory limits. the 401(k) plan match was increased to 6% beginning january 1, 2015. total matching contributions under our 401(k) plan and for other 401(k) plans that are no longer active were $5 million, $4 million and $4 million for the years ended december 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012. no discretionary or profit sharing contributions were made during the years ended december 31, 2014, 2013 or 2012.
15.   fair value measurements our financial instruments consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents, short-term and long-term restricted cash and investments, short-term and long-term investments, customer accounts receivable, margin deposits and guaranty funds, cost and equity method investments, short-term and long-term debt and certain other short-term assets and liabilities. the fair value of our financial instruments are measured based on a three-level hierarchy:
•   level 1 inputs - quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in active markets.
•   level 2 inputs - observable inputs other than level 1 inputs such as quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets or inputs other than quoted prices that are directly observable.
•   level 3 inputs - unobservable inputs supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities.
in general, we use level 1 inputs to determine fair value. the level 1 assets consist of u.s. treasury securities, equity and other securities listed in active markets, and investments in publicly traded mutual funds held for the purpose of providing future payments of the serp and sesp plans. level 2 assets consist of foreign exchange derivative contracts whose fair value we determined using published currency rates. as of december 31, 2014, the fair values of our $1.39 billion senior notes and $1.99 billion nyse notes are $1.46 billion and $2.01 billion, respectively. the fair values of these fixed rate notes were estimated using quoted market prices for these instruments. the fair value of our other short-term and long-term debt approximates the carrying value since the rates of interest on the debt approximate market rates as of december 31, 2014. all other financial instruments are determined to approximate carrying value due to the short period of time to their maturities.
financial assets and liabilities recorded in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets as of december 31, 2014 and 2013 are classified in their entirety based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the asset or liability's fair value measurement. financial instruments measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of december 31, 2014 are as follows (in millions):

held for the purpose of providing future payments to the serp and sesp (note 14). as of december 31, 2014 and 2013, we are holding $374 million and $100 million in u.s. treasury securities, respectively, all of which had maturities of less than one year from the date of purchase (note 5).
we did not use level 3 inputs to determine the fair value of assets or liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of december 31, 2014 and 2013. we measure certain assets, such as intangible assets and cost and equity method investments, at fair value on a non-recurring basis. these assets are recognized at fair value if they are deemed to be impaired. as of december 31, 2014 and 2013, none of these assets were required to be recorded at fair value since no impairment indicators were present.
cost and equity method investments were $53 million and $172 million as of december 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively, and are classified as other non-current assets in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. the decrease in the cost and equity investments relate to investments in lch.clearnet and euroclear owned by euronext that were de-recognized as part of the de-consolidation of euronext (note 16), offset by an increase in our equity method investment in occ.
in connection with our acquisition of nyse, we obtained a 40% ownership in occ. occ serves as a clearing house for securities and commodities options and futures offered for trading on various independent exchanges. occ clears securities options traded on nyse arca and nyse mkt. occ is regulated by the sec as a registered clearing agency and by the cftc as a derivatives clearing organization. we recorded our investment in occ as an equity method investment with an initial fair value of $4 million on november 13, 2013. under equity method accounting, we will subsequently adjust the carrying value of our occ investment on our balance sheet by recognizing our pro-rata share of the earnings or losses of occ, with a corresponding adjustment in our statement of income to other income, after eliminating any intra-entity income or expenses. the share of occ's earnings that we will recognize is calculated based on our 40% ownership of occ's net income. also, if occ issues cash dividends to us in the future, we will deduct the amount of these dividends from the carrying amount of our investment.
historically, occ declared a refund to its clearing members each year that resulted in minimal profit for occ. however, based on a new capital plan designed to comply with proposed new regulatory capital standards, occ declared in december 2014 a reduced refund for 2014. based on the preliminary occ net income for the year ended december 31, 2014, we increased the carrying value of our occ investment by $26 million, and recorded other income of $25 million during the fourth quarter of 2014. in addition, we eliminated intra-entity transaction-based expenses paid to occ of $1 million for the year ended december 31, 2014. we recorded the increase in our equity investment during the fourth quarter of 2014, versus throughout 2014, because we were not able to determine what the occ refund for 2014 was going to be until the new capital plan was formalized during the fourth quarter of 2014 and the 2014 fee refund was declared.
occ's new capital plan, which is scheduled to be finalized during the first quarter of 2015, subject to regulatory and occ shareholders' approvals, would potentially raise $150 million in equity capital from occ's shareholders, including $60 million to be contributed by nyse. if this were to occur, our $60 million equity contribution would increase the carrying value of our investment. in exchange for the equity capital from its shareholders, occ would, subject to determination by its board of directors and compliance with legal requirements, commit to pay an annual dividend to its shareholders equal to the after-tax income of occ, in excess of the amount required to maintain its target capital requirement and satisfy other capital requirements, and after refunds to its clearing members equal to 50% of distributable earnings before tax. after the capital plan is finalized and approved by the regulators and occ's shareholders, we would be able to record our share of occ's net income quarterly in the future since occ will have a formula based program for determining the annual refund to clearing members that will be declared in december of each year. in addition, the occ shareholders have committed to contribute up to $200 million in additional equity capital if certain capital thresholds are breached, including up to $80 million to be contributed by nyse. unless and until such $200 million capital contribution is repaid to the shareholders, occ would not declare any dividends and would not pay refunds to its clearing members.
16.   discontinued operations on june 24, 2014, we sold an aggregate 65.8 million shares of common stock of euronext, representing 94% of euronext's outstanding shares, in three transactions. the three transactions include our sale of 42.2 million shares of euronext common stock in an ipo at €20 per share, 23.4 million shares of euronext common stock to a group of european institutional investors at €19.20 per share, and 0.2 million shares of euronext common stock to eligible euronext employees at €16 per share. on december 9, 2014, we sold our remaining 6%, or 4.2 million shares, of euronext common stock for €95 million ($118 million), including a realized net gain of $4 million, which was recognized in other income in the accompanying consolidated statement of income for the year ended december 31, 2014. the $4 million net gain included a stock price gain of $15 million based on the difference in the euronext stock price from the ipo date to the date of sale on december 9, 2014, less $11 million in foreign currency translation losses relating to the decrease in the value of the euro relative to the u.s. dollar during this same period of time. we no longer hold any shares of euronext stock, and these four transactions generated an aggregate €1.5 billion ($2.1 billion) of net cash proceeds for us. the net cash proceeds received included cash of $220 million distributed from euronext as part of the separation of euronext from ice.

on july 23, 2014, we sold wombat, a unit of nyse technologies, to sr labs. on september 19, 2014 we sold nyfix and metabit, the remaining businesses of nyse technologies, to ullink. these agreements complete our previously announced intention to divest non-core nyse technologies assets.
due to the sale of a controlling interest in euronext and the sales of the three companies comprising nyse technologies, we de-consolidated the assets and liabilities of euronext (as of the june 24, 2014 ipo date) and nyse technologies (as of the various sales dates) and included the financial results of these entities in discontinued operations in the accompanying consolidated financial statements effective from the nyse acquisition date of november 13, 2013.
the results below include external advisory costs and professional services costs related to the sales of euronext and nyse technologies of $51 million and $2 million for the years ended december 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively, which have been included with acquisition-related transaction and integration costs, below, from discontinued operations. the results below also include deal-related compensation and severance costs related to the sales of euronext and nyse technologies of $42 million and $19 million for the years ended december 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively, which have also been included with acquisition-related transaction and integration costs below from discontinued operations. none of our interest expense has been allocated to the results of the discontinued operations. further, the income tax provision for discontinued operations for the year ended december 31, 2013 is primarily from the impact of certain foreign tax law changes that occurred after our acquisition of nyse on euronext's tax assets and liabilities.
we used the cash proceeds from the sale of euronext to repay debt (note 9). we used the net cash proceeds from the sale of nyse technologies to repay debt, invest in growth initiatives, pursue strategic investments and return capital to shareholders via dividends and share repurchases. results of discontinued operations were as follows for the years ended december 31, 2014 and 2013 (in millions):

the total assets and total liabilities of euronext removed from our consolidated balance sheet as of june 24, 2014 were $2.9 billion and $1.1 billion, respectively, including $2.3 billion in goodwill and other intangible assets. the total assets and total liabilities of nyse technologies removed from our consolidated balance sheet as of july 23, 2014 and september 19, 2014 were $214 million and $42 million, respectively, including $186 million in goodwill and other intangible assets. there was no gain or loss recognized on the euronext ipo or on the sale of the nyse technologies companies, as any differences in the carrying value of these net assets was adjusted in the nyse purchase price allocation (note 3). the results above are inclusive of $6 million in net gains included in other income, net, which were reclassified from other comprehensive income for euronext currency translation adjustments and the discontinuance of our net investment hedge.
17.   condensed consolidating financial statements in connection with our acquisition of nyse on november 13, 2013 (note 3), ice, intercontinental exchange holdings, inc. and nyse established various guarantees to protect against structural subordination of each entities' existing indebtedness. each of intercontinental exchange holdings, inc. and nyse are our wholly-owned subsidiaries, and each fully and unconditionally guaranteed, on an unsecured and unsubordinated basis, the payment of principal, premium, if any, and interest of ice's senior notes and, following its establishment, the commercial paper program. similarly, ice and intercontinental exchange holdings,
121
inc. each fully and unconditionally guaranteed, on an unsecured and unsubordinated basis, the payment of principal, premium, if any, and interest of the nyse notes. finally, ice and nyse each fully and unconditionally guaranteed, on an unsecured and unsubordinated basis, the payment of principal, premium, if any, and interest of the 2011 credit facilities and the 364 day facility. all of the guarantees are joint and several with all other guarantees and indebtedness. ice's guarantees, as a standalone entity, will remain in place until each applicable debt obligation has been satisfied.
as discussed in note 9, we entered into the 2014 credit facility and terminated the 2011 credit facilities and the 364 day facility on april 3, 2014. upon the termination of the 2011 credit facilities and the 364 day facility, intercontinental exchange holdings, inc.'s guarantees were no longer required and therefore intercontinental exchange holdings, inc.'s guarantees were automatically released in accordance with their terms on april 3, 2014. in connection with our entry into the 2014 credit facility, nyse agreed to guarantee the 2014 credit facility as a subsidiary guarantor.
for as long as nyse remains a guarantor of the 2014 credit facility, it will remain a guarantor of the senior notes and the commercial paper program. we expect that nyse's guarantee of the 2014 credit facility, the senior notes and the commercial paper program will be released when the nyse notes have been repaid, as the 2014 credit facility provides that nyse's guarantee will be released in accordance with their terms if certain conditions are satisfied, including compliance with the covenant limiting the amount of indebtedness of non-obligor subsidiaries and an investment-grade credit rating.
the following consolidating financial information sets forth, under the equity method of accounting, the condensed consolidating statements of income and comprehensive income, the condensed consolidating balance sheets, and the condensed consolidating statements of cash flows for (i) ice (parent); (ii) nyse; (iii) the subsidiary non-guarantors; (iv) elimination entries necessary to consolidate each of ice and nyse with the non-guarantor subsidiaries; and (v) on a consolidated basis. as discussed in note 1, we were formed on march 6, 2013 for purposes of effecting the acquisition of nyse. therefore, the condensed consolidating statements for periods prior thereto reflect how these statements would have been presented had we been established for all periods presented. the condensed consolidating financial statements only include activity related to nyse for the period subsequent to november 13, 2013, the closing date of the nyse acquisition, for the condensed consolidating statements of income, comprehensive income and cash flows. the condensed consolidating financial information has been retrospectively restated to reflect intercontinental exchange holdings, inc. no longer being a guarantor of the senior notes. the condensed consolidating financial information should be read in conjunction with the accompanying consolidated financial statements.

basic earnings per common share is calculated using the weighted average common shares outstanding during the period. the weighted average common shares outstanding during the year ended december 31, 2014 and 2013 increased primarily due to the 42.4 million shares of our common stock issued to nyse stockholders in connection with the acquisition, weighted to show these additional shares outstanding for the periods after november 13, 2013. common equivalent shares from stock options and restricted stock awards, using the treasury stock method, are also included in the diluted per share calculations unless the effect of their inclusion

would be antidilutive. during the years ended december 31, 2014 and 2012, 155,000 and 228,000 outstanding stock options, respectively, were not included in the computation of diluted earnings per common share, because to do so would have had an antidilutive effect. there were no outstanding stock options for the year ended december 31, 2013 with an antidilutive effect. as of december 31, 2014 and 2013, there were 88,000 and 22,000 restricted stock units, respectively, that were vested but have not been issued that are included in the computation of basic and diluted earnings per share. certain figures in the table above may not recalculate due to rounding.

•   total operating expenses increased $836 million, or 103%, for the year ended december 31, 2014, from the comparable period in 2013, primarily due to an increase of $756 million in expenses recognized relating to the inclusion of nyse, net of integration costs ($1.007 billion in nyse expenses for the year ended december 31, 2014, including $123 million in integration costs, versus $171 million in nyse expenses for the period from november 13, 2013 to december 31, 2013, including $43 million in integration costs). total operating expenses increased $272 million, or 51%, for the year ended december 31, 2013, from the comparable period in 2012, primarily due to $171 million in expenses recognized relating to the inclusion of nyse subsequent to its acquisition on november 13, 2013. acquisition-related transaction and integration costs also increased $124 million for the year ended december 31, 2013, from the comparable period in 2012, primarily relating to our acquisition and integration of nyse (including $43 million in acquisition-related transaction and integration costs incurred directly at nyse and included in the $171 million nyse expense number discussed above). see "- operating expenses" below for further information on the nyse expenses as well as a discussion of the other increases in expenses. total operating expenses exclude euronext and nyse technologies operating expenses which are included in income from discontinued operations discussed below.
•   other income (expense), net includes a $4 million net gain on the remaining sale of our 6% ownership in euronext and $25 million in equity income from our equity investment in the options clearing corporation, or occ, during the year ended december 31, 2014. other income (expense), net includes a $190 million impairment loss on our cetip investment and a $51 million expense relating to the early payoff of outstanding debt during the year ended december 31, 2013. other expense, net, also increased in each of the last two years primarily due to increases in our interest expense resulting from increases in our total debt outstanding during the years ended december 31, 2014 and 2013. the increases in the other expenses was partially offset by an increase in dividend income received relating to our investment in cetip. see "- non-operating income (expenses)" below.
•   income (loss) from discontinued operations, net of tax, for the years ended december 31, 2014 and 2013 include the results of euronext and nyse technologies subsequent to the nyse acquisition on november 13, 2013. see "- discontinued operations" below.
factors affecting our results the business environments in which we operate directly affect our results of operations. our results have been and will continue to be affected by many factors, including the level of trading activity in our markets, which during any period is significantly influenced by general market conditions; competition; price volatility; market share and the pace of industry consolidation; broad trends in the brokerage and finance industry; price levels and price volatility; the number and financial health of companies listed on nyse's cash markets; geopolitical events; weather and disasters; real and perceived supply and demand imbalances; availability of capital; changing technology in the financial services industry; and legislative and regulatory changes; among other factors. in particular, in recent years, the business environment has been characterized by increasing competition among global markets for trading volumes and listings; the globalization of exchanges, customers and competitors; market participants' demand for speed, capacity and reliability, which requires continuing investment in technology; and increasing competition for market data revenues. price volatility increases the need to hedge price risk and creates the need for the exchange of risk between market participants. market liquidity is one of the primary market attributes for attracting and maintaining customers and is an important indicator of a market's strength. the maintenance and growth of our revenues could also be impacted if we face increased pressure on pricing.
the implementation of new regulations may impact participation in our markets. generally, legislative and regulatory bodies in the united states and europe have expressed increased concern regarding derivatives markets when underlying commodity prices rise. as a result, legislative and regulatory actions may change the way we conduct our business and may create uncertainty for market participants, which could affect trading volumes. in particular, many of the proposed changes are still being implemented, and final regulations have not yet been adopted or significant uncertainties and ambiguities remain around adopted regulations. in addition, many market participants are still determining how they will respond to these regulations. as a result, it is
45
difficult to predict all of the effects that the legislation and its implementing regulations will have on us. however, it may possibly result in increased costs and the expenditure of significant resources.
low interest rates and uncertainty in the u.s. financial markets continued to reflect the impact of a slow economic recovery. equity market indices became increasingly volatile in the later part of 2014. economic uncertainty in the european union may also continue to negatively affect global financial markets. in addition, economic uncertainty has continued to affect our clients' activities, business models and technology spending over the last several years. we expect that all of these factors will continue to impact our businesses. we have diversified our business so that we are less subject to the reduction in volatility, trading activity or participation in any one asset class. in addition, we have increased our portion of non-transaction and clearing revenues from 13% in 2012 to 39% in 2014. we continue to focus on our strategy to broaden and diversify our revenue streams, as well as on our company-wide expense reduction initiatives in connection with our acquisition of nyse in order to mitigate these uncertainties.
we also periodically make adjustments to our contract specifications. changes to contracts are generally aimed at making the contracts more relevant to more customers and their evolving hedging needs or are required based on changes to the underlying commodity and may result in fluctuations in trading volume in the near term, with the objective of making the contract more relevant to our customers over the long term. in 2014, we transitioned our gasoil contract to a low-sulphur gasoil contract, and that transition was completed in january 2015. these and other factors could cause our revenues to fluctuate from period to period and these fluctuations may affect the reliability of period to period comparisons of our revenues and operating results.
segment reporting we previously operated as a single reportable business segment as of december 31, 2013, the ice segment. as of march 31, 2014, we operated as two business segments, the ice segment and the euronext segment, which was reflective of how our chief operating decision maker reviewed and operated the business. following the ipo and de-consolidation of euronext in june 2014, we reverted to one business segment as this is reflective of how our chief operating decision maker reviewed and operated the business as of june 30, 2014 and for all subsequent periods.

transaction and clearing fees, net a majority of our revenue is derived from transaction and clearing fees. our transaction and clearing fees are reported on a net basis, except for the transaction-based expenses discussed below, and consist of fees collected from our derivatives trading and clearing and, subsequent to our acquisition of nyse on november 13, 2013, from our u.s. cash trading and u.s. equity options businesses. in our derivatives markets, we earn transaction and clearing fees from both counterparties to each contract that is traded and/or cleared. revenues for per-contract fees are driven by the number of trades executed and fees charged per contract. the amount of our per-contract transaction and clearing fees will depend upon many factors, including, but not limited to, market conditions, transaction and clearing volume, pricing, product mix and new product introductions. because transaction and clearing fees are assessed on a per-contract or notional value basis, revenues and profitability fluctuate with changes in contract volume but not to the same degree due to product mix and pricing. see "- factors affecting our results" above.
in our derivatives markets, following our acquisition of nyse, we recognize transaction and clearing fee revenues from executing and clearing trades based on interest rate, agriculture and equity derivatives futures and options. trading volume in european interest rate products is primarily driven by volatility resulting from expectations for changes in the level and term structure of short-term interest rates and in economic data, and trading in equity derivatives, including equity indexes and single stock futures, is primarily driven by volatility.
we also receive transaction fee revenues from u.s. equity and equity options markets, including the new york stock exchange, nyse arca, nyse mkt and nyse amex options. this revenue includes routing fees related to orders in our markets which are routed to other market for execution.
our u.s. equities markets pay fees to the sec pursuant to section 31 of the exchange act. these section 31 fees are designed to recover the government's costs of supervising and regulating the securities markets and securities professionals. we (or occ on our behalf), in turn, collect activity assessment fees, which are included in transaction and clearing fees in our
47
consolidated statements of income, from member organizations clearing or settling trades on the u.s. equities and options exchanges and recognize these amounts when invoiced. the activity assessment fees are designed so that they are equal to the section 31 fees which are included in transaction-based expenses in our consolidated statements of income. as a result, activity assessment fees and section 31 fees do not have an impact on our net income. activity assessment fees received are included in cash at the time of receipt and, as required by law, the amount due to the sec is remitted semi-annually and recorded as an accrued liability until paid. as of december 31, 2014, the accrued liability related to the un-remitted sec section 31 fees was $137 million.
certain energy futures and options volumes and related revenues have declined or remained flat for the year ended december 31, 2014, from the comparable period in 2013. these energy contracts include north american natural gas and power futures and options contracts and gasoil futures and options contracts. gasoil is a key refined oil products benchmark in europe and asia, which underwent transition to a new specification during 2014.
natural gas revenue declined 6% and volume declined 22% for the year ended december 31, 2014, from the comparable period in 2013, and natural gas revenue declined 15% and volume declined 18% for the year ended december 31, 2013, from the comparable period in 2012. the relatively lower decreases in revenues, compared to the volume decreases, was driven by growth in european natural gas volume, which has a higher transaction fee as compared to the north american natural gas contract, where volume declined significantly year over year. decreased north american natural gas volume was primarily due to continued low volatility and low price levels, which produced muted trading activity in comparison to the record volume levels established during the year ended december 31, 2012. in addition, moderate commodity demand due to muted economic growth, regulatory uncertainty and strong natural gas supply reduced the demand for trading and hedging during 2014 and 2013.
in 2014, ice brent crude futures and options contracts produced the eighteenth consecutive year of record volume. the brent crude futures contract is relied upon by a broad range of global market participants, including oil producing nations and multinational companies, to price and hedge their crude oil production and consumption. based on traded volume in our brent and wti crude futures contracts, we had 54%, 55% and 56% market share of the global crude futures contracts volume for the years ended december 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. other oil revenue and volume grew due to the launch of new global oil and refined product contracts as demand for clearing oil contracts rose.
power futures and options volumes decreased 11% for the year ended december 31, 2014, from the comparable period in 2013, and decreased 8% for the year ended december 31, 2013, compared with the comparable period in 2012. the 3% increase in power futures and options revenues for the year ended december 31, 2014, compared to the volume decreases, were driven by increased european power volume, which has a higher transaction fee as compared to the north american power contract, where volume declined due to low price volatility.
cds trade execution revenues at creditex and ice swap trade were $64 million, $66 million and $78 million for the years ended december 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. the notional value of the underlying cds traded was $1.0 trillion, $904.4 billion and $1.1 trillion for the years ended december 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. the cds execution business remains muted due to financial reform implementation and a general lack of volatility in corporate credit markets.
total cds clearing revenues at ice clear credit and ice clear europe were $97 million, $79 million and $66 million for the years ended december 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. during the years ended december 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, ice clear credit and ice clear europe cleared $13.7 trillion, $10.7 trillion and $10.2 trillion, respectively, of cds notional value. cds clearing activity by investment funds, asset managers, and other buy side market participants has continued to increase due to regulatory mandates, the expansion of products made available for clearing and the benefits derived from portfolio margining.
our transaction and clearing fees are presented net of rebates. we recorded rebates of $631 million, $511 million and $372 million for the years ended december 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. we offer rebates in certain of our markets primarily to support market liquidity and trading volume by providing qualified participants in those markets a discount to the applicable commission rate. such rebates are calculated based on volumes traded. the increase in the rebates is due primarily to the rebates relating to the addition of liffe derivatives markets following the nyse acquisition, an increase in the number of participants in the rebate programs offered on various contracts and an increase in the number of rebate programs.

(1) the north american monthly power futures and options contracts included in the table above (and in the open interest table below) have been adjusted for all periods presented to be sized in megawatts, which resulted in a larger post-conversion contract size for each futures and options contract, a decrease in volume of contracts traded and included in open interest, and a higher rate per contract.

open interest is the aggregate number of contracts (long or short) that clearing members hold either for their own account or on behalf of their clients. open interest refers to the total number of contracts that are currently open - in other words, contracts that have been traded but not yet liquidated by either an offsetting trade, exercise, expiration or assignment. open interest is also a measure of the future activity remaining to be closed out in terms of the number of contracts that members and their clients continue to hold in the particular contract and by the number of contracts held for each contract month listed by the exchange. the following table presents our year-end open interest for our futures and options contracts (in millions, except for percentages).

data services fees we generate revenues from the dissemination of our market data to a variety of users. subscribers can obtain access to our market data services either directly or through third-party distributors. in our derivatives markets, market data fees primarily relate to subscription fees charged for user and license access from data vendors and from the end users, view only market data access, direct access services, terminal access, daily indexes and end of day reports. in addition, we provide a service in our derivatives markets to independently establish market price validation curves whereby participant companies subscribe to receive consensus market valuations.
we earn user and license revenues that we receive from data vendors through the distribution of real-time and historical futures prices and other futures market data derived from trading in our futures markets. during the years ended december 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, we recognized $88 million, $62 million and $64 million, respectively, in market data user and license fees from data vendors. during the years ended december 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, we recognized $87 million, $85 million and $69 million, respectively, in market data access fees. we charge a market data access fee for access to our electronic platform and the increases for the last two years relate to more users and fee increases implemented in 2012 and 2013 related to enhanced data offerings. with the addition of liffe's markets, we also offer real-time and historical futures prices and other futures market data in additional markets, including interest rate futures.
50
our data services fee revenues also increased during the year ended december 31, 2014 following our october 7, 2014 acquisition of superderivatives, a leading provider of risk management analytics, financial market data and valuation services. we recognized $12 million in superderivatives data services revenues during the year ended december 31, 2014, subsequent to our acquisition. the acquisition is intended to accelerate our multi-asset class clearing, risk management and market data strategy.
we now earn data services fees relating to our u.s. equity market data services. we collect cash trading market data fees principally for consortium-based data products and, to a lesser extent, for nyse proprietary data products. consortium-based data fees are dictated as part of the securities industry plans and charged to vendors based on their redistribution of data. consortium-based data revenues from the dissemination of market data (net of administrative costs) are distributed to participating markets on the basis of a formula set by the sec under regulation nms. last sale prices and quotes in new york stock exchange-listed, nyse mkt-listed, and nyse arca-listed securities are disseminated through "tape a" and "tape b," which constitute the majority of our u.s. revenues from consortium-based market data revenues. we also receive a share of the revenues from "tape c," which represents data related to trading of certain securities that are listed on nasdaq. our proprietary products make market data available to subscribers covering activity that takes place solely on our u.s. markets, independent of activity on other markets, and includes depth of book information, historical price information and corporate action information. we also offer nyse realtime reference prices, which allows internet and media organizations to buy real-time, last-sale market data from nyse and provide it broadly and free of charge to the public.
nyse data services fees include fees from secured financial transaction infrastructure, or sfti, which is a physical network infrastructure that connects our markets and other major market centers with numerous market participants in the united states and europe and allows those participants to receive data feeds. sfti is a redundant network that supports a range of nyse services and third-party content and connects all nms market centers in the united states.
during the year ended december 31, 2014 and for the period from november 13, 2013 to december 31, 2013, we recognized data services fee revenues from nyse derivative market data services, u.s. securities trading market data services and sfti fees of $430 million and $57 million, respectively. data services fee revenues exclude euronext data services fee revenues, which are included in income from discontinued operations. see "- discontinued operations" below.
listing fees following our nyse acquisition, we recognize listing fee revenues in our securities markets from two types of fees applicable to companies listed on our u.s. securities exchanges - listing fees and annual fees. listing fees consist of two components: original listing fees and fees related to other corporate-related actions. original listing fees, subject to a minimum and maximum amount, are based on the number of shares that a company initially lists. original listing fees, however, are generally not applicable to companies that transfer to one of our u.s. securities exchanges from another market, except for companies transferring to nyse mkt from the over-the-counter market. other corporate action related fees are paid by listed companies in connection with corporate actions involving the issuance of new shares to be listed, such as stock splits, rights issues and sales of additional securities, as well as mergers and acquisitions, which are subject to a minimum and maximum fee.
original listing fees are recognized as revenue on a straight-line basis over estimated service periods of nine years for nyse and five years for nyse arca and nyse mkt. other corporate action listing fees are recognized as revenue on a straight-line basis over estimated service periods of six years for nyse and three years for nyse arca and nyse mkt. unamortized balances are recorded as deferred revenue in our consolidated balance sheet. we have determined that, at the time of our acquisition of nyse, we did not have a legal performance obligation relating to these listing fees. therefore, in connection with purchase accounting and in accordance with u.s. generally accepted accounting principles, or u.s. gaap, we assigned a fair value of zero to the nyse unamortized deferred revenue balances relating to the listing fees as of the acquisition date of november 13, 2013 (the historical original listing fees deferred revenue balance as of that date was $486 million). the listing fees unamortized deferred revenue balance as of december 31, 2014 of $81 million relates to original and other corporate action listing fees incurred and billed and not yet recognized as revenue subsequent to the november 13, 2013 acquisition through december 31, 2014.
annual fees are charged based on the number of outstanding shares of listed u.s. companies at the end of the prior year. non-u.s. companies pay fees based on the number of listed securities issued or held in the united states. annual fees are recognized as revenue on a pro rata basis over the calendar year.
fees we receive from nyse governance services are included in listing fee revenues. nyse governance services is a leading provider of corporate governance, risk and compliance services to a diverse set of customers, including a number of those listed on the nyse. the true office acquisition is included in with nyse governance services.
listing fees revenues exclude euronext listing fee revenues, which are included in income from discontinued operations. see "- discontinued operations" below.
51
other revenues prior to our acquisition of nyse, other revenues related to various fees for services provided to our customers, including ice chat and ice options analytics subscription fees, ice endex membership fees, agricultural grading and certification fees, regulatory penalties and fines, interest income on certain clearing margin deposits and, during 2013 it included liffe clearing fees (liffe clearing fees are now recorded in transaction and clearing revenues). following our acquisition, other revenues also primarily include technology services revenues, fees for facilities, regulatory fees charged to member organizations of our u.s. securities exchanges, listed company service fees, and designated market maker service fees.
we recognized $163 million and $27 million in other revenues from nyse for the year ended december 31, 2014 and for the period from november 13, 2013 to december 31, 2013, respectively. other revenues exclude euronext and nyse technologies other revenues, which are included in income from discontinued operations. see "- discontinued operations" below.
in addition to the nyse other revenues, the increase in other revenues for the year ended december 31, 2013, from the comparable period in 2012, is primarily due to revenues that we recorded following the whentech acquisition in september 2012 and the ice endex acquisition in march 2013, a reduction in the net interest paid to clearing members for their cash margin deposits at ice clear europe and the fees that we recognized relating to the clearing services agreement for ice clear europe to provide clearing services to nyse liffe from july 1, 2013 to november 12, 2013. the interest paid to clearing members is recorded as a reduction to other revenues. effective january 1, 2013, ice clear europe no longer pays clearing members basis points on certain cash margin deposits.
for the years ended december 31, 2014 and 2013, we have reclassified certain revenues in other revenues to data services fee revenues and to listing fee revenues. the revenues reclassified to data services fees include our sfti network revenues and our colocation service revenues and were $202 million and $32 million for the years ended december 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. the revenues reclassified to listing fees include our nyse governance services revenues and were $30 million and $4 million for the years ended december 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively.
transaction-based expenses see "- revenues - transaction and clearing fees, net" above, for information on the section 31 fees that are included in transaction-based expenses. we incur liquidity payments made to cash trading customers and routing charges made to other exchanges that are included in transaction-based expenses.
we incur routing charges when we do not have the best bid or offer in the market for a security that a customer is trying to buy or sell on one of our u.s. securities exchanges. in that case, we route the customer's order to the external market center that displays the best bid or offer. the external market center charges us a fee per share (denominated in tenths of a cent per share) for routing to its system. additionally, we include costs incurred due to erroneous trade execution within routing as transaction-based expenses. furthermore, nyse arca incurs clearance, brokerage and related transaction expenses and per trade service fees paid to exchanges for trade execution. section 31 fees and routing fees collected from customers are recorded on a gross basis as a component of transaction and clearing fee revenue. refer to note 2 to our consolidated financial statements and related notes, which are included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10-k, for more information on our revenue recognition policies.
operating expenses total operating expenses exclude euronext and nyse technologies operating expenses, which are included in income from discontinued operations. see "- discontinued operations" below. the majority of our operating expenses do not vary directly with changes in our contract volume, except for certain technology and communication expenses and a portion of our compensation expense that is tied directly to our financial performance, as discussed below.

total operating expenses                                   $1,644              $808           103     %          $808              $536            51     %
we expect our operating expenses to decrease in the near term from the year ended december 31, 2014 operating expense level in connection with our integration of nyse, and then to increase in absolute terms in future periods in connection with the growth of our business and to vary from year to year based on the type and level of our acquisitions and other investments.
compensation and benefits expenses compensation and benefits expense is our most significant expense and includes non-capitalized employee wages, bonuses, non-cash or stock compensation, certain severance costs, benefits and employer taxes. the bonus component of our compensation and benefits expense is based on both our financial performance and the individual employee performance and the performance-based restricted stock compensation expense is also based on our financial performance. therefore, our compensation and benefits expense will vary year to year based on our financial performance and by fluctuations in the number of employees.
compensation and benefits expenses increased for the last two years primarily due to increases in employee headcount. our employee headcount increased primarily due to the nyse acquisition, internal hiring relating to the nyse integration, our other acquisitions and hiring for clearing, technology, regulation and compliance. headcount increased from 1,077 employees as of december 31, 2012 to 1,133 employees as of december 31, 2013 (excluding the nyse employees), an increase of 5% compared to the prior year, and increased to 1,650 employees as of december 31, 2014 (excluding the nyse employees), an increase of 46% compared to the prior year.
as of december 31, 2014, we had 1,252 nyse employees, compared to 3,099 nyse employees as of december 31, 2013. the decrease in the nyse employees during the year ended december 31, 2014 is primarily related to the reduction of the euronext employees following the ipo on june 24, 2014, of which there were 1,049 euronext employees as of december 31, 2013, the sale of nyse technologies and employee terminations in connection with the integration of nyse. we recognized $290 million and $46 million in compensation and benefits expenses relating to nyse during the years ended december 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively, subsequent to our acquisition on november 13, 2013.
non-cash compensation expenses recognized in our consolidated financial statements for employee stock options and restricted stock were $82 million, $56 million and $52 million for the years ended december 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. the increase for the year ended december 31, 2014 primarily relates to a greater number of employees receiving non-cash awards due to the headcount increases discussed above.
we incurred non-nyse related employee severance costs of $4 million, $7 million and $7 million for the years ended december 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. the higher employee severance during 2013 and 2012 primarily related to broker severance at creditex and severance during 2012 relating to our closure of the ice futures u.s. open outcry trading floor. in addition, we recorded $99 million and $44 million in nyse employee severance costs during the years ended december 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively, with such costs included in the acquisition-related transaction and integration costs discussed below.
technology and communication expenses technology support services consist of costs for running our wholly-owned data centers, hosting costs paid to third-party data centers, and maintenance of our computer hardware and software required to support our technology. these costs are driven by system capacity, functionality and redundancy requirements. communication expenses consist of costs for network connection for our electronic platforms, telecommunications costs, and fees paid for access to external market data. this expense also includes licensing and other fee agreement expenses which may be impacted by growth in electronic contract volume, our capacity
53
requirements, changes in the number of telecommunications hubs and connections with customers to access our electronic platforms directly.
technology and communication expenses increased the last two years, compared to the prior year, primarily due to the inclusion of nyse expenses following our acquisition, acquisitions and growth in various contract volumes. we recognized $132 million and $13 million in technology and communication expenses relating to nyse during the years ended december 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively.
professional services expenses this expense includes fees for consulting services received on strategic and technology initiatives, temporary labor as well as regulatory, legal and accounting fees. this expense may fluctuate as a result of changes in consulting and technology services and regulatory, accounting and legal proceedings.
professional services expenses increased the last two years, compared to the prior year, primarily due to the inclusion of nyse expenses following our acquisition. we recognized $135 million and $23 million in professional services expenses relating to nyse during the years ended december 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. professional services expenses also increased for the year ended december 31, 2014 due to costs incurred at ice futures singapore as we transitioned the exchange and clearing infrastructures to our trading and clearing platforms, and professional fees incurred for emir implementation.
the increases in professional services expenses during the year ended december 31, 2014 were partially offset by decreases in professional services expenses during the fourth quarter of 2014 relating to a credit we received from the financial industry regulatory authority, or finra, and a reduction in expenses related to the termination of certain services agreements and related agreements, or slas, with euronext.
financial, operational and sales practice oversight of the members of our u.s. securities exchanges is generally conducted by finra. in addition, finra performs the market surveillance and related enforcement functions for our u.s. securities exchanges, pursuant to an agreement with us, although our u.s. securities exchanges retain ultimate regulatory responsibility for the regulatory functions performed by finra under that agreement. finra charges our u.s. securities exchanges throughout the year based on their estimated costs for these services and then trues up the charge at year end to actual costs incurred. based on the actual finra charges incurred to us during 2014 versus what we were accruing, we recorded a credit of $7 million during the fourth quarter of 2014. in january 2016, nyse regulation plans to take over market surveillance, investigation and enforcement functions for nyse equity and options markets from finra.
in connection with the euronext ipo, euronext and ice entered into a series of slas to ensure that euronext and ice (including liffe) had continuity in operating their respective businesses through the separation. the majority of the slas relating to euronext operational support and transition services provided to liffe until its transition to ice futures europe were terminated in november 2014.
rent and occupancy expenses this expense consists of costs related to leased and owned property including rent, maintenance, real estate taxes, utilities and other related costs. we have significant operations located in atlanta, new york and london with smaller offices located throughout the world. rent and occupancy expenses increased the last two years, compared to the prior year, primarily due to the inclusion of nyse expenses following our acquisition. we recognized $56 million and $10 million in rent and occupancy expenses relating to nyse during the years ended december 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively . additionally, we incurred $7 million in duplicate rent expenses and lease termination costs relating to the consolidation of multiple new york office locations that occurred during the year ended december 31, 2013.
acquisition-related transaction and integration costs we incurred $129 million in acquisition-related transaction and integration costs during the year ended december 31, 2014, primarily relating to our integration of nyse and the acquisitions of smx, superderivatives, hch and true office. see "- recent developments" above. of this amount, $6 million was related to fees for investment banking advisors, lawyers, accountants, tax advisors and public relations firms, and other external costs directly related to the transactions. the remaining $123 million was for nyse integration costs incurred during the year ended december 31, 2014, primarily relating to employee termination costs, costs incurred relating to the euronext ipo and sale, costs incurred relating to the sale of nyse technologies, and professional services costs.
54
we incurred $143 million in acquisition-related transaction and integration costs during the year ended december 31, 2013, primarily relating to our acquisition and integration of nyse and ice endex. of this amount, $97 million was related to fees for investment banking advisors, lawyers, accountants, tax advisors and public relations firms, and other external costs directly related to the transactions. the remaining $46 million was for nyse integration costs incurred during the year ended december 31, 2013, primarily relating to employee termination costs, costs incurred relating to the euronext ipo, deal-related bonuses and professional services costs. we incurred acquisition-related transaction costs during the year ended december 31, 2012 primarily relating to our pending acquisitions of nyse and ice endex and our acquisition of whentech.
we expect to continue to explore and pursue various potential acquisitions and other strategic opportunities to strengthen our competitive position and support our growth. as a result, we will incur acquisition-related transaction costs in future periods. see "- non-u.s. gaap financial measures" below.
selling, general and administrative expenses this expense relates to expenses from marketing, advertising, public relations, insurance, dues and subscriptions, travel and entertainment, taxes other than income taxes and other general and administrative costs. selling, general and administrative expenses increased the last two years, compared to the prior year, primarily due to the inclusion of nyse expenses following our acquisition. we recognized $88 million and $11 million in selling, general and administrative expenses relating to nyse during the years ended december 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. selling, general and administrative expenses also increased for the year ended december 31, 2014, from the comparable period in 2013, primarily related to costs from our other acquisitions, due to an accrual made in anticipation of the outcome of certain regulatory proceedings, and increases in certain expenses related to taxes other than income taxes, travel and entertainment and insurance.
depreciation and amortization expenses depreciation and amortization expense results from depreciation of long-lived assets such as buildings, leasehold improvements, planes, furniture, fixtures and equipment over their estimated useful lives. this expense includes amortization of intangible assets obtained in our acquisitions of businesses, as well as on various licensing agreements, over their estimated useful lives. intangible assets subject to amortization consist primarily of customer relationships, trading products with finite lives, technology and the russell licensing rights. this expense also includes amortization of internally developed and purchased software over their estimated useful lives.
we recorded amortization expenses on the intangible assets acquired as part of our acquisitions, as well as on the russell licensing agreement intangible assets, of $151 million, $76 million and $69 million for the years ended december 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. the increases during the years ended december 31, 2014 and 2013 primarily relate to amortization expenses recorded on the nyse intangible assets. we recognized $84 million and $10 million in amortization expenses on the nyse intangible assets during the years ended december 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively.
we recorded depreciation expenses on our fixed assets of $182 million, $80 million and $62 million for the years ended december 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. the increases during the years ended december 31, 2014 and 2013 primarily relate to depreciation expenses recorded on the nyse fixed assets. we recognized $98 million and $16 million in depreciation expenses on the nyse fixed assets during the years ended december 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. depreciation expenses also increased for each of the past two years primarily due to additional depreciation expenses recorded on increased fixed asset additions and capitalized internally developed software, including the building we purchased in atlanta, georgia in july 2013 for $38 million and real estate expenditures during 2014 relating to the atlanta and new york headquarters. see "- cash flow - investing activities" below.

the increases in interest expense over the last two years are primarily due to an increase in the overall amount of debt outstanding during each of the periods, primarily relating to debt incurred for and from the nyse acquisition. see "- debt" below.
we recognized interest and investment income of $7 million, $3 million and $2 million for the years ended december 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. interest and investment income is recorded in other income and the increase primarily relates to an increase in our short-term investments during the year ended december 31, 2014.
we account for our investment in cetip as an available-for-sale investment and it is classified as a long-term investment in our consolidated balance sheet. during the year ended december 31, 2013, we recorded an impairment of our cetip investment for $190 million, which was recorded as other expense. refer to note 5 to our consolidation financial statements and related notes, which are included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10-k, for more information on this impairment. we recognized dividend income received relating to our cetip investment in other income, which was $23 million, $8 million and $5 million for the years ended december 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively.
on october 16, 2013, following the issuance of $1.4 billion in senior notes (as defined below), we prepaid our private senior notes (as defined below) representing $400 million aggregate principal amount. in connection with the early payoff of the private senior notes, we incurred $51 million in expenses, which was recorded as other expense during the year ended december 31, 2013. see "- debt" below.
in connection with our acquisition of nyse, we obtained a 40% ownership in occ and we recorded our investment in occ as an equity method investment. we recognized $25 million in equity income related to this investment during the year ended december 31, 2014 as other income. for a description of this investment, see note 15 to our consolidated financial statements and related notes, which are included elsewhere is this annual report on form 10-k and see "- future capital requirements" below.
we incurred foreign currency transaction losses of $2 million, $2 million and $4 million for the years ended december 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. foreign currency gains and losses are recorded in other income (expense) and relate to the settlement of foreign currency assets, liabilities and payables that occur through our foreign operations that are received in non-functional currencies due to the increase or decrease in the period-end foreign currency exchange rates between periods.
on june 24, 2014, we sold 94% of all outstanding shares of euronext in an ipo. on december 9, 2014, we sold the remaining 4.2 million shares of euronext common stock, representing 6% of the outstanding shares of euronext, for €95 million ($118 million), including a realized net gain of $4 million, which was recognized in other income for the year ended december 31, 2014. the $4 million net gain included a stock price gain of $15 million based on the difference in the euronext stock price from the ipo date to the date of sale on december 9, 2014, less $11 million in foreign currency translation losses relating to the decrease in the value of the euro relative to the u.s. dollar during this same period of time. see "- discontinued operations" below.
during the year ended december 31, 2013, we incurred $3 million in settlements and accruals for various outstanding legal matters, which were recorded as other expense.
for consolidated subsidiaries in which our ownership is less than 100%, and for which we have control over the assets, liabilities and management of the entity, the outside stockholders' interests are shown as non-controlling interests. as of december 31, 2012, non-controlling interest related to the operating results of our cds clearing subsidiaries in which non-ice limited partners held a 45.5% net profit sharing interest. during the year ended december 31, 2013, we purchased 3% of the net profit sharing interest in our cds clearing subsidiaries from various non-ice limited partners and the remaining non-ice limited partners hold a 42.5% net profit sharing interest as of december 31, 2014 and 2013. in connection with our acquisition of nyse,
56
we have non-controlling interest related to various minority ownership interests held in our majority owned subsidiary, nyse amex options. in connection with our 79% acquisition of the derivatives and spot gas business of the former apx-endex in march 2013, gasunie's 21% ownership is included in the non-controlling interest line subsequent to the acquisition date. in connection with our 75% acquisition of hch in december 2014, abn amro clearing bank n.v.'s 25% ownership is included in the non-controlling interest line subsequent to the acquisition date. the increase in the net income attributable to non-controlling interests for the last two years, compared to the prior year, is primarily related to these new non-controlling interests and the increase in the cds clearing revenues the last two years. see "- revenues - transaction and clearing fees" above.
income tax provision consolidated income tax expense was $402 million, $184 million and $228 million for the years ended december 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. the change in consolidated income tax expense between years is primarily due to the change in our pre-tax income and the change in our effective tax rate each year. our effective tax rate was 29%, 37% and 29% for the years ended december 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. the effective tax rates for the years ended december 2014 and 2012 are lower than the statutory federal rate primarily due to favorable foreign tax rate differentials, partially offset by state income taxes. favorable foreign income tax rate differentials result primarily from lower tax rates in the united kingdom, the netherlands and various other lower tax jurisdictions. the effective tax rate for the year ended december 31, 2013 is higher than the statutory federal rate primarily due to the non-tax deductible impairment loss on the cetip investment along with state income taxes and other items. other items are primarily driven by non-tax deductible transaction costs relating to the nyse acquisition.
discontinued operations due to the sale of a controlling interest in euronext and the sales of the three companies comprising nyse technologies (nyfix, metabit and wombat), we de-consolidated the assets and liabilities of euronext (as of the june 24, 2014 ipo date) and nyse technologies (as of the sales dates) and included the financial results of these entities in discontinued operations in our consolidated financial statements effective from the nyse acquisition date of november 13, 2013. see "- recent developments" above and refer to note 16 to our consolidated financial statements and related notes, which are included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10-k, for more information on our discontinued operations disclosures.
the results below include external advisory costs and professional services costs related to the sales of euronext and nyse technologies of $51 million and $2 million for the years ended december 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively, which have been included with acquisition-related transaction and integration costs, below, from discontinued operations. the results below also include deal-related compensation and severance costs related to the sales of euronext and nyse technologies of $42 million and $19 million for the years ended december 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively, which have also been included with acquisition-related transaction and integration costs, below, from discontinued operations. further, the income tax provision for discontinued operations for the year ended december 31, 2013 is primarily from the impact of certain foreign tax law changes that occurred after our acquisition of nyse on euronext's tax assets and liabilities.
we used the cash proceeds from the sale of euronext to repay debt. we used the net cash proceeds from the sale of nyse technologies to repay debt, invest in growth initiatives, pursue strategic investments and return capital to shareholders via dividends and share repurchases. results of discontinued operations were as follows for the years ended december 31, 2014 and 2013 (in millions):

(1) we acquired nyse on november 13, 2013 and have included their financial results in our results of operations for all periods subsequent to the acquisition date. the consolidated statements of income data for euronext, nyfix, metabit and wombat for the periods subsequent to the acquisition of nyse, through their disposition, are included in income from discontinued operations, net of tax. see "- discontinued operations" above.
(2) for the first three quarters of 2014, we have reclassified section 31 fees related to our u.s. equity options revenues to show them gross, with a corresponding offset in transaction-based expenses.
(3) for the years ended december 31, 2014 and 2013, we have reclassified certain revenues in other revenues to data services fee revenues and to listing fee revenues. the revenues reclassified to data services fees include our sfti network revenues and our colocation service revenues and the revenues reclassified to listing fees include our nyse governance services revenues.
(4) for the first three quarters of 2014, we have reclassified certain costs related to nyse to better represent our views on operating expenses.
(5) other income (expense), net for the three months ended december 31, 2014 includes a net $4 million gain on the remaining sale of our 6% ownership in euronext and $25 million in other income from our occ equity method investment. other expense, net for the three months ended december 31, 2013 includes a $190 million impairment loss on our cetip investment and a $51 million expense relating to the early payoff of outstanding debt. see "- non-operating income (expense)" above.
liquidity and capital resources we have financed our operations, growth and cash needs primarily through income from operations and borrowings under our various debt facilities. our principal capital requirements have been to fund capital expenditures, working capital, strategic
59
acquisitions and investments, stock repurchases and the continued development of our electronic trading and clearing platforms. we believe that our cash on hand and cash flows from operations will be sufficient to repay our outstanding debt as it matures. in the future, we may need to incur additional debt or issue additional equity securities, which we may be unable to do or to do on favorable terms. we used the cash proceeds from the euronext ipo and sale to repay debt and we used the net cash proceeds from the sale of nyse technologies to repay debt, invest in growth initiatives, pursue strategic investments and return capital to shareholders via dividends and share repurchases. see "- recent developments" above and "- debt" and "- future capital requirements" below.
on november 13, 2013, we acquired nyse in a stock and cash transaction. we paid cash consideration of $2.7 billion and issued an aggregate number of shares of common stock of 42.4 million shares to nyse stockholders. the cash consideration was funded from cash on hand, $1.4 billion of net proceeds received in october 2013 in connection with our public offering and sale of senior notes and $400 million of borrowings under our revolving facility (as defined below). we refinanced the new borrowings under our revolving facility and the $450 million borrowed under the 364 day facility (as defined below) through the issuance of a commercial paper program. see "- debt" below.
upon maturity of old issuances of commercial paper and to the extent old issuances are not repaid by cash on hand, we are exposed to the rollover risk of not being able to issue new commercial paper. in order to mitigate the rollover risk, we maintain an undrawn backstop bank revolving credit facility for an aggregate amount equaling at any time the amount issued under our commercial paper program. in case we would not be able to issue new commercial paper, we could draw on the backstop revolving facility, which would result in higher interest expense. see "- debt" below.
consolidated cash and cash equivalents were $652 million and $961 billion as of december 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively, and short term investments were $1.2 billion and $74 million as of december 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. we had $379 million and $324 million in long-term investments as of december 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively, and $626 million and $438 million in short-term and long-term restricted cash and investments as of december 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. we consider all short-term, highly liquid investments with remaining maturity dates of three months or less at the time of purchase to be cash equivalents. we classify all investments with original maturity dates in excess of three months but less than one year as short-term investments and all investments that we intend to hold for more than one year as long-term investments. cash and investments that are not available for general use, either due to regulatory requirements or through restrictions in specific agreements, are classified as restricted cash and investments.
the €969 million ($1.2 billion) in short-term investments as of december 31, 2014 represented euro-denominated term deposit investments at various banks each with a maturity date of june 25, 2015 to cover the maturity of the nyse eur notes on june 30, 2015. see "- debt" below. the increase in the long-term investments is due to an increase in our cetip investment's fair value. the restricted cash and investments increase primarily related to a contribution to the ice clear u.s. guaranty fund as of january 1, 2014 in connection with ice clear u.s.'s recognition as a third party qccp, cash escrow set aside for the superderivatives acquisition and increases in the regulatory capital of ice clear europe and ice futures europe due to additional costs incurred at both of these companies due to growth of these businesses.
as of december 31, 2014, the amount of unrestricted cash held by our non-u.s. subsidiaries was $426 million. while we consider our non-u.s. earnings to be indefinitely reinvested overseas, if these cash balances are needed for our operations in the united states, any repatriation by way of dividend may be subject to both u.s. federal and state income taxes, as adjusted for any non-u.s. tax credits. however, we do not have any current needs or foreseeable plans to repatriate cash by way of dividends from our non-u.s. subsidiaries.
our cash and cash equivalents and financial investments are managed as a global treasury portfolio of non-speculative financial instruments that are readily convertible into cash, such as overnight deposits, term deposits, money market funds, mutual funds for treasury investments, short duration fixed income investments and other money market instruments, thus ensuring high liquidity of financial assets. we may invest a portion of our cash in excess of short-term operating needs in investment-grade marketable debt securities, including government or government sponsored agencies and corporate debt securities.
certain of these investments, with an original maturity of greater than three months, will be classified as available-for-sale in accordance with relevant accounting standards. available-for-sale investments are carried at their fair values with unrealized gains and losses, reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income. realized gains and losses, and declines in value deemed to be other-than-temporary on available-for-sale investments, are recognized currently in earnings. we do not have any investments classified as held-to-maturity or trading.
during the years ended december 31, 2014 and 2012, we repurchased 3,231,484 shares and 416,858 shares, respectively, of our outstanding common stock at a cost of $645 million and $53 million, respectively. these repurchases were completed under a stock repurchase plan authorized by our board of directors. the shares repurchased are held in treasury stock. we did not repurchase any shares during the year ended december 31, 2013. as of december 31, 2014, the remaining board authorization permits repurchases of up to $405 million of our common stock with no fixed expiration date.
60
in september 2014, we entered into a rule 10b5-1 trading plan permitting open market repurchases of our common stock based on certain parameters described in the trading plan. we expect to fund any remaining share repurchases with a combination of cash on hand, future cash flows and by borrowing under our credit facilities and our commercial paper program. the timing and extent of any future repurchases that are not made pursuant to the trading plan under rule 10b5-1 are at our discretion and will depend upon market conditions, amount authorized by our board of directors, our stock price, our target debt ratio and corporate debt rating, and our strategic growth initiatives at that time. we may discontinue the stock repurchases at any time or may enter into a new rule 10b5-1 trading plan in the future. in addition, our board of directors may increase or decrease the amount of capacity we have for repurchases from time to time.

operating activities net cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations primarily consists of net income adjusted for certain non-cash items, including depreciation and amortization and the effects of changes in working capital. fluctuations in net cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations is primarily attributable to increases and decreases in our net income between periods and, to a lesser extent, due to fluctuations in working capital. the $749 million increase in net cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations for the year ended december 31, 2014, from the comparable period in 2013, is primarily due to the $685 million increase in our net income from continuing operations, primarily relating to the increase of $435 million in net income from the inclusion of nyse ($465 million in nyse net income from continuing operations for the year ended december 31, 2014 versus $30 million in nyse net income from continuing operations for the period from november 13, 2013 to december 31, 2013). see "- consolidated financial highlights" above.

we had net increases in restricted cash and investments of $161 million, $75 million and $32 million for the years ended december 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. the restricted cash increase in 2014 primarily related to a contribution to the ice clear u.s. guaranty fund as of january 1, 2014 in connection with ice clear u.s.'s status as a qccp, cash escrow set aside for the superderivatives acquisition, regulatory capital from hch after our acquisition, and increases in the regulatory capital of ice clear europe and ice futures europe due to additional costs incurred at both of these companies due to growth of these businesses. the restricted cash increase in 2013 primarily related to increases in the regulatory capital of ice futures europe, ice clear europe and ice futures u.s., resulting from adjustments to the regulatory capital calculations to no longer allow for certain deductions in the
61
calculations of the six months of operating expenditures. the restricted cash increase in 2012 primarily related to mandated changes in the calculations of regulatory capital at ice futures europe and ice clear europe as well as additional costs incurred at both of these companies due to growth of these businesses.

62
the cash portion of the purchase price for our acquisition of nyse while the remaining $500 million was used to pay off the outstanding commercial paper obligations of nyse, as well as to fund certain deal related fees and expenses. in december 2013, we repaid the $900 million borrowed under the revolving facility with the proceeds from the issuance of commercial paper and with cash on hand. in connection with us entering into the 2014 credit facility on april 3, 2014, the 2011 credit facilities were terminated and the $367 million outstanding under the term loan facility was repaid through the issuance of new commercial paper.

senior notes in october 2013, we issued $600 million aggregate principal amount of 2.50% senior unsecured fixed rate notes due october 2018, or the 2018 senior notes, and $800 million aggregate principal amount of 4.00% senior unsecured fixed rate notes due october 2023, or the 2023 senior notes, together with the 2018 senior notes, the senior notes. we used the net proceeds from the senior notes offering to finance, together with cash on hand and $400 million borrowed in october 2013 under the revolving facility, the $2.7 billion cash portion of the purchase price of the acquisition of nyse.
nyse notes in connection with the acquisition of nyse, we assumed the outstanding nyse debt instruments, which included $850 million of 2.0% senior unsecured fixed rate notes due in october 2017, or the nyse usd notes, and €920 million ($1.1 billion) of 5.375% senior unsecured fixed rate notes due in june 2015, or the nyse eur notes, and together with the nyse usd notes, the nyse notes. upon closing of the euronext ipo, we elected to set aside sufficient euro-denominated cash from the proceeds to effectively pre-fund the maturity of the nyse eur notes and the related final interest coupon payment, both due on june 30, 2015. in connection with this, in july 2014, we placed €969 million ($1.2 billion) of the cash proceeds from the euronext ipo in term deposits at various banks each with a maturity date of june 25, 2015 to cover the €920 million ($1.1 billion) principal and the €49 million ($60 million) final interest coupon payment due on june 30, 2015. these deposits are classified as short-term investments in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet as of december 31, 2014. the balance of the cash proceeds received in connection with the euronext ipo were converted to u.s. dollars and used to repay outstanding commercial paper.
commercial paper program in december 2013, we entered into a u.s. dollar commercial paper program, or the commercial paper program. the commercial paper program is currently backed by the borrowing capacity available under the 2014 credit facility, equal to the amount of the commercial paper that is issued and outstanding at any given point in time. the effective interest rate of commercial paper issuances does not materially differ from short term interest rates (such as usd libor). the fluctuation of these rates due to market conditions may impact our interest expense. as of december 31, 2014, the weighted average interest rate on the $905 million outstanding under the commercial paper program was 0.26% per annum, with a weighted average maturity of 24 days.
we used the net proceeds from the notes issued under the commercial paper program, along with cash on hand, to repay the $900 million borrowed under the revolving facility and the $450 million borrowed under the 364 day facility during the year ended december 31, 2013. we used net proceeds from notes issued under the commercial paper program during the year ended december 31, 2014 to repay the $367 million that was outstanding under the term loan facility upon termination of the term loan facility in april 2014, to fund certain of our acquisitions, and to repurchase our common stock during the year ended december 31, 2014. we repaid a portion of the amounts outstanding under the commercial paper program during the year ended december 31, 2014 using a

combination of the cash proceeds received from the ipo and sale of euronext, the sale of nyse technologies and cash flows from operations.
guarantees in connection with our acquisition of nyse on november 13, 2013, ice, intercontinental exchange holdings, inc. and nyse established various guarantees to protect against structural subordination of each entities' existing indebtedness. each of intercontinental exchange holdings, inc. and nyse are our wholly-owned subsidiaries, and each fully and unconditionally guaranteed, on an unsecured and unsubordinated basis, the payment of principal, premium, if any, and interest of ice's senior notes and, following its establishment, the commercial paper program. similarly, ice and intercontinental exchange holdings, inc. each fully and unconditionally guaranteed, on an unsecured and unsubordinated basis, the payment of principal, premium, if any, and interest of the nyse notes. finally, ice and nyse each fully and unconditionally guaranteed, on an unsecured and unsubordinated basis, the payment of principal, premium, if any, and interest of the 2011 credit facilities and the 364 day facility. all of the guarantees are joint and several with all other guarantees and indebtedness. ice's guarantees, as a standalone entity, will remain in place until each applicable debt obligation has been satisfied.
upon the termination of the 2011 credit facilities and the 364 day facility, intercontinental exchange holdings, inc.'s guarantees were no longer required and therefore intercontinental exchange holdings, inc.'s guarantees were automatically released in accordance with their terms on april 3, 2014. in connection with our entry into the 2014 credit facility, nyse agreed to guarantee the 2014 credit facility as a subsidiary guarantor. for as long as nyse remains a guarantor of the 2014 credit facility, it will remain a guarantor of the senior notes and the commercial paper program. we expect that nyse's guarantee of the 2014 credit facility, the senior notes and the commercial paper program will be released when the nyse notes have been repaid, as the 2014 credit facility provides that nyse's guarantee will be released in accordance with their terms if certain conditions are satisfied, including compliance with the covenant limiting the amount of indebtedness of non-obligor subsidiaries and an investment-grade credit rating.
committed repo to provide a tool to liquidate margin and guaranty fund deposits held in the form of high quality sovereign debt, ice clear europe, ice clear credit and ice clear u.s. have entered into committed repurchase agreement facilities, or committed repo. each of these clearing houses is seeking to increase both the amount and the number of counterparties to its existing committed repo facilities. as of december 31, 2014, ice clear europe had $350 million in committed repo, ice clear credit had $100 million and ice clear u.s. had $200 million. as of january 9, 2015, ice clear europe increased its committed repo to $450 million and ice clear u.s. increased its committed repo to $250 million. the ice clear europe committed repo is available in u.s. dollars, euro and pound sterling, the ice clear credit committed repo is available in u.s. dollars and euro and the ice clear u.s. committed repo is available in u.s. dollars.
the committed repo arrangements provide these three clearing houses with an additional liquidity tool that may be utilized in the event there is a need to convert high quality sovereign debt into cash on a same-day basis during a market disruption that makes it difficult to sell and settle such sovereign debt on a same-day basis.
multicurrency payment facility ice clear u.s. requires its clearing members to meet non-u.s. dollar payment obligations in the currency of the obligation. ice clear u.s. also accepts foreign currencies as collateral to satisfy original margin requirements for those contracts which are denominated in a foreign currency. in addition, in order to meet its obligation to make settlement payments in all relevant currencies, ice clear u.s. uses its own capital to purchase the relevant foreign currencies as determined by its daily liquidity calculations. in the event a clearing member were to fail to make payment in a non-usd currency, ice clear u.s. will use the applicable foreign currency posted to satisfy original margin requirements in addition to the applicable foreign currency held by ice clear u.s. in order to meet its settlement obligations in such currency.
future capital requirements our future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including the rate of our trading and clearing volume growth, strategic plans and acquisitions, required technology and clearing initiatives, regulatory requirements, the timing and introduction of new products and enhancements to existing products, the geographic mix of our business, and the continuing market acceptance of our electronic trading and clearing platforms. we currently expect to make aggregate operational capital expenditures and to incur capitalized software development costs ranging between $165 million and $175 million for the year ended december 31, 2015, which we believe will support the enhancement of our technology and the continued expansion of our businesses. in addition, we currently expect between $70 million to $80 million in capital expenditures during 2015, on leasehold improvement expenditures, primarily associated with our nyse headquarters in new york.

our board of directors has adopted a quarterly dividend declaration policy providing that the declaration of any dividends will be determined quarterly by the board or audit committee of the board of directors taking into account such factors as our evolving business model, prevailing business conditions and our financial results and capital requirements, without a predetermined annual net income payout ratio. during the year ended december 31, 2014, we paid a quarterly dividend of $0.65 per share per quarter of our common stock for an aggregate payout of $299 million, which includes the payment of dividend equivalents. on february 5, 2015, we announced a $0.65 per share dividend for the first quarter of 2015 with the dividend payable on march 31, 2015 to shareholders of record as of march 17, 2015 (the ex-dividend date will be march 13, 2015).
as of december 31, 2014, we had $4.3 billion in outstanding debt. we currently have $3.0 billion available for borrowing under our 2014 credit facility. after factoring in the $905 million currently required to backstop the commercial paper program and the $303 million reserved for our clearing houses as discussed above, $1.8 billion of our 2014 credit facility is currently available for general corporate purposes. see "- debt" above.
the 2014 credit facility and the commercial paper program are currently the only significant agreements or arrangements that we have with third parties for liquidity and capital resources. in the event of any strategic acquisitions, mergers or investments, or if we are required to raise capital for any reason or desire to return capital to our stockholders, we may incur additional debt, issue additional equity to raise the necessary funds, repurchase additional shares of our common stock or pay a dividend. however, we cannot provide assurance that such financing or transactions will be available or successful, or that the terms of such financing or transactions will be favorable to us. we have used and intend to use the cash proceeds from the euronext ipo to repay debt. we have used the net cash proceeds from the sales of nyfix, metabit and wombat to invest in growth initiatives, pursue strategic investments, return capital to shareholders via dividends and share repurchases and repay debt. see "- recent developments" above.
in connection with our acquisition of nyse, we assumed nyse's pension plans covering its u.s. and certain european operations. the benefit accrual for the u.s. operations pension plan is frozen. following the euronext ipo in june 2014, there are no longer any nyse european operations covered by the pension plans. during the year ended december 31, 2014, we contributed $51 million to our pension plans. our practice is to fund our frozen defined benefit pension plan each year at a level above the minimum required contribution but within tax deductible limits. based on actuarial projections, we estimate that a contribution of $10 million in 2015 will allow us to meet our funding goal. however, the actual contribution is contingent on the actual plan performance relative to assumptions.
prior to our acquisition, nyse completed the sale of a significant equity interest in nyse amex options, one of its two u.s. options exchanges, to seven external investors. under the terms of the sale, the external investors have the option to require us to repurchase a portion of its equity interest on an annual basis over the course of five years, which began in 2011. we currently own 84% of nyse amex options and the remaining 16% of the outstanding shares of nyse amex options, currently valued at $125 million, can be put back to us by the external investors in 2015 and these shares are recorded as redeemable non-controlling interest as of december 31, 2014.
we are obligated to contribute an aggregate of $100 million to the ice clear credit guaranty fund and the ice clear europe cds guaranty fund and have already contributed $50 million to the ice clear credit guaranty fund and $28 million to the ice clear europe cds guaranty fund as of december 31, 2014. we are obligated to contribute an additional $22 million to the ice clear europe cds guaranty fund as of october 7, 2015, two years from the launch of cds client clearing at ice clear europe.
we own ice futures europe, and in connection with the nyse acquisition, liffe administration and management, or liffe, both of which operate as u.k. recognized investment exchanges. as u.k. recognized investment exchanges, ice futures europe and liffe are required by the financial conduct authority in the united kingdom to restrict the use of the equivalent of six months of operating expenditures, subject to certain deductions, in cash or cash equivalents or investments at all times. as of december 31, 2014 the regulatory capital for ice futures europe and liffe was $57 million and $114 million, respectively. such amounts are reflected as short-term restricted cash and investments in the consolidated balance sheet as of december 31, 2014. in november 2014, we completed the transition of liffe's contracts to ice futures europe. while liffe still has a regulated status, we expect to apply for a de-recognition order in 2015, which will result in the release of the $114 million in regulatory capital and an increase in our cash and cash equivalents. at this time, we do not expect the regulatory capital at ice futures europe to increase during 2015 from $57 million as this balance already takes into account the higher post-liffe migration cost base.
as a u.k. recognized clearing house, ice clear europe is required by the bank of england in the united kingdom to restrict the use of the equivalent of six months of operating expenditures, subject to certain deductions, in cash or cash equivalents or investments at all times. as of december 31, 2014, this amount for ice clear europe was $87 million and is reflected as short-term restricted cash and investments in the consolidated balance sheet as of december 31, 2014. when emir becomes effective, which is currently anticipated during the first half of 2015, the bank of england restricted cash capital requirements for ice clear europe will be superseded by the emir capital requirements, which would require an increase in the liquid regulatory capital requirements of $136 million. we also expect ice clear europe's regulatory capital to increase by an additional $45 million to $50 million during the second quarter of 2015 in connection with the growth of our clearing business and costs at ice clear europe. these regulatory capital increases will be satisfied by way of additional restricted cash through our cash on hand.

in connection with our acquisition of nyse, we obtained a 40% ownership in occ. occ serves as a clearing house for securities options, security futures, commodity futures and options on futures traded on various independent exchanges. occ clears securities options traded on nyse arca and nyse mkt. occ is regulated by the sec as a registered clearing agency and by the cftc as a derivatives clearing organization. occ is developing a new capital plan, which is scheduled to be finalized during the first quarter of 2015, subject to regulatory and occ shareholders' approvals, which would potentially raise $150 million in equity capital from occ's shareholders, including $60 million to be contributed by nyse. in exchange for the equity capital from its shareholders, occ would, subject to determination by its board of directors and compliance with legal requirements, commit to pay an annual dividend to its shareholders equal to the after-tax income of occ, in excess of the amount required to maintain its target capital requirement and satisfy other capital requirements, and after refunds to its clearing members equal to 50% of distributable earnings before tax. in addition, under the occ new capital plan, the occ shareholders would commit to contribute up to $200 million in additional equity capital if certain capital thresholds are breached, including up to $80 million to be contributed by nyse. unless and until such $200 million capital contribution is repaid to the shareholders, occ would not declare any dividends and would not pay refunds to its clearing members. see "- non-operating income (expenses)" above.
non-u.s. gaap financial measures we use non-u.s. gaap measures internally to evaluate our performance and in making financial and operational decisions. when viewed in conjunction with our u.s. gaap results and the accompanying reconciliation, we believe that our presentation of these measures provides investors with greater transparency and a greater understanding of factors affecting our financial condition and results of operations than u.s. gaap measures alone. in addition, we believe the presentation of these measures is useful to investors for period-to-period comparison of results because the items described below are not reflective of our core business performance. these financial measures are not in accordance with, or an alternative to, u.s. gaap financial measures and may be different from non-u.s. gaap measures used by other companies. we use these adjusted results because we believe they more clearly highlight trends in our business that may not otherwise be apparent when relying solely on u.s. gaap financial measures, since these measures eliminate from our results specific financial items that have less bearing on our core operating performance. we strongly recommend that investors review the u.s. gaap financial measures included in this annual report on form 10-k, including our consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto.
adjusted total operating expenses, adjusted operating income, adjusted operating margin, adjusted income from continuing operations, adjusted net income attributable to ice and adjusted earnings per share for the periods presented below are calculated by adding or subtracting the adjustments described below, which are not reflective of our cash operations and core business performance, and their related income tax effect (in millions, except per share amounts):

we have excluded from the contractual obligations and commercial commitments table above $47.5 billion in cash margin deposits and guaranty fund liabilities. clearing members of ice clear europe, ice clear u.s., ice clear credit, ice clear canada, tcc and hch are required to deposit original margin and variation margin and to make deposits to a guaranty fund. the cash deposits made to these margin accounts and to the guaranty fund are recorded in the consolidated balance sheet as current assets with corresponding current liabilities to the clearing members that deposited them. see note 12 to our consolidated financial statements and related notes that are included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10-k for additional information on our clearing houses and the margin deposits and guaranty funds' liabilities.
we have also excluded unrecognized tax benefits, or utbs, from the contractual obligations and commercial commitments table above. as of december 31, 2014, our cumulative utbs were $145 million. interest and penalties related to utbs were $45 million as of december 31, 2014. we are under continuous examination by various tax authorities. we are unable to make a reasonable estimate of the periods of cash settlement because it is not possible to reasonably predict, the amount of tax, interest and penalties, if any, that might be assessed by a tax authority or the timing of an assessment or payment. it is also not possible to reasonably predict whether or not the applicable statutes of limitations might expire without us being examined by any particular tax authority. see note 11 to our consolidated financial statements and related notes that are included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10-k for additional information on our utbs.

as of december 31, 2014, in connection with our acquisition of nyse, we have obligations related to our pension and other benefit programs. the date of payment under these obligations cannot be determined and have been excluded from the table above. see note 14 to our consolidated financial statements and related notes that are included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10-k for additional information on our pension and other benefit programs.
prior to our acquisition, nyse completed the sale of a significant equity interest in nyse amex options, one of its two u.s. options exchanges, to seven external investors. under the terms of the sale, the external investors have the option to require us to repurchase a portion of their equity interest on an annual basis over the course of five years, which began in 2011. since the likelihood of us acquiring the non-controlling interest in the future is probable, the full redemption fair value has been recorded as mezzanine equity and we have classified the related balance as "redeemable non-controlling interest" in our consolidated balance sheet. we currently own 84% of nyse amex options and the remaining 16% of the outstanding shares of nyse amex options, currently valued at $125 million, can be put back to us by the external investors in 2015 and these shares are recorded as redeemable non-controlling interest as of december 31, 2014. however, we cannot estimate whether the external investors will elect to exercise their remaining put options and it has been excluded from the table above. see note 13 to our consolidated financial statements and related notes that are included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10-k for additional information on the redeemable non-controlling interest.
in connection with our acquisition of nyse, we obtained a 40% ownership in occ. occ is developing a new capital plan, which is scheduled to be finalized during the first quarter of 2015, subject to occ's regulatory and occ shareholders' approvals, which would potentially raise $150 million in equity capital from occ's shareholders, including $60 million to be contributed by nyse. in addition, under the occ new capital plan, the occ shareholders would commit to contribute up to $200 million in additional equity capital if certain capital thresholds are breached, including up to $80 million to be contributed by nyse. however, we cannot estimate whether the occ new capital plan will be approved and for how much and the $60 million initial contribution and the potential $80 million additional contribution from us has been excluded from the table above. see "- future capital requirements" above.
new and recently adopted accounting pronouncements refer to note 2 to our consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10-k for information on the new and recently adopted accounting pronouncements that are applicable to us.
critical accounting policies we have identified the policies below as critical to our business operations and the understanding of our results of operations. the impact of, and any associated risks related to, these policies on our business operations is discussed throughout "management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations". for a detailed discussion on the application of these and other accounting policies, see note 2 to our consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10-k. our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with u.s. gaap. the preparation of financial statements in conformity with these accounting principles requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities, and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities, at the date of our financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.
we evaluate our estimates and judgments on an ongoing basis, including those related to the accounting matters described below. we base our estimates and judgments on our historical experience and other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances when we make these estimates and judgments. based on these factors, we make estimates and judgments about, among other things, the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from market prices or other independent sources and about the recognition and characterization of our revenues and expenses. the values and results based on these estimates and judgments could differ significantly under different assumptions or conditions and could change materially in the future.
we believe that the following critical accounting policies, among others, affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements and could materially increase or decrease our reported results, assets and liabilities.
goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets we have significant intangible assets related to goodwill and other acquired intangible assets. in connection with our acquisitions, assets acquired and liabilities assumed are recorded at their estimated fair values. goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price of our acquisitions over the fair value of identifiable net assets acquired, including other identified intangible assets. we recognize specifically identifiable intangibles when a specific right or contract is acquired. our determination of the fair value of the intangible assets and whether or not these assets are impaired requires us to make significant judgments and requires us to use
69
significant estimates and assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows. if we change our strategy or if market conditions shift, our judgments may change, which may result in adjustments to recorded asset balances. as of december 31, 2014, we had goodwill of $8.5 billion and net other intangible assets of $7.8 billion relating to our acquisitions, our purchase of trademarks and internet domain names from various third parties, and the russell licensing agreement. of these amounts, $6.1 billion in goodwill and $7.0 billion of other intangible assets relates to our acquisition of nyse on november 13, 2013. we do not amortize goodwill or other intangible assets with indefinite useful lives. intangible assets with finite useful lives are amortized over their estimated useful lives.
in performing the purchase price allocation, we consider, among other factors, the intended future use of acquired assets, analysis of historical financial performance and estimates of future performance of the acquired business. at the acquisition date, a preliminary allocation of the purchase price is recorded based upon a preliminary valuation. we continue to review and validate estimates, assumptions and valuation methodologies underlying the preliminary valuation during the measurement period. accordingly, these estimates and assumptions are subject to change, which could have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. the measurement period ends as soon as we receive the information about facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date or we learn that more information is not obtainable, which usually does not exceed one year from the date of acquisition.
our goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets are evaluated for impairment annually in our fiscal fourth quarter or more frequently if conditions exist that indicate that the value may be impaired. we test our goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level. these impairment evaluations are performed by comparing the carrying value of the goodwill reporting unit or other indefinite-lived intangibles to its estimated fair value. we allocate goodwill to reporting units based on the reporting unit expected to benefit from the business combination. subsequent to our acquisition of nyse, we identified five reporting units: our futures reporting unit, our cds reporting unit, our cash listings reporting unit, our euronext reporting unit and our technology reporting unit. the cash listings, euronext and technology reporting units were added as part of our nyse acquisition on november 13, 2013. as a result of the ipo of euronext and the sale of nyse technologies during the year ended december 31, 2014, we currently have three reporting units: our futures reporting unit, our cds reporting unit and our cash listings reporting unit.
goodwill impairment testing consists of a two-step methodology. the initial step requires us to determine the fair value of each reporting unit and compare it to the carrying value, including goodwill and other intangible assets, of such reporting unit. if the fair value exceeds the carrying value, no impairment loss is recognized and the second step, which is a calculation of the impairment, is not performed. however, if the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value, an impairment charge is recorded equal to the extent that the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value. for annual goodwill impairment testing, we have the option to first perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, including goodwill and other intangible assets. if we conclude that this is the case, we must perform the two-step methodology described above. otherwise, we can skip the two-step methodology and do not need to perform any further testing. for annual indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment testing, we also have the option to first perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible assets is less than its carrying amount.
application of the impairment test requires judgment, including the identification of reporting units, assignment of assets and liabilities to reporting units, assignment of goodwill to reporting units, and determination of the fair value of each reporting unit. we have historically determined the fair value of our reporting units based on various valuation techniques, including discounted cash flow analysis and a multiple of earnings approach. in assessing whether goodwill and other intangible assets are impaired, we must make estimates and assumptions regarding future cash flows, long-term growth rates of our business, operating margins, discount rates, weighted average cost of capital and other factors to determine the fair value of our assets. these estimates and assumptions require management's judgment, and changes to these estimates and assumptions, as a result of changing economic and competitive conditions, could materially affect the determination of fair value and/or impairment. the cash flows employed in the discounted cash flow analysis are based on our most recent budgets and business plans and, when applicable, various growth rates have been assumed for years beyond the current business plan period. future events could cause us to conclude that indicators of impairment exist for goodwill or other intangible assets. impairment may result from, among other things, deterioration in the performance of our business, adverse market conditions, adverse changes in applicable laws and regulations, competition, or the sale or disposition of a reporting unit. any resulting impairment loss could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations.
our impairment analysis has not resulted in any impairment of goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets through december 31, 2014. among our reporting units, the fair value of our cds reporting unit has been the closest to its carrying value in prior goodwill impairment analyses. our cds reporting unit includes the financial results and net assets of creditex, ice clear credit and the cds clearing business at ice clear europe. cds trade execution revenues at creditex have decreased the last several years. the cds execution business remains pressured due to financial reform implementation and a general lack of volatility in the corporate credit markets. however, the decline in cds trading revenues was offset by an increase in ice cds clearing, the listing of additional cleared cds products, and signing on new clearing members, along with a decrease in expenses at creditex. also, with the advent of mandatory clearing during 2013, cds clearing activity by investment funds, asset managers, and similar buy side market participants has increased significantly.

during the first step of the cds impairment review in the fourth quarter of 2014, we performed a discounted cash flow valuation to estimate the fair value of our cds reporting unit. the valuation of our cds reporting unit concluded that the fair value exceeded carrying value by $751 million, or 132% of the carrying value in the fourth quarter of 2014. as of december 31, 2014, the cds goodwill and other intangible assets balances were $476 million. the discount rate used in the cds discounted cash flow valuation is intended to reflect the risks inherent in the future cash flows of the cds reporting unit and was 9.2% in the fourth quarter 2014 review. a 10 basis point increase in the discount rate used would not have a material impact on our fair value of the cds reporting unit. a 10% decrease in the estimated discounted cash flows for the cds reporting unit would result in the fair value of the reporting unit exceeding the carrying value by $548 million.
given the current market conditions and continued economic and regulatory uncertainty, the fair value of our cds reporting unit may deteriorate and could result in the need to record an impairment charge in future periods. we continue to monitor potential triggering events in our cds reporting unit, including changes in the business and regulatory climate in which it operates, the current volatility in the capital markets, our recent operating performance and our financial projections. any changes in these factors could result in an impairment charge.
we are also required to evaluate other finite-lived intangible assets and property and equipment for impairment by determining whether events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of these assets to be held and used may not be recoverable. if impairment indicators are present, then an estimate of undiscounted future cash flows produced by these long-lived assets is compared to the carrying value of those assets to determine if the asset is recoverable. if an asset is not recoverable, the loss is measured as the difference between fair value and carrying value of the impaired asset. fair value of these assets is based on various valuation techniques, including discounted cash flow analysis. our evaluation has not resulted in any impairment of other finite-lived intangible assets and property and equipment through december 31, 2014.
income taxes we are subject to income taxes in the united states and other foreign jurisdictions where we operate. the determination of our provision for income taxes and related accruals, deferred tax assets and liabilities requires significant judgment, the use of estimates, and the interpretation and application of complex tax laws. we recognize a current tax liability or tax asset for the estimated taxes payable or refundable on tax returns for the current year. we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax bases of our assets and liabilities. we establish valuation allowances if we believe that it is more likely than not that some or all of our deferred tax assets will not be realized. deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using current enacted tax rates in effect for the years in which those temporary differences and carryforwards are expected to reverse.
we do not recognize a tax benefit unless we conclude that it is more likely than not that the benefit will be sustained on audit by the taxing authority based solely on the technical merits of the associated tax position. if the recognition threshold is met, we recognize a tax benefit measured at the largest amount of the tax benefit that, in our judgment, is greater than 50 percent likely to be realized. we recognize accrued interest and penalties related to uncertain income tax positions as income tax expense in the consolidated statements of income.
the undistributed earnings from our non-u.s. subsidiaries are considered to be indefinitely reinvested and, accordingly, no provision for u.s. federal and state income taxes has been made in our consolidated financial statements. a distribution of these non-u.s. earnings in the form of dividends, or otherwise, could subject us to both u.s. federal and state income taxes, as adjusted for non-u.s. tax credits, and withholding taxes payable to the various non-u.s. countries. determination of the amount of any unrecognized deferred income tax liability on these undistributed earnings is not practicable.
we operate within multiple domestic and foreign taxing jurisdictions and are subject to audit in these jurisdictions by domestic and foreign tax authorities. these audits include questions regarding our tax filing positions, including the timing and amount of deductions taken and the allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions. we record accruals for the estimated outcomes of these audits, and the accruals may change in the future due to new developments in each matter. at any point in time, many tax years are subject to or in the process of being audited by various taxing authorities. to the extent our estimates of settlements change or the final tax outcome of these matters is different from the amounts recorded, such differences will impact the income tax provision in the period in which such determinations are made. our income tax expense includes changes in our estimated liability for exposures associated with our various tax filing positions. determining the income tax expense for these potential assessments requires management to make assumptions that are subject to factors such as proposed assessments by tax authorities, changes in facts and circumstances, issuance of new regulations, and resolution of tax audits.
we believe the judgments and estimates discussed above are reasonable. however, if actual results are not consistent with our estimates or assumptions, we may be exposed to losses or gains that could be material.
71
pension and other post-retirement employee benefits in connection with our acquisition of nyse, we assumed nyse's pension plans and other post-retirement employee benefit plans covering its u.s. and certain european operations. following the euronext ipo in june 2014, there are no longer any nyse european operations covered by the pensions plans and other post-retirement employee benefit plans. pension and other post-retirement employee benefits costs and liabilities are dependent on assumptions used in calculating such amounts. these assumptions include discount rates to measure future obligation and interest expense, mortality rates, health care cost trend rates, benefits earned, interest cost, expected return on assets, and other factors. in accordance with u.s. gaap, actual results that differ from the assumptions are accumulated and amortized over future periods and, therefore, generally affect recognized expense and the recorded obligation in future periods. while we believe that the assumptions used are appropriate, differences in actual experience or changes in assumptions may affect our pension and other post-retirement obligations and future expense.
item 7 (a).     quantitative    and qualitative disclosures about market risk as a result of our operating and financing activities, we are exposed to market risks such as interest rate risk, foreign currency exchange rate risk and credit risk. we have implemented policies and procedures designed to measure, manage, monitor and report risk exposures, which are regularly reviewed by the appropriate management and supervisory bodies.
interest rate risk we have exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relating to our cash and cash equivalents, short-term and long-term investments, short-term and long-term restricted cash and investments, and indebtedness. as of december 31, 2014 and 2013, our cash and cash equivalents, short-term and long-term investments and short-term and long-term restricted cash and investments were $2.9 billion and $1.8 billion, respectively, of which $1.9 billion and $819 million, respectively, were denominated in brazilian reais, pounds sterling, euros or canadian dollars. of the $1.9 billion as of december 31, 2014, €969 million ($1.2 billion) represents euro-denominated cash that was placed in term deposits at various banks with a maturity date of june 25, 2015 to cover the maturity of the nyse euro notes on june 30, 2015. see item 7 "management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations - debt" included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10-k. our investment in cetip, which is recorded as an available-for-sale, long-term investment and was recorded in and is held in brazilian reais, was valued at $379 million as of december 31, 2014, including an unrealized gain of $55 million. changes in the fair value of the cetip investment is reflected in accumulated other comprehensive income and do not impact earnings, except to the extent that unrealized losses are deemed to be other than temporary. the remaining investments are denominated in u.s. dollars. we do not use our investment portfolio for trading or other speculative purposes. a hypothetical decrease in long-term interest rates to zero basis points would decrease annual pre-tax earnings by $3 million as of december 31, 2014, assuming no change in the amount or composition of our cash and cash equivalents, short-term and long-term investments and short-term and long-term restricted cash and investments.
as of december 31, 2014, we had $4.3 billion in outstanding debt, of which $1.4 billion relates to the senior notes and $2.0 billion relates to the nyse notes, both of which bear interest at fixed interest rates. the remaining amount outstanding of $905 million relates to the commercial paper program, which bears interest at fluctuating rates and, therefore, subjects us to interest rate risk. a hypothetical 100 basis point increase in interest rates relating to the amounts outstanding under the commercial paper program as of december 31, 2014 would decrease annual pre-tax earnings by $9 million, assuming no change in the volume or composition of our outstanding indebtedness and no hedging activity. the interest rates on our commercial paper program are currently reset on a daily, weekly or monthly basis. see item 7 "management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations - debt" included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10-k.
foreign currency exchange rate risk as an international business, we are subject to foreign currency exchange rate risk. we may experience gains or losses from foreign currency transactions in the future given that a significant part of our assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses are recorded in euros or pounds sterling. certain assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses of foreign subsidiaries are denominated in the local functional currency of such subsidiaries.

nyse, which we acquired in november 2013, has a significant part of its assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses recorded in pounds sterling or euros. for the year ended december 31, 2014, 19% of our consolidated revenues, less transaction-based expenses, were denominated in pounds sterling or euros, and 18% of our consolidated expenses were denominated in pounds sterling or euros, respectively. these percentages do not include the euronext revenues and expenses, as they are included in discontinued operations. as the pound sterling or euro exchange rate changes, the u.s. equivalent of revenues and expenses denominated in foreign currencies changes accordingly.
we have foreign currency transaction risk related to the settlement of foreign currency denominated assets, liabilities and payables that occur through our operations, which are received in or paid in pounds sterling or euros, due to the increase or decrease in the foreign currency exchange rates between periods. we had foreign currency transaction losses of $2 million, $2 million and $4 million for the years ended december 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively, primarily attributable to the fluctuations of the pound sterling and euro relative to the u.s. dollar, which strengthened. a 10% adverse change in the underlying foreign currency exchange rates as of december 31, 2014 would result in a foreign currency transaction loss of $6 million, assuming no change in the composition of the foreign currency denominated assets, liabilities and payables and assuming no hedging activity.
we entered into foreign currency hedging transactions during the years ended december 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012 as economic hedges to hedge a portion of our foreign currency transaction exposure and may enter into additional hedging transactions in the future to help mitigate our foreign exchange risk exposure.
we have foreign currency translation risk equal to our net investment in our foreign subsidiaries. the financial statements of these subsidiaries are translated into u.s. dollars using a current rate of exchange, with gains or losses included in the cumulative translation adjustment account, a component of equity. our exposure to the net investment in foreign currencies is presented by primary foreign currencies in the table below (in millions):

the nyse eur notes of €920 million ($1.1 billion) no longer constitute a partial hedge of nyse's net euro investment in foreign entities following the ipo of euronext. the transaction gain or loss from the revaluation of the nyse eur notes on the u.s. dollar balance sheet of nyse holdings llc will be offset by the transaction gain or loss from the cash held in euros to repay the notes upon their maturity in june 2015, as discussed above.

as of december 31, 2014 and 2013, the portion of our equity attributable to accumulated other comprehensive income from foreign currency translation was $13 million and $143 million, respectively. as of december 31, 2014, we had net exposure of euro and pounds sterling of €601 million ($731 million) and £2.1 billion ($3.2 billion), respectively. based on december 31, 2014 net currency positions, a hypothetical 10% decrease of euro against u.s. dollar would negatively impact our equity by $73 million and a hypothetical 10% decrease of pound sterling against u.s. dollar would negatively impact our equity by $325 million. for the year ended december 31, 2014, currency exchange rate differences had a negative impact of $130 million on our consolidated equity.
credit risk we are exposed to credit risk in our operations in the event of a counterparty default. we limit our exposure to credit risk by rigorously selecting the counterparties with which we make our investments and execute agreements. credit risk is monitored by using exposure limits depending on ratings assigned by rating agencies as well as the nature and maturity of transactions. our investment objective is to invest in securities that preserve principal while maximizing yields, without significantly increasing risk. we seek to substantially mitigate credit risk associated with investments by ensuring that these financial assets are placed with governments, well-capitalized financial institutions and other creditworthy counterparties.
an ongoing review is performed to evaluate changes in the status of counterparties. in addition to the intrinsic creditworthiness of counterparties, our policies require diversification of counterparties (banks, financial institutions, bond issuers and funds) so as to avoid a concentration of risk.
clearing house cash deposits credit risk our clearing houses hold material amounts of clearing member cash deposits which are invested primarily to provide security of capital, but also which may generate interest income for our clearing members. refer to note 12 to our consolidated financial statements and related notes, which are included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10-k, for more information on the clearing houses cash deposits, which were $47.5 billion as of december 31, 2014. the following is a summary of the risks associated with this investment activity and how these risks are mitigated.
interest rate risk interest rate risk is the risk that interest rates rise causing the value of the purchased security to decline. if we were required to sell the security prior to its maturity, and interest rates had risen, the sale of the security might be made at a loss relative to its original purchase price. our clearing houses seek to manage this risk by making all of our cash deposit investments in sovereign debt reverse repurchase agreements that mature within 1 to 37 days. our clearing house investment guidelines require that a minimum of 50% of clearing member cash deposits are invested in sovereign debt reverse repurchase agreements that mature within one business day. efforts are made to invest the remaining 50% in sovereign debt reverse repurchase agreements that mature within 37 business days. if this is not possible, our policy allows for the investment of up to 50% of clearing member cash deposits in high quality sovereign debt (for example, u.s. treasury securities) and supranational debt instruments (euro cash deposits only) with the shortest possible time to maturity provided that no such direct investment in a sovereign debt or supranational instrument will have a time to maturity greater than 397 days (1.09 years).
security issuer risk security issuer risk is the risk that an issuer of a security defaults on its payment when the security matures. this risk is mitigated by investing clearing member cash deposits in high quality sovereign debt reverse repurchase agreements or direct investments in high quality sovereign and supranational debt issues. thus, the risk is mitigated because, in the event of a security issuer default, we are left with a highly marketable, liquid security.
investment counterparty risk investment counterparty risk is the risk that a reverse repurchase agreement counterparty or an investment adviser might become insolvent and, thus, fail to meet its obligations to our clearing houses. we mitigate this risk by only engaging in transactions with high credit quality reverse repurchase agreement counterparties and investment advisors.
when engaging in reverse repurchase agreements, our clearing houses take delivery of the underlying reverse repurchase securities in custody accounts that are under the control of our clearing house. additionally, the securities purchased subject to reverse repurchase have a market value greater than the reverse repurchase amount. the typical haircut received for high quality sovereign debt is 2% of the reverse repurchase amount. thus, in the event that a reverse repurchase counterparty defaults on its obligation to repurchase the underlying reverse repurchase securities, our clearing house will have possession of a security with a value greater than the reverse repurchase counterparty's obligation to our clearing house.
our clearing houses do not hold clearing member cash deposits or the underlying investments with any of our investment advisors. our clearing house property is held in custody accounts controlled by our clearing houses. our clearing houses' property is
74
held with credit worthy custodians which include jpmorgan chase bank n.a., citibank n.a., bny mellon, bmo harris n.a. and euroclear bank brussels (for non-u.s. dollar deposits).
each clearing house employs (or will employ) multiple investment advisors and custodians to ensure that in the event that a single investment adviser or custodian becomes unable to fulfill its role, additional investment advisors or custodians are available as back-ups.
cross-currency margin deposit risk each of our clearing houses, pursuant to their rules, may permit posting of cross-currency collateral to satisfy margin requirements (for example, accepting original margin deposits denominated in u.s. dollars to secure a japanese yen variation margin obligation). the risk exists that the value of the original margin currency provided to satisfy margin obligations declines in value resulting in an inability to make required variation margins in the appropriate currency. this risk is mitigated by applying a "haircut" to the original margin currency at a level sufficiently high enough to weather periods of high currency volatility. cross-currency balances are marked-to-market on a daily basis. should the value of the currency posted to satisfy margin requirements decline in value, the clearing member is required to increase its original margin deposit on a same-day basis.
impact of inflation we have not been adversely affected by inflation as technological advances and competition have generally caused prices for the hardware and software that we use for our electronic platforms to remain constant or to decline. in the event of inflation, we believe that we will be able to pass on any price increases to our participants, as the prices that we charge are not governed by long-term contracts.

item 1a. risk factors.
the quick service restaurant pizza category is highly competitive and such competition could adversely affect our operating results.
in the u.s., we compete against regional and local companies as well as national chains pizza hut®, papa johns® and little caesars pizza®. internationally, we compete primarily with pizza hut®, papa johns® and country-specific national and local pizzerias. we could experience increased competition from existing or new companies in the pizza category which could create increasing pressures to grow our business in order to maintain our market share. if we are unable to maintain our competitive position, we could experience downward pressure on prices, lower demand for our products, reduced margins, the inability to take advantage of new business opportunities and the loss of market share, all of which would have an adverse effect on our operating results and could cause our stock price to decline.
we also compete on a broader scale with quick service and other international, national, regional and local restaurants. the overall food service market and the quick service restaurant sector are intensely competitive with respect to food quality, price, service, image, convenience and concept, and are often affected by changes in:
   consumer tastes;

   international, national, regional or local economic conditions;

   disposable purchasing power;

   demographic trends; and

   currency fluctuations related to international operations.

we compete within the food service market and the quick service restaurant sector not only for customers, but also for management and hourly employees, suitable real estate sites and qualified franchisees. our supply chain segment is also subject to competition from outside suppliers. while over 99% of domestic franchisees purchased food, equipment and supplies from us in 2014, domestic franchisees are not required to purchase food, equipment or supplies from us and they may choose to purchase from outside suppliers. if other suppliers who meet our qualification standards were to offer lower prices or better service to our franchisees for their ingredients and supplies and, as a result, our franchisees chose not to purchase from our domestic supply chain centers, our financial condition, business and results of operations would be adversely affected.
if we fail to successfully implement our growth strategy, which includes opening new domestic and international stores, our ability to increase our revenues and operating profits could be adversely affected.
a significant component of our growth strategy includes the opening of new domestic and international stores. we and our franchisees face many challenges in opening new stores, including, among others:
   availability of financing with acceptable terms;

   selection and availability of suitable store locations;

   negotiation of acceptable lease or financing terms;

   securing required domestic or foreign governmental permits and approvals;

   employment and training of qualified personnel; and

   general economic and business conditions.

the opening of additional franchise stores also depends, in part, upon the availability of prospective franchisees who meet our criteria. our failure to add a significant number of new stores would adversely affect our ability to increase revenues and operating income.
we and our franchisees are currently planning to expand our international operations in many of the markets where we currently operate and in selected new markets. this may require considerable management time as well as start-up expenses for market development before any significant revenues and earnings are generated. operations in new foreign markets may achieve low margins or may be unprofitable, and expansion in existing markets may be affected by local economic and market conditions. therefore, as we expand internationally, we or our franchisees may not experience the operating margins we expect, our results of operations may be negatively impacted and our common stock price may decline.
we may also pursue strategic acquisitions as part of our business. if we are able to identify acquisition candidates, such acquisitions may be financed, to the extent permitted under our debt agreements, with substantial debt or with potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities.
11
the food service market is affected by consumer preferences and perceptions. changes in these preferences and perceptions may lessen the demand for our products, which would reduce sales and harm our business.
food service businesses are affected by changes in consumer tastes, international, national, regional and local economic conditions, and demographic trends. for instance, if prevailing health or dietary preferences cause consumers to avoid pizza and other products we offer in favor of foods that are perceived as more healthy, our business and operating results would be harmed. moreover, because we are primarily dependent on a single product, if consumer demand for pizza should decrease, our business would suffer more than if we had a more diversified menu, as many other food service businesses do.
reports of food-borne illness or food tampering could reduce sales and harm our business.
reports, whether true or not, of food-borne illnesses (such as e. coli, avian flu, bovine spongiform encephalopathy, hepatitis a, trichinosis or salmonella) and injuries caused by food tampering have in the past severely injured the reputations of participants in the qsr sector and could in the future as well. the potential for acts of terrorism on our global food supply also exists and, if such an event occurs, it could have a negative impact on us and could severely hurt sales and profits. in addition, our reputation is an important asset; as a result, anything that damages our reputation could immediately and severely affect our sales and profits. media reports of illnesses and injuries, whether accurate or not, could force some stores to close or otherwise reduce sales at such stores. in addition, reports of food-borne illnesses or food tampering, even those occurring solely at the restaurants of competitors, could, by resulting in negative publicity about the restaurant industry, adversely affect us on a local, regional, national or international basis.
increases in food, labor and other costs could adversely affect our profitability and operating results.
an increase in our operating costs could adversely affect our profitability. factors such as inflation, increased food costs, increased labor and employee health and benefit costs, increased rent costs and increased energy costs may adversely affect our operating costs. most of the factors affecting costs are beyond our control and, in many cases, we may not be able to pass along these increased costs to our customers or franchisees. most ingredients used in our pizza, particularly cheese, are subject to significant price fluctuations as a result of seasonality, weather, demand and other factors. the cheese block price per pound averaged $2.13 in 2014, and the estimated increase in company-owned store food costs from a hypothetical $0.25 adverse change in the average cheese block price per pound would have been approximately $2.2 million in 2014. labor costs are largely a function of the minimum wage for a majority of our store personnel and certain supply chain center personnel and, generally, are also a function of the availability of labor. food, including cheese costs and labor represent approximately 50% to 60% of a typical company-owned stores sales.
we do not have long-term contracts with certain of our suppliers, and as a result they could seek to significantly increase prices or fail to deliver.
we do not have long-term contracts or arrangements with certain of our suppliers. although in the past we have not experienced significant problems with our suppliers, our suppliers may implement significant price increases or may not meet our requirements in a timely fashion, or at all. the occurrence of any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.
shortages or interruptions in the supply or delivery of fresh food products could adversely affect our operating results.
we and our franchisees are dependent on frequent deliveries of fresh food products that meet our specifications. shortages or interruptions in the supply of fresh food products caused by unanticipated demand, problems in production or distribution, financial or other difficulties of suppliers, inclement weather or other conditions could adversely affect the availability, quality and cost of ingredients, which would adversely affect our operating results.
any prolonged disruption in the operations of any of our dough manufacturing and supply chain centers could harm our business.
we operate 16 regional dough manufacturing and supply chain centers, one thin crust manufacturing center and one vegetable processing center in the contiguous united states and a total of seven dough manufacturing and supply chain centers in alaska, hawaii and canada. our domestic dough manufacturing and supply chain centers service all of our company-owned stores and over 99% of our domestic franchise stores. as a result, any prolonged disruption in the operations of any of these facilities, whether due to technical or labor difficulties, destruction or damage to the facility, real estate issues or other reasons, could adversely affect our business and operating results.
12
our success depends in part upon effective advertising, and lower advertising funds may reduce our ability to adequately market the dominos pizza® brand.
we have been routinely named a megabrand by advertising age. each dominos store located in the contiguous united states is obligated to pay a percentage of its sales in advertising fees. in fiscal 2014, each store in the contiguous united states generally was required to contribute 6% of their sales to dnaf (subject, in limited instances, to lower rates based on certain incentives and waivers), which uses such fees for national advertising in addition to contributions for local market-level advertising. we currently anticipate that this 6% contribution rate will remain in place for the foreseeable future. while additional funds for advertising in the past have been provided by us, our franchisees and other third parties, none of these additional funds are legally required. the lack of continued financial support for advertising activities could significantly curtail our marketing efforts, which may in turn materially and adversely affect our business and our operating results.
we face risks of litigation and negative publicity from customers, franchisees, suppliers, employees and others in the ordinary course of business, which can or could divert our financial and management resources. any adverse litigation or publicity may negatively impact our financial condition and results of operations.
claims of illness or injury relating to food quality or food handling are common in the food service industry, and vehicular accidents and injuries occur in the food delivery business. claims within our industry of improper supplier actions have also recently arisen that, if made against one of our suppliers, could potentially damage our brand image. in addition, class action lawsuits have been filed, and may continue to be filed, against various quick service restaurants alleging, among other things, that quick service restaurants have failed to disclose the health risks associated with high-fat foods and that quick service restaurant marketing practices have encouraged obesity. in addition to decreasing our sales and profitability and diverting our management resources, adverse publicity or a substantial judgment against us could negatively impact our financial condition, results of operations and brand reputation, thereby hindering our ability to attract and retain franchisees and grow our business.
further, we may be subject to employee, franchisee and other claims in the future based on, among other things, discrimination, harassment, wrongful termination and wage, rest break and meal break issues, and those claims relating to overtime compensation. we are currently subject to these types of claims and have been subject to these types of claims in the past. if one or more of these claims were to be successful or if there is a significant increase in the number of these claims or if we receive significant negative publicity, our business, financial condition and operating results could be harmed.
loss of key employees or our inability to attract and retain new qualified employees could hurt our business and inhibit our ability to operate and grow successfully.
our success in the highly competitive pizza delivery and carry-out business will continue to depend to a significant extent on our leadership team and other key management personnel. other than with our president and chief executive officer, j. patrick doyle, we do not have long-term employment agreements with any of our executive officers. as a result, we may not be able to retain our executive officers and key personnel or attract additional qualified management. while we do not have long-term employment agreements with our executive officers, for all of our executive officers we have non-compete and non-solicitation agreements that extend for 24 months following the termination of such executive officers employment. our success also will continue to depend on our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel to operate our stores, dough manufacturing and supply chain centers and international operations. the loss of these employees or our inability to recruit and retain qualified personnel could have a material adverse effect on our operating results.
adverse global economic conditions subject us to additional risk.
our financial condition and results of operations are impacted by global markets and economic conditions over which neither we nor our franchisees have control. an economic downturn, including further deterioration in the economic conditions in european countries, may result in a reduction in the demand for our products, longer payment cycles, slower adoption of new technologies and increased price competition. poor economic conditions may adversely affect the ability of our franchisees to pay royalties or amounts owed, and could have a material adverse impact on our ability to pursue our growth strategy, which would reduce cash collections and in turn, may materially and adversely affect our ability to service our debt obligations.
our international operations subject us to additional risk. such risks and costs may differ in each country in which we and our franchisees do business and may cause our profitability to decline due to increased costs.
we conduct a significant and growing portion of our business outside the united states. our financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected if global markets in which our franchise stores compete are affected by changes in political, economic or other factors. these factors, over which neither we nor our franchisees have control, may include:
   recessionary or expansive trends in international markets;

13
   changing labor conditions and difficulties in staffing and managing our foreign operations;

   increases in the taxes we pay and other changes in applicable tax laws;

   legal and regulatory changes, and the burdens and costs of our compliance with a variety of foreign laws;

   changes in inflation rates;

   changes in exchange rates and the imposition of restrictions on currency conversion or the transfer of funds;

   difficulty in collecting our royalties and longer payment cycles;

   expropriation of private enterprises;

   increases in anti-american sentiment and the identification of the dominos pizza® brand as an american brand;

   political and economic instability; and

   other external factors.

fluctuations in the value of the u.s. dollar in relation to other currencies may lead to lower revenues and earnings.
exchange rate fluctuations could have an adverse effect on our results of operations. approximately 7.7% of our total revenues in 2014, 7.4% of our total revenues in 2013 and 7.1% of our total revenues in 2012 were derived from our international franchise segment, a majority of which were denominated in foreign currencies. we also operate dough manufacturing and distribution facilities in canada, which generate revenues denominated in canadian dollars. sales made by franchise stores outside the united states are denominated in the currency of the country in which the store is located, and this currency could become less valuable in u.s. dollars as a result of exchange rate fluctuations. unfavorable currency fluctuations could lead to increased prices to customers outside the united states or lower profitability to our franchisees outside the united states, or could result in lower revenues for us, on a u.s. dollar basis, from such customers and franchisees. a hypothetical 10% adverse change in the foreign currency rates in our international markets would have resulted in a negative impact on international royalty revenues of approximately $14.7 million in 2014.
we may not be able to adequately protect our intellectual property, which could harm the value of our brand and branded products and adversely affect our business.
we depend in large part on our brand and branded products and believe that they are very important to our business. we rely on a combination of trademarks, copyrights, service marks, trade secrets and similar intellectual property rights to protect our brand and branded products. the success of our business depends on our continued ability to use our existing trademarks and service marks in order to increase brand awareness and further develop our branded products in both domestic and international markets. we have registered certain trademarks and have other trademark registrations pending in the united states and foreign jurisdictions. not all of the trademarks that we currently use have been registered in all of the countries in which we do business, and they may never be registered in all of these countries. we may not be able to adequately protect our trademarks and our use of these trademarks may result in liability for trademark infringement, trademark dilution or unfair competition. all of the steps we have taken to protect our intellectual property in the united states and in foreign countries may not be adequate. in addition, the laws of some foreign countries do not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the united states. further, through acquisitions of third parties, we may acquire brands and related trademarks that are subject to the same risks as the brands and trademarks we currently own.
we may from time to time be required to institute litigation to enforce our trademarks or other intellectual property rights, or to protect our trade secrets. such litigation could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and could negatively affect our sales, profitability and prospects regardless of whether we are able to successfully enforce our rights.
our earnings and business growth strategy depends on the success of our franchisees, and we may be harmed by actions taken by our franchisees, or employees of our franchisees, that are outside of our control.
a significant portion of our earnings comes from royalties generated by our franchise stores. franchisees are independent operators, and their employees are not our employees. we provide tools for franchisees to use in training their employees, but the quality of franchise store operations may be diminished by any number of factors beyond our control. consequently, franchisees may not successfully operate stores in a manner consistent with our standards and requirements. if they do not, our image and reputation may suffer, and as a result our revenues and stock price could decline. while we try to ensure that our franchisees maintain the quality of our brand and branded products, our franchisees may take actions that adversely affect the value of our intellectual property or reputation. as of december 28, 2014, we had 899 domestic franchisees operating 4,690 domestic stores. 12 of these franchisees each operate over 50 domestic stores, including our largest domestic franchisee who operates 140 stores, and the average franchisee owns and operates five stores.
14
in addition, our international master franchisees are generally responsible for the development of significantly more stores than our domestic franchisees. as a result, our international operations are more closely tied to the success of a smaller number of franchisees than our domestic operations. our largest international master franchisee operates 1,411 stores in six markets, which accounts for approximately 22% of our total international store count. our domestic and international franchisees may not operate their franchises successfully. if one or more of our key franchisees were to become insolvent or otherwise were unable or unwilling to pay us our royalties or other amounts owed, our business and results of operations would be adversely affected.
interruption, failure or compromise of our information technology, communications systems and electronic data could hurt our ability to effectively serve our customers and protect customer data, which could damage our reputation and adversely affect our business and operating results.
a significant portion of our retail sales depends on the continuing operation of our information technology and communications systems, including but not limited to, dominos pulse, our online ordering platforms and our credit card processing systems. our information technology, communication systems and electronic data may be vulnerable to damage or interruption from earthquakes, terrorist attacks, floods, fires, power loss, telecommunications failures, computer viruses, loss of data, unauthorized data breaches or other attempts to harm our systems. additionally, we operate data centers that are also subject to break-ins, sabotage and intentional acts of vandalism that could cause disruptions in our ability to serve our customers and protect customer data. some of our systems are not fully redundant, and our disaster recovery planning cannot account for all eventualities. the occurrence of a natural disaster, intentional sabotage or other unanticipated problems could result in lengthy interruptions in our service. any errors or vulnerabilities in our systems, or damage to or failure of our systems, could result in interruptions in our services and non-compliance with certain regulations, which could reduce our revenues and profits, and damage our business and brand.
we rely on proprietary and commercially available systems, software, tools and monitoring to provide security for processing, transmission and storage of confidential customer information, such as payment card and personal information and any unauthorized data breaches could damage our reputation and adversely affect our business.
unauthorized intrusion into the portions of our computer systems or those of our franchisees that process and store information related to customer transactions may result in the theft of customer data. furthermore, the systems currently used for transmission and approval of payment card transactions, and the technology utilized in payment cards themselves, all of which can put payment card data at risk, are determined and mandated by payment card industry standards, not by us. in addition to improper activities by third parties, bugs in newly-deployed or early stage advances in hardware and software capabilities, encryption technology, and other events or developments may facilitate or result in a compromise or breach of our computer systems. any such compromises or breaches could cause interruptions in operations and damage to the reputation of the dominos pizza® brand, subject us to costs and liabilities and hurt sales, revenues and profits.
we are subject to extensive government regulation and requirements issued by other groups and our failure to comply with existing or increased regulations could adversely affect our business and operating results.
we are subject to numerous federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations, as well as, requirements issued by other groups, including those relating to:
   the preparation, sale and labeling of food;

   building and zoning requirements;

   environmental protection;

   minimum wage, overtime and other labor requirements;

   compliance with securities laws and new york stock exchange listed company rules;

   compliance with the americans with disabilities act of 1990, as amended;

   working and safety conditions;

   menu labeling and other nutritional requirements;

   compliance with the payment card industry data security standards (pci dss) and similar requirements;

   compliance with the patient protection and affordable care act, and subsequent amendments; and

   compliance with the dodd-frank wall street reform and consumer protection act and any rules promulgated thereunder.

the patient protection and affordable care act and subsequent amendments require employers such as us to provide health insurance for all qualifying employees or pay penalties for not providing coverage. we anticipate that the majority of the increases in these costs will begin in 2015 and will escalate in subsequent years. while we do not expect the incremental costs of this program to be material to us, these costs will likely have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position, as well as an adverse effect on some of our larger franchisees.
15
we may also become subject to legislation or regulation seeking to tax and/or regulate high-fat foods, foods with high sugar and salt content, or foods otherwise deemed to be unhealthy. if we fail to comply with existing or future laws and regulations, we may be subject to governmental or judicial fines or sanctions. in addition, our capital expenditures could increase due to remediation measures that may be required if we are found to be noncompliant with any of these laws or regulations.
we are also subject to a federal trade commission rule and to various state and foreign laws that govern the offer and sale of franchises. additionally, these laws regulate various aspects of the franchise relationship, including terminations and the refusal to renew franchises. the failure to comply with these laws and regulations in any jurisdiction or to obtain required government approvals could result in a ban or temporary suspension on future franchise sales, fines or other penalties or require us to make offers of rescission or restitution, any of which could adversely affect our business and operating results.
our current insurance coverage may not be adequate, insurance premiums for such coverage may increase and we may not be able to obtain insurance at acceptable rates, or at all.
we have retention programs for workers compensation, general liability and owned and non-owned automobile liabilities. we are generally responsible for up to $1.0 million per occurrence under these retention programs for workers compensation and general liability. we are also generally responsible for between $500,000 and $3.0 million per occurrence under these retention programs for owned and non-owned automobile liabilities. total insurance limits under these retention programs vary depending upon the period covered and range up to $110.0 million per occurrence for general liability and owned and non-owned automobile liabilities and up to the applicable statutory limits for workers compensation. these insurance policies may not be adequate to protect us from liabilities that we incur in our business. in addition, in the future our insurance premiums may increase and we may not be able to obtain similar levels of insurance on reasonable terms, or at all. any such inadequacy of, or inability to obtain insurance coverage could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
our annual and quarterly financial results are subject to significant fluctuations depending on various factors, many of which are beyond our control, and if we fail to meet the expectations of securities analysts or investors, our share price may decline significantly.
our sales and operating results can vary significantly from quarter-to-quarter and year-to-year depending on various factors, many of which are beyond our control. these factors include, among other things:
   variations in the timing and volume of our sales and our franchisees sales;

   the timing of expenditures in anticipation of future sales;

   sales promotions by us and our competitors;

   changes in competitive and economic conditions generally;

   changes in the cost or availability of our ingredients or labor; and

   foreign currency exposure.

as a result, our operational performance may decline quickly and significantly in response to changes in order patterns or rapid decreases in demand for our products. we anticipate that fluctuations in operating results will continue in the future.
our common stock price could be subject to significant fluctuations and/or may decline.
the market price of our common stock could be subject to significant fluctuations. among the factors that could affect our stock price are:
   changes planned or actual to our capital or debt structure;

   variations in our operating results;

   changes in revenues or earnings estimates or publication of research reports by analysts;

   speculation in the press or investment community;

   strategic actions by us or our competitors, such as sales promotions, acquisitions or restructurings;

   actions by institutional and other stockholders;

   changes in our dividend policy;

   changes in the market values of public companies that operate in our business segments;

   general market conditions; and

   domestic and international economic factors unrelated to our performance.

the stock markets in general have experienced volatility that has sometimes been unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies. these broad market fluctuations may cause the trading price of our common stock to decline.
16
our substantial indebtedness could adversely affect our business and limit our ability to plan for or respond to changes in our business.
we have a substantial amount of indebtedness. as of december 28, 2014, our consolidated long-term indebtedness was approximately $1.52 billion. we may also incur additional debt, which would not be prohibited under the terms of our current securitized debt agreements. our substantial indebtedness could have important consequences to our business and our shareholders. for example, it could:
   make it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations with respect to our debt agreements;

   increase our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions;

   require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to payments on our indebtedness, thereby reducing the availability of our cash flow for other purposes; and

   limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industry in which we operate, thereby placing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our peers that may have less debt.

in addition, the financial and other covenants we agreed to with our lenders may limit our ability to incur additional indebtedness, make investments, pay dividends and engage in other transactions, and the leverage may cause potential lenders to be less willing to loan funds to us in the future. our failure to comply with these covenants could result in an event of default that, if not cured or waived, could result in the acceleration of repayment of all of our indebtedness.
we may be unable to generate sufficient cash flow to satisfy our significant debt service obligations, which would adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.
our ability to make principal and interest payments on and to refinance our indebtedness will depend on our ability to generate cash in the future. this, to a certain extent, is subject to general economic, financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control. if our business does not generate sufficient cash flow from operations, in the amounts projected or at all, or if future borrowings are not available to us under our variable funding notes in amounts sufficient to fund our other liquidity needs, our financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected. if we cannot generate sufficient cash flow from operations to make scheduled principal amortization and interest payments on our debt obligations in the future, we may need to refinance all or a portion of our indebtedness on or before maturity, sell assets, delay capital expenditures or seek additional equity. if we are unable to refinance any of our indebtedness on commercially reasonable terms or at all or to effect any other action relating to our indebtedness on satisfactory terms or at all, our business may be harmed.
the terms of our securitized debt financing of certain of our wholly-owned subsidiaries have restrictive terms and our failure to comply with any of these terms could put us in default, which would have an adverse effect on our business and prospects.
unless and until we repay all outstanding borrowings under our securitized debt, we will remain subject to the restrictive terms of these borrowings. the securitized debt, under which certain of our wholly-owned subsidiaries issued and guaranteed fixed rate notes and variable funding senior revolving notes, contain a number of covenants, with the most significant financial covenant being a debt service coverage calculation. these covenants limit the ability of certain of our subsidiaries to, among other things:
   sell assets;

   alter the business we conduct;

   engage in mergers, acquisitions and other business combinations;

   declare dividends or redeem or repurchase capital stock;

   incur, assume or permit to exist additional indebtedness or guarantees;

   make loans and investments;

   incur liens; and

   enter into transactions with affiliates.

the securitized debt also requires us to maintain specified financial ratios at the end of each fiscal quarter. these restrictions could affect our ability to pay dividends or repurchase shares of our common stock. our ability to meet these financial ratios can be affected by events beyond our control, and we may not satisfy such a test. a breach of this covenant could result in a rapid amortization event or default under the securitized debt. if amounts owed under the securitized debt are accelerated because of a default under the securitized debt and we are unable to pay such amounts, the investors may have the right to assume control of substantially all of the securitized assets.
17
during the seven-year term following issuance, the outstanding senior notes will accrue interest at a fixed rate of 5.216% per year. additionally, the senior notes have original scheduled principal amortization payments of $29.5 million in 2015, $37.4 million in 2016, $39.4 million in each of 2017 and 2018, and $9.8 million in 2019. in accordance with our debt agreements, once we meet certain conditions, including maximum leverage ratios as defined of less than or equal to 4.5x total debt to ebitda, we cease to make the scheduled principal amortization payments. if one of the defined leverage ratios subsequently exceeds 4.5x, we must make-up the payments we had previously not made. during the second quarter of 2014, we met the maximum leverage ratios of less than 4.5x, and, in accordance with our debt agreements, ceased debt amortization payments in the third quarter of 2014. we continued to meet the maximum leverage ratios of less than 4.5x in the third and fourth quarters of 2014 and currently do not plan to make previously scheduled debt amortization payments as permitted in our debt agreements.
if we are unable to refinance or repay amounts under the securitized debt prior to the expiration of the seven-year term, our cash flow would be directed to the repayment of the securitized debt and, other than a weekly management fee sufficient to cover minimal selling, general and administrative expenses, would not be available for operating our business.
no assurance can be given that any refinancing or additional financing will be possible when needed or that we will be able to negotiate acceptable terms. in addition, our access to capital is affected by prevailing conditions in the financial and capital markets and other factors beyond our control. there can be no assurance that market conditions will be favorable at the times that we require new or additional financing.
the indenture governing the securitized debt will restrict the cash flow from the entities subject to the securitization to any of our other entities and upon the occurrence of certain events, cash flow would be further restricted.
in the event that a rapid amortization event occurs under the indenture (including, without limitation, upon an event of default under the indenture or the failure to repay the securitized debt at the end of the seven-year term), the funds available to us would be reduced or eliminated, which would in turn reduce our ability to operate or grow our business.

item 7. managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations.
overview our fiscal year typically includes 52 weeks, comprised of three twelve-week quarters and one sixteen-week quarter. every five or six years our fiscal year includes an extra (or 53rd) week in the fourth quarter. fiscal 2012, fiscal 2013 and fiscal 2014 each consisted of 52 weeks.
description of the business dominos is the second largest pizza restaurant chain in the world, with more than 11,600 locations in over 75 markets. founded in 1960, our roots are in convenient pizza delivery, while a significant amount of our sales also come from carryout customers. although we are a highly-recognized global brand, we focus on serving the local neighborhoods in which we live and do business through our large network of franchise owners and company-owned stores. on average, we sell more than 1.5 million pizzas each day throughout our global system.
our business model is straightforward: we handcraft and serve quality food at a competitive price, with easy ordering access and efficient service, which are enhanced by our technology innovations. our dough is generally made fresh and distributed to stores around the world by us and our franchisees.
dominos generates revenues and earnings by charging royalties to its franchisees. royalties are ongoing percent-of-sales fees for use of the dominos brand marks. the company also generates revenues and earnings by selling food, equipment and supplies to franchisees primarily in the u.s. and canada, and by operating a number of our own stores. franchisees profit by selling pizza and other complementary items to their local customers. in our international markets, we generally grant geographical rights to the dominos pizza® brand to master franchisees. these master franchisees are charged with developing their geographical area, and they profit by sub-franchising and selling ingredients and equipment to those sub-franchisees, as well as by running pizza stores. everyone in the system can benefit, including the end consumer, who can feed their family dominos menu items conveniently and economically.
our business model can yield strong returns for our franchise owners and company-owned stores. it can also yield significant cash flow to us, through a consistent franchise royalty payment and supply chain revenue stream, with moderate capital expenditures. we have historically returned cash to shareholders through dividend payments and share buybacks since becoming a publicly-traded company.
in the fourth quarter of 2014 several organizational changes were made within the companys management structure, with one of the changes impacting the management of our supply chain operations. as a result, management determined that our previous domestic supply chain segment and the international supply chain operations division of our previous international segment should be combined into a new global supply chain segment. as a result, we now report the following three business segments: domestic stores, supply chain and international franchise. while the consolidated results of the company have not been impacted by this change in our reportable segments, we have restated our historical segment information in order to provide readers of our financial statements with a consistent presentation.
fiscal 2014 highlights
   global retail sales (which are total retail sales at company-owned and franchised stores worldwide) increased 11.1% as compared to 2013.

   same store sales increased 7.5% in our domestic stores and, when excluding the impact of foreign currency exchange rates, increased 6.9% in our international stores.

   our revenues increased 10.6%.

   our income from operations increased 10.1%.

   our net income increased 13.7%.

during 2014, we continued our rapid global expansion with the opening of 743 net new stores. our international segment led the way with a record 662 net new store openings.
we continued our focus on growing online ordering and the digital customer experience as we introduced dom, a voice ordering application, which we believe is the first in the restaurant industry, and we also made the dominos tracker® available on the pebble smartwatch platform. our emphasis on technology innovation helped us generate approximately 45% of u.s. sales from digital channels in 2014, as well as reach an estimated $3.6 billion in global digital sales.
overall, we believe our focus in 2014 on global growth and technology will strengthen our brand in the future.

fiscal 2013 highlights
   global retail sales increased 8.2% as compared to 2012.

   same store sales increased 5.4% in our domestic stores and, when excluding the impact of foreign currency exchange rates, increased 6.2% in our international stores.

   our revenues increased 7.4%.

   our income from operations increased 11.2%.

   our net income increased 27.2%.

during 2013, we continued our strong global growth, as evidenced by the 631 net new stores that were opened. our international segment led the way with 573 net new store openings.
we also remained focused on technology and improving the experience for our customers. we launched our enhanced online ordering profiles platform, allowing customers the ability to reorder their favorite order in as few as five clicks, or about 30 seconds. our emphasis on technology innovation helped us generate approximately 40% of u.s. sales from digital channels in 2013, as well as reach an estimated $3 billion in global digital sales.
we believe our accomplishments and efforts in each of these areas will improve our brand image and brand positioning in the future.
critical accounting policies and estimates the following discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america. the preparation of these financial statements requires our management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. on an ongoing basis, our management evaluates its estimates, including those related to revenue recognition, long-lived and intangible assets, insurance and legal matters, share-based payments and income taxes. we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. actual results may differ from those estimates. changes in our accounting policies and estimates could materially impact our results of operations and financial condition for any particular period. we believe that our most critical accounting policies and estimates are:
revenue recognition. we earn revenues through our network of domestic company-owned and franchised stores, dough manufacturing and supply chain centers and international operations. retail sales from franchise stores are reported to the company by its franchisees and are not included in company revenues. retail sales from company-owned stores and royalty revenues resulting from the retail sales from franchised stores are recognized as revenues when the items are delivered to or carried out by customers. retail sales are generally reported and related royalties paid to the company based on a percentage of retail sales, as specified in the related standard franchise agreement (generally 5.5% of domestic franchise retail sales and, on average, 3.1% of international franchise retail sales). revenues from company-owned stores and royalty revenues from franchised stores can fluctuate from time-to-time as a result of store count changes. this can occur when a company-owned store is sold to a franchisee. if a company-owned store that generated $500,000 in revenue in fiscal 2013 was sold to a franchisee in fiscal 2014, revenues from company-owned stores would have declined by $500,000 in fiscal 2014, while franchise royalty revenues would have increased by only $27,500 in fiscal 2014, as we generally collect 5.5% of a domestic franchisees retail sales. sales of food from our supply chain centers are recognized as revenues upon delivery of the food to franchisees, while sales of equipment and supplies are generally recognized as revenues upon shipment of the related products to franchisees.
long-lived and intangible assets. we record long-lived assets, including property, plant and equipment and capitalized software, at cost. for acquisitions of franchise operations, we estimate the fair values of the assets and liabilities acquired based on physical inspection of assets, historical experience and other information available to us regarding the acquisition. we depreciate and amortize long-lived assets using useful lives determined by us based on historical experience and other information available to us. we evaluate the potential impairment of long-lived assets at least annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable. our evaluation is based on various analyses, including the projection of undiscounted cash flows. for company-owned stores, we perform related impairment tests on an operating market basis, which the company has determined to be the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of other cash flows. if the carrying amount of a long-lived asset exceeds the amount of the expected future undiscounted cash flows of that asset, the company estimates the fair value of the asset. if the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the estimated fair value of the asset, an impairment loss is recognized and the asset is written down to its estimated fair value.
25
we have not made any significant changes in the methodology used to project the future market cash flows of company-owned stores during the years presented. same store sales fluctuations and the rates at which operating costs will fluctuate in the future are key factors in evaluating recoverability of the related assets. if our same store sales significantly decline or if operating costs increase and we are unable to recover these costs, the carrying value of our company-owned stores, by market, may be unrecoverable and we may be required to recognize an impairment charge. as discussed in note 1 to our consolidated financial statements, the company incurred an impairment charge related to its corporate airplane in the fourth quarter of 2014. aside from this impairment charge, the company did not record an impairment charge during fiscal 2014.
a significant portion of our goodwill relates to acquisitions of domestic franchise stores and is included in our domestic stores segment, specifically, our company-owned stores division. we evaluate goodwill annually for impairment by comparing the fair value of the reporting unit (which is primarily determined using the present value of historical cash flows) to its carrying value. if the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds the fair value, goodwill would be impaired. we have not made any significant changes in the methodology used to evaluate goodwill impairment during the years presented. at december 28, 2014, the fair value of our business operations with associated goodwill exceeded their recorded carrying value, including the related goodwill. if cash flows generated by our company-owned stores were to decline significantly in the future or there were negative revisions to the market multiple assumption, we may be required to recognize a goodwill impairment charge. however, based on the latest impairment analysis, we do not believe it is reasonably likely that there could be changes in assumptions that would trigger impairment.
insurance and legal matters. we are a party to lawsuits and legal proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business. management closely monitors these legal matters and estimates the probable costs for the resolution of such matters. these estimates are primarily determined by consulting with both internal and external parties handling the matters and are based upon an analysis of potential results, assuming a combination of litigation and settlement strategies. while historically our actual losses have been materially consistent with our reserves, legal judgments can be volatile and difficult to predict. accordingly, if our estimates relating to legal matters proved inaccurate for any reason, we may be required to increase or decrease the related expense in future periods. we had accruals for legal matters of approximately $4.3 million at december 28, 2014 and $5.0 million at december 29, 2013.
for certain periods prior to december 1998 and for periods after december 2001, we maintain insurance coverage for workers compensation, general liability and owned and non-owned auto liability under insurance policies requiring payment of a deductible for each occurrence up to between $500,000 and $3.0 million, depending on the policy year and line of coverage. the related insurance reserves are based on undiscounted independent actuarial estimates, which are based on historical information along with assumptions about future events. specifically, various methods, including analyses of historical trends and actuarial valuation methods, are utilized to estimate the cost to settle reported claims, and claims incurred but not yet reported. the actuarial valuation methods develop estimates of the future ultimate claim costs based on the claims incurred as of the balance sheet date. when estimating these liabilities, several factors are considered, including the severity, duration and frequency of claims, legal cost associated with claims, healthcare trends and projected inflation.
our methodology for determining our exposure has remained consistent throughout the years presented. management believes that the various assumptions developed and actuarial methods used to determine our self-insurance reserves are reasonable and provide meaningful data that management uses to make its best estimate of our exposure to these risks. while historically our actual losses have been materially consistent with our reserves, changes in assumptions for such factors as medical costs and legal actions, as well as changes in actual experience, could cause our estimates to change in the near term which could result in an increase or decrease in the related expense in future periods. a 10% change in our self-insurance liability at december 28, 2014 would have affected our income before provision for income taxes by approximately $4.1 million for fiscal 2014. we had accruals for insurance matters of approximately $41.4 million at december 28, 2014 and $38.8 million at december 29, 2013.
share-based payments. we recognize compensation expense related to our share-based compensation arrangements over the requisite service period based on the grant date fair value of the awards. the grant date fair value of each restricted stock and performance-based restricted stock award is equal to the market price of our stock on the date of grant. the grant date fair value of each stock option award is estimated using a black-scholes option pricing model. the pricing model requires assumptions, including the expected life of the stock option, the risk-free interest rate, the expected dividend yield and expected volatility of our stock over the expected life, which significantly impact the assumed fair value. we are also required to estimate the expected forfeiture rate and only recognize expense for those awards expected to vest. we use historical data to determine these assumptions. additionally, our stock option, restricted stock and performance-based restricted stock arrangements provide for accelerated vesting and the ability to exercise during the remainder of the ten-year stock option life upon the retirement of individuals holding the awards who have achieved specified service and age requirements.
26
management believes that the methods and various assumptions used to determine compensation expense related to these arrangements are reasonable, but if the assumptions change significantly for future grants, share-based compensation expense will fluctuate in future years.
income taxes. we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax basis of assets and liabilities and reserves for uncertain tax positions. we measure deferred tax assets and liabilities using current enacted tax rates that will apply in the years in which we expect the temporary differences to be recovered or paid. judgment is required in determining the provision for income taxes, related reserves and deferred tax assets and liabilities. these include establishing a valuation allowance related to the ability to realize certain deferred tax assets, if necessary. on an ongoing basis, management will assess whether it remains more likely than not that the net deferred tax assets will be realized. the company had valuation allowances recorded for deferred tax assets of approximately $0.5 million as of december 28, 2014 and approximately $0.9 million as of december 29, 2013. our accounting for deferred tax assets represents our best estimate of future events. our net deferred tax assets assume that we will generate sufficient taxable income in specific tax jurisdictions, based on our estimates and assumptions. changes in our current estimates due to unanticipated events could have a material impact on our financial condition and results of operations.
the amounts recorded on the balance sheet relating to uncertain tax positions consider the ultimate resolution of revenue agent reviews based on estimates and assumptions. we believe we have appropriately accounted for our uncertain tax positions; however, tax audits, changes in tax laws and other unforeseen matters may result in us owing additional taxes. we adjust our reserves for uncertain tax positions when facts and circumstances change or due to the passage of time. the completion of a tax audit, the expiration of a statute of limitations, or changes in penalty and interest reserves associated with uncertain tax positions are examples of situations when we may adjust our reserves. management believes that our tax positions comply with applicable tax law and that we have adequately provided for these matters. however, to the extent the final tax outcome of these matters is different than our recorded amounts, we may be required to adjust our tax reserves resulting in additional income tax expense or benefit in future periods.

2014 compared to 2013
(tabular amounts in millions, except percentages)
revenues. revenues primarily consist of retail sales from our company-owned stores, royalties and fees from our domestic and international franchised stores and sales of food, equipment and supplies from our supply chain centers to substantially all of our domestic franchised stores and certain international franchised stores. company-owned store and franchised store revenues may vary from period to period due to changes in store count mix. supply chain revenues may vary significantly as a result of fluctuations in commodity prices as well as the mix of products we sell.
consolidated revenues increased $191.6 million or 10.6% in 2014. the increase was driven by higher supply chain revenues due to higher volumes from increased store order counts, higher commodity prices, and increased sales of equipment to stores in connection with our store reimaging program. domestic store revenues rose due to an increase in same store sales and store count growth. in addition, higher international franchise same store sales and store count growth also increased consolidated revenues. these increases were offset in part by the negative impact on international revenues of changes in foreign currency exchange rates. these changes in revenues are more fully described below.
domestic stores. revenues from domestic stores are primarily comprised of retail sales from domestic company-owned store operations as well as royalties from retail sales and other fees from domestic franchised stores, as summarized in the following table.
2014                               2013

higher franchise same store sales, store count growth and higher domestic company-owned same store sales drove an increase in overall domestic store revenues of $28.9 million or 5.3%. these results are more fully described below.
domestic company-owned stores. revenues from domestic company-owned store operations increased $11.1 million or 3.3% in 2014. this increase was due to a 6.2% increase in same store sales as compared to 2013, offset in part by a decrease in the average number of domestic company-owned stores open during 2014.
domestic franchise. revenues from domestic franchise operations increased $17.8 million or 8.4% in 2014. the increase was driven by a 7.7% increase in same store sales as compared to 2013 and, to a lesser extent, an increase in the average number of domestic franchised stores open during 2014. revenues further benefited from fees paid by franchisees related to our insourced online ordering platform and we also incurred an increase in expenses related to these technology initiatives.

supply chain. revenues from supply chain operations are primarily comprised of sales of food, equipment and supplies from our supply chain centers to substantially all of our domestic franchised stores and certain international franchised stores, as summarized in the following table.

total supply chain                 $1,262.5           100.0   %         $1,118.9           100.0   %
domestic supply chain. domestic supply chain revenues increased $131.2 million or 13.0% in 2014. the increase was primarily attributable to higher volumes from increased order counts at the store level, higher overall commodity prices, and increases in sales of equipment and supplies. changes in u.s. cheese prices increased revenues by approximately $33.0 million in 2014.
international supply chain. revenues from international supply chain operations increased $12.4 million or 11.3% in 2014. this increase resulted primarily from higher volumes in 2014, and was offset in part by the negative impact of foreign currency exchange rates of approximately $7.3 million during the year.
international franchise. international franchise revenues primarily consist of royalties from retail sales and other fees from our international franchise stores. revenues from international franchise operations increased $19.0 million or 14.3% in 2014. this increase was due to higher same store sales and an increase in the average number of international stores open during 2014, and was offset in part by the negative impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates of approximately $3.4 million in 2014. excluding the impact of foreign currency exchange rates, same store sales increased 6.9% in 2014 compared to 2013. when the impact of foreign currency exchange rates is included, same store sales increased 4.9% in 2014 compared to 2013. this variance was caused by a generally stronger u.s. dollar when compared to the currencies in the international markets in which we compete.
cost of sales / operating margin. consolidated cost of sales consists primarily of domestic company-owned store and supply chain costs incurred to generate related revenues. components of consolidated cost of sales primarily include food, labor and occupancy costs. the changes to the consolidated operating margin, which we define as revenues less cost of sales are summarized in the following table.
2014                                    2013
consolidated revenues                    $1,993.8           100.0   %            $1,802.2           100.0   %
consolidated cost of sales                1,399.1            70.2   %             1,253.2            69.5   %
consolidated operating margin              $594.8            29.8   %              $549.0            30.5   %
the $45.8 million or 8.3% increase in consolidated operating margin was due primarily to higher domestic and international franchise revenues and higher supply chain margins. franchise revenues do not have a cost of sales component, so changes in franchise revenues have a disproportionate effect on the consolidated operating margin.
as a percentage of total revenues, our consolidated operating margin decreased 0.7 percentage points in 2014, due to lower supply chain and company-owned stores operating margins as a percentage of their revenues. these changes were primarily a result of higher commodity prices and were offset in part by a higher mix of franchise revenues and are more fully described below.
domestic company-owned stores. the changes to domestic company-owned store operating margin, which do not include other store-level costs such as royalties and advertising, are summarized in the following table.
2014                               2013
revenues                       $348.5           100.0   %         $337.4           100.0   %
cost of sales                   267.4            76.7   %          256.6            76.0   %
store operating margin          $81.1            23.3   %          $80.8            24.0   %
the $0.3 million or 0.4% increase in the domestic company-owned store operating margin was due primarily to higher same store sales. this was offset in part by an increase in overall commodity prices and labor and related expenses.
as a percentage of store revenues, the store operating margin decreased 0.7 percentage points in 2014, as discussed in more detail below.
   food costs increased 0.7 percentage points to 28.3% in 2014, due primarily to higher overall commodity prices. the cheese block price per pound averaged $2.13 in 2014 compared to $1.75 in 2013.

   occupancy costs, which include rent, telephone, utilities and depreciation, decreased 0.1 percentage points to 9.2% in 2014 due primarily to the positive impact of higher sales per store.

   labor and related costs remained flat at 28.0% in 2014.

   insurance costs decreased 0.1 percentage points to 2.7% in 2014, due primarily to the positive impact of higher sales per store.

supply chain. the changes to the supply chain operating margin are summarized in the following table.
2014                                    2013
revenues                                 $1,262.5           100.0   %         $1,118.9           100.0   %
cost of sales                             1,131.7            89.6   %            996.7            89.1   %
supply chain operating margin              $130.8            10.4   %           $122.2            10.9   %
the $8.6 million increase in the supply chain operating margin was due primarily to higher volumes from increased store order counts.
as a percentage of supply chain revenues, the supply chain operating margin decreased 0.5 percentage points in 2014 due to higher commodity prices and higher health insurance costs, offset in part by the positive impact of higher volumes. increases in certain food prices have a negative effect on the supply chain operating margin percentage due to the fixed dollar margin earned by supply chain on certain food items. changes in u.s. cheese prices increased both revenues and costs by $33.0 million in 2014. if the 2014 u.s. cheese prices had been in effect during 2013, the supply chain operating margin as a percentage of supply chain revenues would have decreased by 0.3 percentage points. however, the dollar margin would have been unaffected.
general and administrative expenses. general and administrative expenses increased $14.2 million or 6.1% in 2014. these increases were due in part to an impairment charge of $5.8 million in connection with replacing our corporate airplane, as well as continued investments that we made in technology and international initiatives, including the addition of team members in both areas. a decrease in non-cash compensation expense of $4.4 million partially offset these increases.
interest income. interest income decreased slightly to $0.1 million in 2014.
interest expense. interest expense decreased $2.0 million to $86.9 million in 2014. the decrease was due primarily to lower interest expense resulting from a lower average debt balance during 2014 compared to 2013 and to a lesser extent, lower interest expense from the cash collateralization of our letters of credit.
our cash borrowing rate remained flat at 5.3% during fiscal 2014. our average outstanding debt balance, excluding capital lease obligations, was approximately $1.52 billion in 2014 and approximately $1.54 billion in 2013. the decrease in the companys average outstanding debt balance resulted from the principal payments made on its fixed rate notes during the first two quarters of 2014.
provision for income taxes. provision for income taxes increased $13.9 million to $96.0 million in 2014, due primarily to higher pre-tax income. the companys effective income tax rate increased 0.6 percentage points to 37.1% of pre-tax income in 2014. the lower effective tax rate in fiscal 2013 primarily resulted from a tax benefit recorded for prior tax years in connection with the company revising its calculation for a deduction related to its domestic dough production.
2013 compared to 2012
(tabular amounts in millions, except percentages)
revenues. consolidated revenues increased $123.8 million or 7.4% in 2013. the increase was driven by higher supply chain revenues due to a change in the mix of products sold, higher volumes from increased store order counts and higher commodity prices. higher international same store sales and store count growth also increased consolidated revenues. domestic franchise and company-owned store revenues also rose due to an increase in same store sales. these increases were offset in part by the negative impact on international revenues of changes in foreign currency exchange rates. these changes in revenues are more fully described below.
domestic stores. domestic stores revenues are summarized in the following table.
2013                               2012
domestic company-owned stores          $337.4            61.4   %         $323.7            62.4   %
domestic franchise                      212.4            38.6   %          195.0            37.6   %
total domestic stores revenues         $549.8           100.0   %         $518.7           100.0   %
higher franchise same store sales and higher domestic company-owned same store sales drove an increase in royalty revenues, which increased overall domestic store revenues by $31.1 million or 6.0%. these results are more fully described below.
domestic company-owned stores. revenues from domestic company-owned store operations increased $13.8 million or 4.3% in 2013. the increase was primarily due to a 3.9% increase in same store sales as compared to 2012.
30
domestic franchise. revenues from domestic franchise operations increased $17.4 million or 8.9% in 2013. the increase was driven by a 5.5% increase in same store sales as compared to 2012 and to a lesser extent, an increase in the average number of domestic franchised stores open during 2013. revenues further benefited from fees paid by franchisees related to our insourced online ordering platform and we also incurred an increase in expenses related to these technology initiatives. additionally, we contracted with a third party to manage our gift card program during 2013. in connection with this change, we refined our assessment of our gift card liability and recorded approximately $3.2 million of domestic franchise revenue and reimbursed approximately $1.5 million to our national advertising fund, as discussed further in general and administrative expenses.
supply chain. supply chain revenues are summarized in the following table.
2013                                 2012
domestic supply chain              $1,009.9            90.3   %           $942.2            90.6   %
international supply chain            109.0             9.7   %             97.6             9.4   %
total supply chain                 $1,118.9           100.0   %         $1,039.8           100.0   %
domestic supply chain. domestic supply chain revenues increased $67.7 million or 7.2% in 2013. the increase was primarily attributable to higher volumes from increased order counts at the store level, higher overall commodity prices, a change in the mix of products sold and increases in sales of equipment and supplies. changes in u.s. cheese prices increased revenues by approximately $8.6 million in 2013.
international supply chain. revenues from international supply chain operations increased $11.4 million or 11.7% in 2013. the increase resulted primarily from higher volumes during the year, and was offset in part by the negative impact of foreign currency exchange rates of $2.9 million in 2013.
international franchise. international franchise revenues increased $13.6 million or 11.3% in 2013. the increase was primarily driven by higher same store sales and an increase in the average number of international stores open during 2013, offset in part by the negative impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates of approximately $4.3 million in 2013. excluding the impact of foreign currency exchange rates, same store sales increased 6.2% in 2013 compared to 2012. when the impact of foreign currency exchange rates is included, same store sales increased 2.8% in 2013 compared to 2012. this variance was caused by a generally stronger u.s. dollar when compared to the currencies in the international markets in which we compete.
cost of sales / operating margin. the changes to the consolidated operating margin, which we define as revenues less cost of sales, are summarized in the following table.
2013                                    2012
consolidated revenues                    $1,802.2           100.0   %            $1,678.4           100.0   %
consolidated cost of sales                1,253.2            69.5   %             1,177.1            70.1   %
consolidated operating margin              $549.0            30.5   %              $501.3            29.9   %
the $47.7 million or 9.5% increase in consolidated operating margin was due primarily to higher domestic and international franchise revenues, higher margins at our company-owned stores and higher domestic supply chain margins. franchise revenues do not have a cost of sales component, so changes in franchise revenues have a disproportionate effect on the consolidated operating margin.
as a percentage of total revenues, our consolidated operating margin increased 0.6 percentage points in 2013, due to a higher mix of franchise revenues and higher supply chain and company-owned stores operating margins, offset in part by higher overall commodity prices.
domestic company-owned stores. the changes to domestic company-owned store operating margin, which do not include other store-level costs such as royalties and advertising, are summarized in the following table.
2013                               2012
revenues                       $337.4           100.0   %         $323.7           100.0   %
cost of sales                   256.6            76.0   %          247.4            76.4   %
store operating margin          $80.8            24.0   %          $76.3            23.6   %
the $4.5 million or 6.0% increase in the domestic company-owned store operating margin was the result of higher same store sales, lower labor and related expenses, lower occupancy expenses and lower insurance expenses. this was offset in part by an increase in overall commodity prices.
31
as a percentage of store revenues, the store operating margin increased 0.4 percentage points in 2013, as discussed in more detail below.
   food costs increased 0.5 percentage points to 27.6% in 2013, due primarily to higher overall commodity prices. the cheese block price per pound averaged $1.75 in 2013 compared to $1.69 in 2012.

   occupancy costs, which include rent, telephone, utilities and depreciation, decreased 0.2 percentage points to 9.3% in 2013 due primarily to the positive impact of higher sales per store.

   labor and related costs decreased 0.4 percentage points to 28.0% in 2013, due primarily to leveraging the higher sales per store.

   insurance costs decreased 0.3 percentage points to 2.8% in 2013, due primarily to lower health costs per store and the positive impact of higher sales per store.

supply chain. the changes to the supply chain operating margin are summarized in the following table.
2013                                 2012
revenues                              $1,118.9           100.0   %         $1,039.8           100.0   %
cost of sales                            996.7            89.1   %            929.7            89.4   %
supply chain operating margin           $122.2            10.9   %           $110.1            10.6   %
the supply chain operating margin increased $12.1 million or 11.0% in 2013 due primarily to higher volumes from increased store order counts and a change in the mix of products sold.
as a percentage of supply chain revenues, the supply chain operating margin increased 0.3 percentage points in 2013 due to the positive impact of higher volumes and lower health insurance costs, offset in part by higher commodity costs. increases in certain food prices have a negative effect on the supply chain operating margin percentage due to the fixed dollar margin earned by supply chain on certain food items. changes in u.s. cheese prices increased both revenues and costs by $8.6 million in 2013. if the 2013 u.s. cheese prices had been in effect during 2012, the supply chain operating margin as a percentage of supply chain revenues would have decreased by 0.1 percentage points. however, the dollar margin would have been unaffected.
general and administrative expenses. general and administrative expenses increased $16.2 million or 7.4% in 2013. these increases were due in part to an increase in non-cash compensation expense of $4.4 million and higher variable performance-based compensation expenses of approximately $2.0 million. general and administrative expenses also include a reimbursement of approximately $1.5 million during 2013 to our national advertising fund related to their historical costs to support the companys gift card program, as discussed above in domestic franchise revenues. additionally, we continued our investments in technology and international initiatives, including the addition of team members in both areas, which also increased general and administrative expenses during 2013 compared to 2012.
interest income. interest income decreased slightly to $0.2 million in 2013.
interest expense. interest expense decreased $12.6 million to $88.9 million in 2013. the decrease was driven by approximately $10.2 million of expenses incurred in the first quarter of 2012 related to the 2012 recapitalization which did not recur in 2013, as well as from lower interest expense resulting from a lower average debt balance during 2013 compared to 2012.
our cash borrowing rate decreased slightly, by 0.2 percentage points, to 5.3% during fiscal 2013. our average outstanding debt balance, excluding capital lease obligations, was approximately $1.5 billion in 2013 and approximately $1.6 billion in 2012. the decrease in the companys average outstanding debt balance resulted from the principal payments made on its fixed rate notes during 2013.
provision for income taxes. provision for income taxes increased $13.3 million in 2013, due primarily to higher pre-tax income. the companys 2013 effective income tax rate decreased 1.5 percentage points to 36.5% of pre-tax income. this decrease was partly from a tax benefit of approximately $1.4 million recorded in the third quarter of 2013 related to prior tax years in connection with the company revising its calculation for a deduction related to its domestic dough production.
32
liquidity and capital resources historically, we have operated with minimal positive working capital or negative working capital primarily because our receivable collection periods and inventory turn rates are faster than the normal payment terms on our current liabilities. we generally collect our receivables within three weeks from the date of the related sale, and we generally experience 30 to 40 inventory turns per year. in addition, our sales are not typically seasonal, which further limits our working capital requirements. these factors, coupled with the use of our ongoing cash flows from operations to service our debt obligations, invest in our business, pay dividends and repurchase our common stock, reduce our working capital amounts. as of december 28, 2014, we had working capital of $41.8 million, excluding restricted cash and cash equivalents of $121.0 million and including total unrestricted cash and cash equivalents of $30.9 million.
as of december 28, 2014, we had approximately $56.2 million of restricted cash held for future principal and interest payments, $43.9 million of cash held as collateral for outstanding letters of credit, $20.8 million of restricted cash held in a three month interest reserve as required by the related debt agreements and $0.1 million of other restricted cash, for a total of $121.0 million of restricted cash and cash equivalents.
the company entered into a recapitalization transaction in 2012, in which certain of our subsidiaries replaced the outstanding 2007 fixed rate notes and variable funding notes with new notes (the notes) issued pursuant to an asset-backed securitization. the notes consist of $1.575 billion of series 2012-1 5.216% fixed rate senior secured notes, class a-2 (the fixed rate notes) and $100.0 million of series 2012-1 variable funding senior secured notes, class a-1 (the variable funding notes). additional information related to the recapitalization transaction is included in note 4 to our consolidated financial statements.
the fixed rate notes original scheduled principal amortization payments are $29.5 million in 2015, $37.4 million in 2016, $39.4 million in each of 2017 and 2018, and $9.8 million in 2019. in accordance with our debt agreements, once we meet certain conditions, including maximum leverage ratios as defined of less than or equal to 4.5x total debt to ebitda, we cease to make the scheduled principal amortization payments. if one of the defined leverage ratios subsequently exceeds 4.5x, we must make-up the payments we had previously not made. during the second quarter of 2014, we met the maximum leverage ratios of less than 4.5x, and, in accordance with our debt agreements, ceased debt amortization payments in the third quarter of 2014. we continued to meet the maximum leverage ratios of less than 4.5x in the third and fourth quarters of 2014 and currently do not plan to make previously scheduled debt amortization payments as permitted in our debt agreements.
the notes are subject to certain financial and non-financial covenants, including a debt service coverage calculation, as defined in the related agreements. in the event that certain covenants are not met, the notes may become due and payable on an accelerated schedule.
on march 16, 2012, our board of directors declared a $3.00 per share special cash dividend on the outstanding common stock totaling $171.1 million, which was paid on april 2, 2012 to stockholders of record at the close of business on march 26, 2012. additionally, under the anti-dilution provisions in our underlying stock option plans, on april 2, 2012, we made a corresponding cash payment of approximately $13.5 million on certain stock options, reduced the exercise price on certain other stock options by an equivalent per share amount and, in certain circumstances, both reduced the stock option exercise price and made a cash payment totaling $3.00 per share.
on april 2, 2012, we also accrued an estimated $2.4 million for payments to be made as certain performance-based restricted stock grants vest. the dividend and related dividend equivalent payments were funded with the remaining proceeds from the 2012 recapitalization and cash on hand. these anti-dilution payments were accounted for as modifications/settlements and were recorded as increases in total stockholders deficit. as of december 30, 2012, total cash paid for common stock dividends and related anti-dilution equivalent payments was approximately $185.5 million and the total estimated liability recorded for future cash dividend payments on certain performance-based restricted stock was approximately $1.5 million. as of december 28, 2014, the total estimated liability recorded for future cash dividend payments on certain performance-based restricted stock was approximately $0.6 million.
during fiscal 2012, in connection with the 2012 recapitalization, we incurred approximately $10.5 million of net expenses. additionally, we recorded an additional $32.5 million of deferred financing costs as an asset in the consolidated balance sheet during fiscal 2012. this amount, in addition to the $7.4 million recorded on the consolidated balance sheet at january 1, 2012 is being amortized into interest expense over the seven-year expected term of the debt.
33
our primary source of liquidity is cash flows from operations and availability of borrowings under our variable funding notes. as of december 28, 2014, we had $44.1 million of outstanding letters of credit and $55.9 million of available borrowing capacity under our variable funding notes. the letters of credit are primarily related to our casualty insurance programs and supply chain center leases. the company has collateralized these letters of credit with $43.9 million of restricted cash to reduce its fees on the variable funding notes, and has the ability to access this cash with minimal notice. borrowings under the variable funding notes are available to fund our working capital requirements, capital expenditures and, subject to other limitations, other general corporate purposes including dividend payments.
the company has a board of directors-approved open market share repurchase program of the companys common stock, which was reset during the first quarter of 2014 at $200.0 million. the open market share repurchase program has historically been funded by excess cash flows. the company used cash of approximately $82.4 million in 2014 and $97.1 million in 2013 for share repurchases. the company had approximately $132.7 million left under the $200.0 million authorization as of december 28, 2014. we expect to continue to use ongoing excess cash flow generation and (subject to certain restrictions in the documents governing the variable funding notes) availability under the variable funding notes to, among other things, repurchase shares under the current authorized program.
in the past three years, we have invested between $29.3 million and $71.8 million annually in capital expenditures. in 2014, we invested $71.8 million in capital expenditures which primarily related to investments in existing company-owned stores, supply chain centers and training facilities, the purchase of a corporate airplane, investments in our proprietary internally developed point-of-sale system (dominos pulse), our digital ordering platform and other technology initiatives. we expect to continue capital expenditures of $50 to $60 million in the future as we see continuing opportunities to invest in our industry leading technology platform, the reimaging of our corporate stores and other initiatives to grow our brand. we did not have any material commitments for capital expenditures as of december 28, 2014.
the following table illustrates the main components of our cash flows:

operating activities cash provided by operating activities was $192.3 million in fiscal 2014. our cash provided by operating activities was mainly the result of net income of $162.6 million that was generated during the year, which included non-cash expenses of $29.7 million.
during fiscal 2013, cash provided by operating activities was $194.0 million, mainly the result of net income of $143.0 generated during fiscal 2013 and which included non-cash expenses of $39.5 million. the changes in operating assets and liabilities also generated $11.5 million of cash inflows during 2013.
cash provided by operating activities was $176.3 million in fiscal 2012. our cash provided by operating activities was mainly the result of net income of $112.4 million that was generated during the year and which included $43.8 million of non-cash expenses. the changes in operating assets and liabilities also generated $20.1 million of cash inflows, primarily from the timing of payments of operating liabilities.
we are focused on continually improving our net income and cash flow from operations, and management expects to continue to generate positive cash flows from operating activities for the foreseeable future.
investing activities during fiscal 2014, cash used in investing activities was $57.4 million, which consisted primarily of $70.1 million of capital expenditures (driven by increased investments in company-owned stores and supply chain centers, investments in our technology initiatives, and the purchase of a corporate airplane). proceeds from the sale of assets of $9.2 million and a $4.5 million net change in restricted cash offset the use of cash in investing activities.

during fiscal 2013, cash used in investing activities was $99.7 million, which consisted primarily of a $65.4 million net change in restricted cash and cash equivalents and $40.4 million of capital expenditures, offset by $4.5 million of proceeds from the sale of assets.
cash provided by investing activities was $7.3 million in fiscal 2012. the main drivers of this change were the net change in restricted cash that provided $32.6 million of cash, and the use of cash through $29.3 million of capital expenditures.
financing activities we used $118.9 million of cash in financing activities in fiscal 2014 compared to $134.8 million during fiscal 2013, both primarily related to purchases of common stock, funding dividend payments to our shareholders and making payments on our long-term debt obligations. the tax impact of equity-based compensation offset the use of cash in financing activities in both fiscal 2014 and fiscal 2013.
in fiscal 2012, we used $177.4 million of cash in financing activities. during fiscal 2012 we issued $1.6 billion of debt in connection with our 2012 recapitalization, which was more than offset by the $1.5 billion repayment of our existing debt at that time, the payment of $185.5 million of special dividend payments to our shareholders, $88.2 million purchases of common stock, and $32.5 million of cash paid for financing costs related to our 2012 recapitalization.
during fiscal 2014, we experienced increases in both domestic and international same store sales and our international business continued to grow stores. these factors have contributed to our continued ability to generate positive operating cash flows. we expect to use our unrestricted cash and cash equivalents, our restricted cash amounts pledged as collateral for letters of credit, ongoing cash flows from operations and available borrowings under the variable funding notes to, among other things, fund working capital requirements, invest in our core business, pay dividends and repurchase our common stock. based upon the current level of operations and anticipated growth, we believe that the cash generated from operations, our current unrestricted cash and cash equivalents and amounts available under the variable funding notes will be more than adequate to meet our anticipated debt service requirements, capital expenditures, dividend payments and working capital needs for the foreseeable future.
our ability to continue to fund these items and continue to reduce debt could be adversely affected by the occurrence of any of the events described in item 1a. risk factors. there can be no assurance, however, that our business will generate sufficient cash flows from operations or that future borrowings will be available under the variable funding notes or otherwise to enable us to service our indebtedness, or to make anticipated capital expenditures. our future operating performance and our ability to service, extend or refinance the fixed rate notes and to service, extend or refinance the variable funding notes will be subject to future economic conditions and to financial, business and other factors, many of which are beyond our control.
impact of inflation we believe that our results of operations are not materially impacted by moderate changes in the inflation rate. inflation did not have a material impact on our operations in 2014, 2013 or 2012. severe increases in inflation, however, could affect the global and u.s. economies and could have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. further discussion on the impact of commodities and other cost pressures is included above as well as in item 7a. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk.
new accounting pronouncements in may 2014, the financial accounting standards board (fasb) issued accounting standards update 2014-09, revenue from contracts with customers. this guidance outlines a single, comprehensive model for entities to use in accounting for revenue arising from contracts with customers and supersedes most current revenue recognition guidance issued by the fasb, including industry specific guidance. the guidance is effective for the company for interim and annual reporting periods beginning on january 1, 2017, and permits the use of either the retrospective or cumulative effect transition method. early adoption is prohibited. the company is evaluating the effect that this guidance will have on its consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.
accounting standards that have been issued by the fasb or other standards-setting bodies that do not require adoption until a future date are not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements upon adoption.

contractual obligations the following is a summary of our significant contractual obligations at december 28, 2014.
(dollars in millions)   2015          2016          2017          2018          2019              thereafter            total long-term debt (1):
principal                        $            $            $            $          $1,521.8   $                 $1,521.8
interest (2)                   79.4          79.4          79.4          79.4              19.8                        337.4
capital leases (3)              0.7           0.7           0.7           0.5                                           2.6
operating leases (4)           38.6          36.3          32.4          28.7              22.3   45.7                  204.0
(1)   the maturity date of the long-term debt noted within the table above reflects the companys expected repayment date of january 2019, rather than the legal maturity date of january 2042.

(2)   the interest rate on our variable funding notes is based primarily on a current commercial paper rate plus 350 basis points. the interest rate on the fixed rate notes is fixed at 5.216% per year.

(3)   the principal portion of the capital lease obligation amounts above, which totaled $2.3 million at december 28, 2014, are classified as debt in our consolidated financial statements.

(4)   we lease certain retail store and supply chain center locations, supply chain vehicles, various equipment and our world resource center, which is our corporate headquarters, under leases with expiration dates through 2024.

liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits of $2.9 million are excluded from the above table, as we are unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the amount and period of payment. for additional information on unrecognized tax benefits see note 6 to the consolidated financial statements included in this form 10-k.
off-balance sheet arrangements we are party to letters of credit and, to a lesser extent, financial guarantees with off-balance sheet risk. our exposure to credit loss for letters of credit and financial guarantees is represented by the contractual amounts of these instruments. total conditional commitments under letters of credit as of december 28, 2014 were approximately $44.1 million and relate to our insurance programs and supply chain center leases. the company has guaranteed lease payments related to certain franchisees lease arrangements. the maximum amount of potential future payments under these guarantees is $2.2 million as of december 28, 2014. we believe that none of these arrangements has or is likely to have a material effect on our results of operations, financial condition or liquidity.

item 1a. risk factors in addition to the factors discussed elsewhere in this report, the following risks and uncertainties could materially adversely affect the company's business, financial condition and results of operations. additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to the company or that the company currently deems immaterial also may impair the company's business operations and financial condition.
5
the company operates in a highly competitive industry the company operates in the highly competitive food industry and experiences international competition in all of its principal products. the principal areas of competition are brand recognition, taste, quality, price, advertising, promotion, convenience and service. a number of the company's primary competitors have substantial financial, marketing and other resources. a strong competitive response from one or more of these competitors to the company's marketplace efforts, or a consumer shift towards private label offerings, could result in the company reducing pricing, increasing marketing or other expenditures, and/or losing market share.
the company's results are dependent on strengthening its established businesses while diversifying into higher-growth spaces the company's strategy is focused on strengthening its established businesses while diversifying its portfolio into higher-growth spaces. its established simple meals, snacks and healthy beverages businesses are concentrated in slower-growing center-store categories in traditional mass and grocery channels. factors that may impact the company's success in strengthening these businesses and/or diversifying its portfolio into higher-growth spaces include:
•the company's ability to identify and capitalize on higher-growth spaces;
•   the company's ability to identify and capitalize on customer or consumer trends, including those related to new or improved products or packaging;
•the company's ability to design and implement effective retail execution plans;
•the company's ability to design and implement effective advertising and marketing programs;
•the company's ability to secure or maintain sufficient shelf space at retailers; and
•changes in underlying growth rates of the categories in which the company competes.
if the company is not successful in addressing theses factors, the company's strategy may not be successful and/or the company's business or financial results may be negatively impacted.
the company's results may be adversely affected by the failure to execute acquisitions and divestitures successfully the company's ability to meet its objectives with respect to the acquisition of new businesses or the divestiture of existing businesses may depend in part on its ability to identify suitable buyers and sellers, negotiate favorable financial terms and other contractual terms, and obtain all necessary regulatory approvals. potential risks of acquisitions also include:
•the inability to integrate acquired businesses efficiently into the company's existing operations;
•diversion of management's attention from other business concerns;
•potential loss of key employees and/or customers of acquired businesses;
•potential assumption of unknown liabilities;
•the inability to implement promptly an effective control environment;
•potential impairment charges if purchase assumptions are not achieved or market conditions decline; and
•the risks inherent in entering markets or lines of business with which the company has limited or no prior experience.
acquisitions outside the u.s. may present unique challenges and increase the company's exposure to risks associated with foreign operations, including foreign currency risks and risks associated with local regulatory regimes. for divestitures, potential risks may also include the inability to separate divested businesses or business units from the company effectively and efficiently and to reduce or eliminate associated overhead costs. the company's business or financial results may be negatively affected if acquisitions or divestitures are not successfully implemented or completed.
disruption to the company's supply chain could adversely affect its business the company's ability to manufacture and/or sell its products may be impaired by damage or disruption to its manufacturing or distribution capabilities, or to the capabilities of its suppliers or contract manufacturers, due to factors that are hard to predict or beyond the company's control, such as adverse weather conditions, natural disasters, fire, terrorism, pandemics, strikes or other events. production of the agricultural commodities used in the company's business may also be adversely affected by drought, water scarcity, temperature extremes, scarcity of suitable agricultural land, crop disease and/or crop pests. failure to take adequate steps to mitigate the likelihood or potential impact of such events, or to effectively manage such events if they occur, may adversely affect the company's business or financial results, particularly in circumstances where a product is sourced from a single supplier or location. disputes with significant suppliers or contract manufacturers, including disputes regarding pricing or performance, may also adversely affect the company's ability to manufacture and/or sell its products, as well as its business or financial results.
6
the company's non-u.s. operations pose additional risks to the company's business in 2014, approximately 22% of the company's consolidated net sales from continuing operations were generated outside of the u.s. sales outside the u.s. are expected to continue to represent a significant portion of consolidated net sales. the company's business or financial performance may be adversely affected due to the risks of doing business in markets outside of the u.s., including but not limited to the following:
•unfavorable changes in tariffs, quotas, trade barriers or other export and import restrictions;
•   the difficulty and/or costs of complying with a wide variety of laws, treaties and regulations, including anti-corruption laws and regulations such as the u.s. foreign corrupt practices act;
•   the difficulty and/or costs of designing and implementing an effective control environment across diverse regions and employee bases;
•   the adverse impact of foreign tax treaties and policies;
•   political or economic instability, including the possibility of civil unrest, armed hostilities or terrorist acts;
•   the possible nationalization of operations;
•   the difficulty of enforcing remedies and protecting intellectual property in various jurisdictions; and
•   restrictions on the transfer of funds to and from countries outside of the u.s., including potentially negative tax consequences.
in addition, the company holds assets and incurs liabilities, generates revenue, and pays expenses in a variety of currencies other than the u.s. dollar, primarily the australian dollar and the canadian dollar. the company's consolidated financial statements are presented in u.s. dollars, and the company must translate its assets, liabilities, sales and expenses into u.s. dollars for external reporting purposes. as a result, changes in the value of the u.s. dollar due to fluctuations in currency exchange rates or currency exchange controls may materially and negatively affect the value of these items in the company's consolidated financial statements, even if their value has not changed in their local currency.
the company faces risks related to recession, financial and credit market disruptions and other economic conditions customer and consumer demand for the company's products may be impacted by weak economic conditions, recession, equity market volatility or other negative economic factors in the u.s. or other nations. similarly, disruptions in financial and/or credit markets may impact the company's ability to manage normal commercial relationships with its customers, suppliers and creditors. in addition, changes in tax or interest rates in the u.s. or other nations, whether due to recession, financial and credit market disruptions or other reasons, could impact the company.
increased regulation or regulatory-based claims could adversely affect the company's business or financial results the manufacture and marketing of food products is extensively regulated. the primary areas of regulation include the processing, packaging, storage, distribution, marketing, advertising, labeling, quality and safety of the company's food products, as well as the health and safety of the company's employees and the protection of the environment. in the u.s., the company is subject to regulation by various government agencies, including the food and drug administration, the u.s. department of agriculture, the federal trade commission, the occupational safety and health administration and the environmental protection agency, as well as various state and local agencies. the company is also regulated by similar agencies outside the u.s. changes in regulatory requirements (such as proposed labeling requirements), or evolving interpretations of existing regulatory requirements, may result in increased compliance cost, capital expenditures and other financial obligations that could adversely affect the company's business or financial results. in addition, the marketing of food products has come under increased scrutiny in recent years, and the food industry has been subject to an increasing number of legal proceedings and claims relating to alleged false or deceptive marketing under federal, state and foreign laws or regulations. legal proceedings or claims related to the company's marketing could damage the company's reputation and/or could adversely affect the company's business or financial results.
the company's results may be adversely impacted by increases in the price of raw and packaging materials the raw and packaging materials used in the company's business include tomato paste, grains, beef, poultry, vegetables, steel, glass, paper and resin. many of these materials are subject to price fluctuations from a number of factors, including product scarcity, demand for raw materials, commodity market speculation, energy costs, currency fluctuations, weather conditions, import and export requirements and changes in government-sponsored agricultural programs. to the extent any of these factors result in an increase in raw and packaging material prices, the company may not be able to offset such increases through productivity or price increases or through its commodity hedging activity.
7
adverse changes in the global climate or extreme weather conditions could adversely affect the company's business or operations the company's business or financial results could be adversely affected by changing global temperatures or weather patterns or by extreme or unusual weather conditions. adverse changes in the global climate or extreme or unusual weather conditions could:
•   unfavorably impact the cost or availability of raw or packaging materials, especially if such events have a negative impact on agricultural productivity or on the supply of water;
•   disrupt the company's ability, or the ability of its suppliers or contract manufacturers, to manufacture or distribute the company's products;
•   disrupt the retail operations of the company's customers; or
•   unfavorably impact the demand for, or the consumer's ability to purchase, the company's products.
in addition, there is growing concern that the release of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases into the atmosphere may be impacting global temperatures and weather patterns and contributing to extreme or unusual weather conditions. this growing concern may result in more regional, federal, and/or global legal and regulatory requirements to reduce or mitigate the effects of greenhouse gases. adoption of such additional regulation may result in increased compliance costs, capital expenditures, and other financial obligations that could adversely affect the company's business or financial results.
price increases may not be sufficient to cover increased costs, or may result in declines in sales volume due to pricing elasticity in the marketplace the company intends to pass along to customers some or all cost increases in raw and packaging materials and other inputs through increases in the selling prices of, or decreases in the packaging sizes of, some of its products. higher product prices or smaller packaging sizes may result in reductions in sales volume. to the extent the price increases or packaging size decreases are not sufficient to offset increased raw and packaging materials and other input costs, and/or if they result in significant decreases in sales volume, the company's business results and financial condition may be adversely affected.
the company may be adversely impacted by a changing customer landscape and the increased significance of some of its customers the company's businesses are largely concentrated in the traditional retail grocery trade. in recent years, alternative retail grocery channels, such as dollar stores, drug stores, club stores and internet-based retailers, have increased their market share. this trend towards alternative channels is expected to continue in the future. if the company is not successful in pursuing its strategy to expand sales in alternative retail grocery channels, its business or financial results may be adversely impacted. in addition, consolidations in the traditional retail grocery trade have produced large, sophisticated customers with increased buying power and negotiating strength who may seek lower prices or increased promotional programs funded by their suppliers. these customers may use more of their shelf space for their private label products. if the company is unable to use its scale, marketing expertise, product innovation and category leadership positions to respond to these customer dynamics, the company's business or financial results could be negatively impacted.
in 2014, the company's five largest customers accounted for approximately 35% of the company's consolidated net sales, with the largest customer, wal-mart stores, inc. and its affiliates, accounting for approximately 19% of the company's consolidated net sales. disruption of sales to any of these customers, or to any of the company's other large customers, for an extended period of time could adversely affect the company's business or financial results.
if the company's food products become adulterated or are mislabeled, the company might need to recall those items, and may experience product liability claims if consumers are injured the company may need to recall some of its products if they become adulterated or if they are mislabeled, and may also be liable if the consumption of any of its products causes injury to consumers. a widespread product recall could result in significant losses due to the costs of a recall, the destruction of product inventory, and lost sales due to the unavailability of product for a period of time. the company could also suffer losses from a significant adverse product liability judgment. a significant product recall or product liability claim could also result in adverse publicity, damage to the company's reputation, and a loss of consumer confidence in the safety and/or quality of its products, ingredients or packaging. such a loss of confidence could occur even in the absence of a recall or a major product liability claim.
8
the company may be adversely impacted by inadequacies in, or security breaches of, its information technology systems the company's information technology systems are critically important to the company's operations. the company relies on its information technology systems (some of which are outsourced to third parties) to manage the data, communications and business processes for all of its functions, including its marketing, sales, manufacturing, logistics, customer service, accounting and administrative functions. if the company does not allocate and effectively manage the resources necessary to build, sustain and protect an appropriate technology infrastructure, the company's business or financial results could be negatively impacted. furthermore, the company's information technology systems may be vulnerable to material security breaches (including the access to or acquisition of customer, consumer or other confidential data), cyber-based attacks or other material system failures. if the company is unable to prevent material failures, the company's operations may be impacted, and the company may suffer other negative consequences such as reputational damage, litigation, remediation costs and/or penalties under various data privacy laws and regulations.
the company's results may be negatively impacted if consumers do not maintain their favorable perception of its brands the company has a number of iconic brands with significant value. maintaining and continually enhancing the value of these brands is critical to the success of the company's business. brand value is based in large part on consumer perceptions. success in promoting and enhancing brand value depends in large part on the company's ability to provide high-quality products. brand value could diminish significantly due to a number of factors, including consumer perception that the company has acted in an irresponsible manner, adverse publicity about the company's products, packaging and/or ingredients (whether or not valid), the company's failure to maintain the quality of its products, the failure of the company's products to deliver consistently positive consumer experiences, or the products becoming unavailable to consumers. the growing use of social and digital media by consumers increases the speed and extent that information and opinions can be shared. negative posts or comments about the company, its brands, products or packaging on social or digital media could seriously damage the company's brands and reputation. if the company does not maintain the favorable perception of its brands, the company's results could be negatively impacted.
the company may not properly execute, or realize anticipated cost savings or benefits from, its ongoing supply chain, information technology or other initiatives the company's success is partly dependent upon properly executing, and realizing cost savings or other benefits from, its ongoing supply chain, information technology and other initiatives. these initiatives are primarily designed to make the company more efficient, which is necessary in the company's highly competitive industry. these initiatives are often complex, and a failure to implement them properly may, in addition to not meeting projected cost savings or benefits, result in an interruption to the company's sales, manufacturing, logistics, customer service or accounting functions.
the company may be adversely impacted by increased liabilities and costs related to its defined benefit pension plans the company sponsors a number of defined benefit pension plans for employees in the u.s. and various non-u.s. locations. the major defined benefit pension plans are funded with trust assets invested in a globally diversified portfolio of securities and other investments. changes in regulatory requirements or the market value of plan assets, investment returns, interest rates and mortality rates may affect the funded status of the company's defined benefit pension plans and cause volatility in the net periodic benefit cost, future funding requirements of the plans and the funded status as recorded on the balance sheet. a significant increase in the company's obligations or future funding requirements could have a material adverse effect on the financial results of the company.
item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview description of the company campbell soup company is a manufacturer and marketer of high-quality, branded convenience food products. the company reports the results of operations in the following reportable segments: u.s. simple meals; global baking and snacking; international simple meals and beverages; u.s. beverages; and bolthouse and foodservice.
on august 6, 2012, the company completed the acquisition of bolthouse farms from a fund managed by madison dearborn partners, llc, a private equity firm. after taking into account customary purchase price adjustments, the final all-cash purchase price was $1.561 billion. see note 3 to the consolidated financial statements for more information on the acquisition.
on june 13, 2013, the company completed the acquisition of plum. the final all-cash purchase price was $249 million. see note 3 to the consolidated financial statements for more information on the acquisition.
on august 8, 2013, the company completed the acquisition of kelsen. the final all-cash purchase price was $331 million. see note 3 to the consolidated financial statements for more information on the acquisition.
on october 28, 2013, the company completed the sale of its european simple meals business to soppa investments s.à r.l., an affiliate of cvc capital partners. the all-cash preliminary sale price was €400 million, or $548 million, and was subject to certain post-closing adjustments, which resulted in a $14 million reduction of proceeds. the company has reflected the results of the european simple meals business as discontinued operations in the consolidated statements of earnings for all years presented. see note 4 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.
key strategies campbell's long-term goal is to build shareholder value by driving sustainable, profitable net sales growth. in its efforts to achieve this goal, the company is guided by its purpose - "real food that matters for life's moments" - which it articulated in 2014 as an expression of its core beliefs and the foundation of its historic connection with consumers. with this purpose as its compass, the company is pursuing a strategy that is focused on strengthening its established simple meals, snacks and healthy beverages businesses while diversifying its portfolio into higher-growth spaces.
campbell plans to take a number of steps in 2015 to strengthen its established businesses. in its north american soup and simple meals business, the company expects to improve performance by enhancing product quality and elevating its marketing and brand-building efforts. the company will also introduce new soup and simple meal products responsive to consumers' desire for indulgent or premium foods; their increasing appetite for ethnic and regional cuisines; and their growing interest in quick and easy home-cooking solutions. for its shelf-stable beverage business, the company will target health-conscious adults with its v8 branded beverages and households with children with its v8 splash branded beverages. pepperidge farm will remain focused on building the goldfish cracker brand, maintaining the momentum of its fresh bakery portfolio, and revitalizing its adult savory crackers business. the company will also continue its efforts to reinvigorate its businesses in australia, focusing on arnott's biscuits.
since 2013, campbell has acquired three businesses - bolthouse farms, plum and kelsen - and divested its european simple meals business as part of its effort to diversify its portfolio into higher-growth spaces. this effort will continue in 2015, with a focus on four key growth platforms:
•   accelerating breakthrough innovation, including through continued expansion of the company's dinner sauces platform and the introduction of v8 protein shakes and bars.
•   becoming a branded leader in packaged fresh foods. for example, in 2015 bolthouse farms will introduce its first kid-focused line of refrigerated snacks and beverages, building on its existing businesses in fresh carrots, super-premium beverages and salad dressings.
•   expanding in developing markets in asia and latin america, where the company already has footholds in china, indonesia, malaysia and mexico.
14
•   increasing the availability of the company's products. across its portfolio, campbell plans to increase the availability of many of its products by focusing on higher growth alternative retail grocery channels, such as the convenience, club and e-commerce channels.
executive summary this executive summary provides significant highlights from the discussion and analysis that follows.
•   there were 53 weeks in 2014. there were 52 weeks in 2013 and 2012.
•   net sales increased 3% in 2014 to $8.268 billion. the kelsen and plum acquisitions contributed 3 points of growth and the 53rd week contributed 2 points of growth.
•   gross profit, as a percent of sales, decreased to 35.1% from 36.2% a year ago. the decrease was primarily due to cost inflation and increased supply chain costs, higher promotional spending and the impact of acquisitions, partly offset by productivity improvements and a reduction in restructuring-related costs.
•   administrative expenses decreased 15% to $573 million from $677 million a year ago. the decline was primarily due to lower incentive compensation costs, cost savings from restructuring initiatives and lower pension expenses, partially offset by the impact of acquisitions.
•   earnings per share from continuing operations were $2.33 in 2014, compared to $2.17 a year ago. the current and prior year included expenses of $.20 and $.31 per share, respectively, from items impacting comparability as discussed below.

in 2014, u.s. simple meals sales increased 3%. u.s. soup sales decreased 1%. excluding the benefit of the 53rd week, u.s. soup sales decreased 2%. further details of u.s. soup, excluding the benefit of the 53rd week, include:
•   sales of campbell's condensed soups decreased 3%, with declines in eating varieties partially offset by gains in cooking varieties. lower volumes and increased promotional spending were partly offset by higher selling prices.
•   sales of ready-to-serve soups decreased 6%, primarily due to declines in canned and microwavable soup varieties.
•   broth sales increased 8%, primarily due to more effective marketing programs, innovation and distribution gains.
sales of other simple meals increased 15%, primarily due to the acquisition of plum in june 2013, which contributed 9 points of growth. excluding the impact of the acquisition and the benefit of the 53rd week, sales increased due to gains in prego pasta sauces, which benefited from the launch of alfredo sauces; and campbell's dinner sauces, which benefited from the introduction in 2014 of campbell's slow cooker sauces; partially offset by declines in campbell's canned gravy products.
in 2013, u.s. simple meals sales increased 5%, reflecting increases in u.s. soup and and other simple meals. u.s. soup sales increased 5%, benefiting from improved execution and the favorable impact of weather. further details of u.s. soup include:
•   sales of campbell's condensed soups increased 2%, with gains in both cooking and eating varieties.
•   sales of ready-to-serve soups increased 9%, due to volume-driven gains in campbell's chunky canned soups, which benefited from new varieties, increased promotional spending and a return to nfl-themed advertising.
•   broth sales increased 4%, primarily driven by double-digit gains in aseptically packaged broth, partially offset by lower sales of canned products and lower sales of swanson flavor boost concentrated broth, which was introduced in 2012.
sales of other simple meals increased 5% primarily due to the acquisition of plum in june 2013, growth in prego pasta sauces, the 2013 launch of campbell's skillet sauces, and growth in pace mexican sauces, partially offset by lower sales in other simple meals products.
in 2014, global baking and snacking sales increased 7%. the acquisition of kelsen contributed $193 million to sales, or 8 points of growth. excluding the impact of the acquisition and the benefit of the 53rd week, sales decreased primarily due to the
18
impact of currency. excluding the benefit of the 53rd week, pepperidge farm sales increased slightly with growth in fresh bakery and goldfish crackers, partially offset by declines in adult cracker varieties and frozen products. in fresh bakery, sales increased due to gains in sandwich bread and rolls. in arnott's, sales decreased primarily due to the impact of currency and sales declines in australia in savory and chocolate varieties, partially offset by strong gains in indonesia and the benefit of the 53rd week. the company increased trade spending in arnott's and pepperidge farm to remain competitive.
in 2013, global baking and snacking sales increased 4% with gains in both pepperidge farm and arnott's. pepperidge farm sales increased primarily due to growth in fresh bakery products, goldfish crackers and cookies. sales of fresh bakery products benefited from improved marketplace performance and increased shelf space at retail outlets resulting from the bankruptcy of a competitor. arnott's sales increased primarily due to gains in indonesia, partially offset by the impact of currency. promotional spending was increased by pepperidge farm for competitive reasons and to capitalize on the opportunity to increase shelf space in the u.s. bread category and in arnott's to remain competitive in the australian marketplace.
in 2014, international simple meals and beverages sales decreased 10%. in canada, sales decreased due to the impact of currency and declines in beverages, partly offset by gains in snacks. in latin america, sales declined due to the impact of presenting revenue on a net basis and lower selling prices in mexico. in the asia pacific region, sales decreased primarily due to the impact of currency and declines in australia, primarily in soup, partially offset by gains in malaysia.
in 2013, international simple meals and beverages sales were comparable to 2012. sales declines in the asia pacific region, primarily due to currency and declines in exports, were partially offset by gains in china, canada and latin america. promotional spending was increased, primarily to support the soup business in canada, in response to more intense price competition in the marketplace.
in 2014, u.s. beverages sales decreased 3%, primarily from declines in v8 v-fusion multi-serve beverages and softness in single-serve beverages, due in part to the transition in 2014 to a new distribution network for the immediate consumption channel. u.s. beverages continues to be under pressure from category weakness in shelf-stable juices, as well as from competition from specialty beverages and packaged fresh juices.
in 2013, u.s. beverages sales decreased 4% due to declines in sales of v8 vegetable juice and v8 v-fusion beverages, partially offset by an increase in v8 splash beverages. promotional spending was increased, primarily on v8 splash beverages, in response to more price-based competition in the value segment.
in 2014, bolthouse and foodservice sales increased 5%. the increase was due in part to the benefit of the 53rd week and the additional week of bolthouse sales in 2014 as the business was acquired one week into 2013. excluding the additional week of bolthouse in 2014 and the benefit of the 53rd week, segment sales increased as gains in bolthouse beverages and salad dressings were partially offset by declines in north america foodservice. the north america foodservice decline was due to volume declines in fresh soup sold at retail perimeter and the impact of currency.
in 2013, bolthouse and foodservice sales increased due to the acquisition of bolthouse farms in 2013, which contributed $756 million to sales. north america foodservice sales declined 8% primarily due to declines in frozen soup products, reflecting the loss of a major restaurant customer, and higher levels of trade spending to remain competitive.

unallocated corporate expenses in 2014 included pension settlement charges of $22 million associated with a u.s. pension plan. the settlement resulted from the level of lump sum distributions from the plan's assets in 2014, primarily due to the closure of the facility in sacramento, california. the current year also included a $9 million loss on foreign exchange forward contracts related to the sale of the european simple meals business and $3 million of restructuring-related costs. unallocated corporate expenses in 2013 included $91 million of restructuring-related costs and $10 million of transaction costs associated with the bolthouse farms acquisition. the remaining decrease in expenses was primarily due to lower incentive compensation costs and gains on foreign exchange transactions. unallocated corporate expenses in 2012 included $5 million associated with the acquisition of bolthouse farms. the remaining increase in expenses in 2013 from 2012 was primarily due to higher incentive compensation costs.
interest expense/income interest expense decreased to $122 million in 2014 from $135 million in 2013, reflecting lower interest rates on the debt portfolio. interest income decreased to $3 million from $10 million in 2013, primarily due to lower levels of cash and cash equivalents.

the decline in the effective tax rate in 2013 from 2012 was primarily due to lower state taxes, including the favorable resolution of certain matters, and an increase in the u.s. manufacturing deduction.

off-balance sheet arrangements and other commitments the company guarantees approximately 2,000 bank loans to pepperidge farm independent sales distributors by third-party financial institutions used to purchase distribution routes. the maximum potential amount of the future payments under existing guarantees the company could be required to make is $179 million. the company's guarantees are indirectly secured by the distribution routes. the company does not believe that it is probable that it will be required to make guarantee payments as a result of defaults on the bank loans guaranteed. see also note 18 to the consolidated financial statements for information on off-balance sheet arrangements.
inflation in 2014, inflation in cost of products sold was higher than 2013. in 2013, inflation in cost of products sold was lower than 2012. the company continues to use a number of strategies to mitigate the effects of cost inflation including increasing prices, commodity hedging and pursuing cost productivity initiatives such as global procurement strategies and capital investments that improve the efficiency of operations.
market risk sensitivity the principal market risks to which the company is exposed are changes in foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates and commodity prices. in addition, the company is exposed to equity price changes related to certain deferred compensation obligations. the company manages its exposure to changes in interest rates by optimizing the use of variable-rate and fixed-rate debt and by utilizing interest rate swaps in order to maintain its variable-to-total debt ratio within targeted guidelines. international operations, which accounted for 22% of 2014 net sales from continuing operations, are concentrated principally in australia and canada. the company manages its foreign currency exposures by borrowing in various foreign currencies and utilizing cross-currency swaps and forward contracts. cross-currency swaps and forward contracts are entered into for periods consistent with related underlying exposures and do not constitute positions independent of those exposures. the company does not enter into contracts for speculative purposes and does not use leveraged instruments.
the company principally uses a combination of purchase orders and various short- and long-term supply arrangements in connection with the purchase of raw materials, including certain commodities and agricultural products. the company also enters into commodity futures, options and swap contracts to reduce the volatility of price fluctuations of diesel fuel, soybean oil, wheat, aluminum, natural gas, cocoa and corn, which impact the cost of raw materials.

the company enters into commodity futures and options contracts to reduce the volatility of price fluctuations for commodities. the notional value of these contracts was $146 million, and the aggregate fair value of these contracts was a loss of $9 million as of august 3, 2014. the notional value of these contracts was $105 million, and the aggregate fair value of these contracts was a loss of $4 million as of july 28, 2013.
the company enters into swap contracts which hedge a portion of exposures relating to certain deferred compensation obligations linked to the total return of the company's capital stock, the total return of the vanguard institutional index, and the total return of the vanguard total international stock index. under these contracts, the company pays variable interest rates and receives from the counterparty either the total return on company capital stock; the total return of the standard & poor's 500 index, which is expected to approximate the total return of the vanguard institutional index; or the total return of the ishares msci eafe index, which is expected to approximate the total return of the vanguard total international stock index. the notional value of the contract that is linked to the total return on company capital stock was $25 million at august 3, 2014 and $26 million at july 28, 2013. the average forward interest rate applicable to this contract, which expires in 2015, was 0.61% at august 3, 2014. the notional value of the contract that is linked to the return on the standard & poor's 500 index was $22 million at august 3, 2014 and $19 million at july 28, 2013. the average forward interest rate applicable to this contract, which expires in 2015, was 0.61% at august 3, 2014. the notional value of the contract that is linked to the total return of the ishares msci eafe index was $9 million at august 3, 2014 and $5 million at july 28, 2013. the average forward interest rate applicable to this contract, which expires in 2015, was 0.56% at august 3, 2014. the fair value of these contracts was a $3 million loss at august 3, 2014 and a $2 million gain at july 28, 2013.
the company's utilization of financial instruments in managing market risk exposures described above is consistent with the prior year. changes in the portfolio of financial instruments are a function of the results of operations, debt repayment and debt issuances, market effects on debt and foreign currency, and the company's acquisition and divestiture activities.
significant accounting estimates the consolidated financial statements of the company are prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states. the preparation of these financial statements requires the use of estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented. actual results could differ from those estimates and assumptions. see note 1 to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of significant accounting policies. the following areas all require the use of subjective or complex judgments, estimates and assumptions:
trade and consumer promotion programs - the company offers various sales incentive programs to customers and consumers, such as feature price discounts, in-store display incentives, cooperative advertising programs, new product introduction fees, and coupons. the mix between promotion programs, which are classified as reductions in revenue, and advertising or other marketing activities, which are classified as marketing and selling expenses, fluctuates between periods based on the company's overall marketing plans, and such fluctuations have an impact on revenues. the measurement and recognition of the costs for trade and consumer promotion programs involves the use of judgment related to performance and redemption estimates. estimates are made based on historical experience and other factors. typically, programs that are offered have a very short duration. historically, the difference between actual experience compared to estimated redemptions and performance has not been significant to the quarterly or annual financial statements. however, actual expenses may differ if the level of redemption rates and performance were to vary from estimates.
valuation of long-lived assets - fixed assets and amortizable intangible assets are reviewed for impairment as events or changes in circumstances occur indicating that the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable. undiscounted cash flow analyses are used to determine if impairment exists. if impairment is determined to exist, the loss is calculated based on estimated fair value.
goodwill and intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives are not amortized but rather are tested at least annually for impairment, or more often if events or changes in circumstances indicate that more likely than not the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable. goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level. a reporting unit represents an operating segment or a component of an operating segment. goodwill is tested for impairment by either performing a qualitative evaluation or a two-step quantitative test. the qualitative evaluation is an assessment of factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, including goodwill. the company may elect not to perform the qualitative assessment for some or all reporting units and perform a two-step quantitative impairment test. fair value is determined based on discounted cash flow analyses. the discounted estimates of future cash flows include significant management assumptions such as revenue growth rates, operating margins, weighted average cost of capital, and future economic and market conditions. if the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds fair value, goodwill is considered impaired. the amount of the impairment is the difference between the carrying value of the goodwill and the "implied" fair value, which is calculated as if the reporting unit had just been acquired and accounted for as a business combination.
29
indefinite-lived intangible assets are tested for impairment by comparing the fair value of the asset to the carrying value. fair value is determined based on discounted cash flow analyses that include significant management assumptions such as revenue growth rates, weighted average cost of capital, and assumed royalty rates. if the fair value is less than the carrying value, the asset is reduced to fair value.
as of august 3, 2014, the carrying value of goodwill was $2,433 million. as of august 3, 2014, goodwill related to the acquisitions in 2013 and 2014 was as follows: bolthouse farms - $692 million, plum - $128 million and kelsen - $140 million. as of the 2014 measurement, the estimated fair value of each reporting unit significantly exceeded the carrying value, excluding the 2013 and 2014 acquisitions. holding all other assumptions used in the 2014 fair value measurement constant, a 100-basis-point increase in the weighted average cost of capital would not result in the carrying value of any reporting unit, excluding the 2013 and 2014 acquisitions, to be in excess of the fair value. within the acquisitions, the fair value exceeded the carrying value of reporting units by at least 4% and as a result, holding all other assumptions used in the 2014 fair value measurement constant, a 100-basis-point increase in the weighted average cost of capital would result in the carrying value to be in excess of the fair value. the fair value was based on significant management assumptions. if assumptions are not achieved or market conditions decline, potential impairment charges could result.
as of august 3, 2014, the carrying value of indefinite-lived trademarks was $957 million. as of august 3, 2014, trademarks related to the acquisitions in 2013 and 2014 were as follows: bolthouse farms - $383 million, plum - $115 million and kelsen - $147 million. holding all other assumptions used in the 2014 measurement constant, a 100-basis-point increase in the weighted average cost of capital would reduce the fair value of trademarks, and result in an impairment charge of approximately $25 million.
in the fourth quarter of 2013, as part of the company's annual review of intangible assets, an impairment charge of $360 million was recorded on goodwill and $36 million on trademarks for the simple meals business in europe. the impairment was attributable to a combination of factors, including the existence of a firm offer to purchase the business; a revised future outlook for the business, with reduced expectations for future sales and discounted cash flows, given the economic uncertainty in the region; future investments required to maintain performance; and management's assumptions on the weighted average cost of capital. on august 12, 2013, the company announced that it was in final and exclusive negotiations for the potential sale of this business. the company has reflected the results of the business as discontinued operations in the consolidated statements of earnings for all years presented. the business was historically included in the international simple meals and beverages segment. the assets and liabilities have been reflected in assets and liabilities held for sale in the consolidated balance sheet as of july 28, 2013. on october 28, 2013, the company completed the sale of its european simple meals business. see note 4 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on discontinued operations.
in 2012, as part of the company's annual review of intangible assets, an impairment charge of $3 million was recognized related to a trademark used in the european simple meals business, formerly included in the international simple meals and beverages segment. the trademark was determined to be impaired as a result of a decrease in the fair value of the brand, resulting from reduced expectations for future sales and discounted cash flows in comparison to the prior year.
the estimates of future cash flows involve considerable management judgment and are based upon assumptions about expected future operating performance, economic conditions, market conditions, and cost of capital. inherent in estimating the future cash flows are uncertainties beyond the company's control, such as capital markets. the actual cash flows could differ materially from management's estimates due to changes in business conditions, operating performance, and economic conditions.
see also note 6 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on goodwill and intangible assets.
pension and postretirement benefits - the company provides certain pension and postretirement benefits to employees and retirees. determining the cost associated with such benefits is dependent on various actuarial assumptions, including discount rates, expected return on plan assets, compensation increases, turnover rates and health care trend rates. independent actuaries, in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states, perform the required calculations to determine expense. actual results that differ from the actuarial assumptions are generally accumulated and amortized over future periods.
the discount rate is established as of the company's fiscal year-end measurement date. in establishing the discount rate, the company reviews published market indices of high-quality debt securities, adjusted as appropriate for duration. in addition, independent actuaries apply high-quality bond yield curves to the expected benefit payments of the plans. the expected return on plan assets is a long-term assumption based upon historical experience and expected future performance, considering the company's current and projected investment mix. this estimate is based on an estimate of future inflation, long-term projected real returns for each asset class, and a premium for active management. within any given fiscal period, significant differences may arise between the actual return and the expected return on plan assets. the value of plan assets, used in the calculation of pension expense, is determined on a calculated method that recognizes 20% of the difference between the actual fair value of assets and the expected calculated method. gains and losses resulting from differences between actual experience and the assumptions are determined at each measurement date. if the net gain or loss exceeds 10% of the greater of plan assets or liabilities, a portion is amortized into earnings in the following year.
net periodic pension and postretirement expense was $109 million in 2014, $130 million in 2013 and $102 million in 2012.
30
significant weighted-average assumptions as of the end of the year were as follows:
2014                                            2013         2012
pension discount rate for benefit obligations   4.33%        4.82%        4.05%
expected return on plan assets          7.62%        7.62%        7.65%
postretirement discount rate for obligations           4.00%        4.50%        3.75%
initial health care trend rate          8.25%        8.25%        8.25%
ultimate health care trend rate         4.50%        4.50%        4.50%
estimated sensitivities to annual net periodic pension cost are as follows: a 50-basis-point reduction in the discount rate would increase expense by approximately $12 million; a 50-basis-point reduction in the estimated return on assets assumption would increase expense by approximately $12 million. a one-percentage-point increase in assumed health care costs would increase postretirement service and interest cost by approximately $1 million.
net periodic pension and postretirement expense is expected to decrease to approximately $75 million in 2015. the reduction is primarily due to pension settlement charges of $22 million recognized in 2014 associated with a u.s. pension plan. the settlements resulted from the level of lump sum distributions from the plan's assets in 2014, primarily due to the closure of the facility in sacramento, california.
the company contributed $35 million, $75 million and $55 million, respectively, to u.s. pension plans in 2014, 2013 and 2012. contributions to non-u.s. plans were $12 million in 2014 and 2013, and $16 million in 2012. the company does not expect to contribute to the u.s. pension plans in 2015. contributions to non-u.s. plans are expected to be approximately $6 million in 2015.

income taxes - the effective tax rate reflects statutory tax rates, tax planning opportunities available in the various jurisdictions in which the company operates and management's estimate of the ultimate outcome of various tax audits and issues. significant judgment is required in determining the effective tax rate and in evaluating tax positions. income taxes are recorded based on amounts refundable or payable in the current year and include the effect of deferred taxes. deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future impact of differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases, as well as for operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those differences are expected to be recovered or settled. valuation allowances are established for deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will not be realized.

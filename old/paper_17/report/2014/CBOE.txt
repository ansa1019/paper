item 1a.    risk factors the risks and uncertainties described below are those that we believe are material at this time. these risks and uncertainties, however, are not the only risks and uncertainties that we face. additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial may also significantly impact us. any of these risks and uncertainties may materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations, liquidity and cash flows.
risks relating to our business loss of our right to exclusively list certain index options and futures could have a material adverse effect on our financial performance.
we hold exclusive licenses to list securities index options on the s&p 500 index, the s&p 100 index and the djia, granted to us by the owners of such indexes and have developed our proprietary vix methodology. in 2014, approximately 81.8% of our transaction fees were generated by our futures and index options, the overwhelming majority of which were generated by our exclusively-licensed products and products based on the vix methodology. the bulk of this revenue is attributable to our s&p 500 index options and vix index options and futures. as a result, our operating revenues are dependent in part on the exclusive licenses we hold for these products and our ability to maintain our exclusive vix methodology.
there is a risk, with respect to each of our current exclusive licenses, that the owner of the index may not renew the license with us on an exclusive basis or at all. in the first event, we would be subject to multiple listing in the trading of what is now an exclusive index product, which could result in a loss of market share and negatively impact our profitability. in the second event, we could lose the right to list the index product entirely. the loss or limited use of any of our exclusive index licenses, especially for the s&p 500 index, for any reason could have a material adverse effect on our business and profitability. see "business-products-strategic relationships" for a discussion of these licenses and their expiration dates.
in addition to the risks related to our exclusive licenses, if we are unable to retain our proprietary rights in the vix methodology, our volatility products could be subject to multiple listing or loss of the ability to offer these products for trading, which could have a material adverse effect on us.
in addition, the european parliament has adopted legislation that requires european exchanges to provide non-discriminatory access to benchmarks, like index options, and is considering other legislation that may impact the ability of european banks to trade our products. while similar legislation has not been proposed in the united states, if it were passed, it could cause us to lose our property rights in our internally developed and licensed index products. the adopted and proposed european legislation may limit our ability to expand our activities in europe while retaining our property rights, and may reduce the volume on our exchanges from international customers.
furthermore, our competitors may succeed in providing a market for the trading of index-based or volatility products that are economically similar to those that we offer. it is also possible that a third party may offer trading in index-based products that are the same as those that are the subject of one of our exclusive licenses, but in a jurisdiction in which the index owner cannot require a license or in a manner otherwise not covered by our exclusive license.
the value of our exclusive licenses to list securities index options also depends on the continued ability of index owners to require licenses for the trading of options based on their indexes. although we and the index owners have prevailed in legal actions challenging our rights to exclusively license indexes, we may be subject to legal or other action taken in the future that might impede our ability to exclusively license indexes.
we agreed with s&p that it may license one or more clearing agencies to clear otc options based on the s&p 500 index that meet certain criteria, and that s&p will compensate us for any transaction cleared under such a license based on the notional value of the transaction. although we expect these transactions to generate incremental revenue, the clearing of options on the s&p 500 index that are traded otc could lead to the migration to the otc market of some trades that today would be entered into on our exchanges, and there can be no assurance that the revenue gained will replace the revenue lost due to any migration.
our business may be adversely affected by price competition.
the business of operating options exchanges is characterized by intense price competition, especially with respect to transaction fees. the pricing model for trade execution for options has changed in response to competitive market conditions and our competitors have adjusted transaction fees and fee structures accordingly, including by opening new exchanges, which
18
allow them to offer multiple pricing models that can appeal to different segments of market participants. these changes have resulted in significant pricing pressures on us, especially on transaction fees for multiply-listed products. as a result of these pricing pressures, our average rate per multiply-listed options contract has decreased from $0.143 in 2012 to $0.092 in 2014. it is likely that this pressure will continue and even intensify as our competitors continue to seek to increase their share of trading by further reducing their transaction fees or by offering other financial incentives to order providers and liquidity providers to induce them to direct orders to their markets.
in addition, one or more competitors may engage in aggressive pricing strategies and significantly decrease or completely eliminate their profit margin for a period of time in order to capture a greater share of trading volume. some order-providing firms on our exchanges have taken ownership positions in options exchanges that compete with us and such exchanges have given those firms added economic incentives to direct orders to them.
like nearly all of the other options exchanges, our options exchanges charge an options regulatory fee or orf to trading permit holders based on the total number of customer contracts cleared by that trading permit holder, regardless of the exchange on which the trade is executed.  along with fines and other regulatory fees, the orf revenues may only be used to support our regulatory functions.  we may face competitive pressures to further reduce or not increase the orfs on our exchanges, and if we are unable to maintain or, if necessary, increase the orfs, our results of operation may be adversely affected.
we could lose a substantial percentage of our share of trading if we are unable to price transactions in a competitive manner. also, our profits could decline if competitive pressures force us to reduce fees. if any of these events occur, our operating results and profitability could be adversely affected.
we operate in a highly regulated industry and may be subject to censures, fines and other legal proceedings if we fail to comply with legal and regulatory obligations.
cboe and c2 are registered national securities exchanges and sros, and, as such, are subject to comprehensive regulation by the sec. cfe is a dcm registered with the cftc and is subject to comprehensive regulation by the cftc. see "business -- compliance - securities industry -- cboe and c2" for information regarding our ongoing regulatory responsibilities for cbsx.
in addition to the requirements related to operating our markets imposed by the sec and the cftc, we also have certain responsibilities for regulating the tphs that trade on our exchanges. while we have entered into agreements under which finra and other sros with respect to our options exchanges, and nfa with respect to our futures exchange, provide certain regulatory services, we retain responsibility for the regulation of our trading permit holders. see "business -- regulatory responsibilities."
our ability to comply with applicable laws and rules is largely dependent on the establishment and maintenance of appropriate systems and procedures, our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel, the ability of finra and nfa to perform under the regulatory services agreements and our oversight of the work done by finra and nfa. the sec and cftc have broad powers to audit, investigate and enforce compliance and to punish noncompliance by sros and dcms, respectively, pursuant to applicable laws, rules and regulations.
if the sec were to find one of our programs of enforcement or compliance to be deficient, cboe or c2 could be the subject of sec investigations and enforcement proceedings that may result in substantial sanctions, including revocation of an exchange's registration as a national securities exchange. any such investigations or proceedings, whether successful or unsuccessful, could result in substantial costs, the diversion of resources, including management time, and potential harm to our reputation, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition. in addition, cboe or c2 may be required to modify or restructure their regulatory functions in response to any changes in the regulatory environment, or they may be required to rely on third parties to perform regulatory and oversight functions, each of which may require us to incur substantial expenses and may harm our reputation if our regulatory services are deemed inadequate.
although cboe holdings itself is not an sro, cboe holdings is subject to regulation by the sec of activities that involve the exchanges. specifically, the sec will exercise oversight over the governance of cboe holdings and its relationship with cboe and c2. see "regulatory environment and compliance-regulatory responsibilities."
if we are unable to execute the undertakings in the consent order, it may have a significant adverse impact on our business.
on june 11, 2013, cboe and c2 entered into the consent order with the sec under which cboe and c2 were censured, ordered to cease and desist from violating certain sections of the securities exchange act, paid a fine of $6 million and agreed to complete certain undertakings. these undertakings included conducting a review of our regulatory programs,
19
enterprise risk management and business influences on regulation; reviewing business practices to ensure compliance with the rules of the exchanges; and implementing training programs for employees. the consent order also requires on-going certifications by cboe and c2's chief executive officer and chief regulatory officer for five years.
we may be subject to additional investigations or proceedings by the sec if the sec were to find that we did not fulfill our obligations under the consent order. any investigations or proceedings, whether successful or unsuccessful, could result in substantial costs, the diversion of resources, including management time, and potential harm to our reputation, which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition.
a significant portion of our operating revenues is generated by our transaction-based business. if the amount of trading volume on our exchanges decreases, or the product mix shifts to lower revenue products, our revenues from transaction fees will decrease.
in 2014, 2013 and 2012, approximately 70.9%, 69.4% and 69.7% of our operating revenues, respectively, were generated by our transaction-based business. this business is dependent on our ability to attract and maintain order flow, both in absolute terms and relative to other market centers. our total trading volumes could decline if our market participants reduce their trading activity for any reason, such as:
•   a reduction in trading by customers,
•   heightened capital requirements,
•   regulatory or legislative actions,
•   reduced access to capital required to fund trading activities, or
•   significant market disruptions.
over the past few years, a number of legislative actions have been taken, both domestically and internationally, that may cause our customers, including market makers, to be subject to increased capital requirements and additional compliance burdens. these actions, including basel iii, dodd-frank and the collins amendment to dodd-frank, may cause customers to reduce the number of trades they make on our exchanges.
in addition, the transaction fees generated are different based on type of product and other factors, including the type of customer and certain volume discounts. see "management's discussion and analysis -- operating revenues -- average revenue per contract." if the amount of our trading volume decreases, or the mix traded shifts to our lower revenue per contract products, our revenues from transaction fees will decrease. we can offer no assurance that we would be able to reduce our costs to match the amount of any such decrease.
legislative or regulatory changes affecting the listed options market could have a material adverse effect on our business.
changes in regulation by the sec, cftc or other government action, including sec approval of rule filings by other sros or entities, including occ, could materially affect our markets. in recent years, the securities and futures industries have been subject to significant regulatory changes as a result of increasing government and public scrutiny in response to the global economic crisis.
in 2010, congress passed the dodd-frank act and other legislation. while many of its requirements have been implemented or are in the process of being implemented, some of the provisions in dodd-frank that impact our markets require additional action by the sec or the cftc. depending on how the sec and cftc interpret and implement these laws, exchanges like ours could be subject to increased competition and additional costs. we could also see reduced trading by our customers due to margin or other requirements placed on them.
under the collins amendment to the dodd-frank act, starting in 2015, u.s. banks are required to use a new approach in order to compute their risk weighted assets, which include exchange-traded options and futures. this is expected to increase the capital requirements for u.s. bank holding companies, and bank subsidiaries involved in the trading and clearing of derivatives. these increased capital requirements may reduce trading in options and futures due to bank-affiliated broker-dealers reducing their own trading, charge their customers more to trade or reducing the type or number of customers.
in 2012, the sec directed the self-regulatory organizations to submit a plan to create, implement and maintain a consolidated audit trail, which would serve as a comprehensive audit trail of orders that will allow regulators to efficiently and accurately track all activity in regulation nms securities in the u.s. market. in addition to increased regulatory obligations, implementation of a consolidated audit trail could result in significant additional expenditures, including to implement any new technology to meet any plan's requirements. the sec has also adopted regulation systems compliance and integrity ("reg sci") and established working groups of exchanges to focus on improving market resiliency. meeting the requirements of reg
20
sci or other regulations or mandates generated by these working groups could result in significant additional expenses, including for technology and compliance.
it is also possible that there will be additional legislative and regulatory changes or efforts in the environment in which we operate our businesses, although we cannot predict the nature of these changes or their impact on our business at this time. actions on any of the specific regulatory issues currently under review in the u.s. and other proposals could have a material impact on our business. for a discussion of the regulatory environment in which we operate and proposed regulatory changes, see "business-regulatory environment and compliance."
in addition, congress, the sec and other regulatory authorities could impose legislative or regulatory changes that could adversely impact the ability of our market participants to use our markets, or participate in the options or futures industry at all. any such changes could result in the loss of a significant number of market participants or a reduction in trading activity on our markets, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business. changes or proposed changes in regulation may also result in additional costs of compliance and modification of market participants' trading activity on our exchanges.
intense competition could materially adversely affect our market share and financial performance.
we compete with a number of entities on several different fronts, including the cost, quality and speed of our trade execution, functionality and ease of use of our trading platform, range of our products and services, our technological innovation and adaptation and our reputation. we compete with futures exchanges and swap execution facilities that offer comparable products and with the over-the-counter market with respect to our proprietary products. with respect to our multiply-listed products, our principal competitors are the ten other u.s. options exchanges. see the risk factor "our business may be adversely affected by price competition."
most of the equity options and options on etps listed and traded on our exchanges are also listed and traded on other u.s. options exchanges. changes we have implemented in response to competitive pressures may not be successful in maintaining or expanding our market share in those products in the future. likewise, our future responses to these or other competitive developments may not be successful in maintaining or expanding our market share.
some of our competitors and potential competitors have greater financial, marketing, technological, personnel and other resources than we do. these factors may enable them to develop similar or more innovative products, to offer lower transaction fees or better execution to their customers or to execute their business strategies more quickly or efficiently than we can.
furthermore, our competitors may:
•   respond more quickly to competitive pressures;
•   develop products that compete with our products or are preferred by our customers;
•   develop and expand their technology and service offerings more efficiently;
•   provide better, more user-friendly and more reliable technology;
•   take greater advantage of acquisitions, alliances and other opportunities;
•   market, promote and sell their products and services more effectively;
•   leverage existing relationships with customers and alliance partners more effectively or exploit brand names to market and sell their services; and
•   exploit regulatory disparities between traditional, regulated exchanges and alternative markets, including over-the-counter markets, that benefit from a reduced regulatory burden and lower-cost business model.
the derivatives industry has witnessed both the consolidation of exchange holding companies and the growth in the number of exchanges, with a doubling of the number of options exchanges over the past decade. consolidation or alliances among our competitors may achieve cost reductions or other increases in efficiency, which may allow them to offer better prices or services than we do. the increase to the number of competitors that we face may result in fragmentation of the market and a reduced market share for our exchanges.
if our products, markets, services and technology are not competitive, our financial condition and operating results would be materially harmed. a decline in our transaction fees or any loss of customers would lower our revenues, which would adversely affect our profitability. for a discussion of the competitive environment in which we operate, see "business-competition."
we depend on third party service providers for certain services that are important to our business. an interruption or cessation of such service by any third party could have a material adverse effect on our business.
21
we depend on a number of service providers, including clearing organizations such as the occ and its member clearing firms; securities information processors such as the consolidated tape association and opra; regulatory service providers such as finra and nfa; the host of our data center; and various vendors of communications and networking products and services. more specifically:
•   occ is the sole provider of clearing on all of our exchanges. if it were unable to perform clearing services, or its clearing members were unable or unwilling to clear through occ, transactions could likely not occur on our markets.
•   opra, utp securities information processor and the consolidated tape association consolidate market information to provide market and regulatory information. if one or both of them were unable to provide this information for a sustained period of time, we may be unable to offer trading on our options markets.
•   finra and nfa provide regulatory services for our options and futures exchanges, respectively, while, in most cases, we retain regulatory responsibilities for such services. if finra or nfa stopped providing services, or provided inadequate services, we may be subject to action by the sec or cftc, or may have limitations placed upon our markets.
•   we are heavily dependent on technology for our markets, including our data center, which is housed by a third party, and certain communications and networking products and services. if this technology is unavailable, and cannot be replaced in a short time period, we may be unable to operate our markets.
we cannot provide assurance that any of these providers will be able to continue to provide these services in an efficient manner or that they will be able to adequately expand their services to meet our needs. an interruption or malfunction in or the cessation of an important service by a third party could cause us to halt trading in some or all of our products or our services, or make us unable to conduct other aspects of our business. in addition, our inability to make alternative arrangements in a timely manner, or at all, could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and operating results.
we may not be able to protect our intellectual property rights.
we rely on patent, trade secret, copyright and trademark laws, the law of the doctrine of misappropriation and contractual protections to protect our proprietary technology, proprietary index and futures products, index methodologies and other proprietary rights. in addition, we rely on the intellectual property rights of our licensors in connection with our listing of exclusively-licensed index and futures products. we and our licensors may not be able to prevent third parties from copying, or otherwise obtaining and using, our intellectual property without authorization, listing our proprietary or exclusively-licensed index products without licenses or otherwise infringing on our rights. we and our licensors may have to rely on litigation to enforce our intellectual property rights, determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others or defend against claims of infringement or invalidity. we and our licensors may not be successful in this regard. such litigation, whether successful or unsuccessful, could result in substantial costs to us, diversion of our resources or a reduction in our revenues, any of which could materially adversely affect our business.
any infringement by us on patent rights of others could result in litigation and could have a material adverse effect on our operations.
our competitors, as well as others, have obtained, or may obtain, patents that are related to our technology or the types of products and services we offer or plan to offer. we may not be aware of all patents containing claims that may pose a risk of infringement by our products, services or technologies. in addition, some patent applications in the united states are confidential until a patent is issued, and therefore we cannot evaluate the extent to which our products and services may be covered or asserted to be covered in pending patent applications. thus, we cannot be sure that our products and services do not infringe on the rights of others or that others will not make claims of infringement against us. claims of infringement are not uncommon in our industry. if one or more of our products, services or technologies were determined to infringe a patent held by another party, we may be required to pay damages, stop using, developing or marketing those products, services or technologies, obtain a license from the holders of the patents or redesign those products, services or technologies to avoid infringing the patent. if we were required to stop using, developing or marketing certain products, our business, results of operations and financial condition could be materially harmed. moreover, if we were unable to obtain required licenses, we may not be able to redesign our products, services or technologies to avoid infringement, which could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial condition.
computer and communications systems failures and capacity constraints could harm our reputation and our business.
we operate, monitor and maintain our computer systems and networks, including the systems that comprise cboe command, the platform for trading on our exchanges. if we are unable to operate, monitor or maintain these systems and networks, or program them so that they operate correctly and maintain the integrity of their data, it could have a material
22
adverse effect on our ability to conduct our business. although we have a complete back-up of cboe and cfe, the back-up systems or disaster recovery plans may prove to be inadequate in the event of a systems failure or cyber-security breach. despite the enhancements made to our disaster recovery facilities, there can be no guarantees that we will be able to open an efficient, transparent and liquid marketplace, if we can open at all.
in addition, we have extended the trading hours on cfe for vix futures, and expect to extend the trading hours in 2015 for certain products on cboe. with extended trading hours, we have to operate our systems longer and have fewer non-trading hours to address any potential concerns with the systems on which we rely.
our systems may fail, in whole or in part, or may operate slowly, causing one or more of the following:
•   unanticipated disruption in service to our participants,
•   failures or delays during peak trading times or times of unusual market volatility,
•   slower response times and delays in trade execution and processing,
•   incomplete or inaccurate accounting, recording or processing of trades, and
•   distribution of inaccurate or untimely market data to participants who rely on this data in their trading activity.
any of these events may cause:
•   a loss in transaction or other fees due to the inability to provide services for a time,
•   requests by market participants or others that we reimburse them for financial loss, either within the constraints of the limited liability provisions of our exchanges' rules or in excess of those amounts,
•   trading to diminish on our exchanges due to dissatisfaction with the platform, and
•   one or more of our regulators to investigate or take enforcement action against us.
as a consequence of any of these events, our business, financial condition and results of operations could suffer materially.
in addition to other measures, we test our systems to confirm whether they will be able to handle anticipated present and future peak trading volume or times of unusual market volatility. however, we cannot assure you that our estimates of future trading volume will be accurate or that our systems will always be able to accommodate actual trading volume without failure or degradation of performance.
we anticipate that we will need to continue to make significant investments in hardware, software and telecommunications infrastructure to accommodate the increases in traffic. if we cannot increase the capacity and capabilities of our systems to accommodate an increasing volume of transactions and to execute our business strategy, our ability to maintain or expand our businesses would be adversely affected.
the computer systems and communication networks upon which we rely may be vulnerable to security risks and other disruptions.
the secure and reliable operation of our computer systems, our communications networks and the systems of our service providers and market participants, is a critical element of our operations. these systems and communications networks may be vulnerable to unauthorized access, including the improper access of personally identifiable information, malware and other security problems, as well as to acts of terrorism, natural disasters and other events that are beyond our control. if our security measures are inadequate or if there are interruptions or malfunctions in our systems or communications networks, our business, financial condition and operating results could be materially impacted. we may be required to expend significant resources in the event of any real or threatened breaches in security or system failures, including to protect against threatened breaches and to alleviate harm caused by an actual breach, and may suffer harm to our reputation and litigation. measures we implement for security and otherwise to provide for the confidentiality, integrity and reliability of our systems may prove to be inadequate in preventing system failures or delays in our systems or communications networks, which could lower trading volume and have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results.
general economic conditions and other factors beyond our control could significantly reduce demand for our products and services and harm our business.
the volume of options and futures transactions and the demand for our products and services are directly affected by economic, political and market conditions in the united states and elsewhere in the world that are beyond our control, including:
23
•   broad trends in business and finance;
•   concerns over inflation and wavering institutional or retail confidence levels;
•   changes in government fiscal and monetary policy and foreign currency exchange rates;
•   the availability of short-term and long-term funding and capital;
•   the availability of alternative investment opportunities;
•   changes in the level of trading activity in underlying instruments;
•   changes and volatility in the prices of securities;
•   the level and volatility of interest rates;
•   unforeseen market closures or other disruptions in trading; and
•   concerns about terrorism and war.
general economic conditions affect options and futures trading in a variety of ways, from the availability of capital to investor confidence. the economic climate in recent years has been characterized by challenging business, economic and political conditions throughout the world. adverse changes in the economy may have a negative impact on our revenues by causing a decline in trading volume. significant declines in trading volumes or demand for market data may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results.
we may not be able to maintain operating revenues generated by making trading permits available in exchange for a fee.
the right to trade on our exchanges is made available through trading permits for which the user pays a fee. these fees account for a significant portion of our operating revenues -- 9.6% in 2014. cboe charges the highest relative trading permit rates in the options industry. we may face pressure from our customers to lower these rates or may see larger firms electing to use fewer permits to access our exchanges. if the demand for trading permits to our exchanges is less than historic levels or if we are unable to maintain permit rates, our ability to generate operating revenues through the granting of permits for trading access would be negatively impacted, which could adversely affect our profitability.
potential conflicts of interest between our for-profit status and our regulatory responsibilities may adversely affect our business.
as a for-profit business with regulatory responsibilities, we are responsible for disciplining tphs for violating our rules, including by imposing fines and sanctions. this may create a conflict of interest between our business interests and our regulatory responsibilities. any failure by us to fulfill our regulatory obligations could significantly harm our reputation, increase regulatory scrutiny or cause the sec or cftc to take action against us, all of which could adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial condition.
our compliance methods might not be effective and may result in outcomes that could adversely affect our financial condition and operating results.
as the parent company for sros, we are responsible for maintaining exchanges that comply with securities and futures laws, and sec and cftc regulations and the rules of the respective exchanges. our ability to comply with applicable laws and rules is largely dependent on our policies and procedures designed to meet those compliance responsibilities, as well as our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel throughout the company. our policies and procedures to identify, monitor and manage compliance risks may not be fully effective. management of legal and regulatory risk requires policies and procedures to properly monitor, record and verify a large number of transactions and events. we cannot provide assurance that our policies and procedures will always be effective or that we will always be successful in monitoring or evaluating the compliance risks to which we are or may be exposed, or that our compliance and internal audit functions would be able to identify any such ineffectiveness. if these policies and procedures are not effective, we may be subject to monetary or other penalties by our regulators.
if we fail to attract or retain highly skilled management and other employees, our business may be harmed.
our future success depends in large part on our management team, which possesses extensive knowledge and managerial skill with respect to the critical aspects of our business. the failure to retain members of our management team could adversely affect our ability to manage our business effectively and execute our business strategy.
our business is also dependent on highly skilled employees, especially those who provide specialized services to our clients and oversee our technology functions. many of these employees have extensive knowledge and experience in highly
24
technical and complex areas of the options trading industry. because of the complexity and risks associated with our business and the specialized knowledge required to conduct this business effectively, and because the growth in our industry has increased demand for qualified personnel, many of our employees could find employment at other firms if they chose to do so, particularly if we fail to continue to provide competitive levels of compensation. if we fail to retain our current employees, it would be difficult and costly to identify, recruit and train replacements needed to continue to conduct and expand our business. in particular, failure to retain and attract qualified systems personnel could result in systems errors. consequently, our reputation may be harmed, we may incur additional costs and our profitability could decline.
we may not effectively manage our growth, which could materially harm our business.
over the past five years, we have demutualized, launched a second options exchange, experienced significantly increased volume on our futures exchange and extended trading hours on our futures exchange, and plan to extend trading hours in spx and vix options. we expect that our business will continue to grow, which may place a significant strain on our management, personnel, systems and resources. we must continually improve our operational, financial and regulatory systems and managerial controls and procedures, and may need to continue to expand, train and manage our workforce. we must also maintain close coordination among our technology, accounting, finance, marketing, sales, regulatory and compliance functions. we cannot assure you that we will manage our growth effectively. if we fail to do so, our business could be materially harmed.
our continued growth will require increased investment by us in technology, facilities, personnel, and financial and management systems and controls. it also will require expansion of our procedures for monitoring and assuring our compliance with applicable regulations, and we will need to integrate, train and manage a growing employee base. the expansion of our existing businesses, any expansion into new businesses and the resulting growth of our employee base will increase our need for internal audit and monitoring processes, which may be more extensive and broader in scope than those we have historically required. we may not be successful in identifying or implementing all of the processes that are necessary. further, unless our growth results in an increase in our revenues that is proportionally greater than or equal to the increase in our costs associated with this growth, our operating margins will be adversely affected.
our ability to implement or amend rules could be limited or delayed because of regulation, which could negatively affect our ability to implement needed changes.
our options exchanges registered with the sec must submit proposed rule changes to the sec for its review and, in many cases, its approval. even where a proposed rule change may be effective upon filing with the sec, the sec retains the right to suspend and disapprove such rule changes. also, the cftc may stay or disapprove rules that we file with it for cfe, our futures exchange. the rule review process can be lengthy and can significantly delay the implementation of proposed rule changes that we believe are necessary to the operation of our markets. if the sec or cftc delays or does not allow one of our exchanges to implement a rule change, this could negatively affect our ability to make needed changes or implement business activities.
similarly, the sec must approve amendments to our options exchange subsidiaries' certificates of incorporation and bylaws as well as certain amendments to the certificate of incorporation and bylaws of cboe holdings. the sec may decide not to approve a proposed amendment or may delay such approval in a manner that could negatively affect our ability to make a desired change, which could prevent or delay us from improving the operations of our markets or recognize income from new products.
as one of the largest options exchanges in the world and the largest options exchange in the u.s., we may be at a greater risk for a cyber attack and other cyber security risks.
the frequency of cyber attacks is increasing in general, and various groups have specifically targeted the financial services industry due to its perceived role in the economic and political climate. at the date of this filing, we have no evidence of any cases of data theft, corruption or destruction of data or compromised customer data. security breaches may have significant costs in terms of cash outlays, business disruption, revenue losses, internal labor, overhead and other expenses. measures we implement to monitor the environment and protect our infrastructure against security breaches and misappropriation of our intellectual property assets may prove insufficient, which could result in system failures and delays that could cause us to lose market participants, experience lower trading volume, incur significant liabilities or have a negative impact on our competitive advantage.
misconduct by our tphs or others could harm us.
we run the risk that our trading permit holders, other persons who use our markets or our employees may engage in fraud or other misconduct, which could result in regulatory sanctions and serious harm to our reputation, especially because we are the parent company of sros. it is not always possible to deter misconduct, and the precautions we take to prevent and
25
detect this activity may not be effective in all cases. in addition, misconduct by, or failures of, participants on our exchanges may discourage trading on our exchanges, which could reduce revenues.
changes in the tax laws and regulations affecting us and our market participants could have a material adverse effect on our business.
legislation has been proposed, both domestically and internationally, that could change the way that our market participants are taxed on the products they trade on our markets. the proposals include modifications to the taxation of financial products, including repealing the "60/40 rule," which allows market-makers to pay a blend of capital gains and ordinary tax rates on their income, requiring all derivatives to be marked-to-market, eliminating the exemption for "qualified covered calls," and the implementation of a transaction tax. if the proposed tax law changes, a transaction tax or other tax change that detrimentally impacts options or futures trading were to become law, they could have a negative impact on the options and futures industry and us by making transactions more costly to market participants, which may reduce trading.
the irs has proposed new regulations under section 871(m) that may require dividend tax withholding for a significant number of transactions completed by foreign persons. if the proposed regulations are adopted, or unless significant changes are made to the regulations, there may be a significant reduction in trading by foreign persons, either by their choice or due to brokers refusing to trade options for such persons.
in addition to proposed tax changes that would affect our market participants, states are currently modifying the apportionment factors on which the taxes are based, and are becoming more aggressive at asserting nexus over corporations that are not domiciled in the state. if these state tax laws change, or if states are successful at asserting nexus against us, we may be subject to taxes in additional states or at a higher amount in the states in which we operate. if this occurs, we may experience a higher marginal state tax rate.
if our risk management methods are not effective, our business, reputation and financial results may be adversely affected.
we have methods to identify, monitor and manage our risks. if our methods are not effective or we are not successful in monitoring or evaluating the risks to which we are or may be exposed, our business, reputation, financial condition and operating results could be materially adversely affected. in addition, our insurance policies may not provide adequate coverage.
we may selectively explore acquisition opportunities or strategic alliances relating to other businesses, products or technologies. we may not be successful in integrating other businesses, products or technologies with our business. any such transaction also may not produce the results we anticipate, which could adversely affect us.
we may selectively explore and pursue acquisition and other opportunities to strengthen our business and grow our company. we may enter into business combination transactions, make acquisitions or enter into strategic partnerships, joint ventures or alliances, any of which may be material. the market for acquisition targets and strategic alliances is highly competitive, which could make it more difficult to find appropriate merger or acquisition opportunities. if we are required to raise capital by incurring debt or issuing additional equity for any reason in connection with a strategic acquisition or investment, financing may not be available or the terms of such financing may not be favorable to us and our stockholders, whose interests may be diluted by the issuance of additional stock.
the process of integration may produce unforeseen regulatory and operating difficulties and expenditures and may divert the attention of management from the ongoing operation of our business and harm the reputation of the companies. we may not successfully achieve the integration objectives, and we may not realize the anticipated cost savings, revenue growth and synergies in full or at all, or it may take longer to realize them than expected, any of which could negatively impact our results of operations, financial condition or the market price of our common stock.
any decision to pay dividends on our common stock is at the discretion of our board of directors and depends upon the earnings of our operating subsidiaries. accordingly, there can be no guarantee that we will pay dividends to our stockholders.
we have paid quarterly dividends since the restructuring transaction and initial public offering and intend to continue paying regular quarterly dividends to our stockholders. however, any decision to pay dividends on our common stock will be at the discretion of the board of directors, which may determine not to declare dividends at all or at a reduced amount. the board's determination to declare dividends will depend upon our profitability and financial condition, contractual restrictions, restrictions imposed by applicable law and the sec and other factors that the board deems relevant. as a holding company with no significant business operations of its own, cboe holdings depends entirely on distributions, if any, it may receive from its subsidiaries to meet its obligations and pay dividends to its stockholders. if these subsidiaries are not profitable, or even if they are and they determine to retain their profits for use in their businesses, we will be unable to pay dividends to our stockholders.

certain provisions in our organizational documents could enable the board of directors to prevent or delay a change of control.
our organizational documents contain provisions that could block actions that shareholders might find favorable, including discouraging, delaying or preventing a change of control or and unsolicited acquisition proposals for us. these include provisions:
•   prohibiting stockholders from acting by written consent;
•   requiring advance notice of director nominations and of business to be brought before a meeting of stockholders; and
•   limiting the persons who may call special stockholders' meetings.
in addition, our organizational documents include provisions that:
•   restrict any person from voting or causing the voting of shares of stock representing more than 20% of our outstanding voting capital stock; and
•   restrict any person from beneficially owning shares of stock representing more than 20% of the outstanding shares of our capital stock.
furthermore, our board of directors has the authority to issue shares of preferred stock in one or more series and to fix the rights and preferences of these shares without stockholder approval. any series of our preferred stock is likely to be senior to our common stock with respect to dividends, liquidation rights and, possibly, voting rights. the ability of the board of directors to issue preferred stock also could have the effect of discouraging unsolicited acquisition proposals, thus adversely affecting the market price of our common stock.
delaware law makes it difficult for stockholders that have recently acquired a large interest in a corporation to cause the merger or acquisition of the corporation against the directors' wishes. under section 203 of the delaware general corporation law, a delaware corporation may not engage in any merger or other business combination with an interested stockholder for a period of three years following the date that the stockholder became an interested stockholder except in limited circumstances, including by approval of the corporation's board of directors.
item 7.    management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations ("md&a") should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements of the company and the notes thereto included in item 8 of this annual report on form 10-k. the following discussion contains forward-looking statements. actual results could differ materially from the results discussed in the forward-looking statements. see "risk factors" and "forward-looking statements" above.
overview cboe holdings, inc. is the holding company for chicago board options exchange, incorporated, cboe futures exchange, llc, c2 options exchange, incorporated and other subsidiaries.
the company's principal business is operating markets that offer for trading options on various market indexes (index options), mostly on an exclusive basis, and futures contracts, as well as on non-exclusive "multiply-listed" options, such as options on the stocks of individual corporations (equity options) and options on other exchange-traded products (etp options), such as exchange-traded funds (etf options) and exchange-traded notes (etn options). the company operates three stand-alone exchanges, but reports the results of its operations in one reporting segment.
cboe is our primary options market and offers trading in listed options through a single system that integrates electronic trading and traditional open outcry trading on our trading floor in chicago. this integration of electronic trading and traditional open outcry trading into a single exchange is known as our hybrid trading model. cfe, our all-electronic futures exchange, offers trading of futures on the vix index and other products. c2 is our all-electronic exchange that also offers trading for listed options, and may operate with a different market model and fee structure than cboe. all of our exchanges operate on our proprietary technology platform known as cboe command.
business trends
•   transaction fees accounted for 70.9%, 69.4% and 69.7% of total operating revenues for the year ended december 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively.
•   index options and futures contracts accounted for 81.8%, 78.8% and 67.7% of our transaction fees for the year ended december 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively.
•   our share of total exchange-traded options contracts for the year ended december 31, 2014 was 29.9% up from 27.9% and 27.8% in 2013 and 2012, respectively.
•   operating expenses were 49.2%, 50.0% and 52.3%, of total operating revenues for the years ended december 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively.
•   employee costs, representing our largest expense category, were 19.7%, 20.6% and 20.3%, of total operating revenues for the years ended december 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively.
•   in december 2014, we entered into an agreement with the financial industry regulatory authority ("finra") to provide a majority of regulatory services to the cboe and c2 options markets. we do not expect revenue generated from regulatory fees to be materially impacted by the agreement with finra. as a result of this agreement, we will experience a shift in expenses from employee costs to outside services.
business strategy we believe that the derivatives industry, especially the listed options and futures industry, has significant growth potential, including through new participants and products. we expect to further expand our business and increase our revenues and profitability by pursuing the following growth strategies:
•   we intend to continue developing innovative proprietary products that meet the needs of the derivatives industry, both through strategic relationships and internal development.
•   we intend to continue our efforts to expand the use of our products internationally. at the core of that effort is extending trading hours in our exclusive options and futures products.
•   we have designed our fee schedule to provide economic benefits to market participants that concentrate their overall trading activity at our exchanges.
33
•   we intend to continue to enhance our trading platform by continuing to invest in hardening and augmenting the functionality and capacity of our trading systems.
•   we seek to attract participants from the over-the-counter market, through customizing options products and through offering products similar to those traded over-the-counter.
•   we evaluate strategic opportunities that we believe will enhance stockholder value.
components of operating revenues transaction fees the primary and largest source of operating revenues is transaction fees. transaction fees are a function of many variables with the main three being: (1) exchange fee rates; (2) trading volume mix (products traded); and (3) transaction mix between order type. because transaction fees are assessed on a per contract basis, transaction fee revenue is highly correlated to the volume of contracts traded on the company's exchanges. while exchange fee rates are established by the company, trading volume and transaction mix are influenced by a number of factors, including price competition, price volatility in the underlying securities and national and international economic and political conditions.
revenue is recorded as transactions occur on a trade-date basis. the main products we trade are equity, index and etp options and futures contracts.
•   equity options reflect trading in options contracts on the stocks of individual companies.
•   index options reflect trading in index options contracts on market indexes.
•   etp options include etf options that are options on baskets of stocks designed to generally track an index, but which trade like individual stocks, and etn options that are options on senior, unsecured, unsubordinated debt securities issued by an underwriting bank.
•   futures contracts are standardized, transferable, exchange-traded contracts that require delivery of a commodity, bond, currency, stock index or other benchmark interests at a specified price and on a specified future date, which are settled in cash.
the company believes that the number of investors that use options represents a growing proportion of the total investing public and that the increasing use of options represents a long-term trend that will continue in the future. furthermore, we believe significant opportunities exist to expand the use of options by both institutional and professional investors and for the migration of activity from the over-the-counter market to exchanges.
while there is no certainty, we expect that the industry-wide and company-specific factors that contributed to past volume changes will continue to contribute to future volume changes. however, additional factors may arise that could also impact trading volume which may result in increases or decreases in our trading volume, such as new or existing competition, or other events. considering these factors, we do not expect past trading volumes to be an indicator of future trading volume.
access fees access fees represent fees assessed to trading permit holders for the opportunity to trade, including fees for trading-related functionality, on cboe, c2 and cfe. the cboe program contains a tier-based market-maker appointment system with different trading permits based on trading function and, in the case of market-makers, the assessment of a surcharge for certain cboe proprietary products. beginning in mid-2013, cboe implemented sliding scales for all market-maker and floor broker trading permits held by affiliated trading permit holders and tph organizations that are used in any options classes other than certain proprietary indexes. the number of trading permits made available is limited.
exchange services and other fees to facilitate trading, the company offers technology services, terminal and other equipment rentals, maintenance services, trading floor space and telecommunications services. trading floor and equipment rentals are generally on a month-to-month basis. facilities, systems services and other fees are generally monthly fee-based, although certain services are influenced by trading volume or other defined metrics, while others are based solely on demand.
34
market data fees market data fees represent income derived from the sale of our transaction information through the options price reporting authority ("opra") and primarily through our subsidiary, market data express, llc ("mdx"). through mdx, we sell historical options data, as well as real-time data for certain proprietary products and indexes. it also provides market data through cboe streaming markets, a high-availability, low latency streaming data feed. opra is a limited liability company consisting of representatives of the member exchanges, including cboe and c2, authorized by the sec to provide consolidated options information. opra gathers market data from various options exchanges, including cboe and c2, and, in turn, disseminates this data to third parties who pay fees to opra to access the data. revenue generated by opra from the dissemination of market data is shared among opra members according to the number of total cleared options transactions by each of the member exchanges as calculated each quarter. opra is not consolidated with the company.
regulatory fees regulatory fees are charged to trading permit holders in support of our regulatory responsibilities as self-regulatory organizations under the exchange act. regulatory fees include an options regulatory fee under which fees are based on industry-wide customer volume of trading permit holders and designated examining authority fees for certain trading permit holders. this source of revenue could decline in the future if the number of customer contracts executed by trading permit holders declines and rates are not increased or are decreased or if our costs to perform our regulatory responsibilities stabilize or decrease.
the sec requires that the revenues derived from certain of the fees from our regulatory functions, some of which are included in this revenue category, and regulatory fines must be used for regulatory purposes. expenses related to our regulatory functions are included in our operating expenses, mainly in employee costs and outside services.
in december 2014, we entered into an agreement with the financial industry regulatory authority ("finra") to provide certain regulatory services to the cboe and c2 options markets. additionally, cboe entered into a separate agreement with finra, under which it assigned to finra the responsibility to perform regulatory services for the options regulatory surveillance authority ("orsa"). finra began performing the services on january 1, 2015.
other revenue the following sub-categories are the sources of revenue within this category:
•   revenue generated through various licensing agreements;
•   revenue generated through regulatory service agreements with other options exchanges (in 2015, we will no longer generate revenue from these regulatory service agreements);
•   revenue derived from fines assessed for rule violations;
•   revenue generated through our order routing cancel fee and position transfer fee;
•   revenue associated with advertisements through our corporate web site, www.cboe.com;
•   revenue generated from courses and seminars offered through cboe's options institute;
•   rental of commercial space in the lobby of our building; and
•   other sources of revenue.
components of operating expenses most of our expenses do not vary directly with changes in our trading volume except royalty fees and trading volume incentives.
employee costs employee costs are our most significant expense and include salaries and benefits, stock-based compensation, incentive compensation, severance and employer taxes. salaries and benefits represent our largest expense category and tend to be driven by both our staffing requirements and the general dynamics of the employment market. stock-based compensation is a non-cash expense related to equity awards. stock-based compensation can vary depending on the quantity and fair value of the award on the date of grant and the related service period.
depreciation and amortization
35
depreciation and amortization expense results from the depreciation of long-lived assets purchased and the amortization of purchased and internally developed software.
data processing data processing expense consists primarily of costs related to the maintenance of computer equipment supporting our system architecture, circuits supporting our wide area network, support for production software, fees paid to information vendors for displaying data and off-site system hosting fees.
outside services outside services consist primarily of consulting services, which include: the supplementation of staff for activities primarily related to systems development and maintenance and legal, regulatory and audit and tax advisory services.
royalty fees royalty fees primarily consist of license fees paid for the use of underlying indexes in our proprietary products usually based on contracts traded. the company has licenses with the owners of the s&p 500 index, s&p 100 index and certain other s&p indexes, the djia, the nasdaq 100 and the russell indexes. this category also includes fees paid to market participants for order flow that they direct or cause to be directed to our exchanges and fees related to the dissemination of market data related to s&p indexes.
trading volume incentives trading volume incentives consist of market linkage expenses incurred to send certain orders to other exchanges. if a competing exchange quotes a better price, we route the customer's order to that exchange and pay certain of the associated costs. regardless of whether the transaction is traded at our options exchanges, the order flow potential enhances our overall market position and participation and provides cost savings to customers.
travel and promotional expenses travel and promotional expenses primarily consist of advertising, costs for special events, sponsorship of industry conferences, options education seminars and travel related expenses.
facilities costs facilities costs primarily consist of expenses related to owned and leased properties including rent, maintenance, utilities, real estate taxes and telecommunications costs.
other expenses other expenses represent costs necessary to support our operations but are not included in the above categories.
other income/(expense)
income and expenses incurred through activities outside of our core operations are considered non-operating and are classified as other income/(expense). these activities primarily include interest earned on the investing of excess cash and investments in other business ventures.
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of the company's consolidated financial statements requires the company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. on an ongoing basis, the company evaluates its estimates, including those related to areas that require a significant level of judgment or are otherwise subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty. the company bases its estimates on historical experience, observance of trends in particular areas, information available from outside sources and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. information from these sources form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that may not be readily apparent from other sources. actual amounts may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.
we have identified the policies below as critical to our business operations and the understanding of our results of operations. the impact of, and any associated risks related to, these policies on our business operations is discussed throughout "management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations." for a detailed discussion on the application of these and other accounting policies, see note 1 to our consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10-k.

revenue recognition
•   transaction fees revenue is considered earned upon the execution of the trade recognized on a trade-date basis and presented net of applicable volume discounts. in the event liquidity providers prepay transaction fees, revenue is recognized based on the attainment of volume thresholds resulting in the amortization of the prepayment over the calendar year.
•   access fee revenue is recognized during the period access is granted and assurance of collectability is provided.
•   exchange services and other fees revenue is recognized during the period the service is provided.
•   market data fees from opra are allocated based upon the share of total options transactions cleared for each of the opra members and is received quarterly. revenue from our market data services is recognized in the period the data is provided.
•   regulatory fees are recognized primarily on a trade-date basis.
income taxes deferred income taxes arise from temporary differences between the tax basis and book basis of assets and liabilities. the company accounts for income taxes under the asset and liability method, which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of the events that have been included in the consolidated financial statements. under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the differences between the book and tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to be reversed. the effect of a change in tax rates on deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized in the period that includes the enactment date. the company files tax returns for federal, state and local income tax purposes. a valuation allowance is recognized if it is anticipated that some or all of a deferred tax asset may not be realized.
if the company considers that a tax position is "more-likely-than-not" to be sustained upon audit, based solely on the technical merits of the position, it recognizes the tax benefit. the company measures the tax benefit by determining the largest amount that is greater than 50% likely of being realized upon settlement, presuming that the tax position is examined by the appropriate taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information. these assessments can be complex and require specific analysis to determine the impact of the position, as such the company often obtains assistance from external advisors. the company considers the information and arrives at the percentage to apply as a possible uncertain portion related to the position. to the extent that the company's estimates change or the final tax outcome of these matters is different than the amounts recorded, such differences will impact the income tax provision in the period in which such determinations are made. uncertain tax positions are classified as current only when the company expects to pay cash within the next twelve months. interest and penalties, if any, are recorded within the provision for income taxes in the company's consolidated statements of income and are classified on the consolidated balance sheets with the related liability for unrecognized tax benefits.
recent accounting pronouncements in april 2014, the fasb issued asu 2014-08, reporting discontinued operations and disclosures of disposals of components of an entity, an amendment to fasb asc topic 205, presentation of financial statements and fasb asc topic 360, property, plant and equipment. the update revises the definition of discontinued operations by limiting discontinued operations reporting to disposals of components of an entity that represent strategic shifts that have (or will have) a major effect on an entity's operations and financial results, removing the lack of continuing involvement criteria and requiring discontinued operations reporting for the disposal of an equity method investment that meets the definition of discontinued operations. the update also requires expanded disclosures for discontinued operations, including disclosure of pretax profit or loss of an individually significant component of an entity that does not qualify for discontinued operations reporting. this asu is effective prospectively for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after december 15, 2014. the company has elected early adoption of the guidance and does not believe it will impact our consolidated balance sheets, statements of income, comprehensive income or cash flows.
in may 2014, the fasb issued asu 2014-09, revenue from contracts with customers. this standard outlines a single comprehensive model for entities to use in accounting for revenue arising from contracts with customers and supersedes most current revenue recognition guidance, including industry-specific guidance. in addition, it provides guidance on accounting for certain revenue-related costs including when to capitalize costs associated with obtaining and fulfilling a contract. the guidance provides companies with two implementation methods. companies can choose to apply the standard retrospectively to each prior reporting period presented (full retrospective application) or retrospectively with the cumulative effect of initially applying the standard as an adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings of the annual reporting period that includes the date of initial application (modified retrospective application). this guidance is effective for annual reporting periods
37
beginning after december 15, 2016, including interim periods within that reporting period. early application is not permitted. the company is in the process of evaluating this guidance, though we do not expect it will materially impact our consolidated balance sheets, statements of income, comprehensive income or cash flows.

•   the increase in total operating revenues was primarily driven by higher transaction fees and market data fees. the increase in transaction fees was primarily driven by an 11.6% increase in total volume in 2014. we experienced volume growth across all product categories. as reported by the occ, total industry cleared options contract volume was 4.3 billion contracts in 2014, a 4% increase from 2013.
•   the increase in total operating expenses was primarily driven by higher employee costs, depreciation and amortization, data processing and royalty fees, partially offset by lower outside services. employee costs reflect accelerated stock-based compensation expense and severance expense related to the transition of regulatory services to finra. the increase in royalty fees primarily resulted from higher volume in licensed and proprietary products.
•   the increase in total other expense was primarily driven by an impairment charge of $3.0 million related to our investment in ipxi holdings, llc ("ipxi"), partially offset by a reduction in equity losses in other investments.

transaction fees transaction fees increased 10.2% to $437.8 million for the year ended december 31, 2014, representing 70.9% of total operating revenues, compared with $397.2 million for the prior year period, or 69.4% of total operating revenues. this increase was largely driven by an 11.6% increase in trading volume, partially offset by a 1.2% decrease in the average revenue per contract. the increase in trading volume was across all product categories and the decrease in average revenue per contract primarily resulted from a shift in volume mix and an increase in volume based incentives. we believe volume across our product segments increased year over year due to market volatility, increased use of our proprietary products most directly tied to volatility and success in capturing market share. trading volume is impacted by many factors, including: macroeconomic events, market volatility, regulatory actions or considerations, availability of capital, competition, pricing and number of trading days in the period.
average revenue per contract, discussed in more detail below, is impacted by our fee structure, which includes volume based incentive programs, mix of products traded, the account type (customer, firm, market-maker, etc.) and the manner in which a trade is executed (electronic, open-outcry, etc.). the implementation of fee changes, which may increase or decrease our average revenue per contract, is primarily to ensure that we are competitive in the options marketplace and to ultimately improve and continue to drive order flow to our exchanges. we cannot predict the trading patterns of market participants, which may be based on factors outside our control, but we can attempt to price our products at levels that are competitive in our market.

factors contributing to the change in total average revenue per contract for the year ended december 31, 2014 compared to the same period in 2013 included:
•   product mix-we experienced a shift in overall product mix. as a percentage of total volume, equities increased to 36.9% from 36.5%, indexes decreased to 30.7% from 31.4% and futures increased to 3.8% from 3.4%. equities represent our lowest average revenue per contract, while index options and futures generate our highest options average revenue per contract and our highest total average revenue per contract, respectively.
40
•   rate structure- our rate structure includes sliding scales, volume discounts, volume incentive programs and caps on fees as part of our effort to increase liquidity and market share in multiply-listed options. average revenue per contract on multiply-listed options (equities and exchange-traded products) decreased 19.1% and 12.5%, respectively. these decreases resulted primarily from increases in volume-based incentives for these products. average revenue per contract on futures increased 3.4%. the increase was primarily due to fee changes implemented in 2014.
access fees access fees for the year ended december 31, 2014 decreased to $59.3 million from $61.0 million in the comparable prior year period. the decrease in access fees was primarily due to incentive programs for market-maker trading permits and floor brokers implemented in may 2013 and a reduction in the number of trading permits.
the demand for trading permits could be impacted by market fluctuations that affect trading volume.
exchange services and other fees exchange services and other fees for the year ended december 31, 2014 increased 2.1% to $38.0 million from $37.3 million in the comparable period in the prior year. the increase was primarily due to increased demand for technology services, terminal and other equipment rentals and certain services impacted by trading volume.
market data fees market data fees increased 22.2% to $30.4 million for the year ended december 31, 2014 from $24.9 million in the prior year. market data fees represent income derived from opra as well as the company's market data services, which for the year ended december 31, 2014 were $15.0 million and $15.4 million, respectively, and for the same period in 2013, were $12.9 million and $12.0 million, respectively. income derived from opra is allocated based on each exchange's share of total cleared options transactions. the company's share of opra income for the period ended december 31, 2014 increased to 24.9% from 21.7% for the same period in 2013 as a result of an increase in the company's share of total cleared options transactions. revenue generated from the company's market data services, which provide current and historical options and futures data, increased $3.4 million, resulting primarily from an increase in subscribers and rates for certain market data services.
regulatory fees regulatory fees increased 1.2% for the year ended 2014 to $37.1 million from $36.7 million in the same period in the prior year. regulatory fees are primarily generated by the options regulatory fee that we charge on all trading permit holder customer volume industry-wide which increased compared to the prior period. the higher revenue attributed to volume was partially offset by cboe and c2 lowering their respective options regulatory fee rates as of august 1, 2014, and a decrease in regulatory fees received for other regulatory services, primarily related to cboe stock exchange, llc ("cbsx"), which ceased trading operations on april 30, 2014.
under the rules of each of our options exchanges, as required by the sec, any revenue derived from regulatory fees and fines cannot be used for non-regulatory purposes.
in december 2014, we entered into an agreement with the financial industry regulatory authority ("finra") to provide a majority of the regulatory services to the cboe and c2 options markets. the company does not expect revenue generated from regulatory fees to be materially impacted by the agreement with finra.
concentration of revenue all contracts traded on our exchanges must be cleared through clearing members of the occ. at december 31, 2014, there were one hundred seven trading permit holders that are clearing members of the occ. two clearing members accounted for 46% of transaction and other fees collected through the occ in 2014. the next largest clearing member accounted for approximately 11% of transaction and other fees collected through the occ. no one trading permit holder using the clearing services of the top two clearing member firms represented more than 42% of transaction and other fees collected through the occ, for the respective clearing member, in 2014. should a clearing member withdraw from cboe, we believe the trading permit holder portion of that clearing member's trading activity would likely transfer to another clearing member.
the two largest clearing members mentioned above clear the majority of the market-maker sides of transactions at cboe, c2 and at all of the u.s. options exchanges. if either of these clearing members were to withdraw from the business of market-maker clearing and market-makers were unable to transfer to another clearing member, this could create significant disruption to the u.s. options markets, including ours.

operating expenses total operating expenses increased $17.2 million, or 6.0%, to $303.4 million for the year ended 2014 from $286.2 million in the year ago period, resulting from higher employee costs, depreciation and amortization, data processing and royalty fees, partially offset by lower outside services. expenses decreased to 49.2% of total operating revenues in the year ended 2014 compared with 50.0% in the same period in 2013.
the following summarizes changes in operating expenses for the year ended december 31, 2014 compared to 2013.

employee costs for the year ended december 31, 2014, employee costs were $121.7 million, or 19.7% of total operating revenues, compared with $118.1 million, or 20.6% of total operating revenues, in the same period in 2013. this represented an increase of $3.6 million, or 3.1%, resulting from higher salaries of $3.6 million, driven primarily by annual pay adjustments, higher payroll taxes of $0.5 million and higher health insurance costs of $0.4 million, higher severance expense of $2.4 million, primarily due to transition of a majority of regulatory services to finra, and higher annual incentive compensation of $2.0 million, which is aligned with performance targets, partially offset by lower stock-based compensation expense of $5.2 million.
in december 2014, we entered into an agreement with finra to provide certain regulatory services to the cboe and c2 options markets. as part of the agreement, a significant number of our regulatory staff, as well as certain systems staff supporting our regulatory functions, transitioned to finra resulting in a headcount reduction of over 100 employees. as a result of the reduction in headcount, we expect employees costs to be lower in 2015.
depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization increased by $5.4 million to $39.9 million for the year ended december 31, 2014 compared with $34.5 million for the same period in 2013. the increase in depreciation and amortization primarily resulted from increased capital spending to harden and enhance our trading platform and operations.
data processing data processing expenses increased $1.3 million to $19.2 million for the year ended december 31, 2014 compared with $17.9 million in the prior-year period. the increase in data processing expenses is primarily due to higher costs for hardware and software maintenance.
outside services expenses related to outside services decreased to $32.0 million for the year ended december 31, 2014 from $34.5 million in the prior-year period. the $2.5 million decrease is primarily due to lower costs related to litigation, partially offset by higher costs for contract programmers. the company received an insurance reimbursement for legal expenses of $1.5 million in 2013.
in december 2014, we entered into an agreement with finra to provide certain regulatory services to the cboe and c2 options markets. as noted above, certain staff transitioned from cboe to finra. as a result of the transition, costs for former employees in regulatory and systems staff supporting our regulatory functions, will be included in outside services in 2015. as a result, we expect outside services to be in higher in 2015. we do not expect this change to result in a material increase in total operating expenses in 2015.
42
royalty fees royalty fees for the year ended december 31, 2014 were $66.1 million compared with $56.6 million for the prior year period, an increase of $9.5 million. the increase is primarily due to higher trading volume in licensed and proprietary products and an increase in royalty rates as a result of the amendment the company executed with s&p opco llc ("s&p"), effective as of march 2013, relating to the company's license to trade options and futures and create products based on certain s&p indexes and higher fees associated with dissemination of certain market data.
operating income as a result of the items above, operating income in 2014 was $313.8 million compared to $285.9 million in 2013, an increase of $27.9 million.
other expense net loss from investment in affiliates net loss from investment in affiliates was $4.2 million for the year ended december 31, 2014 compared with $2.2 million for the same period in the prior year. the loss in 2014 and 2013 primarily included the company's share of the operating loss of signal trading systems, llc and, in 2014, the impairment of our investment in ipxi which totaled $3.0 million. see note 3 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on the company's investment in signal trading systems, llc and ipxi.
income before income taxes as a result of the items above, income before income taxes in 2014 was $309.7 million compared to $283.7 million in 2013, an increase of $26.0 million.
income tax provision for the year ended december 31, 2014, the income tax provision was $120.0 million compared with $107.7 million for the same period in 2013. this increase is primarily a result of higher taxable income and a higher effective tax rate. the effective tax rate was 38.7% and 38.0% for the year ended december 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively.
net income as a result of the items above, net income allocated to common stockholders in 2014 was $188.4 million compared to $173.9 million in 2013, an increase of $14.5 million. basic and diluted net income per share allocated to common stockholders were $2.21 and $1.99 for the years ended december 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively.

there were a number of factors that contributed to the increase in our average revenue per contract in 2013 compared to 2012. these include:
•   product mix-the increase in the average revenue per contract reflected a shift in the volume mix by product. index options and futures contracts accounted for 31.4% and 3.4% of total trading volume in 2013, up from 26.8% and 2.1% in 2012, respectively. index options generated total average revenue per contract of $0.670 representing the highest options average revenue per contract, while futures contracts generated our highest total average revenue per contract of $1.570.
•   spx options, vix options and vix futures- for the year ended december 31, 2013 as compared to the prior year period, the total trading volume in spx options, vix options and vix futures increased by 18.9%, 29.1% and 67.9%, respectively.
access fees access fees for the year ended december 31, 2013 decreased to $61.0 million from $64.1 million in the comparable prior year period. the decrease in access fees was primarily due to the implementation of an incentive programs for market-maker trading permits and floor brokers implemented in may 2013, which lowered monthly access fees.
exchange services and other fees exchange services and other fees for the year ended december 31, 2013 increased 18.8% to $37.3 million from $31.4 million in the comparable period in the prior year, resulting from the introduction of a network access option offered in connection with the company's data center move to new jersey in december 2012.
market data fees market data fees increased 2.3% to $24.9 million for the year ended december 31, 2013 from $24.3 million in the same period in the prior year. opra and company market data fees for 2013 and 2012 were $12.9 million and $12.0 million and $15.0 million and $9.3 million, respectively. the company's share of opra income for the period ended december 31, 2013 decreased to 21.7% from 24.4% for the same period in 2012 as a result of a decrease in the company's share of total cleared options transactions. revenue generated from the company's market data services increased $2.7 million, resulting primarily from an increase in subscribers to cboe streaming markets and other market data services and an increase in subscriber rates.
regulatory fees regulatory fees increased 74.5% for the year ended 2013 to $36.7 million from $21.0 million in the same period in the prior year, resulting from cboe and c2 increasing their options regulatory fee rates and higher trading permit holder customer volume industry-wide as compared to the same period in 2012. in september 2013, cboe decreased its options regulatory fee rate and c2 suspended its options regulatory fee rate.
operating expenses total operating expenses increased $18.0 million, or 6.7%, to $286.2 million for the year ended 2013 from $268.2 million in the year ago period, resulting from higher employee costs, depreciation and amortization and royalty fees, partially offset by lower data processing, outside services, trading volume incentives and other expense. expenses decreased to 50.0% of total operating revenues in the year ended 2013 compared with 52.3% in the same period in 2012.

the increase in stock-based compensation of $8.5 million resulted from the amortization of stock-compensation expense relating to the february 2013 and may 2013 grants and the recognition of $4.0 million of accelerated stock-based compensation related to the february 2013 grant to certain executives due to provisions contained in their employment arrangements and the recognition of the remaining value of stock grants awarded, in june 2010, to employees in the company's regulatory division who were no longer eligible to receive equity-based compensation.

data processing data processing expenses decreased $1.7 million to $17.9 million for the year ended december 31, 2013 compared with $19.6 million in the prior-year period. the decrease in data processing expenses is primarily due to decreases in hardware and software maintenance relating to the migration of the trading platform completed in december 2012.

royalty fees royalty fees expense for the year ended december 31, 2013 were $56.6 million compared with $46.1 million for the prior year period, an increase of $10.5 million. the increase is primarily due to higher trading volume in licensed index products and an increase in royalty rates as a result of the amendment the company executed with s&p to the existing s&p agreement.
trading volume incentives trading volume incentives decreased $2.0 million to $4.3 million for the year ended december 31, 2013 compared to $6.3 million for the prior year period. the decrease was primarily due to lower volume in multiply-listed options products, modifications in the criteria for contracts qualifying for certain quantity-based fee waivers and adjustments to the fees paid by the company for transactions linked to away exchanges.

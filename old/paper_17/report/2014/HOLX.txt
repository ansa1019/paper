risks relating to our business the continuing worldwide macroeconomic uncertainty may adversely affect our business and prospects.
market acceptance of our medical products in the u.s. and other countries is dependent upon the medical equipment purchasing and procurement practices of our customers, patient demand for our products and procedures and the reimbursement of patients' medical expenses by government healthcare programs and third-party payors. the continuing uncertainty surrounding world financial markets and continuing weak worldwide macroeconomic conditions have caused and may continue to cause the purchasers of medical equipment to decrease their medical equipment purchasing and procurement activities. economic uncertainty as well as increasing health insurance premiums and co-payments may continue to result in cost-conscious consumers making fewer elective trips to their physicians and specialists, which in turn would adversely affect demand for our products and procedures. job losses or slow improvement in the unemployment rate in the u.s. as a result of current macroeconomic conditions may result in a smaller percentage of our patients being covered by an employer health group and a larger percentage being covered by lower paying medicare and medicaid programs. furthermore, governments and other third-party payors around the world facing tightening budgets could move to further reduce the reimbursement rates or the scope of coverage offered, which could adversely affect sales of our products. if the current adverse macroeconomic conditions continue, our business and prospects may be negatively impacted.
sales and market acceptance of our products is dependent upon the coverage and reimbursement decisions made by third-party payors. the failure of third-party payors to provide appropriate levels of coverage and reimbursement for the use of our products and treatments facilitated by our products could harm our business and prospects.
sales and market acceptance of our medical products and the treatments facilitated by our products in the u.s. and other countries is dependent upon the coverage decisions and reimbursement policies established by government healthcare programs and private health insurers. market acceptance of our products and treatments has and will continue to depend upon our customers' ability to obtain an appropriate level of coverage for, and reimbursement from third-party payors for, these products and treatments.
healthcare reform proposals and medical cost containment measures are being adopted in the u.s. and in many foreign countries. these reforms and measures, including those envisioned by the adoption in 2010 of u.s. healthcare reform, could among other things limit the use of our products and treatments and further reduce reimbursement available for such use. in addition, the uncertainty in the medical community regarding their nature and effect could have an adverse effect on our customers' purchasing decisions regarding our products and treatments and could harm our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects. significant reductions in reimbursement rates proposed or implemented for the use of any our products have had and may continue to have a material adverse effect on the sales of those products. we also expect that pricing of medical products and services will remain under pressure as alternative payment models such as bundling, value-based purchasing and accountable care organizations develop in the u.s.
the adoption of healthcare reform in the u.s. and the uncertainty surrounding the implementation of these reforms could harm our business and prospects.
the healthcare industry has undergone significant change driven by various efforts to reduce costs, trends toward managed care, cuts in medicare, consolidation of healthcare distribution companies and collective purchasing arrangements by office-based healthcare practitioners. the effect of the implementation of ppaca on our business is uncertain. among other things, the law requires the medical device industry to subsidize healthcare reform in the form of a 2.3% excise tax on u.s. sales of certain medical devices which became effective on january 1, 2013. we expect that this excise tax will continue to apply to the majority, if not all, of our products sold in the u.s. in addition, the judgments we make regarding which of our products are subject to the excise tax based on our interpretations of the law, related internal revenue service, or irs, regulations and the underlying factors used to calculate the amount of tax due on the sale of such products could differ from the judgments made by the irs, resulting in additional charges to our results of operations. our u.s. product revenues represented 74% of our net product revenues for the years ended september 27, 2014 and september 28, 2013. the company incurred $21.9 million and $15.7 million of excise tax expense related to the domestic sales of its medical device products for the years ended september 27, 2014 and september 28, 2013, respectively.
17
the law also includes regulatory mandates and other measures designed to constrain medical costs, as well as stringent reporting requirements of financial relationships between device manufacturers and physicians and teaching hospitals. specifically, under section 6002 of ppaca, which is commonly referred to as the physician payment sunshine act, we are required to collect data on and annually report to cms certain payments or other transfers of value to physicians and teaching hospitals and annually report certain ownership and investment interests held by physicians or their immediate family members. compliance with the healthcare legislation, including with these reporting requirements and the excise tax, has imposed significant additional administrative and financial burdens on us. various healthcare reform proposals have also emerged at the state level. the healthcare reform legislation and these proposals could reduce medical procedure volumes and impact the demand for our products or the prices at which we sell our products. these reforms include a national pilot program on payment bundling to encourage hospitals, physicians and other providers to improve the coordination, quality and efficiency of certain healthcare services through bundled payment models. in addition, the excise tax has increased our costs of doing business. the impact of this healthcare reform legislation, and practices including price regulation, competitive pricing, comparative effectiveness of therapies, technology assessments, and managed care arrangements could harm our business and prospects, results of operations and/or financial condition. healthcare reform proposals and medical cost containment measures in the u.s. and in many foreign countries could:
•   limit the use of our products and treatments;
•   reduce reimbursement available for such use;
•   further tax the sale or use of our products;
•   adversely affect the use of new therapies for which our products may be targeted; and
•   further increase the administrative and financial burden of compliance.
these reforms, cost containment measures and new taxes, including the uncertainty in the medical community regarding their nature and effect, could also have an adverse effect on our customers' purchasing decisions regarding our products and treatments and could harm our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects.
changes in laws affecting the healthcare industry could adversely affect our revenues and profitability.
we operate in a highly regulated industry. as a result, governmental actions may adversely affect our business, operations or financial condition, including:
•   new laws, regulations or judicial decisions, or new interpretations of existing laws, regulations or decisions, related to healthcare availability, method of delivery and payment for healthcare products and services;
•   changes in the fda and foreign regulatory approval processes that may delay or prevent the approval of new products and treatments and result in lost market opportunity;
•   changes in fda and foreign regulations that may require additional safety monitoring, labeling changes, restrictions on product distribution or use, or other measures after the introduction of our products and treatments to market, which could increase our costs of doing business, adversely affect the future permitted uses of approved products or treatments, or otherwise adversely affect the market for our products and treatments; and
•   new laws, regulations and judicial decisions affecting pricing or marketing practices.
we anticipate that governmental authorities will continue to scrutinize the healthcare industry closely and that additional regulation by governmental authorities may cause increased compliance costs, exposure to litigation and other adverse effects to our operations.
guidelines, recommendations and studies published by various organizations may reduce the use of our products.
professional societies, government agencies, practice management groups, private health/science foundations, and organizations involved in healthcare issues may publish guidelines, recommendations or studies to the healthcare and patient communities. recommendations of government agencies or these other groups/organizations may relate to such matters as usage, cost-effectiveness, and use of related therapies. organizations like these have in the past made recommendations about our products and those of our competitors. recommendations, guidelines or studies that are followed by healthcare providers and insurers could result in decreased use of our products. for example, in november 2012, the american congress of obstetrics and gynecologists, known as the acog, released updates in which they have recommended less frequent cervical cancer screening similar to guidelines released in march 2012 by the u.s. preventative services task force and the american cancer society. we believe that these recommendations and guidelines may have contributed to increased screening intervals for cervical cancer, which we believe has and may continue to adversely affect our thinprep revenues.
18
our long-term success will depend upon our ability to successfully develop and commercialize new products and treatments and enhance our existing products and treatments.
we are devoting significant resources to our continuing research and development programs which are designed to develop new products and treatments and to enhance and improve our existing products and treatments. the successful development of our products and product enhancements is subject to numerous risks, both known and unknown, including:
•   unanticipated delays in development, clinical trials or the approval or clearance process by the fda or other applicable regulatory authority;
•   access to capital;
•   budget overruns;
•   third-party intellectual property;
•   technical problems; and
•   other difficulties that could result in the abandonment or substantial change in the design, development and commercialization of these new products, including, for example, changes requested by the fda in connection with pre-market approval applications or 510(k) clearance.
given the uncertainties inherent with product development, introduction, and enhancement our efforts may not be completed on a timely basis or within budget, if at all. our failure to develop new products and product enhancements on a timely basis or within budget, if at all, could harm our business and prospects.
if we cannot maintain our current corporate collaborations and enter into new corporate collaborations, our product development could be delayed. in particular, any failure by us to successfully maintain our blood screening collaboration could have a material adverse effect on our business.
in some instances we have entered into corporate collaborations, including alliances and joint ventures, with certain partners or companies that could make it more difficult for us to enter into advantageous business transactions or relationships with others.
with respect to certain of our products we have relied, to a significant extent, on corporate collaborators for funding development and marketing. in addition, we expect to rely on our corporate collaborators for the commercialization of certain products. if any of our corporate collaborators were to breach or terminate its agreement with us or otherwise fail to conduct its collaborative activities successfully and in a timely manner, the development or commercialization and subsequent marketing of the products contemplated by the collaboration could be delayed or terminated. we cannot control the amount and timing of resources our corporate collaborators devote to our programs or potential products.
the continuation of any of these collaboration agreements depends upon their periodic renewal by us and our collaborators. if any of our current collaboration agreements are terminated, or if we are unable to renew those collaborations on acceptable terms, we may be required to devote additional internal resources to product development or marketing or to terminate some development programs or seek alternative corporate collaborations. in addition, in the event of a dispute under our current or any future collaboration agreements, a court or arbitrator may not rule in our favor and our rights or obligations under an agreement subject to a dispute may be adversely affected, which may have an adverse effect on our business or operating results. any corporate collaboration may divert management time and resources. entering into a disadvantageous corporate collaboration, failing to manage a collaboration effectively, or failing to comply with the obligations associated with a collaboration, could harm our business and prospects.
if we or our contract manufacturers are unable to manufacture our products in sufficient quantities, on a timely basis, at acceptable costs and in compliance with regulatory and quality requirements, our ability to sell our products will be harmed.
the manufacture of many of our products is highly complex and requires precise high quality manufacturing that is difficult to achieve. we have in the past and may in the future experience difficulties in manufacturing our products on a timely basis and in sufficient quantities. these difficulties have primarily related to delays and difficulties associated with ramping up production of newly introduced products and may result in increased delivery lead-times and increased costs of manufacturing these products. in addition, production of these newer products may require the development of new manufacturing technologies and expertise, which we may be unable to develop. our failure, including the failure of our contract manufacturers, to achieve and maintain the required high manufacturing standards could result in further delays or failures in product testing or delivery, cost overruns, product recalls or withdrawals, increased warranty costs or other problems that could harm our business and prospects.
19
in determining the required quantities of our products and the manufacturing schedule, we must make significant judgments and estimates based on historical experience, inventory levels, current market trends and other related factors. because of the inherent nature of estimates, there could be significant differences between our estimates and the actual amounts of products we and our distributors require, which could harm our business and results of operations.
blood screening, medical diagnostic and surgical device products are regulated by the fda as well as other foreign medical regulatory bodies. in some cases, such as in the u.s. and the eu, certain products may also require individual lot release testing. maintaining compliance with multiple regulators, and multiple centers within the fda, adds complexity and cost to our manufacturing processes. in addition, our manufacturing facilities and those of our contract manufacturers are subject to periodic regulatory inspections by the fda and other regulatory agencies, and these facilities are subject to the fda's quality system regulation and good manufacturing practices. we or our contractors may fail to satisfy these regulatory requirements in the future, and any failure to do so may prevent us from selling our products.
our business could be harmed if our products contain undetected errors or defects or do not meet applicable specifications.
we are continuously developing new products and improving our existing products. our existing and newly introduced products can contain undetected errors or defects. in addition, these products may not meet their performance specifications under all conditions or for all applications. if, despite internal testing and testing by customers, any of our products contain errors or defects or fail to meet applicable specifications, then we may be required to enhance or improve those products or technologies. we may not be able to do so on a timely basis, if at all, and may only be able to do so at considerable expense. in addition, any significant reliability problems could result in adverse customer reaction, negative publicity, mandatory or voluntary recalls or legal claims and could harm our business and prospects.
our products may be subject to recalls even after receiving regulatory clearance or approval, which could harm our reputation, business and prospects.
the fda and similar governmental bodies in other countries have the authority to require the recall of medical products in the event of material deficiencies or defects in design or manufacture. a government mandated or voluntary recall by us could occur as a result of component failures, manufacturing errors or design defects, including defects in labeling. any recall could divert managerial and financial resources, be difficult and costly to correct, result in the suspension of sales of certain of our products, harm our reputation and the reputation of our products and adversely affect our business and prospects.
interruptions, delays, shutdowns or damage at our manufacturing facilities could harm our business.
we and our contract manufacturers manufacture our products at a relatively limited number of different facilities located throughout the world. an interruption in manufacturing capabilities at any of these facilities, as a result of equipment failure or other reasons, could reduce, delay or prevent the production of our products. our manufacturing facilities and those of our contract manufacturers are subject to the risk of catastrophic loss due to unanticipated events, such as fires, earthquakes, explosions, floods or weather conditions. manufacturing facilities may experience plant shutdowns, strikes or other labor disruptions, or periods of reduced production as a result of equipment failures, loss of power, gray outs, delays in deliveries or extensive damage, which could harm our business and prospects. because some of our manufacturing operations are located outside the u.s., including in costa rica, canada, the united kingdom, germany and china, those manufacturing operations are also subject to additional challenges and risks associated with international operations described below.
our inability to obtain, or any delay in obtaining, any necessary u.s. or foreign regulatory clearances or approvals for our newly developed products and treatments or product enhancements could harm our business and prospects.
our products and treatments are subject to a high level of regulatory oversight. our inability to obtain, or any delay in obtaining, any necessary u.s. or foreign regulatory clearances or approvals for our newly developed products or product enhancements could harm our business and prospects. the process of obtaining clearances and approvals can be costly and time-consuming. in addition, there is a risk that any approvals or clearances, once obtained, may be withdrawn or modified.
medical devices cannot be marketed in the u.s. without 510(k) clearance or premarket approval by the fda. any modifications to a device that has received a pre-market approval that affect the safety or effectiveness of the device require a pre-market approval supplement or possibly a separate pre-market approval, either of which is likely to be time-consuming, expensive and uncertain to obtain. if the fda requires us to seek one or more pre-market approval supplements or new pre-market approvals for any modification to a previously approved device, we may be required to cease marketing or to recall the modified device until we obtain approval, and we may be subject to significant criminal and/or civil sanctions, including, but not limited to, regulatory fines or penalties.
20
medical devices sold in the u.s. must also be manufactured in compliance with fda good manufacturing practices, which regulate the design, manufacture, packing, storage and installation of medical devices. moreover, medical devices are required to comply with fda regulations relating to investigational research and labeling. states may also regulate the manufacture, sale and use of medical devices, particularly those that employ x-ray technology. our products are also subject to approval and regulation by foreign regulatory and safety agencies.
delays in receipt of, or failure to obtain, clearances or approvals for future products could delay or preclude realization of product revenues from new products or result in substantial additional costs which could decrease our profitability. in september 2012, the european commission proposed new regulations for medical devices. the proposed new regulations cover in one regulation devices that are currently the subject of three separate directives the adoption of these regulations may impact our international operations through a broadened scope of medical device oversight and/or regulatory reach. compliance with the new european commission regulations, if and when adopted, may impose additional administrative and financial burdens on us.
the markets for our newly developed products and treatments and newly introduced enhancements to our existing products and treatments may not develop as expected.
the successful commercialization of our newly developed products and treatments and newly introduced enhancements to our existing products and treatments are subject to numerous risks, both known and unknown, including:
•   uncertainty of the development of a market for such product or treatment;
•   trends relating to, or the introduction or existence of, competing products, technologies or alternative treatments or therapies that may be more effective, safer or easier to use than our products, technologies, treatments or therapies;
•   the perception of our products or treatments as compared to other products and treatments;
•   recommendation and support for the use of our products or treatments by influential customers, such as hospitals, radiological practices, breast surgeons and radiation oncologists and treatment centers;
•   the availability and extent of data demonstrating the clinical efficacy of our products or treatments;
•   competition, including the presence of competing products sold by companies with longer operating histories, more recognizable names and more established distribution networks; and
•   other technological developments.
often, the development of a significant market for a product or treatment will depend upon the establishment of a reimbursement code or an advantageous reimbursement level for use of the product or treatment. moreover, even if addressed, such reimbursement codes or levels frequently are not established until after a product or treatment is developed and commercially introduced, which can delay the successful commercialization of a product or treatment.
if we are unable to successfully commercialize and create a significant market for our newly developed products and treatments and newly introduced enhancements to our existing products and treatments our business and prospects could be harmed.
our business may be harmed by prior acquisitions or acquisitions we may complete in the future.
we have acquired a number of businesses, technologies, product lines and products, and may make additional acquisitions in the future. promising acquisitions are difficult to identify and complete for a number of reasons, including competition among prospective buyers and the need for regulatory, including antitrust, approvals. we may not be able to identify and successfully complete acquisition transactions. any acquisition we may complete may be made at a substantial premium over the fair value of the net assets of the acquired company. further, the long-term success of our acquisitions and any additional acquisitions we may complete in the future will depend upon our ability to realize the anticipated benefits from combining the acquired businesses with our business. we may fail to realize anticipated benefits for a number of reasons, including the following:
•   problems may arise with our ability to successfully integrate the acquired businesses, which may result in us not operating as effectively and efficiently as expected, and may include:
•   diversion of management time, as well as a shift of focus from operating the businesses to issues related to integration and administration or inadequate management resources available for integration activity and oversight;
•   failure to retain and motivate key employees;
21
•   failure to successfully oversee international sales efforts and inability to prevent fcpa violations;
•   failure to successfully obtain appropriate regulatory approval or clearance for products under development;
•   failure to successfully manage relationships with customers, distributors and suppliers;
•   failure of customers to accept new products;
•   failure to effectively coordinate sales and marketing efforts;
•   failure to combine product offerings and product lines quickly and effectively;
•   failure to effectively enhance acquired technology and products or develop new products relating to the acquired businesses;
•   potential difficulties and inefficiencies in managing and operating businesses in multiple locations or operating businesses in which we have either limited or no direct experience;
•   potential difficulties integrating financial reporting systems;
•   potential difficulties in the timely filing of required reports with the sec; and
•   potential difficulties in implementing controls, procedures and policies, including disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting, appropriate for a larger public company at companies that, prior to the acquisition of such companies, had lacked such controls, procedures and policies, which may result in ineffective disclosure controls and procedures or material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting;
•   we may not be able to achieve the expected synergies from an acquisition or it may take longer than expected to achieve those synergies;
•   an acquisition may result in future impairment charges related to a decline in the fair value of the acquired business as compared to the price we paid for such acquisition;
•   an acquisition may involve restructuring operations or reductions in workforce which may result in substantial charges to our operations;
•   our current and prospective customers and suppliers may experience uncertainty associated with an acquisition, including with respect to current or future business relationships with us and may attempt to negotiate changes in existing business;
•   an acquisition may involve unexpected costs or liabilities, including as a result of pending and future shareholder lawsuits relating to acquisitions or exercise by shareholders of their statutory appraisal rights, or the effects of purchase accounting may be different from our expectations;
•   an acquisition may involve significant deferred or contingent payments that may adversely affect our future liquidity or capital resources; and
•   the acquired businesses may be adversely affected by future legislative, regulatory, or tax decisions and/or changes as well as other economic, business and/or competitive factors.
our failure to realize the anticipated benefits from combining acquired businesses could harm our business and prospects.
if we are successful in pursuing future acquisitions, we may be required to expend significant funds, incur additional debt or other obligations, or issue additional securities, which may negatively affect our operating results and financial condition. if we spend significant funds or incur additional debt or other obligations, our ability to obtain financing for working capital or other purposes could decline, and we may be more vulnerable to economic downturns and competitive pressures. we cannot guarantee that we will be able to finance additional acquisitions or that we will realize any anticipated benefits from acquisitions that we complete.
22
it may be difficult for us to implement our strategies for sustaining growth.
some of the markets in which we compete have been flat or declining. for example, in fiscal 2014 and 2013, we experienced declines in domestic sales of our thinprep and novasure systems, and worldwide sales of our 2d mammography systems. we attribute the decline in thinprep system sales to the increased time intervals between cervical cancer screenings as a result of recent screening recommendations, the decline in the sale of novasure systems to the continuing effect of unemployment and economic uncertainty and the increase in insurance deductibles and the availability of less expensive, although often less effective, alternative therapies, and the decline in 2d mammography sales to our introduction of the dimensions 3d tomosynthesis system. at the end of fiscal 2013 and in 2014, we also experienced a modest decline in prices for our molecular diagnostics products. we also continue to experience pressures resulting from ongoing economic challenges and uncertainty resulting from healthcare reforms, reimbursement pressures and capital budget uncertainty. we expect such trends and pressures to continue in fiscal 2015.
to offset these pressures, we are pursuing a number of strategies to sustain our business, including:
•   continuing to aggressively place our molecular diagnostics instrumentation in laboratories, particular our panther system, to drive longer term growth from the use of those systems and the purchase of our assays;
•   continuing to aggressively market and sell our dimensions 3d tomosynthesis system;
•   expanding our product offerings, particularly within our diagnostics segment;
•   allocating research and development funding to products with higher growth prospects;
•   developing new applications for our technologies;
•   strengthening our presence in selected geographic markets;
•   implementing targeted customer initiatives; and
•   supporting cross-selling opportunities of products and services to take advantage of the breadth of our product offerings.
we may not be able to successfully implement these strategies, and these strategies may not result in the desired growth of our business.
consolidation in the healthcare industry could lead to increased demands for price concessions or the exclusion of some suppliers from certain of our significant market segments, which could harm our business and prospects.
the cost of healthcare has risen significantly over the past decade and numerous initiatives and reforms by legislators, regulators and third-party payors to curb these costs have resulted in a consolidation trend in the healthcare industry, including with respect to hospitals and clinical laboratories. this consolidation has resulted in greater pricing pressures, decreased average selling prices, and the exclusion of certain suppliers from important market segments as group purchasing organizations, independent delivery networks and large single accounts continue to consolidate purchasing decisions for some of our hospital customers. we expect that market demand, government regulation, third-party reimbursement policies, government contracting requirements, and societal pressures will continue to change the worldwide healthcare industry, resulting in further business consolidations and alliances among our customers and competitors, which may reduce competition and continue to exert further downward pressure on the prices of our products and adversely impact our business, financial condition or results of operations. in particular, we are dependent upon a relatively small number of large clinical laboratory customers in the u.s. for a significant portion of our sales of diagnostics products. due in part to a trend toward consolidation of clinical laboratories in recent years and the relative size of the largest u.s. laboratories, it is likely that a significant portion of these sales will continue to be concentrated among a relatively small number of large clinical laboratories.
our business is dependent on technologies we license, and if we fail to maintain these licenses or license new technologies and rights to particular nucleic acid sequences for targeted diseases in the future, we may be limited in our ability to develop new products.
our business is dependent on licenses from third parties for some of our key technologies. for example, our patented tma technology is based on technology we licensed from stanford university. we anticipate that we will enter into new licensing arrangements in the ordinary course of business to expand our product portfolio and access new technologies to enhance our products and develop new products. many of these licenses will provide us with exclusive rights to the subject technology or disease marker. if our license with respect to any of these technologies or markers is terminated for any reason, we may not be able to sell products that incorporate the technology. similarly, we may lose competitive advantages if we fail to maintain exclusivity under an exclusive license.
23
additionally, the u.s. supreme court has issued several recent decisions, the full impact of which is not yet known. for example, in march 2012 in mayo collaborative services, dba mayo medical laboratories, et al. v. prometheus laboratories, inc., the court held that several claims drawn to measuring drug metabolite levels from patient samples and correlating them to drug doses were not patentable subject matter. the decision appears to impact diagnostics patents that merely apply a law of nature via a series of routine steps and has created uncertainty around the patentability of certain biomarker-related method claims. additionally, in june 2013 in association for molecular pathology v. myriad genetics, inc., the court held that claims to isolated genomic dna are not patentable, but claims to complementary dna, or cdna, molecules were held to be valid. the effect of the decision on patents for other isolated natural products is uncertain and we may lose competitive advantages should the subject matter of an exclusive license be deemed non-statutory and we therefore fail to maintain exclusivity to such subject matter as a result.
our ability to develop additional diagnostic tests for diseases may depend on the ability of third parties to discover particular sequences or markers and correlate them with disease, as well as the rate at which such discoveries are made. our ability to design products that target these diseases may depend on our ability to obtain the necessary rights from the third parties that make any of these discoveries. in addition, there are a finite number of diseases and conditions for which our nat diagnostic assays may be economically viable. if we are unable to access new technologies or the rights to particular sequences or markers necessary for additional diagnostic products on commercially reasonable terms, we may be limited in our ability to develop new diagnostic products.
our products and manufacturing processes will require access to technologies and materials that may be subject to patents or other intellectual property rights held by third parties. we may need to obtain additional intellectual property rights in order to commercialize our products. we may be unable to obtain such rights on commercially reasonable terms or at all, which could adversely affect our ability to grow our business.
our business could be harmed if we are unable to protect our proprietary technology.
we have relied primarily on a combination of trade secrets, patents, copyrights and confidentiality procedures to protect our products and technology. despite these precautions, unauthorized third parties may infringe our intellectual property, or copy or reverse engineer portions of our technology. the pursuit and assertion of a patent right, particularly in areas like nucleic acid diagnostics and biotechnology, involve complex determinations and, therefore, are characterized by substantial uncertainty. we do not know if current or future patent applications will be issued with the full scope of the claims sought, if at all, or whether any patents that do issue will be challenged or invalidated. the patents that we own or license could also be subject to interference proceedings or similar disputes over the priority of the inventions, and an unfavorable outcome could require us to cease using the related technology or to attempt to license rights to the technology from the prevailing party. in addition, the laws governing patentability and the scope of patent coverage continue to evolve, particularly in the field of biotechnology. as a result, patents might not issue from certain of our patent applications or from applications licensed to us.
we have obtained or applied for corresponding patents and patent applications in several foreign countries for some of our u.s. patents and patent applications. there is a risk that these patent applications will not be granted or that the patent or patent application will not provide significant protection for our products and technology. moreover, there is a risk that foreign intellectual property laws will not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as intellectual property laws in the u.s.
the rights provided by a patent are finite in time. over the coming years, certain patents relating to current products will expire in the u.s. and abroad thus allowing third parties to utilize certain of our technologies.
our competitors may independently develop similar or superior technology that our patents do not cover. in addition, because patent applications in the u.s. are not generally publicly disclosed until eighteen months after the application is filed, applications may have been filed by third parties that relate to our technology. even if our proprietary information is protected by patents or otherwise, the initiation of actions to protect our proprietary information could be costly and divert the efforts and attention of our management and technical personnel, and the outcome of such litigation is often uncertain. as a result of these uncertainties, we could also elect to forego such litigation or settle such litigation without fully enforcing our proprietary rights. in the absence of significant patent protection, we may be vulnerable to competitors who attempt to copy our products, processes or technology.
additionally, the effect of the prometheus laboratories and myriad genetics decisions on patents for other isolated natural products is uncertain and these decisions could increase the uncertainties and costs surrounding the prosecution of our patent applications and the enforcement or defense of our issued patents, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition.
24
our business could be harmed if we infringe upon the intellectual property rights of others.
there has been substantial litigation regarding patent and other intellectual property rights in the medical device, diagnostic products and related industries. we are and have been involved in patent litigation, and may in the future be subject to further claims of infringement of intellectual property rights possessed by third parties.
in connection with claims of patent infringement, we may seek to enter into settlement and/or licensing arrangements. there is a risk in these situations that no license will be available or that a license will not be available on reasonable terms. alternatively, we may decide to litigate such claims or to design around the patented technology. these actions could be costly and would divert the efforts and attention of our management and technical personnel. as a result, any infringement claims by third parties or claims for indemnification by customers resulting from infringement claims, whether or not proven to be true, may harm our business and prospects.
our international operations and foreign acquisitions expose us to additional operational challenges that we might not otherwise face.
we are subject to a number of additional risks and expenses due to our international operations, including our operations in china. any of these risks or expenses could harm our operating results. these risks and expenses include:
•   difficulties in developing staffing and simultaneously managing operations in multiple locations as a result of, among other things, distance, language and cultural differences;
•   protectionist laws and business practices that favor local companies;
•   difficulties in the collection of trade accounts receivable;
•   difficulties and expenses related to implementing internal control over financial reporting and disclosure controls and procedures;
•   expenses associated with customizing products for clients in foreign countries;
•   possible adverse tax consequences;
•   the inability to obtain favorable third-party reimbursements;
•   the inability to obtain required regulatory approvals;
•   governmental currency controls;
•   multiple, conflicting and changing government laws and regulations (including, among other things antitrust and tax requirements);
•   operation in parts of the world where strict compliance with anti-bribery laws may conflict with local customs and practices;
•   reduced protection for intellectual property rights in some countries;
•   political and economic changes and disruptions, export/import controls and tariff regulations;
•   the inability to effectively obtain or enforce intellectual property rights and otherwise protect against clone or "knock off" products; and
•   the lack of ability to enforce non-compete agreements with former owners of acquired businesses competing with us in china and other foreign countries.
our global operations are required to comply with the fcpa, chinese anti-corruption and similar anti-bribery laws in other jurisdictions and with u.s. and foreign export control, trade embargo and customs laws. if we fail to comply with any of these laws, we could suffer civil and criminal sanctions.
our china operations are subject to national, regional and local regulations. the regulatory environment in china is evolving, and officials in the chinese government exercise broad discretion in deciding how to interpret and apply regulations. it is possible that the chinese government's current or future interpretation and application of existing or new regulations will negatively impact our china operations, result in regulatory investigations or lead to fines or penalties.

we utilize distributors for a portion of our sales, the loss of which could harm our revenues in the territory serviced by these distributors.
we rely on strategic relationships with a number of key distributors for sales and service of our products. for example, in our diagnostics business we are dependent on grifols to distribute the blood screening products we manufacture. commercial blood screening product sales to grifols accounted for 18.8% and 16.6% of our diagnostics segment revenue in fiscal 2014 and 2013 respectively. if our blood screening relationship or any of our other strategic relationships are terminated and not replaced, our revenues and/or ability to service our products in the territories serviced by these distributors could be adversely affected. if any of our distribution or marketing agreements are terminated, particularly our blood screening collaboration agreement, or if we elect to distribute new products directly, we will have to invest in additional sales and marketing resources, including additional field sales personnel, which would significantly increase future selling, general and administrative expenses. we may not be able to enter into new distribution or marketing agreements on satisfactory terms, or at all. if we fail to enter into acceptable distribution or marketing agreements or fail to successfully market our products, our product sales will decrease. we may also be exposed to risks as a result of transitioning a territory from a distributor sales model to a direct sales model, such as difficulties maintaining relationships with specific customers, hiring appropriately trained personnel or ensuring compliance with local product registration requirements, any of which could result in lower revenues than previously received from the distributor in that territory.
fluctuations in the exchange rates of european currencies and the other foreign currencies in which we conduct our business, in relation to the u.s. dollar, could harm our business and prospects.
we maintain sales and service offices outside the u.s., have manufacturing facilities outside the u.s. in costa rica, canada, the united kingdom, germany and china, and conduct business worldwide. the expenses of our international offices are denominated in local currencies, except at our costa rica subsidiary, where the majority of business is conducted in u.s. dollars. our foreign sales may be denominated in local currencies, the euro or u.s. dollar.
fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates could affect our revenues, cost of goods and operating margins and could result in exchange losses. in addition, currency devaluation can result in a loss if we hold deposits of that currency. in the last few years we have not hedged foreign currency exposures, but we may in the future hedge foreign currency denominated sales. there is a risk that any hedging activities will not be successful in mitigating our foreign exchange risk exposure and may adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations.
we have only one third-party manufacturer for certain of our product lines and rely on one or a limited number of suppliers for some key raw materials, components or subassemblies for our products. this reliance exposes us to increased risks associated with production delays, delivery schedules, manufacturing capability, quality control, quality assurance and costs.
certain of our raw materials, components or subassemblies are purchased from a single-source due to cost, quality, expertise or other considerations. obtaining alternative sources of supply of these raw materials, components or subassemblies could involve significant delays and other costs and regulatory challenges, and may not be available to us on reasonable terms, if at all. the failure of a supplier to provide sufficient quantities, acceptable quality and timely delivery of goods at an acceptable price, or an interruption in the delivery of goods from such a supplier could harm our business and prospects. any disruption of supplies of goods could delay or reduce shipments, which could result in lost or deferred sales. for example, we have one third-party manufacturer for each of our molecular diagnostics instruments. kmc systems, inc., or kmc systems, is the only manufacturer of the tigris instrument; stratec biomedical ag, or stratec, is the only manufacturer of the panther instrument; and d&k engineering, inc., or d&k, is the only manufacturer of the tomcat instrument. we have no firm long-term commitments from kmc systems, stratec, d&k or any of our other contract manufacturers to supply goods to us for any specific period, or in any specific quantity, except as may be provided in a particular purchase order. if kmc systems, stratec, d&k or any of our other third-party manufacturers experiences delays, disruptions, capacity constraints or quality control problems in its development or manufacturing operations or becomes insolvent or otherwise fails to supply us with goods in sufficient quantities, then instrument shipments to our customers could be delayed, which would decrease our revenues and harm our competitive position and reputation. further, because we place orders with our manufacturers based on forecasts of expected demand for our products, if we inaccurately forecast demand we may be unable to obtain adequate manufacturing capacity or adequate quantities of components to meet our customers' delivery requirements. similarly, we rely on one or a limited number of suppliers for some key raw materials for our products. for example, our current supplier of certain key raw materials for certain of our amplified nat diagnostic assays, pursuant to a fixed-price contract, is roche and we have a supply and purchase agreement for oligonucleotides for hpv with roche molecular systems, inc. we also have a supply agreement with an affiliate of ge for membranes used in connection with our thinprep product line. ge competes with us in our breast health and skeletal health businesses.
26
we may in the future need to find new contract manufacturers or suppliers to replace existing manufacturers or suppliers, increase our volumes or reduce our costs. we may not be able to find contract manufacturers or suppliers that meet our needs, and even if we do the process is expensive and time consuming. if we are required or elect to change contract manufacturers or suppliers, we may lose revenues and our customer relationships may suffer.
we may experience unexpected problems and expenses associated with our planned consolidation of operations and facilities that could materially harm our business and prospects.
we continually review our operations and facilities in an effort to reduce costs and increase efficiencies. to that end, we recently completed consolidating our madison, wisconsin molecular diagnostics operations into our facilities in san diego, california. during fiscal 2013, we moved our selenium panel coating production line into our digital detector manufacturing facility in newark, delaware from germany, and have completed the consolidation of our breast biopsy operations, including manufacturing, research and development and sales support to our costa rica manufacturing facility and facilities in massachusetts. uncertainty is inherent within the consolidation process, and unforeseen circumstances, costs and expenses could offset the anticipated benefits, disrupt operations, including the timely delivery of products and service to customers, and impact product quality, which could materially harm our business and prospects. in addition, we may fail to retain key employees who possess specific knowledge or expertise and who we depend upon for the timely and successful transition, we may not be able to attract a sufficient number of skilled workers at the new locations to handle the additional production and other demands, and the relocation may absorb significant management and key employee attention and resources. if any of these risks materialize, our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects may be adversely affected.
we face intense competition from other companies and may not be able to compete successfully.
a number of companies have developed, or are expected to develop, products that compete or will compete with our products. in addition, some companies may have significant competitive advantages over us, which may make them more attractive to hospitals, radiology clients, group purchasing organizations, laboratories, and physicians, including:
•   greater brand recognition;
•   larger or more established distribution networks and customer bases;
•   a broader product portfolio, resulting in the ability to offer rebates or bundle products to offer discounts or incentives to gain a competitive advantage;
•   higher levels of automation and greater installed bases of such equipment;
•   more extensive research, development, sales, marketing, and manufacturing capabilities and greater financial resources; and
•   greater technical resources positioning them to continue to improve their technology in order to compete in an evolving industry.
the markets in which we sell our products are intensely competitive, subject to rapid technological change and may be significantly affected by new product introductions and other market activities of industry participants, and these competitive pressures may reduce our gross margins. other companies may develop products that are superior to and/or less expensive than our products. improvements in existing competitive products or the introduction of new competitive products may reduce our ability to compete for sales, particularly if those competitive products demonstrate better safety or effectiveness, clinical results, ease of use or lower costs.
the current environment of managed care, economically-motivated buyers, consolidation among healthcare providers, increased competition and declining reimbursement rates, together with current global economic conditions and healthcare reform measures, may put additional competitive pressure on us, including on our average selling prices, overall procedure rates and market sizes.
if we are unable to compete effectively against existing and future competitors and existing and future alternative products and treatments, our business and prospects could be harmed.
27
our diagnostics segment depends on a small number of customers for a significant portion of its product sales, the loss of any of these customers or any cancellation or delay of a large purchase by any of these customers could significantly reduce revenues in our diagnostics segment.
although we do not currently have any customers that represent more than 10% of our consolidated revenues, a material portion of product sales in our diagnostics segment comes from a limited number of customers. we have long-term commitments with some of our diagnostics' customers, but only our collaboration agreement with grifols results in revenues of more than 10% of our diagnostics segment's total revenues. product sales from our blood screening collaboration with grifols accounted for 18.8% and 16.6% of our diagnostics segment revenue in fiscal 2014 and 2013, respectively. in fiscal 2014, our blood screening collaboration was largely dependent on two significant customers in the u.s., the american red cross and creative testing solutions, although we did not receive any revenues directly from those entities. we anticipate that our operating results in our diagnostics segment will continue to depend, to a significant extent, upon revenues from a small number of customers. the loss of any of these key customers, or a significant reduction in sales volume or pricing to these customers, could significantly reduce our diagnostics segment revenues or profitability.
our success depends upon our ability to adapt to rapid changes in technology and customer requirements.
the markets for our products have been characterized by rapid technological change, frequent product introductions and evolving customer requirements. these trends will likely continue into the foreseeable future. our success depends, in part, upon our ability to enhance our existing products, successfully develop new products that meet increasingly challenging customer requirements and gain market acceptance. if we fail to do so our products may be rendered obsolete or uncompetitive by new industry standards or changing technology.
we will likely continue to incur significant research and development expenses, which may reduce our profitability.
historically, we have incurred significant costs in connection with the development and improvement of our products and technologies. we expect that research and development expenditures will remain high as we seek to expand our product offerings and continue to develop and improve products and technologies. as a result, we will need to continue to generate significant revenues to maintain current levels of profitability. we may not be able to generate sufficient revenues to maintain current levels of profitability in the future.
our results of operations are subject to significant quarterly variation.
our results of operations have been and may continue to be subject to significant quarterly variation. our results for a particular quarter may also vary due to a number of factors, including:
•   the overall state of healthcare and cost containment efforts;
•   the timing and level of reimbursement for our products domestically and internationally;
•   the development status and demand for our products;
•   the development status and demand for therapies to treat the health concerns addressed by our products and treatments;
•   economic conditions in our markets;
•   foreign exchange rates;
•   the timing of orders;
•   the timing of expenditures in anticipation of future sales;
•   the mix of products we sell and markets we serve;
•   regulatory approval of products;
•   the introduction of new products and product enhancements by us or our competitors;
•   pricing and other competitive conditions;
•   unanticipated expenses;
•   complex revenue recognition rules pursuant to u.s. generally accepted accounting principles, which we refer to as u.s. gaap;
•   asset impairments;
•   contingent consideration charges;
•   restructuring and consolidation charges; and
•   seasonality of sales of certain of our products.
28
customers may also cancel or reschedule shipments. production difficulties could also delay shipments. any of these factors also could harm our business and prospects.
some of our activities may subject us to risks under federal and state laws prohibiting "kickbacks" and false or fraudulent claims.
we are subject to the provisions of a federal law commonly known as the anti-kickback statute, and several similar state laws, which prohibit payments intended to induce physicians or others either to refer patients or to acquire or arrange for or recommend the acquisition of healthcare products or services. while the federal law applies only to products or services for which payment may be made by a federal healthcare program, state laws often apply regardless of whether federal funds may be involved. these laws constrain the sales, marketing and other promotional activities of manufacturers of medical devices by limiting the kinds of financial arrangements, including sales programs, that may be used with hospitals, physicians, laboratories and other potential purchasers of medical devices. other federal and state laws generally prohibit individuals or entities from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, claims for payment from medicare, medicaid, or other third-party payors that are false or fraudulent, or are for items or services that were not provided as claimed. anti-kickback and false claims laws prescribe civil and criminal penalties (including fines) for noncompliance that can be substantial. similarly, our international operations are subject to the provisions of the fcpa, which prohibits u.s. companies and their representatives from offering, promising, authorizing, or making payments to foreign officials for the purpose of influencing any act or decision of such official in his or her official capacity, inducing the official to do any act in violation of his or her lawful duty, or to secure any improper advantage in obtaining or retaining business. in many countries, the healthcare professionals we regularly interact with may meet the definition of a foreign official for purposes of the fcpa. in addition to the fcpa, our international operations are also subject to various other international anti-bribery laws such as the uk anti-bribery act. our policies mandate compliance with these anti-bribery laws. however, despite meaningful measures that we undertake to facilitate lawful conduct, which include training and compliance programs and internal control policies and procedures, we may not always prevent unauthorized, reckless or criminal acts by our employees or agents, or employees or agents of businesses or operations we may acquire. it is possible that our practices might be challenged under federal or state anti-kickback, fcpa or similar laws due to the breadth of the statutory provisions and the absence of extensive guidance regarding compliance. violations of these laws, or allegations of such violations, could disrupt our operations, involve significant management distraction and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. we also could be subject to adverse publicity, severe penalties, including criminal and civil penalties, disgorgement, further changes or enhancements to our procedures, policies and controls, personnel changes and other remedial actions. moreover, our failure to comply with domestic or foreign laws could result in various adverse consequences, including possible delay in approval or refusal to approve a product, recalls, seizures, and withdrawal of an approved product from the market.
failure to comply with laws relating to the confidentiality of sensitive personal information or standards related to the transmission of electronic health data, may require us to make significant changes to our products, or incur penalties or other liabilities.
state, federal and foreign laws, such as the federal health insurance portability and accountability act of 1996, or hipaa, regulate the confidentiality of sensitive personal information and the circumstances under which such information may be released. these measures may govern the disclosure and use of personal and patient medical record information and may require users of such information to implement specified security measures, and to notify individuals in the event of privacy and security breaches. evolving laws and regulations in this area could restrict the ability of our customers to obtain, use or disseminate patient information, or could require us to incur significant additional costs to re-design our products in a timely manner to reflect these legal requirements, either of which could have an adverse impact on our results of operations. other health information standards, such as regulations under hipaa, establish standards regarding electronic health data transmissions and transaction code set rules for specified electronic transactions, for example transactions involving submission of claims to third party payors. these standards also continue to evolve and are often unclear and difficult to apply. in addition, under the federal health information technology for economic and clinical health act, or hitech act, some of our businesses that were previously only indirectly subject to federal hipaa privacy and security rules became directly subject to such rules because the businesses may be deemed to serve as "business associates" to certain of our customers. in january 2013, the office for civil rights of the department of health and human services released a final rule implementing the hitech act and making certain other changes to hipaa privacy and security requirements. compliance with the rule will increase the requirements applicable to some of our businesses. failure to maintain the confidentiality of sensitive personal information in accordance with the applicable regulatory requirements, or to abide by electronic health data transmission standards, could expose us to breach of contract claims, fines and penalties, costs for remediation and harm to our reputation.
29
new regulations related to "conflict minerals" may cause us to incur additional expenses and could limit the supply and increase the cost of certain metals used in manufacturing our products.
in august 2012, the sec adopted a new rule requiring disclosures of specified minerals, known as conflict minerals, that are necessary to the functionality or production of products manufactured or contracted to be manufactured by public companies. the conflict minerals rule requires companies annually to diligence, disclose and report whether or not such minerals originate from the democratic republic of congo and other specified countries. the new rule could affect sourcing at competitive prices and availability in sufficient quantities of certain minerals used in the manufacture of our products, including tantalum, tin, gold and tungsten. the number of suppliers who provide conflict-free minerals may be limited. in addition, there may be material costs associated with complying with the disclosure requirements, such as costs related to determining the source of certain minerals used in our products, as well as costs of possible changes to products, processes, or sources of supply as a consequence of such verification activities. since our supply chain is complex, we may not be able to sufficiently verify the origins of the relevant minerals used in our products through the due diligence procedures that we implement, which may harm our reputation. in addition, we may encounter challenges to satisfy those customers who require that all of the components of our products be certified as conflict-free, which could place us at a competitive disadvantage if we are unable to do so.
security breaches and other disruptions could compromise our information, expose us to liability and harm our reputation and business.
in the ordinary course of our business we collect and store sensitive data, including intellectual property, personal information, our proprietary business information and that of our customers, suppliers and business partners, and personally identifiable information of our customers and employees in our data centers and on our networks. the secure maintenance and transmission of this information is critical to our operations and business strategy. we rely on commercially available systems, software, tools and monitoring to provide security for processing, transmission and storage of confidential information. computer hackers may attempt to penetrate our computer systems and, if successful, misappropriate personal or confidential business information. in addition, an associate, contractor, or other third-party with whom we do business may attempt to circumvent our security measures in order to obtain such information, and may purposefully or inadvertently cause a breach involving such information. any such compromise of our data security and access, public disclosure, or loss of personal or confidential business information could result in legal claims or proceedings, liability under laws that protect the privacy of personal information, and regulatory penalties, disrupt our operations, damage our reputation and customers' willingness to transact business with us, and subject us to additional costs and liabilities any of which could adversely affect our business. although we have experienced occasional, actual or attempted breaches of our computer systems, to date none of these breaches has had a material effect on our business, operations or reputation.
we are subject to the risk of product liability claims relating to our products.
our business involves the risk of product liability and other claims inherent to the medical device business. if even one of our products is found to have caused or contributed to injuries or deaths, we could be held liable for substantial damages. we maintain product liability insurance subject to deductibles and exclusions. there is a risk that the insurance coverage will not be sufficient to protect us from product and other liability claims, or that product liability insurance will not be available to us at a reasonable cost, if at all. an under-insured or uninsured claim could harm our business and prospects. in addition, claims could adversely affect the reputation of the related product, which could damage that product's competitive position in the market.
the sale and use of our diagnostic products could also lead to the filing of product liability claims if someone were to allege that one of our products contained a design or manufacturing defect that resulted in inaccurate test results or the failure to detect a disorder for which it was being used to screen, or caused injuries to a patient. any product liability claim brought against us, with or without merit, could result in an increase in our product liability insurance rates or the inability to secure additional coverage in the future. also, even a meritless or unsuccessful product liability claim could be time consuming and expensive to defend, which could result in a diversion of management's attention from our business and could adversely affect the perceived safety and efficacy of our products, and could harm our business and prospects.
30
we use hazardous materials and products.
our research and development and manufacturing processes involve the controlled use of hazardous materials, such as toxic and carcinogenic chemicals and various radioactive compounds. although we believe that our safety procedures for handling and disposing of such materials comply with the standards prescribed by federal, state, foreign and local regulations, the risk of accidental contamination or injury from these materials cannot be eliminated. in the event of this type of accident, we could be held liable for any resulting damages, and any such liability could be extensive. from time to time new regulations are enacted, and it is difficult to anticipate how such regulations will be implemented and enforced. we continue to evaluate the necessary steps for compliance with regulations as they are enacted. these regulations include, for example, the registration, evaluation, authorization and restriction of chemical substances, or reach, the restriction on the use of certain hazardous substances in electrical and electronic equipment directive, or rohs, and the waste electrical and electronic equipment directive, or weee, enacted in the european union which regulate the use of certain hazardous substances in, and require the collection, reuse and recycling of waste from, certain products we manufacture. this and similar legislation that has been or is in the process of being enacted in japan and china and various states of the u.s. may require us to re-design our products to ensure compliance with the applicable standards, for example by requiring the use of different types of materials. these redesigns or the use of alternative materials may detrimentally impact the performance of our products, add greater testing lead-times for product introductions or have other similar effects. we believe we comply with all such legislation where our products are sold and we will continue to monitor these laws and the related regulations to determine our responsibilities. we are also subject to substantial regulation relating to occupational health and safety, environmental protection, hazardous substance control, and waste management and disposal. the failure to comply with such regulations could subject us to, among other things, fines and criminal liability.
we may incur losses in excess of our insurance coverage.
our insurance coverage includes product liability, property, fire, terrorism and business interruption policies. our insurance coverage contains policy limits, specifications and exclusions. we believe that our insurance coverage is consistent with general practices within our industry. nonetheless, we may incur losses of a type for which we are not covered by insurance or which exceed the limits of liability of our insurance policies. in that event, we could experience a significant loss which could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition.
our future success depends on the continued services of key personnel.
we constantly monitor the dynamics of the economy, the healthcare industry and the markets in which we compete; and we continue to assess our key personnel that we believe are essential to our long-term success. during the last year we effected a leadership change and have made significant organizational and strategic changes in connection therewith. if we fail to effectively manage our ongoing organizational and strategic changes, our financial condition, results of operations, and reputation, as well as our ability to successfully attract, motivate and retain key employees, could be harmed.
moreover, in our industry, there is substantial competition for key personnel in the regions in which we operate and we may face increased competition for such employees. the loss of any of our key personnel, particularly management or key research and development personnel, could harm our business and prospects and could impede the achievement of our research and development, operational or strategic objectives. our success also depends upon our ability to attract and retain other qualified managerial and technical personnel. competition for such personnel is intense. we may not be able to attract and retain personnel necessary for the development of our business.
an adverse change in the projected cash flows from our business units or the business climate in which they operate, including the continuation of the current financial and economic uncertainty, could require us to record an impairment charge, which could have an adverse impact on our operating results.
at least annually, we review the carrying value of our goodwill, and for other long-lived assets when indicators of impairment are present, to determine if any adverse conditions exist or a change in circumstances has occurred that would indicate impairment of the value of these assets. conditions that could indicate impairment and necessitate an evaluation of these assets include, but are not limited to, a significant adverse change in the business climate or the legal or regulatory environment within which we operate. in addition, the deterioration of a company's market capitalization significantly below its net book value is an indicator of impairment. we assess goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level and in evaluating the potential impairment of goodwill, we make assumptions regarding the amount and timing of future cash flows, terminal value growth rates and appropriate discount rates.
31
all of our reporting units passed step 1 of the goodwill impairment test in fiscal 2014. one reporting unit within our diagnostics segment passed step 1 by less than 10% and is at risk of failing such tests in the future. this reporting unit had $202.8 million of goodwill at september 27, 2014. although we use reasonable methodologies for developing assumptions and estimates underlying the fair value calculations used in our impairment tests, these estimates are uncertain by nature and can vary from actual results. it is possible that the continuation of the current global financial and economic uncertainty could negatively affect our anticipated future cash flows, or the discount rates used to value the cash flows for each reporting unit, to such an extent that we could be required to perform an interim impairment test during fiscal 2015.
our effective tax rate may fluctuate and we may incur obligations in tax jurisdictions in excess of amounts that have been accrued.
we are subject to income taxes and non-income based taxes in both the u.s. and various foreign jurisdictions. in certain instances, we take certain income tax return positions and provide additional taxes if it is more-likely-than-not that the tax position will not withstand a tax authority's challenge. we are subject to ongoing tax audits in various jurisdictions, and tax authorities may disagree with certain positions we have taken and assess additional taxes. we regularly evaluate the likely outcomes of audits to determine the appropriateness of our tax provision and tax reserves. however, we can give no assurance that we will accurately predict the audits' outcomes, which could have a material impact on our operating results and financial condition.
our effective tax rate may be lower or higher than prior years due to numerous factors, including a change in our geographic earnings mix and changes in tax laws or tax rulings. any of these factors could cause us to experience an effective tax rate significantly different from previous periods or our current expectations, which could have a material impact on our business and operating results. in addition, u.s. law makers are considering several u.s. corporate tax reform proposals, including, among others, proposals which could reduce or eliminate u.s. income tax deferrals on unrepatriated foreign earnings and eliminate tax incentives, such as the domestic manufacturing deduction and research credits, in exchange for a lower u.s. statutory tax rate.
risks relating to our indebtedness we incurred significant indebtedness in order to finance the acquisition of gen-probe, which will limit our operating flexibility, and could adversely affect our operations and financial results and prevent us from fulfilling our obligations.
as of september 27, 2014, we had approximately $4.27 billion aggregate principal of indebtedness. we also have other contractual obligations and deferred tax liabilities. this significant level of indebtedness and our other obligations may:
•   make it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations with respect to our outstanding indebtedness;
•   increase our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions, including increases in interest rates;
•   require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to interest and principal payments on our indebtedness, which will reduce the availability of our cash flow to fund working capital, capital expenditures, expansion efforts and other general corporate purposes;
•   limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the markets in which we participate;
•   place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less debt; and
•   limit our ability to borrow additional funds for working capital, capital expenditures, general corporate purposes or acquisitions.
in addition, the terms of our credit facilities require us to meet certain financial covenants that are customary with these types of credit facilities, which are described in note 5 "borrowings and credit arrangements" in the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements included in item 15 of this annual report. our ability to comply with these covenants may be adversely affected by general economic conditions, industry conditions and other events beyond our control. if we are unable to comply with these covenants, we could default under the credit facilities, which could cause us to be unable to borrow additional amounts under the credit facilities and may result in the acceleration of the maturity of our outstanding indebtedness under the facilities. if the maturities were accelerated, we may not have sufficient funds available for repayment, and if we were unable to make additional borrowings under the facilities, we may not be able to make investments in our business to support our strategy or we may end up in bankruptcy proceedings, or other processes, in which our business would be negatively impacted. in addition, our shareholders could be adversely impacted as shareholder value could decrease to a point of limited return. each scenario would result in significant negative implications to our liquidity and results of operations.
32
further, the terms of our indebtedness contain covenants that restrict our ability, and that of our subsidiaries, to engage in certain transactions and may impair our ability to respond to changing business and economic conditions, including, among other things, limitations on our ability to:
•   incur indebtedness or issue certain preferred equity;
•   pay dividends, redeem stock or make other distributions or restricted payments;
•   make certain investments;
•   agree to payment restrictions affecting the restricted subsidiaries;
•   sell or otherwise transfer or dispose of assets, including equity interests of our subsidiaries;
•   enter into transactions with our affiliates;
•   create liens;
•   designate our subsidiaries as unrestricted subsidiaries;
•   consolidate, merge or sell substantially all of our assets; and
•   use the proceeds of permitted sales of our assets.
if there were an event of default under one of our debt instruments or a change of control, the holders of the debt could cause all amounts outstanding with respect to that debt to be due and payable immediately and may be cross-defaulted to other debt, including our senior notes. our assets or cash flow may not be sufficient to fully repay borrowings under our outstanding debt instruments if accelerated upon an event of default or a change of control, and there is no guarantee that we would be able to repay, refinance or restructure the payments on such debt. see "management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations-liquidity and capital resources."
we may not be able to generate sufficient cash flow to service all of our indebtedness and other obligations.
our ability to make payments on and to refinance our indebtedness and to fund planned capital expenditures, strategic transactions and expansion efforts will depend on our ability to generate cash in the future. this, to a certain extent, is subject to general economic, financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control.
our business may not be able to generate sufficient cash flow from operations, and we can give no assurance that future borrowings will be available to us in amounts sufficient to enable us to pay our indebtedness as such indebtedness matures and to fund our other liquidity needs. if this occurs, we will need to refinance all or a portion of our indebtedness on or before maturity, and there can be no assurance that we will be able to refinance any of our indebtedness on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. we may need to adopt one or more alternatives, such as reducing or delaying planned expenses and capital expenditures, selling assets, restructuring debt, or obtaining additional equity or debt financing. these alternative strategies may not be affected on satisfactory terms, if at all. our ability to refinance our indebtedness or obtain additional financing, or to do so on commercially reasonable terms, will depend on, among other things, our financial condition at the time, restrictions in agreements governing our indebtedness, and other factors, including the condition of the financial markets and the markets in which we compete.
if we do not generate sufficient cash flow from operations, and additional borrowings, refinancings or proceeds from asset sales are not available to us, we may not have sufficient cash to enable us to meet all of our obligations.
a significant portion of our indebtedness is subject to floating interest rates, which may expose us to higher interest payments.
a significant portion of our indebtedness is subject to floating interest rates, which makes us more vulnerable in the event of adverse economic conditions, increases in prevailing interest rates, or a downturn in our business. as of september 27, 2014, approximately $2.05 billion aggregate principal of our indebtedness, which represents the outstanding principal under our tranche a term loan facility and our tranche b term loan facility, was subject to floating interest rates. we currently have no hedging arrangements in place to mitigate the impact of higher interest rates.
33
risks relating to our common stock future issuances of common stock and hedging activities may depress the trading price of our common stock and our convertible notes.
any future issuance of equity securities, including the issuance of shares upon conversion of our convertible notes, could dilute the interests of our existing stockholders, including holders who have received shares upon conversion of our convertible notes, and could substantially decrease the trading price of our common stock and our convertible notes. we may issue equity securities in the future for a number of reasons, including to finance our operations and business strategy (including in connection with acquisitions, strategic collaborations or other transactions), to adjust our ratio of debt to equity, to satisfy our obligations upon the exercise of outstanding warrants or options or for other reasons.
in addition, the price of our common stock could also be affected by possible sales of our common stock by investors who view our convertible notes as a more attractive means of equity participation in our company and by hedging or arbitrage trading activity that we expect to develop involving our common stock. the hedging or arbitrage could, in turn, affect the trading price of our convertible notes, or any common stock that note holders receive upon conversion of their notes.
future sales of our common stock in the public market or the issuance of securities senior to our common stock could adversely affect the trading price of our common stock and the value of our convertible notes and our ability to raise funds in new securities offerings.
future sales of our common stock, the perception that such sales could occur or the availability of shares of our common stock or securities convertible into or exercisable for our common stock for future sale could adversely affect the market price of our common stock and the value of our convertible notes prevailing from time to time and could impair our ability to raise capital through future offerings of equity or equity-related securities. in addition, we may issue common stock or equity securities senior to our common stock in the future for a number of reasons, including to finance our operations and business strategy, to adjust our ratio of debt to equity, to satisfy our obligations upon the exercise of options or for other reasons.
provisions in our charter, bylaws, and indebtedness may have the effect of discouraging advantageous offers for our business or common stock and limit the price that investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock.
our charter, bylaws, and the provisions of the delaware general corporation law include provisions that may have the effect of discouraging or preventing a change of control. our indebtedness also contains provisions which either accelerate or require us to offer to repurchase the indebtedness at a premium upon a change of control. these provisions could limit the price that our stockholders might receive in the future for shares of our common stock.
our stock price is volatile.
the market price of our common stock has been, and may continue to be, highly volatile. we believe that a variety of factors could cause the price of our common stock to fluctuate, perhaps substantially, including:
•   new, or changes in, recommendations, guidelines or studies that could affect the use of our products;

the price of our common stock also may be adversely affected by the amount of common stock issuable upon conversion of our convertible notes. in addition, in recent years the stock market in general and the markets for shares of "high-tech" companies, have experienced extreme price fluctuations which have often been unrelated to the operating performance of affected companies. any such fluctuations in the future could adversely affect the market price of our common stock, and the market price of our common stock may decline.
our previously announced stock repurchase program could affect the price of our common stock and increase volatility and may be suspended or terminated at any time, which may result in a decrease in the trading price of our common stock.
in november 2013, we announced that our board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to $250 million of our outstanding common stock over the next three years. under the stock repurchase program, we are authorized to repurchase, from time-to-time, shares of our outstanding common stock on the open market or in privately negotiated transactions in the u.s. the timing and amount of stock repurchases will be determined based upon our evaluation of market conditions and other factors. the stock repurchase program may be suspended, modified or discontinued at any time, and we have no obligation to repurchase any amount of our common stock under the program. repurchases pursuant to our stock repurchase program could affect our stock price and increase the volatility of our common stock. the existence of a stock repurchase program could also cause our stock price to be higher than it would be in the absence of such a program and could potentially reduce the market liquidity for our stock. there can be no assurance that any stock repurchases will enhance stockholder value because the market price of our common stock may decline below the levels at which we repurchased shares of common stock. although our stock repurchase program is intended to enhance long-term stockholder value, short-term stock price fluctuations could reduce the program's effectiveness. through september 27, 2014, we had not repurchased any shares of our common stock under this stock repurchase program.
item  7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the information described under the caption "risk factors" in part i, item 1a of this report.
overview we are a developer, manufacturer and supplier of premium diagnostics products, medical imaging systems and surgical products. our core business units are focused on diagnostics, breast health, gyn surgical and skeletal health. we sell and service our products through a combination of direct sales and service forces and a network of independent distributors and sales representatives.
we offer a wide range of diagnostic products which are used primarily to aid in the diagnosis of human diseases and screen donated human blood. our primary diagnostics products include our aptima family of assays, including our advanced instrumentation (panther and tigris), our thinprep system, the rapid fetal fibronectin test and procleix blood screening assays. the aptima family of assays is used to detect the infectious microorganisms that cause the common sexually transmitted diseases, or stds, chlamydia and gonorrhea, certain high-risk strains of human papillomavirus, or hpv, and trichomonas vaginalis, the parasite that causes trichomoniasis. the thinprep system is primarily used in cytology applications, such as cervical cancer screening, and the rapid fetal fibronectin test assists physicians in assessing the risk of pre-term birth. in blood screening, we develop and manufacture the procleix family of assays, which are used to detect various infectious diseases. these blood screening products are marketed worldwide by our blood screening collaborator, grifols s.a., or grifols, under grifols' trademarks.
our breast health products include a broad portfolio of breast imaging and related products and accessories, including digital and film-based mammography systems, computer-aided detection, or cad, for mammography and minimally invasive breast biopsy devices, breast biopsy site markers, breast biopsy guidance systems and breast brachytherapy products. our most advanced breast imaging platform, dimensions, utilizes a technology called tomosynthesis to produce 3d images, as well as conventional 2d full field digital mammography images.
our gyn surgical products include our novasure endometrial ablation system, or novasure, and our myosure hysteroscopic tissue removal system, or myosure. the novasure system involves a trans-cervical procedure for the treatment of abnormal uterine bleeding. the myosure system is a tissue removal device that is designed to provide incision-less removal of fibroids, polyps, and other pathology within the uterus.
our skeletal health products include dual-energy x-ray bone densitometry systems, an ultrasound-based osteoporosis assessment product, and our fluoroscan mini c-arm imaging products.

recent developments market acceptance of our medical products in the united states and other countries is dependent upon the purchasing and procurement practices of our customers, patient demand for our products and procedures, and the reimbursement of patients' medical expenses by government healthcare programs, private insurers or other healthcare payors. in the united states, the centers for medicare & medicaid services, known as cms, establishes coverage policies and payment rates for medicare beneficiaries. under current cms policies, varying payment levels have been established for certain of our products and treatments. coverage and payment policies and rates applicable to patients with private insurance are dependent upon individual private payor decisions which may not follow the policies and rates established by cms. the use of our products outside the united states is similarly affected by payment policies adopted by foreign regulatory authorities and insurance carriers. on october 31, 2014, cms for the first time released payment rates for screening and diagnostic 3d mammography (breast tomosynthesis). this action establishes national average payment rates for the category i current procedural terminology, or cpt, code for 3d mammography screening and creates a new add-on healthcare common procedure coding system, or hcpcs, code for 3d diagnostic mammography. these codes and rates go into effect january 1, 2015. coverage policies for 3d mammography still need to be determined by most government and private payors.

the continuing uncertainty surrounding worldwide financial markets and macroeconomic conditions has caused and may continue to cause the purchasers of medical equipment to decrease or delay their medical equipment purchasing and procurement activities. economic uncertainty as well as increasing health insurance premiums, deductibles and co-payments have resulted and may continue to result in cost-conscious consumers focusing on acute care rather than wellness, which has and may continue to adversely affect demand for our products and procedures. furthermore, governments and other third-party payors around the world facing tightening budgets could move to further reduce the reimbursement rates or the scope of coverage offered, which could adversely affect sales of our products. if the current adverse macroeconomic conditions continue, our business and prospects may be negatively impacted.
in march 2010, significant reforms to the healthcare system were adopted as law in the united states. the law includes provisions that, among other things, reduce and/or limit medicare reimbursement, require all individuals to have health insurance (with limited exceptions) and imposes new and/or increased taxes. specifically, the law requires the medical device industry to subsidize healthcare reform in the form of a 2.3% excise tax on united states sales of certain medical devices effective january 1, 2013. since the effective date of the medical device excise tax, the company has incurred $21.9 million and $15.7 million in fiscal 2014 and 2013, respectively, of excise tax expense related to the domestic sales of its medical device products. the law also includes regulatory mandates and other measures designed to constrain medical costs, as well as stringent reporting requirements of financial relationships between medical device manufacturers and physicians and hospitals. compliance with the healthcare legislation, including these reporting requirements and the excise tax, has imposed significant additional administrative and financial burdens on us. various healthcare reform proposals have also emerged at the state level and in various foreign countries. the healthcare reform legislation and these proposals could reduce medical procedure volumes and impact the demand for our products or the prices at which we sell our products. in addition, the excise tax has increased our cost of doing business. these reforms, cost containment measures and new taxes, including the uncertainty in the medical community regarding their nature and effect, could also have an adverse effect on our customers' purchasing decisions regarding our products and treatments and could harm our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects.
we operate in a highly regulated industry and other governmental actions may adversely affect our business, operations or financial condition, including, without limitation: new laws, regulations or judicial decisions, or new interpretations of existing laws, regulations or decisions, related to healthcare availability, methods of delivery and payment for healthcare products and services; changes in the fda and foreign regulatory approval processes that may delay or prevent the approval of new products and result in lost market opportunity; changes in fda and foreign regulations that may require additional safety monitoring, labeling changes, restrictions on product distribution or use, or other measures after the introduction of our products to market, any of which could increase our costs of doing business, adversely affect the future permitted uses of approved products, or otherwise adversely affect the market for our products and treatments; new laws, regulations and judicial decisions affecting pricing or marketing practices; and changes in the tax laws relating to our operations, including those associated with the recently adopted healthcare reform law discussed above.
professional societies, government agencies, practice management groups, private health/science foundations, and organizations involved in healthcare issues may publish guidelines, recommendations or studies to the healthcare and patient communities from time to time. recommendations of government agencies or these other groups/organizations may relate to such matters as usage, cost-effectiveness, and use of related preventative services and treatments/therapies. recommendations, guidelines or studies that are followed by patients and healthcare providers could result in decreased reimbursement or use of our products. for example, in november 2012, the american congress of obstetrics and gynecologists, known as the acog, released updates in which they have recommended less frequent cervical cancer screening similar to guidelines released in march 2012 by the u.s. preventative services task force, known as the uspstf, and the american cancer society. however, the uspstf recommendations now also include hpv co-testing for certain patient populations, an update from their draft guidelines in october 2011. overall, we believe that these guidelines have contributed to an increase in testing intervals in the u.s. for cervical cancer screening, resulting in fewer such tests being performed.
over the last few years, including in october 2014, there have been periodic significant fluctuations in foreign currencies relative to the u.s. dollar. the ongoing fluctuations of the value of the u.s. dollar may cause our products to be less competitive in international markets and may impact sales and profitability over time. a majority of our international sales are denominated in foreign currencies. given the uncertainty in the worldwide financial markets, foreign currency fluctuations may be significant in the future and we may experience a material adverse effect on our international revenues and operating results.

acquisitions fiscal 2012 acquisition:
gen-probe incorporated on august 1, 2012, we completed the acquisition of gen-probe for $3.97 billion, which was funded through available cash and financing consisting of senior secured credit facilities and senior notes resulting in aggregate proceeds of $3.48 billion, net of discounts. gen-probe's revenue and pre-tax loss from continuing operations for the period from the acquisition date to september 29, 2012 were $89.5 million and $47.7 million, respectively.

diagnostics product revenues decreased 1.7% in fiscal 2014 compared to fiscal 2013 primarily due to a reduction in thinprep revenues of $31.5 million and a decrease of $23.1 million in lifecodes revenue as a result of the divestiture of this product line in the second quarter of fiscal 2013. these decreases were partially offset by an increase in our molecular diagnostics products of $12.4 million primarily due to an increase in revenues from our aptima family of assays and an increase in blood screening revenues of $24.5 million, which were partially offset by lower sales of our tigris and panther instrumentation and lower prodesse sales.
we attribute the reduction in thinprep revenues primarily to lower domestic sales volumes resulting from an increase in screening intervals based on guidelines released in 2012 by the american congress of obstetrics and gynecologists and the u.s. preventative services task force and lower average sales prices internationally.
the increase in revenues in the current year related to our aptima family of assays was primarily due to increased volumes from our strategic alliance with quest diagnostics incorporated, or quest, entered into in the third quarter of fiscal 2013, our increased installed base of panther instruments, and increased sales volumes of our hpv screening assay, which was fda approved for use on our panther system in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013. these increases were partially offset by slightly lower average sales prices for our aptima products due to increased competitive pressures, and a reduction in cervista hpv revenues as our larger customers transition to our panther system and aptima hpv assay. the reduction in instruments sales was primarily due to the ramp up of unit sales to quest in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013. prodesse revenues decreased in the current year primarily due to a milder flu season this year compared to the corresponding period in the prior year and the recent introduction of competitive products.
our blood screening revenues increased in fiscal 2014 compared to fiscal 2013 primarily due to the inclusion of contingent revenue under our blood screening collaboration that was not recognized in the first quarter of fiscal 2013, and to a lesser extent the second quarter of fiscal 2013, due to unbilled accounts receivable being recorded as a fair value adjustment in purchase accounting. under the collaboration, a portion of our blood screening revenue is contingent on donations testing revenue earned by our blood screening collaborator. as a result, amounts that were to be received for this contingent revenue related to inventory on hand and not yet utilized by novartis' (our blood screening collaborator at the time) customers as of the date we acquired gen-probe were recorded as unbilled accounts receivable on the balance sheet in purchase accounting, and these amounts were not recorded as revenue in our results of operations in fiscal 2013. the amount of this contingent revenue not recorded as revenue in the prior year was $23.5 million. we also experienced an increase in volume due to the recent agreement between grifols, our current blood screening partner, and the japanese red cross. these increases were partially offset by lower west nile virus assay sales compared to the corresponding period in fiscal 2013 as last year had a higher incidence of the west nile virus resulting in higher donation testing in the prior year.
breast health product revenues increased 2.0% in fiscal 2014 compared to fiscal 2013. our digital mammography systems and related products revenue increased $22.8 million in fiscal 2014 compared to fiscal 2013 primarily due to the increase in 3d dimensions units sold on a worldwide basis and higher workstations and workflow product revenue driven by our c-view product. as expected, we continue to experience a decline in the number of 2d systems sold as customers transition to the 3d dimensions systems, which is occurring primarily in the united states. in addition, our breast biopsy products revenue increased $2.3 million in fiscal 2014 compared to fiscal 2013 primarily due to the increase in the number of eviva biopsy devices sold worldwide. these increases were partially offset by declines in our analog mammography systems and hitec imaging products.
44
gyn surgical product revenues increased 0.3% in fiscal 2014 compared to fiscal 2013 primarily due to an increase in myosure system sales of $18.3 million partially offset by lower novasure device sales of $16.8 million. the myosure system continues to gain strong market acceptance as unit sales increase globally, partially offset by product mix. we experienced a decrease in the number of novasure devices sold in the united states, which we continue to believe is primarily attributable to patients delaying surgery or opting for lower cost and generally less effective alternatives, partially offset by higher international volume.
skeletal health product revenues increased 1.4% in fiscal 2014 compared to fiscal 2013 primarily due to an increase in our osteoporosis assessment product sales, namely our horizon product, which was introduced in late fiscal 2013, and to a lesser extent our mini c-arm systems, partially offset by lower volumes of our older discovery products and pricing pressures.
in fiscal 2014, 73.6% of product revenues were generated in the united states, 13.8% in europe, 8.6% in asia-pacific, and 4.0% in other international markets. in fiscal 2013, 73.9% of product revenues were generated in the united states, 13.6% in europe, 8.9% in asia-pacific, and 3.6% in other international markets.

service and other revenues are primarily comprised of revenue generated from our field service organization to provide ongoing service, installation and repair of our products. the majority of these revenues are generated within our breast health segment. service and other revenues increased 11.3% in fiscal 2014 compared to fiscal 2013 primarily due to an increase in the number of service contracts in our breast health business driven by an increase in the installed base of our digital mammography systems, an increase in services not covered by service contracts and higher installation and training revenues related to our 3d dimensions systems. in addition, within our diagnostics' segment, we executed a license amendment with roka bioscience, inc. and received $20.1 million of non-recurring revenue in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014.

product gross margin increased to 48.8% in fiscal 2014 compared to 46.3% in fiscal 2013.
cost of product revenues. the cost of product revenues, excluding amortization and impairment of intangible assets, as a percentage of product revenue was 34.9% in fiscal 2014 compared to 38.9% in fiscal 2013. cost of product revenues as a percentage of product revenues in the current year decreased in diagnostics, breast health and skeletal health and remained relatively consistent in gyn surgical compared to the corresponding period in the prior year, resulting in an overall improved gross margin.
diagnostics' product costs as a percentage of revenue decreased in fiscal 2014 compared to fiscal 2013 primarily due to the inclusion of $52.4 million in the prior year of additional costs related to the sale of acquired inventory written up to fair value in purchase accounting for the gen-probe acquisition. in addition, we were able to recognize contingent revenue under our blood screening collaboration in the current year that we were not able to recognize in fiscal 2013 due to a purchase accounting adjustment as described above. we also had lower tigris and panther sales in fiscal 2014 and these instrument sales are typically low margin transactions. furthermore, we experienced favorable manufacturing variances across many of our products and lower royalty costs for thinprep, partially offset by unfavorable pricing on thinprep and aptima sales and increased service costs for placed instruments.
45
breast health's product costs as a percentage of revenue decreased in fiscal 2014 compared to fiscal 2013 primarily due to the increase in 3d dimensions sales on both a unit basis and as a percentage of total digital mammography systems sales compared to our 2d systems. our 3d dimensions systems have higher average sales prices than our 2d systems resulting in higher gross margins. in addition, we had higher software related sales for 3d upgrades and our c-view product, which have higher gross margins than capital equipment sales.
gyn surgical's product costs as a percentage of revenue in fiscal 2014 was relatively consistent with fiscal 2013. while we have experienced lower domestic novasure volumes and a change in myosure product mix, this trend was offset by the increased utilization at our costa rica facility in fiscal 2014 as a result of the transfer of our breast biopsy products from our indianapolis, indiana facility during the second half of fiscal 2013.
skeletal health's product costs as a percentage of revenue decreased in fiscal 2014 compared to fiscal 2013 primarily due to the increase in revenue for our horizon product, which has a higher gross margin than our legacy discovery products.
amortization of intangible assets. amortization of intangible assets relates to acquired developed technology. these intangible assets are generally amortized over their estimated useful lives of between 8.5 and 20 years using a straight-line method or, if reliably determinable, based on the pattern in which the economic benefits of the assets are expected to be consumed. the economic pattern is based on undiscounted future cash flows. the increase in amortization expense in fiscal 2014 compared to fiscal 2013 was primarily due to certain in-process research and development projects recorded in the gen-probe acquisition receiving fda approval in fiscal 2013. as a result, these approved projects are now being amortized. in addition, we adjusted the estimated life of the mri breast coils developed technology assets in the third quarter of fiscal 2014 resulting in higher amortization expense.
impairment of intangible assets. in the second quarter of fiscal 2014, we evaluated our mri breast coils product line asset group, which is within our breast health segment, for impairment due to our expectation that it would be sold or disposed of significantly before the end of its previously estimated useful life. the undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by this asset group over its estimated remaining life were not sufficient to recover its carrying value. at that time, we estimated the fair value of the asset group resulting in an aggregate impairment charge of $28.6 million, comprised of $27.1 million of intangible assets and $1.5 million of property and equipment. the impairment charge was allocated to the long-lived assets, resulting in $26.6 million being allocated to developed technology. the mri breast coils product line was sold in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014.
during the third quarter of fiscal 2013, we determined that a developed technology asset was impaired due to our decision to cease selling and providing support for such product. as a result, we recorded a $1.7 million charge to record the asset at its fair value.

service and other revenues gross margin was 51.2% in fiscal 2014 compared to 48.1% in fiscal 2013. within our breast health segment, the continued conversion of a high percentage of our domestic installed base of digital mammography systems to service contracts upon expiration of the warranty period without a corresponding increase in costs to service these contracts has resulted in higher gross margins. in addition, the $20.1 million of revenue from the roka bioscience, inc. license amendment transaction, which did not have any corresponding costs, increased gross margin.

** percentage not meaningful research and development expenses. research and development expenses increased 2.8% in fiscal 2014 compared to fiscal 2013 primarily due to an increase in compensation, additional program spend for our virology product line and increased spending for our next generation breast biopsy products. these increases were partially offset by lower headcount, reductions to certain development programs, primarily in the gyn surgical business as part of our cost containment measures implemented in fiscal 2013 and the beginning of the first quarter of fiscal 2014, lower integration costs related to the gen-probe acquisition, and the divestiture of lifecodes (in the second quarter of fiscal 2013), which contributed $4.2 million of expense in the prior year. research and development primarily reflects spending on new product development programs, regulatory compliance and clinical research and trials. at any point in time, we have a number of different research projects and clinical trials being conducted and the timing of these projects and related costs can vary from period to period.
selling and marketing expenses. selling and marketing expenses decreased 3.0% in fiscal 2014 compared to fiscal 2013 primarily due to lower compensation as a result of headcount reductions and lower spend on trade shows, seminars, consulting services, medical education and travel, primarily as a result of our cost containment measures, and lower integration costs related to the gen-probe acquisition. in addition, fiscal 2013 included $4.6 million of expense related to lifecodes. these reductions were partially offset by an increase in spend for advertising initiatives and market research.
general and administrative expenses. general and administrative expenses increased 14.1% in fiscal 2014 compared to fiscal 2013 primarily due to an increase in the medical device excise tax of $6.2 million (primarily due to the inclusion of this expense for the entire fiscal year in 2014 compared to three quarters in fiscal 2013), legal and consulting fees of $4.7 million incurred in the first quarter of fiscal 2014 to assist us in our negotiations and response to shareholder activism, higher legal fees for litigation, an increase in certain non-income tax expenses, tax consulting fees and credit card fees related to customer payments, partially offset by lower compensation due to headcount reductions from our cost containment measures and lower integration costs related to the gen-probe acquisition. in addition, the first quarter of fiscal 2013 included legal settlement benefits of $8.9 million.
47
amortization of intangible assets. amortization of intangible assets results from customer relationships, trade names, business licenses and non-compete agreements related to our acquisitions. these intangible assets are generally amortized over their estimated useful lives of between 2 and 30 years using a straight-line method or, if reliably determinable, based on the pattern in which the economic benefits of the assets are expected to be consumed utilizing expected undiscounted future cash flows. the increase in fiscal 2014 compared to fiscal 2013 was primarily due to shortening the remaining life of certain corporate trade names as we decided to phase out their use during the second quarter of fiscal 2014 partially offset by lower amortization from intangibles acquired in the cytyc, inc. acquisition in fiscal 2008 as the pattern of economic benefits decreases.
impairment of intangible assets. in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014, we recorded a $5.1 million impairment charge for our existing in-process research and development, or ipr&d, projects from our gen-probe acquisition primarily due to a reduction in estimated future revenues from these products.
contingent consideration-compensation expense. in connection with our acquisition of tct international co., ltd., or tct, we were obligated to make contingent earn-out payments. the payments were contingent on future employment and based on achieving certain incremental revenue growth milestones. the measurement period ended in fiscal 2013, and as such, there were no charges in fiscal 2014.
contingent consideration-fair value adjustments. in connection with our acquisition of interlace medical, inc., or interlace, we were required to pay future consideration that was contingent on achieving certain revenue based milestones. as of the acquisition date, we recorded a contingent consideration liability for the estimated fair value of the amount we expected to pay to the former shareholders of interlace. this liability was based on future revenue projections. we recorded charges of $11.3 million in fiscal 2013 reflecting an increase in the fair value of the liability due to higher revenues from interlace than originally estimated. the measurement period for this contingent consideration ended in the second quarter of fiscal 2013, and as such, there were no charges in fiscal 2014.
impairment of goodwill. during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013, as a result of our company-wide annual budgeting and forecasting process and a full re-evaluation of our existing product development efforts and cost structure, we reduced our short term and long term revenue forecasts and determined that indicators of impairment existed in our molecular diagnostics reporting unit. the updated forecast, which reflected pricing pressures, for revenue and profitability was lower than those expected at the time of the gen-probe acquisition. as such, the fair value of this reporting unit declined. as a result of performing step 2 of the goodwill impairment test, which requires the completion of a hypothetical purchase price allocation to determine the fair value of the implied goodwill, we recorded a $1.1 billion goodwill impairment charge. for additional information, refer to note 2- "intangible assets and goodwill" to the consolidated financial statements contained in item 15 of this annual report.
gain on sale of intellectual property. in the first quarter of fiscal 2013, we recorded a net gain of $53.9 million related to the sale of our makena asset to k-v pharmaceutical company, or kv. on august 4, 2012, kv and certain of its subsidiaries filed voluntary petitions for reorganization under chapter 11 of title 11 of the united states code in the united states bankruptcy court for the southern district of new york. at that time, kv still owed us $95.0 million. in december 2012, we executed a settlement agreement with kv and released kv from all claims in consideration of a $60.0 million payment. we recorded this payment, net of certain costs, in the first quarter of fiscal 2013. for additional information, please refer to note 7 contained in item 15 of this annual report.
restructuring and divestiture charges. in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012, in connection with our acquisition of gen-probe, we implemented a restructuring action to consolidate our diagnostics operations by decreasing headcount and closing our legacy molecular diagnostics operations in madison, wisconsin. we also finalized our decision to transfer production of our interventional breast products from our indianapolis facility to our costa rica facility. in fiscal 2013 and in the first quarter of fiscal 2014, we implemented cost containment measures that primarily resulted in headcount reductions. in the second, third and fourth quarters of fiscal 2014, we terminated certain personnel at our hitec imaging operation in germany, and as part of ongoing management changes and structural refinement, we terminated certain executives and employees on a worldwide basis. pursuant to u.s. generally accepted accounting principles, the related severance and benefit charges are being recognized either ratably over the respective required employee service periods or when benefits become probable for contractual and statutory benefits, and other charges are being recognized as incurred. in fiscal 2014 and 2013, we recorded aggregate charges of $51.7 million and $32.8 million, respectively, from these actions. the charges recorded in fiscal 2014 primarily related to severance and benefits and include a $3.1 million impairment charge to record certain buildings at our warstein, germany location to their estimated fair value. in addition, these charges include a loss on divestiture of $5.3 million related to the sale of our mri breast coils product line in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014. the charges in fiscal 2013 primarily related to severance and benefits. in addition, in fiscal 2013 we recorded a net gain of $0.6 million primarily related to the sale

interest expense consists primarily of the cash interest costs and the related amortization of the debt discount and deferred financing costs on our outstanding debt. the decrease in interest expense in fiscal 2014 compared to fiscal 2013 was primarily due to principal payments in fiscal 2013 and 2014, which included $325.0 million of voluntary pre-payments, of amounts borrowed under our credit agreement, lower weighted-average interest rates due to refinancing both the term loan a and term loan b facilities, and the redemption of $405.0 million in principal amount of our 2.00% convertible notes due 2037, or the 2007 notes, in december 2013. these decreases were partially offset by additional interest expense from the accretion of principal on our 2.00% convertible notes due 2043, or the 2013 notes, at 4.0% annually.

in the second quarter of fiscal 2014, we refinanced the term loan b facility of our credit agreement and voluntarily prepaid $25.0 million of principal. in connection with this transaction, we recorded a debt extinguishment loss of $4.5 million for the write off of the pro-rata share of the debt discount and deferred issuance costs. in the first quarter of fiscal 2014, we made a $100.0 million voluntary pre-payment on our term loan b facility. as a result, the pro-rata share of the debt discount and deferred issuance costs aggregating $2.9 million related to this prepayment was recorded as a debt extinguishment loss.
in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013, we refinanced the term loan b facility of the credit agreement and made a voluntary prepayment of $200.0 million of principal. in connection with this transaction, we recorded a debt extinguishment loss of $6.0 million for the write-off of the pro-rata share of the debt discount and deferred issuance costs. in the second quarter of fiscal 2013, we refinanced the term loan a facility of the credit agreement and certain existing creditors opted not to participate in such refinancing. in connection with this transaction, we recorded a debt extinguishment loss of $3.2 million for the write-off of the pro-rata share of the debt discount and deferred issuance costs.

our effective tax rate for fiscal 2014 was 63.9% compared to a benefit of 1.7% on the pretax loss in fiscal 2013.  for fiscal 2014, the effective tax rate was higher than the statutory rate primarily due to unbenefited foreign losses partially offset by the domestic production activities deduction benefit.
for fiscal 2013, the effective tax rate was lower than the statutory rate primarily due to the non-deductible goodwill impairment charge, non-deductible contingent consideration expense related to the tct and interlace acquisitions and unbenefited foreign losses, partially offset by the domestic production activities deduction benefit and the release of a $19.9 million valuation allowance related to capital losses utilized to offset capital gains generated during the year.
segment results of operations we report our business as four segments: diagnostics, breast health, gyn surgical and skeletal health. the accounting policies of the segments are the same as those described in the footnotes to the accompanying consolidated financial statements contained in item 15 of this annual report. we measure segment performance based on total revenues and operating income or loss. revenues from product sales of each of these segments are described in further detail above. the discussion that follows is a summary analysis of total revenues and the primary changes in operating income or loss by segment.

operating income (loss) as a % of segment revenue   4.1                   %           (96.6             )%
diagnostics revenues decreased in fiscal 2014 compared to fiscal 2013 primarily due to the decrease in product revenues discussed above.
operating income for this business segment increased in fiscal 2014 compared to fiscal 2013, primarily due to the goodwill impairment charge of $1.1 billion recorded in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013 related to our molecular diagnostics reporting unit discussed above.
gross profit in absolute dollars increased primarily due to the inclusion in the prior fiscal year of fair value adjustments of $52.4 million for acquired gen-probe inventory that did not recur in the current year. in addition, we were able to record contingent revenue under our blood screening collaboration in the current fiscal year that had previously been recorded as unbilled accounts receivable in purchase accounting as described above. furthermore, we experienced favorable manufacturing variances across many of our products, lower royalty costs for thinprep, and lower instrumentation sales, partially offset by lower thinprep volumes and slightly lower pricing on thinprep and aptima sales. as a result, the gross margin improved to 46.8% in fiscal 2014 from 41.4% in fiscal 2013.
operating expenses, excluding the goodwill impairment charge noted above, decreased in fiscal 2014 compared to fiscal 2013 primarily due to a decrease of $80.0 million of contingent consideration charges related to tct, the divestiture of lifecodes, which contributed $9.4 million of operating expenses in fiscal 2013, and lower gen-probe integration costs, restructuring charges, and compensation from headcount reductions as part of our cost containment measures. these decreases were partially offset by the $5.1 million ipr&d charge, increases in spending on research and development for our virology products and market research, higher intangible asset amortization expense of $4.2 million due to changes in estimated useful lives, and an increase in the medical device excise tax of $2.8 million. as discussed above, the prior fiscal year included a $53.9 million gain related to the settlement with kv for the sale of our rights to makena.

operating income as a % of segment revenue   19.9                  %        23.9                  %
breast health revenues increased in the fiscal 2014 compared to fiscal 2013 primarily due to the $28.0 million increase in service revenues and $11.6 million increase in product revenues discussed above.
operating income for this business segment decreased in fiscal 2014 compared to fiscal 2013 primarily due to higher operating expenses partially offset by an increase in gross profit in absolute dollars. gross profit in absolute dollars increased primarily due to the increase in product and service revenues and the favorable product mix between 3d dimensions and our 2d systems partially offset by a $24.9 million increase in developed technology asset impairment charges related to our impairment assessment of the mri breast coils product line in the second quarter of fiscal 2014 discussed above and higher intangible asset amortization expense. as a result, overall gross margin declined slightly to 50.1% in fiscal 2014 compared to 50.2% in fiscal 2013.
operating expenses increased in fiscal 2014 compared to fiscal 2013 primarily due to higher restructuring and divestiture charges, which includes corporate allocated amounts and the loss on disposal of the mri breast coils product line of $5.3 million, higher research and development expenditures primarily for next generation breast biopsy devices, higher compensation and an increase in the medical device excise tax of $2.6 million and intangible asset and property impairment charges related to the mri breast coils product line aggregating $1.8 million.

operating income as a % of segment revenue   9.8                   %        6.4                   %
gyn surgical revenues remained relatively flat in fiscal 2014 compared to fiscal 2013 as discussed above.
operating income for this business segment increased in fiscal 2014 compared to fiscal 2013 primarily due to a decrease in operating expenses while gross profit in absolute dollars was relatively flat as revenues were consistent year over year. gross margin was 56.9% in both fiscal 2014 and 2013.
operating expenses decreased in fiscal 2014 primarily due to the $11.3 million of contingent consideration charges related to the interlace earn-out included in the prior year. additional reductions in operating expenses were primarily due to headcount reductions, lower research and development program expenditures and lower marketing related expenditures, all as a result of our cost containment measures, and lower intangible asset amortization expense. these decreases were offset by higher legal fees associated with our ongoing litigation, restructuring charges and an increase in the medical device excise tax.

skeletal health revenues increased in fiscal 2014 compared to fiscal 2013 primarily due to the increase in product revenues of $0.9 million discussed above and a slight increase in service and other revenue.
operating income increased in fiscal 2014 compared to the prior year primarily due to the increase in gross profit in absolute dollars as a result of higher sales of our higher margin horizon product and lower operating expenses. the decrease in operating expenses was primarily driven by a decrease in restructuring charges.

diagnostics product revenues increased 63.4% in fiscal 2013 compared to fiscal 2012 primarily due to the inclusion of gen-probe's product sales (acquired in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012), which contributed $483.1 million of additional revenue in fiscal 2013, partially offset by lower thinprep revenues of $28.5 million and fiscal 2013 had one less week than fiscal 2012, which was a 53-week fiscal period. the decline in thinprep revenue was primarily due to lower domestic volumes and, to a lesser extent, lower average selling prices internationally. we attributed the domestic volume decline to an increase in testing intervals as a result of recent screening recommendations from governmental agencies and professional organizations. we also experienced lower average selling prices in china, at least in part, due to restructuring the sales channel as we move toward using a combination of dealers and our direct sales force to gain broader market coverage compared to principally a direct sales strategy in fiscal 2012. however, international thinprep unit volumes were higher in fiscal 2013 as compared to fiscal 2012. we also experienced a decrease in our rapid fetal fibronectin test revenue compared to the prior year primarily due to lower domestic volumes. partially offsetting these decreases was an increase in revenues from our sale of cervista hpv products primarily in the united states, as we continued to gain new customer accounts and increase unit sales to existing customers. the inclusion of gen-probe's results was partially impacted by our blood screening collaboration. pursuant to the collaboration, a portion of gen-probe's revenue is contingent on donations testing revenue earned by novartis (currently our partner is grifols). as a result, amounts to be received for this contingent revenue related to inventory on hand and not yet utilized by novartis' customers as of the date of our acquisition of gen-probe were recorded as unbilled accounts receivable on the balance sheet in purchase accounting and were not recorded as revenue in our results of operations. in fiscal 2013 and fiscal 2012 this contingent revenue of $23.5 million and $11.6 million, respectively, was not recognized in our results of operations.
breast health product revenues increased 0.7% in fiscal 2013 compared to fiscal 2012. our digital mammography systems revenue increased $23.0 million in fiscal 2013 compared to fiscal 2012 primarily due to the increase in our 3d dimensions systems revenue of $52.5 million in fiscal 2013 compared to fiscal 2012 as we sold more 3d dimensions units with higher average selling prices in the united states, partially offset by slightly lower average selling prices internationally. partially offsetting the increase in 3d dimensions sales in fiscal 2013, we had lower unit sales and, to a lesser extent, lower average selling prices of our 2d dimensions systems and selenia systems on a worldwide basis. we also experienced a decline in sales of related components and workstation products of $7.0 million in fiscal 2013 compared to the prior year primarily because customers that upgrade to 3d dimensions do not always require new versions of these related products. our breast biopsy products revenue increased $7.8 million in fiscal 2013 compared to fiscal 2012 primarily due to an increase in the number of eviva biopsy devices sold in the united states and, to a lesser extent, internationally, and an increase in the number of celero devices sold in the united states. partially offsetting these increases was a decline in the unit sales and average selling price of our atec devices, which we attribute to the introduction and increased sales of our eviva biopsy devices. additionally, in fiscal 2013, we experienced an $8.0 million decline in revenue from our organic photoconductor materials business as this non-core product line continues to experience pricing pressures in a competitive market space. we decided to phase out this product line in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013.
gyn surgical product revenues decreased 1.9% in fiscal 2013 compared to fiscal 2012 primarily due to the decline in sales of novasure devices of $24.0 million and an $11.3 million decrease due to the discontinuance of adiana system sales. in addition, fiscal 2013 had one less week than fiscal 2012. these decreases were partially offset by an increase in myosure system sales, including our new aquilex fluid management system used with our myosure devices, of $29.5 million. we experienced a decrease in the number of novasure devices sold in the united states, which we primarily attributed to the continuing effect of unemployment and economic uncertainty and the trend toward higher insurance co-payments and deductibles, resulting in cost-conscious patients delaying surgery or opting for lower cost and generally less effective alternatives. partially offsetting this decrease, we sold more units internationally in fiscal 2013 compared to the prior year. the discontinuance of adiana system sales was due to our decision to cease manufacturing, marketing and selling the product as of
53
the end of the second quarter of fiscal 2012, determining it was not financially viable and would not become so in the foreseeable future. the increase in myosure system revenue in fiscal 2013 was substantially due to an increase in units sold domestically offset slightly by lower average selling prices due to the introduction of new variations of the primary myosure device compared to fiscal 2012.
skeletal health product revenues decreased 5.3% in fiscal 2013 compared to fiscal 2012 primarily due to a decline of $5.2 million in our osteoporosis assessment system sales worldwide and lower average selling prices internationally, partially offset by an increase in mini c-arm sales of $1.6 million, primarily due to the introduction of our new insight fd product.
in fiscal 2013, 73.9% of product sales were generated in the united states, 13.6% in europe, 8.9% in asia-pacific, and 3.6% in other international markets. in fiscal 2012, 72.8% of product sales were generated in the united states, 11.9% in europe, 9.3% in asia-pacific, and 6.0% in other international markets.
the increase in product revenues in the united states as a percent of consolidated product revenues in fiscal 2013 compared to fiscal 2012 was primarily due to the inclusion of gen-probe and to a lesser extent higher sales of our 3d dimensions systems. the increase in european product revenues as a percent of consolidated product revenues in fiscal 2013 compared to fiscal 2012 was primarily due to the inclusion of gen-probe product sales in europe and, to a lesser extent, a higher percentage of selenia system unit sales to total sales in that region.

service and other revenues increased 13.5% in fiscal 2013 compared to fiscal 2012 primarily in our breast health business due to an increase in the number of service contracts driven by an increase in the installed base of our digital mammography systems. in addition, the inclusion of gen-probe contributed an additional $24.4 million, primarily comprised of other revenue, in fiscal 2013 compared to fiscal 2012. partially offsetting these increases was one less week in fiscal 2013 compared to fiscal 2012.

** percentage not meaningful product gross margin decreased to 46.3% in fiscal 2013 compared to 50.6% in fiscal 2012 primarily due to higher intangible asset amortization expense and charges for additional costs related to the sale of acquired inventory written up to fair value in purchase accounting.
cost of product revenues. the cost of product revenues as a percentage of product revenues was 38.9% in fiscal 2013 compared to 37.2% in fiscal 2012. cost of product revenues as a percentage of product revenues in the current fiscal year increased moderately in diagnostics and slightly in breast health and decreased in gyn surgical and to a lesser extent in skeletal health compared to the prior year, resulting in an overall increased rate in fiscal 2013 compared to fiscal 2012.
54
diagnostics' gross margin declined in fiscal 2013 compared to fiscal 2012 due to the inclusion of gen-probe, which included $52.4 million of additional costs related to the sale of acquired inventory written up to fair value in purchase accounting in fiscal 2013 compared to $19.9 million of such costs in fiscal 2012. we also recorded impairment charges of $6.3 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013 to write down certain instruments and related inventory due to our plan to transition certain customers to our panther instrumentation from our hta instrument. in addition, gen-probe's gross margin since acquisition has been lower than its historical gross margin rate primarily due to the purchase accounting effect on our collaboration agreement with grifols in our blood screening business. based on the grifols collaboration terms, a portion of gen-probe's revenue is contingent on donations testing revenue earned by grifols, however, gen-probe recognizes the full product cost upon shipment. as a result, amounts to be received for this contingent revenue related to inventory on hand and not yet utilized by grifols' customers as of the acquisition date were recorded as unbilled accounts receivable on the balance sheet in purchase accounting and were not recorded as revenue in our results of operations. this contingent revenue not recognized in our results of operations was $23.5 million and $11.6 million in fiscal 2013 and fiscal 2012, respectively. also contributing to the decline in the diagnostics gross margin rate was a decline in domestic thinprep sales and lower average selling prices in china and other international markets, unfavorable manufacturing and overhead variances, higher service costs, depreciation of equipment at customer sites, and distribution costs.
breast health experienced a slight decrease in gross margin in fiscal 2013 compared to fiscal 2012 primarily due to the lower gross margin rate in our breast biopsy business from higher sales of our eviva disposable, which carries lower gross margins due to higher manufacturing costs and royalty costs compared to our atec disposable, and lower average selling prices of our atec disposables domestically. we also experienced unfavorable absorption and higher production spend for this line of business primarily due to the transfer of our manufacturing lines from indianapolis to costa rica, resulting in production of some of our breast biopsy products at two facilities. partially offsetting these decreases was an increase in unit sales and average selling prices of our 3d dimensions systems in the united states coupled with a decrease in our 2d digital systems sales as a percentage of total unit sales in fiscal 2013 compared to fiscal 2012. this 2d digital systems decrease was primarily related to our selenia system and, to a lesser extent, our 2d dimensions systems. selenia systems have lower average selling prices and gross margins than our dimensions systems.
gyn surgical gross margin increased in fiscal 2013 compared to fiscal 2012 due to favorable manufacturing absorption and the discontinuance of the adiana system in fiscal 2012, offset by the impact of lower novasure system sales. the adiana system had a much lower gross margin rate compared to the novasure and myosure systems. during the second quarter of fiscal 2012, we determined the adiana product was not financially viable and would not become so in the foreseeable future. as a result, we ceased manufacturing, marketing and selling our adiana system and recorded a charge of $19.1 million in fiscal 2012 for the write-off of inventory, manufacturing equipment and equipment at customer sites, and contractual purchase orders for which there was no expected future use of the materials and components. in addition, the improved gross margin in fiscal 2013 is partially due to the increase in myosure system sales and the transfer of its production to costa rica, which has resulted in overall lower production costs.
skeletal health had a slightly higher gross margin in fiscal 2013 compared to fiscal 2012 primarily due to favorable product mix.
amortization of intangible assets. the increase in amortization expense in fiscal 2013 compared to fiscal 2012 is primarily due to the inclusion of gen-probe, which accounted for $112.6 million of additional expense, partially offset by fiscal 2013 having one less week compared to fiscal 2012.
impairment of intangible assets. during the third quarter of fiscal 2013, we determined that a developed technology asset was impaired, primarily due to our decision to cease selling and providing support for such product. as a result, we recorded a charge of $1.7 million to record the asset at its fair value.

service and other revenues gross margin was 48.1% in fiscal 2013 compared to 45.1% in fiscal 2012. within our breast health segment, the continued conversion of a high percentage of our domestic installed base of digital mammography systems to service contracts upon expiration of the warranty period without a corresponding increase in costs to service such contracts has resulted in higher gross margins, partially offset by increased warranty, higher spare parts and additional headcount costs.

** percentage not meaningful research and development expenses. research and development expenses increased 50.8% in fiscal 2013 compared to fiscal 2012 primarily due to $76.0 million of additional expense from the inclusion of gen-probe. partially offsetting this increase was a decline in compensation and benefits from lower headcount and bonus expense in the legacy hologic businesses. in addition, expenses were lower in fiscal 2013 due to a decrease in prototype materials and consulting expense based on the status and timing of various projects and the discontinuance of adiana development projects in fiscal 2012.
selling and marketing expenses. selling and marketing expenses increased 6.1% in fiscal 2013 compared to fiscal 2012 primarily due to $39.0 million of additional expense from the inclusion of gen-probe, higher compensation for additional sales personnel worldwide, and integration costs related to the gen-probe acquisition. in fiscal 2013, we also had higher marketing spend for our initiatives related to our 3d dimensions tomosynthesis products and myosure system, and higher training and travel expenses for our increased sales personnel headcount. partially offsetting these increases in fiscal 2013 was the absence of expenditures for our novasure direct-to-consumer advertising campaign, which was completed in fiscal 2012, the discontinuance of the adiana system in fiscal 2012, decreased expenditures for international trade shows, meetings and medical education and a reduction of headcount in the second half of fiscal 2013. in addition, there was one less week in fiscal 2013 compared to fiscal 2012.
56
general and administrative expenses. general and administrative expenses increased 3.3% in fiscal 2013 compared to fiscal 2012 primarily due to $41.4 million of additional expense from the inclusion of gen-probe, integration costs related to the gen-probe acquisition, the medical device excise tax of $15.7 million, higher compensation and benefits, and an increase in information technology service contracts from an increase of licenses, partially offset by lower acquisition transaction costs to third-parties and lower consulting costs as well as a reduction in headcount in the second half of fiscal 2013. in fiscal 2013, these increases were partially offset by legal settlement benefits of $8.9 million, lower international bad debt expense, and lower charges for sales and other non-income tax audits as compared to fiscal 2012. in addition, there was one less week in fiscal 2013 compared to fiscal 2012.
amortization of intangible assets. the increase in amortization expense in fiscal 2013 compared to fiscal 2012 was primarily due to the inclusion of gen-probe, which accounted for $45.0 million of additional expense, partially offset by one less week in fiscal 2013 compared to fiscal 2012.
contingent consideration-compensation expense. the amounts recorded in fiscal 2013 relate solely to tct, and in fiscal 2012, primarily relate to tct. the measurement period for the tct earn-out was completed in fiscal 2013.
contingent consideration-fair value adjustments. in connection with our acquisitions of sentinelle medical and interlace, we were required to pay future consideration that was contingent on achieving certain revenue based milestones. the sentinelle medical final measurement period ended in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012, and as a result the charges recorded in fiscal 2013 relate solely to interlace. we recorded a charge of $11.3 million in fiscal 2013 reflecting an increase in the fair value of the liability due to higher revenues for interlace than estimated. in fiscal 2012, we recorded a charge of $38.5 million related to an increase in estimated interlace revenues resulting in a charge of $41.8 million offset by a benefit of the sentinelle medical liability of $3.3 million due to a reduction in estimated revenues. the measurement period for the interlace earn-out was completed in fiscal 2013.
impairment of goodwill. during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013, as a result of our company-wide annual budgeting and forecasting process and a full re-evaluation of our existing product development efforts and cost structure, we reduced our short term and long term revenue forecasts and determined that indicators of impairment existed in our molecular diagnostics reporting unit. the molecular diagnostics reporting unit is primarily comprised of our aptima business acquired in the gen-probe acquisition and the molecular diagnostics business acquired in the third wave acquisition. the updated forecast, which reflected pricing pressures, for revenue and profitability were lower than those expected at the time of the gen-probe acquisition. as such, the fair value of this reporting unit declined. as a result of performing step 2 of the goodwill impairment test, which requires the completion of a hypothetical purchase price allocation to determine the fair value of the implied goodwill, we recorded a $1.1 billion goodwill impairment charge.
during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012, we recorded an impairment charge of $5.8 million related to our mammosite reporting unit, which is included in our breast health segment. the fair value of this reporting unit declined from fiscal 2011 primarily due to our reassessment in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012 of the overall market size of breast brachytherapy and long-term growth projections. for additional information, refer to note 2- "intangible assets and goodwill" to the consolidated financial statements contained in item 15 of this annual report.
gain on sale of intellectual property. in the first quarter of fiscal 2013, we recorded a net gain of $53.9 million related to the sale of our makena assets to kv. on august 4, 2012, kv and certain of its subsidiaries filed voluntary petitions for reorganization under chapter 11 of title 11 of the united states code in the united states bankruptcy court for the southern district of new york. in december 2012, we and kv executed a settlement agreement, which became effective on december 28, 2012. under the settlement agreement, we released kv from all claims in consideration of a $60.0 million payment. we recorded this amount net of certain costs, including contingent fees and amounts due to the inventor. we will receive no more payments from kv. during the second quarter of fiscal 2012, we received a scheduled payment of $12.5 million from kv, which was recorded net of amounts owed to the original inventor of makena. for additional information, please refer to note 7 contained in item 15 of this annual report.
acquired in-process research and development. during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012, we acquired certain research and development assets that were determined to have no future alternative use and recorded a $4.5 million charge within our gyn surgical segment.
restructuring and divestiture charges. in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012, in connection with our acquisition of gen-probe, we implemented a restructuring action to consolidate our diagnostics operations by decreasing headcount and transferring our legacy molecular diagnostics operations in madison, wisconsin to san diego, california. we also finalized our decision to transfer production of our interventional breast products from our indianapolis facility to our costa rica facility. in addition, we transfered our selenium panel coating production line from germany to newark, delaware. in the third and fourth quarters of fiscal 2013, we implemented additional restructuring actions to reduce expenses which included terminating
57
employees. pursuant to u.s. generally accepted accounting principles, the majority of severance and benefit charges were being recognized ratably over the respective required employee service periods, and in certain circumstances we were recording charges pursuant to contractual or statutory requirements. other charges, such as facility closure costs are being recognized as incurred. in fiscal 2013 and 2012, we recorded restructuring charges of $32.8 million and $17.5 million, respectively, which were primarily comprised of severance and related benefits, including stock compensation for acceleration of equity awards. for additional information, please refer to note 4 contained in item 15 of this annual report.

the increase in interest expense in fiscal 2013 compared to fiscal 2012 was primarily due to debt borrowed under the credit agreement and sale of senior notes in connection with our gen-probe acquisition in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012. in fiscal 2013, we incurred additional expenses of $4.1 million related to our retirement of $370.0 million in aggregate principal of our 2007 notes for $370.0 million in aggregate principal of 2013 notes. this exchange enabled us to extend the first put date to december 15, 2017 as well as the subsequent put dates with the conversion price of the notes remaining at approximately $38.59. in addition, in fiscal 2013, we incurred additional expenses of $3.5 million related to our refinancing of the term loan a and term loan b facilities under the credit agreement, which lowered the interest rates on these facilities by 100 basis points and 75 basis points, respectively. the majority of the refinancings was accounted for as a modification for accounting purposes and the pro-rata amount of issuance costs were expensed and not capitalized. partially offsetting this increase was lower amortization of our convertible notes' debt discount.

in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013, we refinanced the term loan b facility of the credit agreement and made a voluntary prepayment of $200.0 million of principal. in connection with this transaction, we recorded a debt extinguishment loss of $6.0 million for the write-off of the pro-rata share of the debt discount and deferred issuance costs. in the second quarter of fiscal 2013, we refinanced the term loan a facility of the credit agreement and certain existing creditors opted not to participate in such refinancing. in connection with this transaction, we recorded a debt extinguishment loss of $3.2 million for the write-off of the pro-rata share of the debt discount and deferred issuance costs.
in the second quarter of fiscal 2012, we retired $500.0 million in aggregate principal of our 2007 notes for $500.0 million in aggregate principal of new 2.00% convertible notes due 2042, or the 2012 notes. this exchange enabled us to extend the first put date to march 1, 2018 as well as the subsequent put dates. in consideration, the equity conversion price of the notes was reduced to approximately $31.18 from $38.59, and the cash coupon payment period was extended four and a quarter more years, consistent with extending the first put date, instead of accreting the coupon to the principal as required under the original terms. in connection with this transaction, we recorded a debt extinguishment loss of $42.3 million, which includes the write-off of the pro-rata allocation of deferred financing costs.

our effective tax rate for fiscal 2013 was a benefit of 1.7% on the pretax loss compared to 19.4% of the pretax loss in fiscal 2012. for fiscal 2013, the effective tax rate was lower than the statutory rate primarily due to the non-deductible goodwill impairment charge, non-deductible contingent consideration expense related to the tct and interlace acquisitions and unbenefited foreign losses, partially offset by the domestic production activities deduction benefit and the release of a $19.9 million valuation allowance related to capital losses utilized to offset capital gains generated during the year.
our effective tax rate in fiscal 2012 was significantly impacted by non-deductible contingent consideration compensation expense related to the tct, interlace and sentinelle medical acquisitions, nondeductible acquisition costs, a nondeductible goodwill impairment charge, and a net increase in income tax reserves and valuation allowances on certain foreign losses. the unfavorable tax impact of these items was partially offset by the domestic production activities deduction benefit and a loss claimed related to the discontinuance of the adiana product line.

** percentage not meaningful diagnostics revenues increased in fiscal 2013 compared to fiscal 2012 primarily due to the increase in product revenues discussed above, which is principally attributable to the inclusion of gen-probe for a full year.
operating loss for this business segment increased in fiscal 2013 compared to fiscal 2012, primarily due to the goodwill impairment charge of $1.1 billion recorded in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013 related to our molecular diagnostics reporting unit discussed above.
while gross profit in absolute dollars increased in fiscal 2013 due primarily to the inclusion of gen-probe as discussed above, higher operating expenses, excluding the impact of the goodwill impairment charge, more than offset the gross margin impact. gross margin decreased to 41.4% in fiscal 2013 compared to 50.5% in fiscal 2012, which was primarily attributable to the inclusion of gen-probe for the full year and incremental charges related to developed technology intangible asset amortization expense of $112.6 million and inventory written up to fair value in purchase accounting of $32.5 million. in addition, we recorded impairment charges of $6.3 million in the fourth quarter to write down certain instruments and related
59
inventory due to our plan to transition certain customers to our panther instrumentation from our hta instrumentation. gross margin was also impacted by lower thinprep volumes in the u.s. and lower average selling prices in china and other international markets, unfavorable manufacturing and overhead variances, higher service costs, depreciation of equipment at customer sites, and distribution costs.
operating expenses, excluding the goodwill impairment charge noted above, increased in fiscal 2013 compared to fiscal 2012 primarily due to the inclusion of gen-probe, which contributed an incremental $197.9 million of expenses comprised of research and development, sales and marketing, general and administrative and amortization expense. in addition, this segment incurred incremental charges and expenses for restructuring of $4.0 million, tct contingent consideration expense of $4.6 million, medical device excise taxes of $6.8 million and integration and retention costs. partially offsetting these increases were reductions in headcount, bonus expense, international trade shows and marketing initiatives and project spend in the legacy hologic businesses. in addition, in fiscal 2013, we recorded a net gain of $53.9 million related to the settlement with kv for the sale of our rights to makena discussed above, and in the prior year second quarter, we recorded a net gain of $12.4 million related to the makena sale.

breast health revenues increased in fiscal 2013 compared to fiscal 2012 primarily due to the $25.5 million increase in service revenue and the $3.8 million in product revenues discussed above.
operating income for this business segment increased in fiscal 2013 compared to fiscal 2012 primarily due to an increase in gross profit dollars from higher revenues discussed above and lower operating expenses.
in fiscal 2013, overall gross margin increased to 50.2% compared to 49.4% in the prior year. product gross margin decreased slightly to 49.3% in fiscal 2013 compared to 49.9% in fiscal 2012 as discussed above. operating expenses decreased in fiscal 2013 compared to fiscal 2012 primarily due to a gain on the settlement of class-action litigation of $5.7 million, lower clinical trials spend, lower compensation from headcount reductions, and lower corporate allocations due to the gen-probe acquisition. partially offsetting these decreases were incremental restructuring charges of $7.1 million, and the medical device excise tax of $5.3 million.

gyn surgical revenues decreased in fiscal 2013 compared to fiscal 2012 due to the decrease in product revenues discussed above.
operating income for this business segment increased in fiscal 2013 compared to fiscal 2012. in fiscal 2013, gross profit in absolute dollars increased compared to fiscal 2012 primarily because fiscal 2012 included $19.1 million of charges recorded in cost of product sales related to the discontinuance of the adiana system discussed above. gross margin improved to 56.9% in fiscal 2013 from 50.3% in fiscal 2012. gross margin also improved primarily due to higher sales of our myosure system, which was partially offset by a reduction in novasure system sales and higher intangible asset amortization expense of $2.9 million.
operating expenses decreased in fiscal 2013 primarily due a reduction in interlace contingent consideration charges of $30.5 million, a reduction in advertising expenditures for our novasure system's direct-to-consumer advertising campaign which ended in fiscal 2012, lower legal expenses primarily relating to a lawsuit settlement in fiscal 2012, lower marketing,

medical education and research and development expenses due to the discontinuance of the adiana product line, and lower compensation due to headcount reductions. in addition, in fiscal 2012, we recorded charges for an ongoing sales tax audit. partially offsetting these decreases were higher spend on developing the next generation novasure device, marketing initiatives for the myosure system and the medical device excise tax of $2.7 million.

skeletal health revenues decreased in fiscal 2013 compared to fiscal 2012 primarily due to the decrease in product revenues of $3.5 million discussed above and reduction in service revenues of $2.0 million. operating income decreased in fiscal 2013 compared to the prior year primarily due to lower revenues and higher operating expenses. higher operating expenses were primarily driven by restructuring charges of $3.8 million and the medical device excise tax of $0.9 million.
liquidity and capital resources at september 27, 2014, we had $946.2 million of working capital, and our cash and cash equivalents totaled $736.1 million. our cash and cash equivalents balance decreased by $86.4 million during fiscal 2014 principally due to principal payments on our outstanding debt and capital expenditures partially offset by cash generated from operations and net proceeds from stock option exercises.
in fiscal 2014, our operating activities provided us with $508.4 million of cash, which included net income of $17.3 million, non-cash charges for depreciation and amortization aggregating $523.2 million, non-cash interest expense of $68.7 million related to our outstanding debt, stock-based compensation expense of $50.0 million, asset impairment charges of $38.4 million, and debt extinguishment losses of $7.4 million. these adjustments to net income were partially offset by a decrease in net deferred tax liabilities of $243.1 million, primarily from the amortization of intangible assets. cash provided by operations included a net cash inflow of $44.5 million from changes in our operating assets and liabilities. changes in our operating assets and liabilities were driven primarily by a decrease in prepaid income taxes of $22.4 million due to the timing of payments versus their utilization for our tax liability, a decrease in prepaid expenses and other assets of $17.3 million, an increase in deferred revenue of $15.1 million primarily due to an increase in our installed base of digital mammography systems, an increase in accrued expenses and other liabilities of $14.7 million primarily due to a net increase in bonus and benefits accruals, and restructuring and professional fees, partially offset by contingent consideration payments and lower accrued interest on our debt based on the timing of payments. these cash flow increases were partially offset by an increase in inventories of $44.7 million for expected demand and to build up our safety stock of instruments and assays primarily in our diagnostics business.
in fiscal 2014, our investing activities utilized $67.0 million of cash primarily for capital expenditures of $80.2 million, which consisted primarily of the placement of equipment under customer usage agreements and purchases of manufacturing equipment and computer hardware, partially offset by proceeds of $10.1 million received from the divestiture of product lines, and net sales of mutual funds and insurance contracts of $6.5 million to pay participant withdrawals from our deferred compensation plan due to employee terminations.
in fiscal 2014, our financing activities used cash of $525.1 million, primarily due to $595.0 million in debt principal payments comprised of $405.0 million to pay off our 2007 notes and $190.0 million under our credit agreement, and $9.8 million to pay employee-related taxes withheld for the net share settlement of vested restricted stock units. partially offsetting these uses of cash were proceeds of $81.4 million from our equity plans, primarily from the exercise of stock options.
debt we had total recorded debt outstanding of $4.3 billion at september 27, 2014, which is comprised of amounts outstanding under our amended credit agreement of $2.03 billion (principal $2.05 billion), senior notes of $1.0 billion and convertible notes of $1.24 billion (principal $1.32 billion). no amounts were outstanding under our revolving facility.
61
credit agreement the facilities under the amended credit agreement initially consisted of:
•   $1.0 billion senior secured tranche a term loan, or term loan a, with a final maturity date of august 1, 2017;
•   $1.5 billion senior secured tranche b term loan, or term loan b, with a final maturity date of august 1, 2019; and
•   $300.0 million secured revolving credit facility, or revolving facility, with a final maturity date of august 1, 2017.
as of september 27, 2014, the interest rates under our term loan a facility and term loan b facility were 2.15% and 3.25%, respectively, and the principal amounts outstanding were $900.0 million and $1.15 billion, respectively.
the credit facilities are secured by first-priority liens on, and a first-priority security interest in, substantially all of our assets and the assets of the guarantors, including all of the capital stock of substantially all of the u.s. subsidiaries owned by us and the guarantors, 65% of the capital stock of certain of our first-tier foreign subsidiaries and all intercompany debt.
we are required to make scheduled principal payments under the term loan a facility in an increasing amount, which is currently $25.0 million per three month period and increase to $50.0 million per three month period commencing october 31, 2015, and under the term loan b facility in equal installments of $3.75 million per three month period beginning on october 31, 2012 and for 27 three month periods thereafter. the remaining balance of $400 million for term loan a and $1.07 billion for term loan b is due at maturity. any amounts outstanding under the revolving facility are due at maturity. we are required to make principal repayments first, pro rata among the term loan facilities, and second to the revolving facility from specified excess cash flows from operations and from the net proceeds of specified types of asset sales, debt issuances, insurance recoveries and equity offerings. subject to certain limitations, we may voluntarily pre-pay any of the credit facilities without premium or penalty.
the amended credit agreement contains affirmative and negative covenants customarily applicable to senior secured credit facilities, including covenants restricting our ability and the ability of the guarantors, subject to negotiated exceptions, to incur additional indebtedness and additional liens on their assets, engage in mergers or acquisitions or dispose of assets, enter into sale-leaseback transactions, pay dividends, repurchase or redeem capital stock or make other distributions, voluntarily prepay other indebtedness, enter into transactions with affiliated persons, make investments, and change the nature of their businesses.
the amended credit agreement contains two financial ratio covenants measured as of the last day of each fiscal quarter: a total net leverage ratio and an interest coverage ratio. the total net leverage ratio covenant is currently 6.00:1.00, which then decreases over time to 4.00:1.00 for the fiscal quarter ending september 30, 2017 and each fiscal quarter thereafter. the interest coverage ratio is currently 3.25:1.00, which increases over time to 3.75:1.00 for the fiscal quarter ending september 30, 2017 and each quarter thereafter. the total net leverage ratio covenant is defined as the ratio of our consolidated net debt as of the quarter end to our consolidated adjusted ebitda for the four-fiscal quarter period ending on the measurement date. the interest coverage ratio is defined as the ratio of our consolidated adjusted ebitda for the prior four-fiscal quarter period ending on the measurement date to adjusted consolidated cash interest expense for the same measurement period. these terms, and the calculation thereof, are defined in further detail in the amended credit agreement. as of september 27, 2014, we were in compliance with these covenants.
senior notes on august 1, 2012, we completed a private placement of $1.0 billion aggregate principal amount of our senior notes at an offering price of 100% of the aggregate principal amount of the senior notes. the senior notes are our general senior unsecured obligations and are guaranteed on a senior unsecured basis by the guarantors. the senior notes mature on august 1, 2020 and bear interest at the rate of 6.25% per year, payable semi-annually on february 1 and august 1 of each year, commencing on february 1, 2013.
the indenture for our senior notes contains customarily applicable affirmative and negative covenants, including covenants restricting our ability and the ability of certain of our subsidiaries', subject to negotiated exceptions and qualifications, to: incur additional indebtedness; pay dividends or repurchase or redeem capital stock or make other distributions; make certain investments; incur liens; enter into certain types of transactions with our affiliates; and sell assets or consolidate or merge with or into other companies. we are not required to maintain any financial covenants with respect to the senior notes.
62
we may redeem up to 35% of the aggregate principal amount of the senior notes with the net cash proceeds of certain equity offerings at any time and from time to time before august 1, 2015, at a redemption price equal to 106.250% of the aggregate principal amount so redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the redemption date. we also have the option to redeem the senior notes on or after: august 1, 2015 through july 31, 2016 at 103.125% of par; august 1, 2016 through july 31, 2017 at 102.083% of par; august 1, 2017 through july 31, 2018 at 101.042% of par; and august 1, 2018 and thereafter at 100% of par. in addition, if we undergo a change of control, as provided in the indenture, we will be required to make an offer to purchase each holder's senior notes at a price equal to 101% of the aggregate principal amount of the senior notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the repurchase date.
convertible notes at september 27, 2014, our convertible notes, in the aggregate principal amount of $1.32 billion, are recorded at $1.24 billion, which is net of the unamortized debt discount attributed to the embedded conversion feature of the convertible notes. these notes consist of:
•   $450 million of our 2.00% convertible exchange senior notes due 2037 issued in november 2010 (2010 notes);
•   $500 million of our 2.00% convertible senior notes due 2042 issued in march 2012 (2012 notes); and
•   $370 million of our 2.00% convertible senior notes due 2043 issued in february 2013 (2013 notes).
the 2010 notes, 2012 notes and 2013 notes are collectively referred to herein as the convertible notes. interest on the 2013 notes is currently being accreted to principal, from their date of issuance, at a rate of 4.00% per year until and including december 15, 2017, and 2.00% per year thereafter. all other notes bear interest at a rate of 2.00% per year on the original principal amount, payable semi-annually in arrears until their first put date and thereafter accrete principal at the rate of 2.00% per year. in addition, under certain circumstances contingent interest may be payable under the convertible notes after each of their first put date.
holders may require us to repurchase the 2010 notes on each of december 15, 2016, 2020, 2025, on december 13, 2030 and on december 14, 2035, or upon a fundamental change, as provided in the indenture for the 2010 notes, at a repurchase price equal to 100% of their accreted principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest.
holders may require us to repurchase the 2012 notes on each of march 1, 2018, 2022, 2027 and 2032, and on march 2, 2037, or upon a fundamental change, as provided in the indenture for the 2012 notes, at a repurchase price equal to 100% of their accreted principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest.
holders may require us to repurchase the 2013 notes on each of december 15, 2017, 2022, 2027, 2032 and 2037, or upon a fundamental change, as provided in the indenture for the 2013 notes, at a repurchase price equal to 100% of their accreted principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest.
we may redeem any of the 2010 notes, 2012 notes and 2013 notes beginning december 19, 2016, march 6, 2018, and december 15, 2017, respectively. we may redeem all or a portion of the 2010 notes, 2012 notes and 2013 notes (i.e., in cash or a combination of cash and shares of our common stock) at a redemption price equal to 100% of their principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the applicable redemption date.
we have recorded deferred tax liabilities related to the convertible notes original issuance discount, representing the spread between the cash coupon rate and the higher interest rate deductible for tax purposes. when our convertible notes are extinguished, we are required to recapture the original issuance discount previously deducted for tax purposes.
stock repurchase program on november 11, 2013, we announced that our board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to $250 million of our outstanding common stock over the next three years. under the stock repurchase program, we are authorized to repurchase, from time-to-time, shares of our outstanding common stock on the open market or in privately negotiated transactions in the united states. the timing and amount of stock repurchases will be determined based upon our evaluation of market conditions and other factors. the stock repurchase program may be suspended, modified or discontinued at any time, and we have no obligation to repurchase any amount of our common stock under the program. through september 27, 2014 we had not repurchased any shares of our common stock under this program.

(1)   included within long-term debt obligations, we have three issuances (2010 notes, 2012 notes and 2013 notes) of convertible notes which can first be put to us on december 15, 2016 ($450 million principal), march 1, 2018 ($500 million principal), and december 15, 2017 ($370 million principal) and we have assumed for purpose of the above table that the principal amounts for each issuance will be paid off when they first can be put to us, which is in fiscal 2017 and fiscal 2018. the 2013 notes also have principal accretion of 4% annually, which is included in the principal amount in the 3-5 years column above. the amounts in the table do not include deferred tax liabilities for the recapture of the original issuance discount.
(2)   the financing leases represent two leases for an office building and a manufacturing facility, which were required to be recorded on our balance sheet under u.s. gaap. see note 12 to our consolidated financial statements contained in item 15 of this annual report.
(3)   purchase obligations primarily represent minimum purchase commitments for inventory and instruments and, to a lesser extent, other operating expense commitments.
(4)   represents minimum royalties due on net sales of products incorporating licensed technology and subject to a minimum annual royalty payment, and payments under collaborative agreements. in addition to the minimum payments due under our collaborative agreements included above, we may be required to pay up to $4.4 million in milestone payments, plus royalties on net sales of any products using specified technology
(5)   pension obligations do not include our obligation under our deferred compensation plans of $35.8 million, which is recorded as a current liability. deferred compensation plan benefits are generally paid out at retirement or termination of employment.
the above table does not reflect our long-term liabilities associated with uncertain tax positions recorded under fin 48 (codified primarily in asc 740, income taxes) totaling $131.4 million. due to the complexity associated with tax uncertainties, we cannot reasonably make a reliable estimate of the period in which we expect to settle these non-current liabilities. see note 8 to our consolidated financial statements contained in item 15 of this annual report for more information on our unrecognized tax benefits. in addition, certain of our cost method equity investments give us the option to acquire the company in the future. since it is not possible to estimate when, or even if, we will exercise our option to acquire these companies, we have not included these future potential payments in the table above.
future liquidity considerations we expect to continue to review and evaluate potential strategic transactions and alliances that we believe will complement our current or future business. subject to the risk factors set forth in part i, item 1a of this annual report and the general disclaimers set forth in our special note regarding forward-looking statements at the outset of this annual report, we believe that cash flow from operations and the cash available under our revolving facility will provide us with sufficient funds in order to fund our expected normal operations, and debt payments, including interest over the next twelve months. our longer-term liquidity is contingent upon future operating performance. we may also require additional capital in the future to fund capital expenditures, repayment of debt, acquisitions or other investments, or to repay our convertible notes and related deferred tax liabilities. as described above, we have significant indebtedness outstanding under our credit agreement, senior notes and convertible notes. these capital requirements could be substantial. our operating performance may also be affected
64
by matters discussed under the above-referenced risk factors set forth elsewhere in this report. these risks, trends and uncertainties may also adversely affect our long-term liquidity.
legal contingencies we are currently involved in certain legal proceedings and claims. in connection with these legal proceedings and claims, management periodically reviews estimates of potential costs to be incurred by us in connection with the adjudication or settlement, if any, of these proceedings. these estimates are based on an analysis of potential litigation outcomes and settlement strategies. in accordance with asc 450, contingencies, loss contingencies are accrued if, in the opinion of management, an adverse outcome is probable and such outcome can be reasonably estimated. it is possible that future results for any particular quarter or annual period may be materially affected by changes in our assumptions or the effectiveness of our strategies relating to these proceedings.
critical accounting policies and estimates the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with u.s. generally accepted accounting principles. the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. on an on-going basis, we evaluate our estimates, including those related to revenue recognition for multiple element arrangements, allowance for doubtful accounts, reserves for excess and obsolete inventories, valuations, purchase price allocations and contingent consideration related to business combinations, expected future cash flows including growth rates, discount rates, terminal values and other assumptions used to evaluate the recoverability of long-lived assets and goodwill, estimated fair values of intangible assets and goodwill, amortization methods and periods, warranty reserves, certain accrued expenses, restructuring and other related charges, stock-based compensation, contingent liabilities, tax reserves and recoverability of our net deferred tax assets and related valuation allowances. we base our estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. actual results could differ from these estimates if past experience or other assumptions do not turn out to be substantially accurate. any differences may have a material impact on our financial condition and results of operations.
the following is a discussion of what we believe to be the more significant critical accounting policies and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements.
inventory our inventories include material, labor and overhead, and are stated at the lower of cost (first-in, first-out) or market. as a developer and manufacturer of high technology medical equipment, we may be exposed to a number of economic and industry factors that could result in portions of our inventory becoming either obsolete or in excess of anticipated usage. these factors include, but are not limited to, technological changes in our markets, our ability to meet changing customer requirements, competitive pressures on products and prices, and reliability and replacement of and the availability of key components from our suppliers. our policy is to establish inventory reserves when conditions exist that suggest that our inventory may be in excess of anticipated demand or is obsolete based upon our assumptions about future demand for our products and market conditions. we regularly evaluate our ability to realize the value of our inventory based on a combination of factors including the following: historical usage rates, forecasted sales or usage, product expiration or end of life dates, estimated current and future market values and new product introductions. assumptions used in determining our estimates of future product demand may prove to be incorrect, in which case the provision required for excess and obsolete inventory would have to be adjusted in the future. if inventory is determined to be overvalued, excess or obsolete, we would be required to record impairment charges within cost of goods sold at the time of such determination. although considerable effort is made to ensure the accuracy of our forecasts of future product demand, any significant unanticipated changes in demand or expected usage could have a significant negative impact on the value of our inventory and our operating results. when recorded, our reserves are intended to reduce the carrying value of our inventory to its net realizable value.
accounts receivable reserves we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments. we regularly evaluate the collectability of our trade receivables based on a combination of factors, including discussions with the customer to determine the cause of non-payment, and evaluation of the customer's current financial situation. in the event it is determined that the customer may not be able to meet its full obligation to us, we record a specific allowance to reduce the receivable to the amount that we expect to recover given all information present. we perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers and adjust credit limits based upon payment history and our assessment of the customer's current credit worthiness. we continuously monitor collections from our customers and maintain a provision for
65
estimated credit losses based upon our historical experience and any specific customer collection issues that we have identified. while such credit losses have historically been within our expectations and the provisions established, we cannot guarantee that we will continue to experience the same credit loss rates in the future. if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate, additional allowances may be required.
we also record a provision for estimated sales returns and allowances on product and service related sales in the same period as the related revenues are recorded. these estimates are based on the specific facts and circumstances of particular orders, analysis of credit memo data and other known factors. if the data we use to calculate these estimates do not properly reflect reserve requirements, then a change in the allowances would be made in the period in which such a determination is made and revenues in that period could be adversely affected.
business combinations we record tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed in business combinations under the purchase method of accounting. amounts paid for each acquisition are allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their fair values at the dates of acquisition. contingent consideration, which is not deemed to be linked to continuing employment, is recorded at fair value as measured on the date of acquisition. the value recorded is based on estimates of future financial projections under various potential scenarios, which are generally probability weighted as to the outcome of each scenario. these cash flow projections are discounted with an appropriate risk adjusted rate. quarterly until such contingent amounts are earned, the fair value of the liability is reassessed at each reporting period and adjusted as a component of operating expenses based on changes to the underlying assumptions. the estimates used to determine the fair value of the contingent consideration liability are subject to significant judgment and actual results are likely to differ from the amounts originally recorded.
the fair value of identifiable intangible assets is based on detailed valuations that use information and assumptions provided by management, which consider management's best estimate of inputs and assumptions that a market participant would use. we allocate any excess purchase price over the fair value of the net tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed to goodwill.
purchased research and development represents the value of in-process projects that have not yet reached technological feasibility and have no alternative future uses as of the date of acquisition. we use the income approach to determine the fair values of our purchased research and development. this approach determines fair value by estimating the after-tax cash flows attributable to an in-process project over its useful life and then discounting these after-tax cash flows back to a present value. we base our revenue assumptions on estimates of relevant market sizes, expected market growth rates, expected trends in technology and expected product introductions by competitors. in arriving at the value of the in-process projects, we consider, among other factors, the in-process projects' stage of completion, the complexity of the work completed as of the acquisition date, the costs already incurred, the projected costs to complete, the contribution of core technologies and other acquired assets, the expected introduction date and the estimated useful life of the technology. we base the discount rate used to arrive at a present value as of the date of acquisition on the time value of money and medical technology investment risk factors. we believe that the estimated purchased research and development amounts so determined represent the fair value at the date of acquisition and do not exceed the amount a third-party would pay for the projects. if the projects are not successful or completed in a timely manner, we may not realize the financial benefits expected for these projects or for the acquisitions as a whole and impairments may result.
we also used the income approach, as described above, to determine the estimated fair value of certain other identifiable intangible assets including developed technology, customer relationships and contracts, and trade names. developed technology represents patented and unpatented technology and know-how. customer relationships represent established relationships with customers, which provide a ready channel for the sale of additional products and services. trade names represent acquired company and product names.
with respect to property, plant and equipment, we estimate the fair value of these assets using a combination of the cost and market approaches, depending on the component. generally, we apply the cost approach as the primary method in estimating the fair value of land and buildings as the market approach is less reliable based on potential significant differences between the property being valued and the potentially comparable sales of similar properties.
intangible assets and goodwill intangible assets we amortize our intangible assets that have finite lives using either the straight-line method or, if reliably determinable, based on the pattern in which the economic benefit of the asset is expected to be consumed. the economic pattern is based on undiscounted future cash flows. amortization is recorded over the estimated useful lives ranging from 2 to 30 years. we review
66
our intangible assets subject to amortization to determine if any adverse conditions exist or a change in circumstances has occurred that would indicate impairment or a change in the remaining useful life. if the carrying value of an asset exceeds its undiscounted cash flows, we will write-down the carrying value of the intangible asset to its fair value in the period identified. in assessing fair value, we must make assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and discount rates. if these estimates or related assumptions change in the future, we may be required to record impairment charges. we generally determine fair value based on the present value of estimated future cash flows to be generated by the asset using a risk-adjusted discount rate. if the estimate of an intangible asset's remaining useful life is changed, we will amortize the remaining carrying value of the intangible asset prospectively over the revised remaining useful life.
goodwill we test goodwill at the reporting unit level for impairment on an annual basis and between annual tests if events and circumstances indicate it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value. events that could indicate impairment and trigger an interim impairment assessment include, but are not limited to current economic and market conditions, including a decline in market capitalization, a significant adverse change in legal factors, business climate, operational performance of the business or key personnel, and an adverse action or assessment by a regulator. our annual impairment test date is the first day of our fiscal fourth quarter.
in performing the test, we utilize the two-step approach prescribed under asc 350. the first step requires a comparison of the reporting unit's carrying value to its fair value. we consider a number of factors to determine the fair value of a reporting unit, including an independent valuation to conduct this test. the valuation is based upon expected future discounted operating cash flows of the reporting unit as well as analysis of recent sales and ratio comparisons of similar companies. we base the discount rate on the weighted average cost of capital, or wacc, of market participants. if the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value, we will perform the second step of the goodwill impairment test to measure the amount of impairment loss, if any. the second step of the goodwill impairment test compares the implied fair value of a reporting unit's goodwill to its carrying value. the second step requires us to perform a hypothetical purchase allocation as of the measurement date and estimate the fair value of net tangible and intangible assets. the fair value of intangible assets is determined as described above and is subject to significant judgment.
we conducted our fiscal 2014 annual impairment test on the first day of the fourth quarter. we utilized discounted cash flows, or dcf, and market approaches to estimate the fair value of our reporting units as of june 29, 2014 and ultimately used the fair value determined by the dcf in making our impairment test conclusions. we believe we used reasonable estimates and assumptions about future revenue, cost projections, cash flows, market multiples and discount rates as of the measurement date. as a result of completing step 1, all of the reporting units had fair values exceeding their carrying values, and as such, step 2 of the impairment test was not required for those reporting units. for illustrative purposes, had the fair value of each of our remaining reporting units been lower by 10%, all of our other reporting units, except for one, would have still passed step 1 of the goodwill impairment test. the one reporting unit that was at risk of failing step 1 is within the diagnostics segment and had goodwill of $202.8 million at september 27, 2014.
since the fair value of our reporting units was determined by use of the dcf, and the key assumptions that drive the fair value in this model are the wacc, terminal values, growth rates, and the amount and timing of expected future cash flows, significant judgment is applied in determining fair value. if the current economic environment were to deteriorate, this would likely result in a higher wacc because market participants would require a higher rate of return. in the dcf as the wacc increases, the fair value decreases. the other significant factor in the dcf is our projected financial information (i.e., amount and timing of expected future cash flows and growth rates) and if these assumptions were to be adversely impacted, this could result in a reduction of the fair value of this reporting unit.
at september 27, 2014, we believe that all reporting units, except for one within our diagnostics segment as noted above, with goodwill aggregating $2.61 billion were not at risk of failing step 1 of the goodwill impairment test based on the current forecasts.
we conducted our fiscal 2013 annual impairment test on the first day of the fourth quarter. we utilized discounted cash flows, or dcf, and market approaches to estimate the fair value of our reporting units as of june 30, 2013 and ultimately used the fair value determined by the dcf in making our impairment test conclusions. we believe we used reasonable estimates and assumptions about future revenue, cost projections, cash flows, market multiples and discount rates as of the measurement date. as a result of completing step 1, all of the reporting units, except for our molecular diagnostics reporting unit, which is within our diagnostics reportable segment, had fair values exceeding their carrying values, and as such, step 2 of the impairment test was not required for those reporting units.
as a result of our company-wide annual budgeting and strategic planning process and a full re-evaluation of our existing product development efforts and cost structure performed in the fourth quarter, we reduced our short term and long term
67
revenue forecasts and determined that indicators of impairment existed in our molecular diagnostics reporting unit. the molecular diagnostics reporting unit is primarily comprised of our aptima business acquired in the gen-probe acquisition and the molecular diagnostics business acquired in the third wave acquisition. the updated forecast, which reflected pricing pressures, for revenue and profitability were lower than those expected at the time of the gen-probe acquisition.
as a result, the fair value of this reporting unit was below its carrying value. we performed step 2 of the impairment test, consistent with the procedures described above, and recorded a goodwill impairment charge of $1.1 billion. the basis of fair value for molecular diagnostics assumed the reporting unit would be purchased or sold in a taxable transaction, and the discount rate of 10% applied to the after-tax cash flows was relatively consistent with that used in our purchase accounting for the gen-probe acquisition. for illustrative purposes, had the fair value of molecular diagnostics been lower by 10%, the company would have recorded an additional impairment charge of $195.4 million.
revenue recognition we generate revenue from the sale of products, primarily medical imaging systems and diagnostic and surgical disposable products, and related services, which are primarily support and maintenance services on our medical imaging systems.
we recognize product revenue upon shipment provided that there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement, there are no uncertainties regarding acceptance, the sales price is fixed or determinable, no right of return exists and collection of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured. generally, our product arrangements for capital equipment sales, primarily in our breast health and skeletal health reporting segments, are multiple-element arrangements, including services, such as installation and training, and multiple products. in accordance with asc 605-25, based on the terms and conditions of the product arrangements, we believe that these services and undelivered products can be accounted for separately from the delivered product element as our delivered products have value to our customers on a stand-alone basis. accordingly, revenue for services not yet performed at the time of product shipment are deferred and recognized as such services are performed. the relative selling price of any undelivered products is also deferred at the time of shipment and recognized as revenue when these products are delivered. there is no customer right of return in our sales agreements.
service revenues primarily consist of amounts recorded under service and maintenance contracts and repairs not covered under warranty, installation and training, and shipping and handling costs billed to customers. service and maintenance contract revenues are recognized ratably over the term of the contract. other service revenues are recognized as the services are performed.
for revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables, we record revenue as separate units of accounting if the delivered items have value to the customer on a stand-alone basis, and if the arrangement includes a general right of return relative to the delivered items, the delivery or performance of the undelivered items is considered probable and substantially within our control. some of our products have both software and non-software components that function together to deliver the product's essential functionality. we determined that except for our cad products and c-view product, the software element in our other products is incidental and not within the scope of the software revenue recognition rules, asc 985-605, software-revenue recognition. we determined that given the significance of the software component's functionality to our cad and c-view systems, which are sold by our breast health segment, these products are within the scope of the software revenue recognition rules. we evaluated the appropriate revenue recognition treatment of our other hardware products, including our dimensions digital mammography systems, which have both software and non-software components that function together to deliver the products' essential functionality (i.e., it is a tangible product), and determined they are not within the scope of asc 985-605.
we are required to allocate revenue to multiple element arrangements based on the relative fair value of each element's selling price. we typically determine the selling price of our products based on our best estimate of selling price, referred to as esp, and services based on vendor-specific objective evidence of selling price, referred to as vsoe. we determine vsoe based on our normal pricing and discounting practices for the specific product or service when sold on a stand-alone basis. in determining vsoe, our policy requires a substantial majority of selling prices for a product or service to be within a reasonably narrow range. we also consider the class of customer, method of distribution, and the geographies into which our products and services are sold when determining vsoe. if vsoe cannot be established, which may occur in instances when a product or service has not been sold separately, stand-alone sales are too infrequent, or product pricing is not within a narrow range, we attempt to establish the selling price based on third-party evidence of selling price, referred to as tpe. tpe is determined based on competitor prices for similar deliverables when sold separately. when we cannot determine vsoe or tpe, we use esp in our allocation of arrangement consideration. the objective of esp is to determine the price at which we would typically transact a stand-alone sale of the product or service. esp is determined by considering a number of factors including our pricing policies, internal costs and gross margin objectives, method of distribution, information gathered from experience in customer negotiations, market research and information, recent technological trends, competitive landscape and geographies.
68
for those arrangements accounted for under the software revenue recognition rules, asc 985-605 generally requires revenue earned on software arrangements involving multiple elements to be allocated to each element based on their relative vsoe of fair value. if vsoe does not exist for a delivered element, the residual method is applied in which the arrangement consideration is allocated to the undelivered elements based on their vsoe with the remaining consideration recognized as revenue for the delivered elements. for multiple-element software arrangements where vsoe of fair value of post-contract customer support, referred to as pcs, has been established, we recognize revenue using the residual method at the time all other revenue recognition criteria have been met.
as part of our diagnostics reporting segment, we manufacture blood screening products according to demand schedules provided by our collaboration partner, grifols. our agreement provides that we share a portion of grifols's revenue from screening blood donations. upon shipment to grifols, we recognize blood screening product sales at an agreed upon fixed transfer price, which is not refundable, and record the related cost of products sold. based on the terms of our collaboration agreement with grifols, our ultimate share of the net revenue from sales to the end user in excess of the transfer price revenues recognized is not known until it is reported to us by grifols. on a monthly basis, grifols reports net revenue generated during the prior month and remits an additional corresponding net payment to us which we record as revenue at that time. this payment combined with the transfer price revenues previously recognized represents our ultimate share of net revenue under the agreement.
while the majority of our instruments are placed at customer sites, in certain instances, we sell sell instruments to our clinical diagnostics customers and record sales of these instruments upon delivery and customer acceptance. prior to delivery, each instrument is tested to meet the company's specifications and the specifications of the fda, and is shipped fully assembled. customer acceptance of the company's clinical diagnostic instrument systems requires installation and training by our technical service personnel. installation is a standard process consisting principally of uncrating, calibrating and testing the instrumentation. we sell our instruments to grifols for use in blood screening and record these instrument sales upon delivery since grifols is responsible for the placement, maintenance and repair of the units with its customers.
within our diagnostics business and, to a lesser extent, our gyn surgical business, we provide our instrumentation (for example, the thinprep processor, thinprep imaging system, panther and tigris) and certain other hardware to customers without requiring them to purchase the equipment or enter into a lease. instead, we recover the cost of providing the instrumentation and equipment in the amount we charge for our diagnostic tests and assays and other disposables. customers enter into a customer usage agreement, and we install the equipment at customer sites and customers commit to purchasing minimum quantities of disposable products at a stated price over a defined contract term, which is typically between three and five years. revenue is recognized over the term of the customer usage agreement as tests, assays and other disposable products are shipped or delivered, depending on the customer arrangement.
stock-based compensation we recognize stock-based compensation expense associated with the granting of stock options, restricted stock units and performance stock units issued to our employees. determining the amount of stock-based compensation to be recorded requires us to develop estimates to be used in calculating the grant-date fair value of stock options. we use a binomial lattice model to determine the fair value of our stock options. we consider a number of factors to determine the fair value of stock options including the advice of an outside valuation advisor and the advisor's model. the model requires us to make estimates of the following assumptions:
expected volatility-we are responsible for estimating volatility and have considered a number of factors, including third-party estimates, when estimating volatility. we currently use a combination of historical and implied volatility, which is weighted based on a number of factors.
expected term-we use historical employee exercise and option expiration data to estimate the expected term assumption. we believe that this historical data is currently the best estimate of the expected term of a new option, and that generally, all of our employees exhibit similar exercise behavior.
risk-free interest rate-the yield on zero-coupon u.s. treasury securities for a period that is commensurate with the expected term assumption is used as the risk-free interest rate.
the amount of stock-based compensation expense recognized during a period is based on the value of the portion of the awards that are ultimately expected to vest. asc 718, stock compensation, requires forfeitures to be estimated at the time of grant and revised, if necessary, in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates. based on an analysis of historical forfeitures, we have determined a specific forfeiture rate for certain employee groups and have applied forfeiture rates ranging from 0% to 6.5% as of september 27, 2014 depending on the specific employee group. this analysis is re-evaluated
69
periodically and the forfeiture rate is adjusted as necessary. ultimately, the actual expense recognized over the vesting period will only be for those awards that vest.
we recognized $50.0 million, $52.3 million and $40.6 million of stock-based compensation expense for employee equity awards in fiscal years 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. as of september 27, 2014, there was $24.4 million and $62.1 million of unrecognized compensation expense related to stock options and stock units, respectively, that we expect to recognize over a weighted-average period of 3.0 years and 2.6 years, respectively.
income taxes we use the asset and liability method for accounting for income taxes. under this method, we determine deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the difference between our assets and liabilities financial reporting and taxes bases. we measure deferred tax assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when we expect the differences to reverse.
we have recognized $1.34 billion in net deferred tax liabilities at september 27, 2014 and $1.58 billion at september 28, 2013. the liabilities primarily relate to deferred taxes associated with our acquisitions and debt. the tax assets relate primarily to net operating loss carryforwards, accruals and reserves, stock-based compensation, and research credits. we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized. while we have considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance, in the event we determine that we could realize our deferred tax assets in the future in excess of the net recorded amount, an adjustment to the deferred tax assets would increase income in the period such determination is made. likewise, should we determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax assets in the future, an adjustment to the deferred tax assets would be charged to income in the period such determination is made.
we had $137.0 million in gross unrecognized tax benefits, excluding interest, at september 27, 2014 and $121.8 million at september 28, 2013. at september 27, 2014, $66.1 million represents the amount of unrecognized tax benefits that, if recognized, would result in a reduction of the company's effective tax rate. in the next twelve months, it is reasonably possible that we will reduce our unrecognized tax benefits by $6.0 to $8.0 million due to statute of limitations expiring and potentially favorably settling with taxing authorities.
in the ordinary course of global business, there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax outcome is uncertain. judgment is required in determining our worldwide income tax provision. in our opinion, we have made adequate provisions for income taxes for all years subject to audit. while we consider our estimates reasonable, no assurance can be given that the final tax outcome will not be different than amounts reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals. if our assumptions are incorrect, the differences could have a material impact on our income tax provision and operating results in the period in which such determination is made.
recent accounting pronouncements in august 2014, the financial accounting standards board (fasb) issued accounting standards update (asu) no. 2014-15, disclosure of uncertainties about an entity's ability to continue as a going concern. asu 2014-15 explicitly requires management to evaluate, at each annual or interim reporting period, whether there are conditions or events that exist that raise substantial doubt about an entity's ability to continue as a going concern within one year after the date the financial statements are issued and to provide related disclosures. asu 2014-15 is effective for annual periods ending after december 15, 2016 and earlier application is permitted. the adoption of asu 2014-15 is not expected to have a material effect on our condensed consolidated financial statements or disclosures.
in may 2014, the fasb issued asu 2014-09, revenue from contracts with customers (topic 660), which provides guidance for revenue recognition. this asu is applicable to any entity that either enters into contracts with customers to transfer goods or services or enters into contracts for the transfer of nonfinancial assets. asu 2014-09 will supersede the revenue recognition requirements in topic 605, revenue recognition, and most industry-specific guidance. the standard's core principle is that a company will recognize revenue when it transfers promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the company expects to be entitled to receive in exchange for those goods or services. in doing so, companies will need to use more judgment and make more estimates than under current u.s. gaap. these may include identifying performance obligations in the contract, estimating the amount of variable consideration to include in the transaction price and allocating the transaction price to each separate performance obligation.  asu 2014-09 is effective prospectively for fiscal years, and interim reporting periods within those years, beginning after december 15, 2016, which is fiscal 2018 for the company. we are currently evaluating the impact of the adoption of asu 2014-09 on our consolidated financial position and results of operations.
70
in july 2013, the fasb issued asu no. 2013-11, presentation of an unrecognized tax benefit when a net operating loss carryforward, a similar tax loss, or a tax credit carryforward exist. asu 2013-11 amends the presentation requirements of asc 740 and requires an unrecognized tax benefit to be presented in the financial statements as a reduction to a deferred tax asset for a net operating loss carryforward, similar tax loss, or a tax credit carryforward. to the extent the tax benefit is not available at the reporting date under the governing tax law or if the entity does not intend to use the deferred tax asset for such purpose, the unrecognized tax benefit should be presented as a liability and not combined with deferred tax assets. the asu is effective for annual periods, and interim periods within those years, beginning after december 15, 2013, which is fiscal 2015 for us. the amendments are to be applied to all unrecognized tax benefits that exist as of the effective date and may be applied retrospectively to each prior reporting period presented. we are currently evaluating the impact of the adoption of asu 2013-11 on our consolidated financial position.
in march 2013, fasb issued asu 2013-05, foreign currency matters (topic 830): parent's accounting for the cumulative translation adjustment upon derecognition of certain subsidiaries or groups of assets within a foreign entity or of an investment in a foreign entity.  asu 2013-05 addresses the accounting for the cumulative translation adjustment when a parent either sells a part or all of its investment in a foreign entity or no longer holds a controlling financial interest in a subsidiary or group of assets that is a nonprofit activity or a business within a foreign entity. the guidance outlines the events when cumulative translation adjustments should be released into net income. the asu is effective for annual periods, and interim periods within those years, beginning after december 15, 2013, which is fiscal 2015 for us. we will apply the guidance prospectively to any derecognition events that may occur after the effective date and does not expect the adoption of asu 2013-05 to have a material impact on our consolidated financial position and results of operations.

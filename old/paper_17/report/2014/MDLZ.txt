item 1a. risk factors.
you should read the following risk factors carefully when evaluating our business and the forward-looking information contained in this annual report on form 10-k. any of the following risks could materially and adversely affect our business, operating results, financial condition and the actual outcome of matters described in this annual report on form 10-k. while we believe we have identified and discussed below the key risk factors affecting our business, there may be additional risks and uncertainties that we do not presently know or that we do not currently believe to be significant that may adversely affect our business, performance or financial condition in the future.
we operate in a highly competitive industry.
the food and snacking industry is highly competitive. our principal competitors include major international food, snack and beverage companies that, like us, operate in multiple geographic areas as well as numerous local and regional companies. we compete based on product quality, brand recognition and loyalty, service, product innovation, taste, convenience, the ability to identify and satisfy consumer preferences, effectiveness of sales and marketing, routes to market and distribution networks, promotional activity and price. if we do not effectively respond to challenges from our competitors, our business could be adversely affected.
competitor and customer pressures may require that we reduce our prices. these pressures may also restrict our ability to increase prices in response to commodity and other cost increases. failure to effectively assess, change and set proper pricing may negatively impact the achievement of our strategic and financial goals. the emergence of new distribution channels, such as internet sales directly to consumers, may affect customer and consumer preferences, cost structures or margins. we may also need to increase or reallocate spending on marketing, advertising and new product innovation to protect or increase market share. these expenditures might not result in trade and consumer acceptance of our efforts. if we reduce prices or our costs increase but we cannot increase sales volumes to offset those changes, then our financial condition and results of operations will suffer.
in addition, companies in our industry are under increasing pressure to improve the efficiency of their overall cost structures. we have announced a transformation agenda with the goals of focusing our portfolio, improving our cost structure and operating model, and accelerating our growth. if we do not achieve these objectives in a way that minimizes disruptions to our business, our financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.
maintaining, extending and expanding our reputation and brand image is essential to our business success.
our success depends on our ability to maintain brand image for our existing products, extend our brands into new geographies and to new distribution platforms, including online, and expand our brand image with new product offerings.
9
we seek to maintain, extend and expand our brand image through marketing investments, including advertising and consumer promotions, and product innovation. continuing global focus on health and wellness, including weight management, and increasing attention from the media, shareholders, consumers, activists and other stakeholders on the role of food marketing could adversely affect our brand image. it could also lead to stricter regulations and increased focus on food and snacking marketing practices. increased legal or regulatory restrictions on our advertising, consumer promotions and marketing, or our response to those restrictions, could limit our efforts to maintain, extend and expand our brands. moreover, adverse publicity about regulatory or legal action against us, product quality and safety, or environmental and human rights risks in our supply chain could damage our reputation and brand image, undermine our customers confidence and reduce demand for our products, even if the regulatory or legal action is unfounded or these matters are immaterial to our operations.
in addition, our success in maintaining, extending and expanding our brand image depends on our ability to adapt to a rapidly changing marketing and media environment, including our increasing reliance on social media and online dissemination of marketing and advertising campaigns. we are subject to a variety of legal and regulatory restrictions on how and to whom we market our products. these restrictions may limit our ability to maintain, extend and expand our brand image, particularly as social media and the communications environment continue to evolve. negative posts or comments about us on social networking web sites (whether factual or not) or security breaches related to use of our social media and failure to respond effectively to these posts, comments or activities could seriously damage our reputation and brand image across the various regions in which we operate. in addition, we might fail to invest sufficiently in maintaining, extending and expanding our brand image. as a result, we might be required to recognize impairment charges on our intangible assets or goodwill. if we do not successfully maintain, extend and expand our reputation and brand image, then our brands, product sales, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.
we are subject to risks from operating globally.
we are a global company and generated 82.1% of our 2014 net revenues, 83.1% of our 2013 net revenues and 82.9% of our 2012 net revenues outside the united states. we manufacture and market our products in approximately 165 countries and have operations in more than 80 countries, so we are subject to risks inherent in multinational operations. those risks include:
   compliance with u.s. laws affecting operations outside of the united states, including anti-bribery laws such as the foreign corrupt practices act (fcpa);

   compliance with antitrust and competition laws, data privacy laws, and a variety of other local, national and multi-national regulations and laws in multiple regimes;

   changes in tax laws, interpretation of tax laws and tax audit outcomes;

   currency devaluations or fluctuations in currency values, including in developing markets such as venezuela, argentina and russia as well as in developed markets such as countries within the european union;

   changes in capital controls, including currency exchange controls, government currency policies or other limits on our ability to import raw materials or finished product or repatriate cash from outside the united states;

   discriminatory or conflicting fiscal policies;

   increased sovereign risk, such as default by or deterioration in the economies and credit ratings of governments;

   changes in local regulations and laws, the uncertainty of enforcement of remedies in foreign jurisdictions, and foreign ownership restrictions and the potential for nationalization or expropriation of property or other resources;

   varying abilities to enforce intellectual property and contractual rights;

   greater risk of uncollectible accounts and longer collection cycles;

   design, implementation and use of effective control environment processes across our diverse operations and employee base; and

   the imposition of increased or new tariffs, quotas, trade barriers or similar restrictions on our sales or regulations, taxes or policies that might negatively affect our sales.

in addition, political and economic changes or volatility, geopolitical regional conflicts, terrorist activity, political unrest, civil strife, acts of war, public corruption, expropriation and other economic or political uncertainties could interrupt and negatively affect our business operations or customer demand. the slowdown in economic growth or high unemployment in some emerging markets could constrain consumer spending, and declining consumer purchasing power could adversely impact our profitability. continued instability in the banking and governmental sectors of certain countries in the european union or the dynamics associated with the federal and state debt and budget challenges in the united states could adversely affect us. all of these factors could result in increased costs or decreased revenues, and could materially and adversely affect our product sales, financial condition and results of operations.
10
our operations in certain emerging markets expose us to political, economic and regulatory risks.
our growth strategy depends in part on our ability to expand our operations in emerging markets, including brazil, china, india, mexico, russia, venezuela, argentina, ukraine, the middle east, africa and southeast asia. however, some emerging markets have greater political, economic and currency volatility and greater vulnerability to infrastructure and labor disruptions than more established markets. in many countries outside of the united states, particularly those with emerging economies, it may be common for others to engage in business practices prohibited by laws and regulations with extraterritorial reach, such as the fcpa and the u.k. bribery act, or local anti-bribery laws. these laws generally prohibit companies and their employees, contractors or agents from making improper payments to government officials, including in connection with obtaining permits or engaging in other actions necessary to do business. failure to comply with these laws could subject us to civil and criminal penalties that could materially and adversely affect our reputation, financial condition and results of operations.
in addition, competition in emerging markets is increasing as our competitors grow their global operations and low cost local manufacturers expand and improve their production capacities. our success in emerging markets is critical to our growth strategy. if we cannot successfully increase our business in emerging markets and manage associated political, economic and regulatory risks, our product sales, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.
unanticipated business disruptions could adversely affect our ability to provide our products to our customers.
we manufacture and source products and materials on a global scale. we have a complex network of suppliers, owned manufacturing locations, co-manufacturing locations, distribution networks and information systems that support our ability to provide our products to our customers consistently. factors that are hard to predict or beyond our control, like weather, natural disasters, fire, explosions, terrorism, political unrest, generalized labor unrest or health pandemics could damage or disrupt our operations or our suppliers or co-manufacturers operations. if we do not effectively respond to disruptions in our operations, for example, by finding alternative suppliers or replacing capacity at key manufacturing or distribution locations, or cannot quickly repair damage to our information, production or supply systems, we may be late in delivering or unable to deliver products to our customers. if that occurs, we may lose our customers confidence, and long-term consumer demand for our products could decline. in addition, we might not have the functions, processes or organizational capability necessary to achieve on our anticipated timeframes our strategic ambition to reconfigure our supply chain and drive efficiencies to fuel growth. further, changes to regulatory restrictions within the markets in which we operate may impact our ability to supply multiple markets with a streamlined manufacturing footprint. these events could materially and adversely affect our product sales, financial condition and results of operations.
we are subject to currency exchange rate fluctuations.
at december 31, 2014, we sold our products in approximately 165 countries and had operations in more than 80 countries. a significant portion of our business is exposed to currency exchange rate fluctuations. our financial results and capital ratios are sensitive to movements in currency exchange rates because a large portion of our assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses must be translated into u.s. dollars for reporting purposes or converted into u.s. dollars to service obligations such as our u.s. dollar-denominated indebtedness and dividends. in addition, movements in currency exchange rates can affect transaction costs because we source product ingredients from various countries. we seek to mitigate our exposure to exchange rate fluctuations, primarily on cross-currency transactions, but our efforts may not be successful. accordingly, changes in the currency exchange rates that we use to translate our results into u.s. dollars for financial reporting purposes or for transactions involving multiple currencies could materially and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.
commodity and other input prices are volatile and may rise significantly or availability of commodities may become constrained.
we purchase and use large quantities of commodities, including cocoa, coffee, dairy, wheat, corn products, soybean and vegetable oils, sugar and other sweeteners, and nuts. in addition, we purchase and use significant quantities of packaging materials to package our products and natural gas, fuels and electricity for our factories and warehouses. prices for these raw materials, other supplies and energy are volatile and can fluctuate due to conditions that are difficult to predict. these conditions include global competition for resources, currency fluctuations, political conditions, severe weather, the potential longer-term consequences of climate change on agricultural productivity, crop disease or pests, water risk, health pandemics, consumer or industrial demand, and changes in governmental trade, alternative energy and agricultural programs. many of the commodities we purchase are grown by smallholder farmers, who might lack the capacity to invest to increase
11
productivity or adapt to changing conditions. although we monitor our exposure to commodity prices and hedge against input price increases, we cannot fully hedge against changes in commodity costs, and our hedging strategies may not protect us from increases in specific raw material costs. continued volatility in the prices of commodities and other supplies we purchase could increase or decrease the costs of our products, and our profitability could suffer as a result. moreover, increases in the price of our products to cover increased input costs may result in lower sales volumes, while decreases in input costs could require us to lower our prices and thereby affect our revenues, profits or margins. likewise, constraints in the supply of key commodities may limit our ability to grow our net revenues. if our mitigation activities are not effective, if we are unable to price to cover increased costs or must reduce our prices, or if we are limited by supply constraints, our financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected.
changes in laws and regulations could increase our costs.
our activities throughout the world are highly regulated and subject to government oversight. various laws and regulations govern food production, storage, distribution, sales, advertising and marketing, as well as licensing, trade, labor, tax and environmental matters, and health and safety practices. government authorities regularly change laws and regulations and their interpretations. our compliance with new or revised laws and regulations or the interpretation and application of existing laws and regulations could materially and adversely affect our product sales, financial condition and results of operations.
we may be unable to hire or retain and develop key personnel or a highly skilled and diverse global workforce or manage changes in our workforce.
we must hire, retain and develop effective leaders and a highly skilled and diverse global workforce. we compete to hire new personnel in the many countries in which we manufacture and market our products and then to develop and retain their skills and competencies. unplanned turnover or failure to develop adequate succession plans for leadership positions or hire and retain a diverse global workforce with the skills and in the locations we need to operate and grow our business could deplete our institutional knowledge base and erode our competitiveness.
we also face increased personnel-related risks in connection with implementing the changes in our transformation agenda related to our operating model and business processes. these risks could lead to operational challenges, including increased competition for employees with the skills we require to achieve our business goals, higher employee turnover, including of employees with key capabilities, and challenges in developing the capabilities necessary to transform our business processes. furthermore, we might be unable to manage changes in, or that affect, our workforce appropriately or satisfy the legal requirements associated with how we manage and compensate our employees. this includes our management of employees represented by labor unions or workers councils, who represent approximately 64% of our 91,000 employees outside the united states and approximately 28% of our 13,000 u.s. employees.
these risks could materially and adversely affect our reputation, ability to meet the needs of our customers, product sales, financial condition and results of operations.
we must address risks related to consolidation of retail customers and leverage our value proposition in order to compete against retailer and other economy brands.
retail customers, such as supermarkets, warehouse clubs and food distributors in the european union, the united states and our other major markets, continue to consolidate, resulting in fewer but larger customers with whom we can conduct business. larger, more sophisticated retail customers and alliances among customers can resist price increases, delist or reduce the shelf space allotted to our products, and demand lower pricing, increased promotional programs, longer payment terms or specifically tailored products. in addition, larger retail customers have the scale to develop supply chains that permit them to operate with reduced inventories or to develop and market their own retailer and other economy brands that compete with some of our products. our products must provide higher quality or value to our consumers than the less expensive alternatives, particularly during periods of economic uncertainty. consumers may not buy our products if consumers perceive the difference in the quality or value between our products and retailer or other economy brands has narrowed. if consumers switch to purchasing or otherwise prefer retailer or other economy brands, then we could lose market share or sales volumes or need to shift our product mix to lower margin offerings.
retail consolidation also increases the risk that adverse changes in our customers business operations or financial performance will have a corresponding material adverse effect on us. for example, if our customers cannot access sufficient funds or financing, then they may delay, decrease or cancel purchases of our products, or delay or fail to pay us for previous purchases.
12
if we do not effectively respond to retail consolidation, increasing retail power and competition from retailer and other economy brands, our reputation, product sales, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.
we are subject to and may fail to manage changes in our relationships with significant customers or suppliers.
during 2014, our five largest customers accounted for 15.7% of our net revenues. there can be no assurance that our customers will continue to purchase our products in the same mix or quantities or on the same terms as in the past, particularly as increasingly powerful retailers continue to demand lower pricing and develop their own brands. the loss of or disruptions related to significant customers, such as the disruptions we experienced in 2014 with customers in france, could result in a material reduction in sales or change in the mix of products we sell to a significant customer. this could materially and adversely affect our product sales, financial condition and results of operations.
additionally, disputes with significant suppliers, including those related to pricing or performance, could adversely affect our ability to supply products to our customers and could materially and adversely affect our product sales, financial condition and results of operations.
we may decide or be required to recall products or be subjected to product liability claims.
we could decide, or laws or regulations could require us, to recall products due to suspected or confirmed product contamination, spoilage or other adulteration, product misbranding or product tampering. in addition, if another company recalls or experiences negative publicity related to a product in a category in which we compete, consumers might reduce their overall consumption of products in this category. any of these events could materially and adversely affect our reputation, product sales, financial condition and results of operations.
we may also suffer losses if our products or operations violate applicable laws or regulations, or if our products cause injury, illness or death. in addition, our marketing could face claims of false or deceptive advertising or other criticism. a significant product liability or other legal judgment against us, a related regulatory enforcement action or a widespread product recall could materially and adversely affect our reputation and profitability. moreover, even if a product liability or consumer fraud claim is unsuccessful, has no merit or is not pursued, the negative publicity surrounding assertions against our products or processes could materially and adversely affect our reputation, product sales, financial condition and results of operations.
we could be subject to legal or tax claims or other regulatory enforcement actions.
we are a large food and snacking company operating in highly regulated environments and constantly evolving legal, tax and regulatory frameworks around the world. consequently, we are subject to greater risk of litigation, legal or tax claims or other regulatory enforcement actions. there can be no assurance that our employees, contractors or agents will not violate policies and procedures we have implemented to promote compliance with existing laws and regulations. moreover, our failure to maintain effective control environment processes could lead to violations, unintentional or otherwise, of laws and regulations. litigation, legal or tax claims or regulatory enforcement actions arising out of our failure or alleged failure to comply with applicable laws, regulations or controls could subject us to civil and criminal penalties that could materially and adversely affect our reputation, product sales, financial condition and results of operations.
we may not successfully identify, complete or manage strategic transactions.
we evaluate a variety of potential strategic transactions, including acquisitions, divestitures, joint ventures, minority investments and other strategic alliances that could further our strategic business objectives. we may not successfully identify, complete or manage the risks presented by these strategic transactions. strategic transactions may result in the diversion of management attention from our existing business and may present financial, managerial and operational risks. our success depends, in part, upon our ability to identify suitable transactions; negotiate favorable contractual terms; comply with applicable regulations and receive necessary consents, clearances and approvals (including regulatory and antitrust clearances and approvals); integrate or separate businesses; realize the full extent of the benefits, cost savings or synergies presented by strategic transactions; effectively implement control environment processes with employees joining us as a result of a transaction; minimize adverse effects on existing business relationships with suppliers and customers; achieve accurate estimates of fair value; minimize potential loss of customers or key employees; and minimize indemnities and potential disputes with buyers, sellers and strategic partners.
13
with respect to acquisitions and joint ventures in particular, we are also exposed to potential risks based on our ability to conform standards, controls, policies and procedures, and business cultures; consolidate and streamline operations and infrastructures; identify and eliminate redundant and underperforming operations and assets; manage inefficiencies associated with the integration of operations; and coordinate antitrust and competition laws in the united states, the european union and other jurisdictions. joint ventures and strategic alliances pose additional risks, as we share ownership and management responsibilities with one or more other parties who may not have the same objectives, priorities, strategies or resources as we do. in may 2014, we entered into an agreement to combine our wholly owned coffee portfolio (outside of france) with d.e master blenders 1753 b.v., and in conjunction with that transaction, acorn holdings b.v., owner of d.e master blenders 1753 b.v., made a binding offer to receive our coffee business in france. we might not effectively separate our coffee business, integrate our operations into the new venture or complete the transaction on the anticipated timeframe. furthermore, we may not be able to complete, on terms favorable to us, desired or proposed divestitures of businesses that do not meet our strategic objectives or our growth or profitability targets. our divestiture activities, or related activities such as reorganizations, restructuring programs and transformation initiatives, may require us to recognize impairment charges or to take action to reduce costs that remain after a divestiture is completed. gains or losses on the sales of, or lost operating income from, those businesses may also affect our profitability.
any of these risks and challenges could materially and adversely affect our business, product sales, financial condition and results of operations.
we must correctly predict, identify and interpret changes in consumer preferences and demand and offer new products to meet those changes.
consumer preferences for food and snacking products change continually. our success depends on our ability to predict, identify and interpret the tastes, dietary habits, packaging and other preferences of consumers around the world and to offer products that appeal to these preferences. moreover, weak economic conditions, recession, equity market volatility or other factors could affect consumer preferences and demand. if we do not offer products that appeal to consumers or if we misjudge consumer demand for our products, our sales and market share will decrease and our profitability could suffer.
we must distinguish among short-term fads, mid-term trends and long-term changes in consumer preferences. if we do not accurately predict which shifts in consumer preferences will be long-term, or if we fail to introduce new and improved products to satisfy those preferences, our sales could decline. in addition, because of our varied consumer base, including by geography, we must offer an array of products that satisfy the broad spectrum of consumer preferences. if we fail to expand our product offerings successfully across product categories, or if we do not rapidly develop products in faster growing and more profitable categories, demand for our products could decrease and our profitability could suffer.
prolonged negative perceptions concerning the health implications of certain food products could influence consumer preferences and acceptance of some of our products and marketing programs. for example, recently, consumers have increasingly focused on health and wellness, including weight management and reducing sodium and added sugar consumption. in addition, consumer preferences differ by region, and we must monitor and adjust our use of ingredients to respond to these regional preferences. we might be unsuccessful in our efforts to effectively respond to changing consumer preferences and social expectations. continued negative perceptions and failure to satisfy consumer preferences could materially and adversely affect our reputation, product sales, financial condition and results of operations.
failure to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting could adversely affect us, and we have not maintained effective internal controls over our accounting for income taxes.
the accuracy of our financial reporting depends on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. internal control over financial reporting can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to the preparation and fair presentation of financial statements and may not prevent or detect misstatements because of its inherent limitations. these limitations include, among others, the possibility of human error, inadequacy or circumvention of controls and fraud. if we do not maintain effective internal control over financial reporting or design and implement controls sufficient to provide reasonable assurance with respect to the preparation and fair presentation of our financial statements, we could be unable to file accurate financial reports on a timely basis. as a result, our reputation, results of operations and stock price could be materially adversely affected.
14
in connection with managements assessment of internal control over financial reporting under section 404 of the sarbanes-oxley act of 2002 for the fiscal year ended december 31, 2013, we determined that we did not maintain effective monitoring and oversight of controls over the completeness, accuracy and presentation of our accounting for income taxes, including the income tax provision and related tax assets and liabilities. we determined that the ineffective monitoring and oversight of controls over income tax accounting constituted a material weakness. as of december 31, 2014, we made substantial progress toward remediating the material weakness. see item 9a, controls and procedures, for a discussion of the material weakness and the progress on the remediation. if the new controls we have implemented to address the material weakness and to strengthen our overall internal control over accounting for income taxes are not designed or do not operate effectively, if we are unsuccessful in implementing or following these new processes or if we are otherwise unable to remediate this material weakness, we may not timely or accurately report our financial condition or results of operations. this could adversely affect our stock price and the confidence of investors, business partners and others in our financial reports.
we are increasingly dependent on information technology.
we rely on information technology networks and systems, including the internet, to process, transmit and store electronic and financial information, to manage a variety of business processes and activities, and to comply with regulatory, legal and tax requirements. we also depend on our information technology infrastructure for digital marketing activities and for electronic communications among our personnel, customers and suppliers around the world. these information technology systems, many of which are managed by third parties or used in connection with shared service centers, may be susceptible to damage, disruptions or shutdowns due to failures during the process of upgrading or replacing software, databases or components thereof, power outages, hardware failures, computer viruses, attacks by computer hackers or other cybersecurity risks, telecommunication failures, user errors, natural disasters, terrorist attacks or other catastrophic events. furthermore, to the extent our information technology systems are managed by third parties or used in connection with external shared service centers, we would have to coordinate with these third parties to try to resolve issues related to these events. if any of our significant information technology systems suffer severe damage, disruption or shutdown, and our disaster recovery and business continuity plans do not effectively resolve the issues in a timely manner, our product sales, financial condition and results of operations may be materially and adversely affected, and we could experience delays in reporting our financial results.
in addition, if we are unable to prevent physical and electronic break-ins, cyber-attacks and other information security breaches, we may suffer financial and reputational damage, be subject to litigation or incur remediation costs or penalties because of the unauthorized disclosure of confidential information belonging to us or to our partners, customers, suppliers or employees. the mishandling or inappropriate disclosure of non-public sensitive or protected information could lead to the loss of intellectual property, negatively impact planned corporate transactions or damage our reputation and brand image. misuse, leakage or falsification of legally protected information could also result in a violation of data privacy laws and regulations and have a negative impact on our reputation, business, financial condition and results of operations.
weak financial performance, downgrades in our credit ratings, illiquid global capital markets and volatile global economic conditions could limit our access to the global capital markets, reduce our liquidity and increase our borrowing costs.
we may need to access the long-term and short-term global capital markets to obtain financing. our financial performance, our short-and long-term debt credit ratings, interest rates, the stability of financial institutions with which we partner, the liquidity of the overall global capital markets and the state of the global economy, including the food industry, will affect our access to, and the availability or cost of, financing on acceptable terms and conditions in the future. there can be no assurance that we will have access to the global capital markets on terms we find acceptable.
we regularly access the commercial paper markets in the united states and europe for ongoing funding requirements. a downgrade in our credit ratings by a credit rating agency could increase our borrowing costs and adversely affect our ability to issue commercial paper. disruptions in the global commercial paper market or other effects of volatile economic conditions on the global credit markets also could reduce the amount of commercial paper that we could issue and raise our borrowing costs for both short- and long-term debt offerings.
limitations on our ability to access the global capital markets, a reduction in our liquidity or an increase in our borrowing costs could materially and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.
15
volatility in the equity markets, interest rates or other factors could substantially increase our pension costs.
we sponsor a number of defined benefit pension plans for our employees throughout the world. at the end of 2014, the projected benefit obligation of our defined benefit pension plans was $12.5 billion and plan assets were $9.6 billion. the difference between plan obligations and assets, or the funded status of the plans, significantly affects the net periodic benefit costs of our pension plans and the ongoing funding requirements of those plans. our major defined benefit pension plans are funded with trust assets invested in a globally diversified portfolio of investments, including equities and corporate debt. among other factors, changes in interest rates, mortality rates, early retirement rates, investment returns, minimum funding requirements in the jurisdictions in which the plans operate, the viability of other employers in the multiemployer pension plans in which we participate and the market value of plan assets can affect the level of plan funding, cause volatility in the net periodic pension cost and increase our future funding requirements. legislative and other governmental regulatory actions may also increase funding requirements for our pension plans benefits obligation.
volatility in the global capital markets may increase the risk that we are required to make additional cash contributions to the pension plans and recognize further increases in our net pension cost. a portion of our pension trust assets is invested in european sovereign debt and subject to heightened risk that it could lose value as a result of political and financial turmoil in europe.
due to our participation in multi-employer pension plans, we may have exposure under those plans that extends beyond what our obligation would be with respect to our employees. our contributions to a multi-employer plan may increase beyond our bargaining obligations depending on the financial condition of the multi-employer plan. we may be required to participate in funding the unfunded obligations of the plan allocable to a withdrawing employer, and our costs might increase as a result. further, if we have a partial or complete withdrawal from a multi-employer pension plan, we may be required to pay an amount to the plan based on our allocable share of the underfunded status of the plan. this liability will generally increase if other employers cease participating in the plan whether or not due to bankruptcy. (see note 10, benefit plans, to the consolidated financial statements for more information on our multiemployer pension plans.)
a significant increase in our pension benefit obligations or funding requirements could have a negative impact on our ability to invest in the business and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.
our intellectual property rights are valuable, and our failure to protect them could reduce the value of our products and brands.
we consider our intellectual property rights, particularly and most notably our trademarks, but also our patents, trade secrets, copyrights and licensing agreements, to be a significant and valuable part of our business. we attempt to protect our intellectual property rights by taking advantage of a combination of patent, trademark, copyright and trade secret laws in various countries, as well as licensing agreements, third party nondisclosure and assignment agreements and policing of third party misuses of our intellectual property. our failure to obtain or adequately protect our intellectual property rights, or any change in law or other changes that serve to lessen or remove the current legal protections of our intellectual property, may diminish our competitiveness and could materially harm our business.
we may be unaware of third party claims of intellectual property infringement relating to our technology, brands or products. any litigation regarding patents or other intellectual property could be costly and time-consuming and could divert managements and other key personnels attention from our business operations. third party claims of intellectual property infringement might require us to pay monetary damages or enter into costly license agreements. we also may be subject to injunctions against development and sale of certain of our products. any of these occurrences could materially and adversely affect our reputation, product sales, financial condition and results of operations.
item 7. managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations.
the following discussion and analysis contains forward-looking statements. it should be read in conjunction with the other sections of this annual report on form 10-k, including the consolidated financial statements and related notes contained in item 8, forward-looking statements and risk factors contained in item 1a.
description of the company we manufacture and market primarily snack food and beverage products, including biscuits (cookies, crackers and salted snacks), chocolate, gum & candy, coffee & powdered beverages and various cheese & grocery products. we have operations in more than 80 countries and sell our products in approximately 165 countries.
over the last several years, we have been expanding geographically and building our presence in the snacking category. at the same time, we continued to invest in product quality, marketing and innovation behind our iconic brands, while implementing a series of cost saving initiatives. our goals are to achieve industry-leading revenue growth over time along with the higher expected growth rates of advantaged snack categories; leverage our cost structure through supply chain reinvention, productivity programs, overhead streamlining, volume growth and improved product mix to drive margin gains; and grow earnings per share in the top-tier of our peer group.
planned coffee business transactions on may 7, 2014, we announced that we entered into an agreement to combine our wholly owned coffee portfolio (outside of france) with d.e master blenders 1753 b.v. (demb). in conjunction with this transaction, acorn holdings b.v. (ahbv), owner of demb, has also made a binding offer to receive our coffee business in france. the parties have also invited our partners in certain joint ventures to join the new company.
upon completion of all proposed transactions, we expect to receive cash of approximately 4 billion and a 49 percent equity interest in the new company, to be called jacobs douwe egberts (jde). ahbv will hold a majority share in the proposed combined company and will have a majority of the seats on the board, which will be chaired by current demb chairman bart becht. we will have certain minority rights. ahbv is owned by an investor group led by jab holding company s.à r.l.
the transactions (collectively, the jde coffee transactions) remain subject to regulatory approvals and the completion of employee information and consultation requirements. we continue to expect the transactions to be completed in 2015, subject to closing conditions, including regulatory approvals. in december 2014, the european commission announced its intention to further evaluate the proposed transaction against eu antitrust regulations in order to make a final determination on merger clearance, which we currently expect in the second half of 2015. we and demb also continue to undertake consultations with works councils and employee representatives as required in connection with the transactions.
in connection with the expected receipt of approximately 4 billion upon closing, we entered into currency exchange forward contracts in the second quarter of 2014 to lock in an expected u.s. dollar value of approximately $5 billion. as of december 31, 2014, the forward contracts were recorded as derivative assets within other current assets and through december 31, 2014, we recognized $628 million of unrealized gains related to the hedges within interest and other expense, net. on february 11, 2015, we monetized the forward contracts and recorded an additional realized gain of $311 million in the first quarter of 2015, for a total realized gain of $939 million. we also entered into new currency exchange forward contracts to continue to lock in an expected u.s. dollar value of approximately $5 billion from the transactions. based on changes in the euro/u.s. dollar exchange rate, the actual closing date of the planned jde coffee transactions and the settlement dates of the hedges or other hedges we may put into place, the actual amount of u.s. dollars we receive could change. in addition to the hedges, we have also incurred incremental expenses related to readying our coffee businesses for the planned transactions that totaled $77 million through december 31, 2014 and were recorded within selling, general and administrative expenses of our europe and eemea segments and within our general corporate expenses. for additional information on the jde coffee transactions, see note 2, divestitures and acquisitionsplanned coffee business transactions.

2014-2018 restructuring program on may 6, 2014, our board of directors approved a $3.5 billion restructuring program, comprised of approximately $2.5 billion in cash costs and $1 billion in non-cash costs (the 2014-2018 restructuring program), and up to $2.2 billion of capital expenditures. the primary objective of the 2014-2018 restructuring program is to reduce our operating cost structure in both our supply chain and overhead costs. we expect the 2014-2018 restructuring program to generate annualized savings of at least $1.5 billion by the programs completion at the end of 2018. lower overheads and accelerated supply chain cost reductions are each expected to generate roughly half of the total incremental savings. we expect to incur the majority of the programs charges in 2015 and 2016 and to complete the program by year-end 2018. in 2014, we recorded restructuring and related implementation charges of $381 million under this program. for additional information on the 2014-2018 restructuring program, see note 6, restructuring programs.
s ummary of results
   net revenues decreased 3.0% to $34.2 billion in 2014 and increased 0.8% to $35.3 billion in 2013. net revenues in 2014 were significantly affected by unfavorable currency translation as the u.s. dollar strengthened against most currencies in which we operate.

   organic net revenue increased 2.4% to $36.0 billion in 2014 and increased 3.9% to $35.9 billion in 2013. organic net revenue is a non-gaap financial measure we use to evaluate our underlying results (see the definition of organic net revenue and our reconciliation with net revenues within non-gaap financial measures appearing later in this section).

                  diluted eps attributable to mondelēz international decreased 41.6% to $1.28 in 2014 and increased 28.1% to $2.19 in 2013. excluding the results of discontinued operations, our diluted eps attributable to mondelēz international from continuing operations decreased 0.8% to $1.28 in 2014 and increased 46.6% to $1.29 in 2013. a number of significant items also affected the comparability of our reported results, as further described in the discussion and analysis of historical results appearing later in this section and in the notes to the consolidated financial statements.

   adjusted eps increased 14.3% to $1.76 in 2014 and increased 7.7% to $1.54 in 2013. on a constant currency basis, adjusted eps increased 23.4% to $1.90 in 2014 and increased 11.9% to $1.60 in 2013. adjusted eps is a non-gaap financial measure we use to evaluate our underlying results (see the definition of adjusted eps and our reconciliation with diluted eps within non-gaap financial measures appearing later in this section).

financial outlook we seek to achieve top-tier financial performance. we manage our business to achieve this goal using a number of operating metrics including organic net revenue, adjusted operating income and adjusted eps. (refer to non-gaap financial measures appearing later in this section for more information on these measures.) additional metrics that we use or monitor include product quality measures, category growth, market share performance, pricing net of commodity costs, net commodity inflation, volume growth, power brand organic net revenue growth, gross and net productivity savings, brand support and related investments, capital spending, cash conversion cycle, free cash flow, return on invested capital and shareholder returns. we also monitor a number of factors and trends that we expect may impact our near- and long-term revenues and profitability objectives:
long-term demographics and consumer trends  snack food consumption is highly correlated to gdp growth, urbanization of the population and rising discretionary income levels associated with a growing middle class particularly in emerging markets. over the long-term, we expect these trends to continue leading to growth in key consumer behaviors, including increased snacking occasions, greater use of convenience food and migration to more frequent, smaller meals. in the near term, lower gdp growth, high unemployment and weak consumer confidence in europe and emerging markets has slowed category and our growth.
demand  we monitor consumer spending and our market share within the food and beverage categories in which we sell our products. growth in the global categories slowed from approximately 4% in 2013 to 3.6% in 2014. we believe the slowdown in category growth will continue to affect our near-term net revenue growth, but we expect the slowdown, particularly in emerging markets, to be temporary. we expect category growth to return to levels more in line with the expected growth of emerging markets and consumer spending in those markets. we continue to make investments in our brands and build strong routes to market to address the needs of consumers in emerging and developed markets. in doing so, we anticipate stimulating demand in our categories and growing our position in these markets.
22
volatility of global markets  our growth strategy depends in part on our ability to expand our operations, particularly in emerging markets. some of these markets have greater political and economic volatility and vulnerability to infrastructure and labor disruptions as we experienced this past year in markets including russia, ukraine, venezuela and argentina. volatility in these markets affects demand for and the costs of our products and requires frequent changes in how we operate our business. there will likely be continued volatility across these and other markets in which we sell. as such, we are focused on aggressively managing our costs currently as we continue to invest in brand building and routes to market.
competition  we operate in highly competitive markets that include global, regional and local competitors. our advantaged geographic footprint, operating scale and portfolio of brands have all significantly contributed to building our market-leading positions across most of the product categories in which we sell. to grow and maintain our market positions, we focus on product quality, bringing new products and innovations to market and effectively meeting consumer needs and preferences. we pursue significant growth opportunities such as expanding our global operations and growing our portfolio of power brands and innovative products. we continue to optimize our manufacturing and other operations and invest in our brands through ongoing research and development, advertising and marketing consumer promotions.
pricing  we adjust our product prices based on a number of variables including demand, the competitive environment and changes in our product input costs. our net revenue growth and profitability may be affected as we adjust prices to address new conditions. in 2014, we generally increased prices in response to higher commodity costs, currency and other market factors. in 2015, we continue to expect higher aggregate commodity and related costs and anticipate adjusting our prices in response to changing market conditions. price competition or delayed price increases by competitors or customers also affected our net revenues in 2014 and may continue to affect net revenues or market share in the near term until the market adjusts to the changes in input costs and other market conditions. in 2015, we plan to address some of these issues and improve our revenue mix by discontinuing certain low margin, customer-specific product lines, discontinuing certain low-margin licensed products and continuing to simplify our portfolio of skus.
operating costs  our operating costs include raw materials, labor, selling, general and administrative expenses, taxes, currency impacts and financing costs. we manage these costs through cost saving and productivity initiatives, sourcing and hedging programs, pricing actions, refinancing and tax planning. we continue to work on various programs to expand our profitability and margins, such as our 2014-2018 restructuring program designed to bring about significant reductions in our operating cost structure in both our supply chain and overhead costs.
currency  as a global company with over 80% of our net revenues generated outside the united states, we are exposed to changes in global economic conditions and currency movements. in 2014, as the u.s. dollar strengthened relative to other currencies in which we operate and as several countries experienced significant declines in or devaluations of their currency, these currency movements had a significant negative effect on our reported results of operations. our 2014 net revenues were $34.2 billion, down 3.0% from 2013, including a negative 5.1 percentage point impact from currency translation. while we have net investment hedges in the form of local currency denominated debt to offset the translation of certain of our overseas investments, we generally do not hedge against currency translation. we primarily seek to hedge against economic losses on cross-currency transactions. due to limited markets for hedging currency transactions and other factors, we may not be able to effectively hedge all of our cross-currency transaction risks. during 2014, we recognized $167 million of currency devaluation charges in pretax earnings related to the remeasurement of our net monetary assets in venezuela. the economy, monetary policies and other business restrictions in venezuela, as well as in other countries such as argentina and russia, have created a challenging business environment in which to operate, and our ability to hedge against currency-related economic losses may be limited. while we work to mitigate our exposure to these currency risks, factors such as continued global market volatility, actions by foreign governments, political uncertainty and other external developments could lead to further unfavorable currency impacts in the future.
financing costs  we regularly evaluate our variable and fixed-rate debt. we continue to use lower cost short- and long-term debt to finance our ongoing working capital, capital expenditures and other investments, dividends and share repurchases. in the first quarter of 2014 and fourth quarter of 2013, we retired $5 billion of our long-term u.s. dollar-denominated debt and issued lower-cost long-term euro and u.s. dollar-denominated debt. our weighted-average interest rate on our total debt as of december 31, 2014 was 4.3%, down from 4.8% as of december 31, 2013 and down from 5.8% as of december 31, 2012.

organic net revenue growth was driven by higher net pricing, partially offset by unfavorable volume/mix. overall, net pricing was up as we realized the effects of input cost-driven pricing actions implemented over the course of the year. higher net pricing was reflected primarily in latin america, eemea, europe and asia pacific. unfavorable volume/mix was driven primarily by europe, asia pacific and latin america. in addition to price elasticity, the decline was largely due to a slow response by competitors to higher input costs as well as the impact of price-related customer disruptions in europe. unfavorable currency impacts decreased net revenues by $1,806 million, due primarily to the devaluation of the venezuelan bolivar and the strength of the u.s. dollar relative to several currencies, including the argentinean peso, russian ruble, brazilian real and ukrainian hryvnya, partially offset by the strength of the british pound sterling relative to the u.s. dollar. the impact of divestitures completed in 2013 resulted in a year-over-year decrease in net revenues of $70 million and included a salty snacks business in turkey, a confectionery business in south africa and a chocolate business in spain. the accounting calendar change made in europe in 2013 resulted in a year-over-year decrease in net revenues of $38 million. the acquisition of a biscuit operation in morocco on february 22, 2013 added $14 million in incremental net revenues this year for the period prior to the anniversary date of the acquisition.

during 2014, higher net pricing outpaced increased input costs. higher net pricing was reflected across all segments. the increase in input costs was driven by higher raw material costs, in part due to higher currency exchange transaction costs on imported materials, partially offset by lower manufacturing costs. unfavorable volume/mix was driven by latin america, asia pacific and europe, partially offset by gains in eemea and north america.

total selling, general and administrative expenses decreased $222 million from 2013, due to a number of factors noted in the table above, including in part, a favorable currency impact, lower integration program costs, value-added tax (vat)-related settlements in 2014, lower spin-off costs, 2013 business divestitures and a gain on a sale of property in 2014. items that increased selling, general and administrative expenses included a 2013 benefit received related to the resolution of a cadbury acquisition indemnification, increased devaluation charges related to our net monetary assets in venezuela, costs incurred for the 2014-2018 restructuring program, costs incurred in 2014 related to the jde coffee transactions, gains on property sales in 2013 and higher 2012-2014 restructuring program costs.
excluding the factors noted above, selling, general and administrative expenses decreased $313 million from 2013, driven primarily by lower overhead costs and lower advertising and consumer promotion costs. overhead costs fell as a result of continued cost reduction efforts. advertising and consumer promotion costs were lower due primarily to savings from consolidating media providers, reductions in non-working media costs and efficiencies gained by shifting spending to lower-cost, digital media outlets, while we increased our spending on our power brands and maintained working media spending.
the change in unrealized gains / (losses) decreased operating income by $174 million in 2014. in 2014, the net unrealized losses on primarily commodity hedging activity were $112 million, as compared to net unrealized gains of $62 million in 2013 related to currency and commodity hedging activity. in 2013, we recorded pre-tax gains of $68 million related to sales of properties in india and europe. in 2014, we recorded a benefit of $84 million related to vat-related settlements in latin america. in 2014, we recorded a pre-tax gain of $7 million related to the sale of a property in europe. the acquisition of a biscuit operation in morocco on february 22, 2013 added $3 million in incremental operating income in 2014 for the period prior to the anniversary of the acquisition.
unfavorable currency impacts decreased operating income by $287 million, due primarily to the devaluation of the venezuelan bolivar in 2013 and 2014 and the strength of the u.s. dollar relative to several currencies, including the argentinean peso, brazilian real, russian ruble and ukrainian hryvnya, partially offset by the strength of the british pound sterling relative to the u.s. dollar.
operating income margin decreased from 11.2% in 2013 to 9.5% in 2014. the decrease in operating income margin was driven primarily by costs incurred for the 2014-2018 restructuring program, the year-over-year negative impact of the benefit from the resolution of the cadbury acquisition-related indemnification recorded in 2013, higher costs for the 2012-2014 restructuring program, the impact from the devaluation of our net monetary assets in venezuela and costs incurred related to the jde coffee transactions, partially offset by lower integration program costs. adjusted operating income margin increased from 12.1% in 2013 to 12.9% in 2014. the increase in adjusted operating income margin was driven primarily by lower overhead costs from continued cost reduction efforts and lower advertising and consumer promotion costs due primarily to current year productivity initiatives, partially offset by a decline in gross profit margin due entirely to the unfavorable impact of unrealized gains / (losses) on currency and commodity hedging activities.

organic net revenue growth was driven by favorable volume/mix and higher net pricing. favorable volume/mix was driven primarily by higher shipments across all segments except asia pacific. higher net pricing in latin america, primarily related to venezuela, argentina and brazil, and in north america was partially offset by lower net pricing in europe, asia pacific and eemea, primarily due to lower coffee prices. unfavorable currency decreased net revenues by $837 million, due primarily to the devaluation of the venezuelan bolivar and the strength of the u.s. dollar relative to most currencies, including the brazilian real, argentinean peso, australian dollar, indian rupee, japanese yen and south african rand, partially offset by the strength of the euro relative the u.s. dollar. the impact of divestitures resulted in a year-over-year decrease in net revenues of $345 million. in addition, the acquisition of a biscuit operation in morocco added $91 million in net revenues and the accounting calendar change in europe added $37 million in net revenues in 2013.

favorable volume/mix was driven primarily by volume gains across all segments except asia pacific. higher net pricing in latin america and north america was partially offset by lower net pricing in europe, asia pacific and eemea, primarily due to lower coffee pricing. during 2013, increased input costs outpaced higher net pricing. the increase in input costs was driven by higher raw material costs, in part due to higher currency exchange transaction costs on imported materials, partially offset by lower manufacturing costs.
total selling, general and administrative expenses decreased $497 million from 2012, due in part to lower spin-off costs, a benefit from the resolution of the cadbury acquisition-related indemnification, a favorable currency impact net of the negative impact from the devaluation of our net monetary assets in venezuela, gains on the sales of properties in 2013 and the impact of businesses divested in 2013 and 2012, which were partially offset by gains on sales of properties in 2012, higher integration program costs, higher 2012-2014 restructuring program costs and the inclusion of expenses related to the acquired biscuit operations in morocco.
31
excluding the factors noted above, selling, general and administrative expenses increased $246 million from 2012, driven primarily by higher overhead costs in emerging markets, including investments in sales capabilities and route-to-market expansion in emerging markets, the 2012 reversal of reserves carried over from the cadbury acquisition in 2010 and no longer required, prior-year proceeds from insurance settlements and higher advertising and consumer promotion costs in asia pacific, eemea and latin america.
the change in unrealized gains / (losses) added $61 million in operating income for 2013. in 2013, the net unrealized gains were $62 million, as compared to net unrealized gains of $1 million in 2012. in 2013, we recorded pre-tax gains of $68 million related to sales of properties in india and europe. in 2012, we recorded pre-tax gains of $77 million related to sales of properties in russia and turkey. the acquisition of a biscuit operation in morocco added $16 million in operating income for 2013. accounting calendar changes that went into effect in europe in the first quarter of 2013 increased operating income by $6 million.
unfavorable currency impacts decreased operating income by $146 million, due primarily to the devaluation of the venezuelan bolivar and the strength of the u.s. dollar relative to most currencies, including the brazilian real, argentinean peso, indian rupee, japanese yen, south african rand and russian ruble, partially offset by the strength of the euro relative to the u.s. dollar.
operating income margin increased from 10.4% in 2012 to 11.2% in 2013. the increase in operating income margin was driven primarily by lower spin-off costs and the benefit from the resolution of the cadbury acquisition-related indemnification, partially offset by higher costs for the 2012-2014 restructuring program, lower integration program costs, a negative impact from divestitures and the unfavorable impact from the devaluation of our net monetary assets in venezuela. adjusted operating income margin decreased from 12.3% in 2012 to 12.1% in 2013. the decrease in adjusted operating income margin was driven primarily by a modest decline in gross margin, due to the timing of price increases to cover rising currency exchange transaction costs on imported raw materials in the second half of the year, partially offset by the benefit of leverage on our selling, general and administrative expenses.

results of operations by reportable segment our operations and management structure are organized into five reportable operating segments:
   latin america

   asia pacific

   eemea

   europe

   north america

we manage our operations by region to leverage regional operating scale, manage different and changing business environments more effectively at a local level and pursue growth opportunities as they arise in our key markets. beginning in 2015, within each region, we also manage by product category. in the historical periods presented and discussed below, we managed our operations within latin america, asia pacific and eemea by location and within europe and north america by location and product category.
we use segment operating income to evaluate segment performance and allocate resources. we believe it is appropriate to disclose this measure to help investors analyze segment performance and trends. see note 17, segment reporting, for additional information on our segments and items affecting comparability of financial results earlier in this section for items affecting our segment operating results.

2014 compared with 2013:
net revenues decreased $229 million (4.3%), due to unfavorable currency (19.4 pp) and unfavorable volume/mix (4.2 pp), partially offset by higher net pricing (19.3 pp). unfavorable currency impacts were due primarily to the venezuelan bolivar devaluation and the strength of the u.s. dollar relative to the argentinean peso and brazilian real. unfavorable volume/mix was driven primarily by mexico, venezuela and argentina, partially offset by gains in brazil and the western andean countries. higher net pricing was reflected primarily in the higher inflationary countries of venezuela and argentina, as well as in brazil and mexico.
segment operating income decreased $95 million (16.7%), due primarily to higher raw material costs, unfavorable currency, unfavorable volume/mix, the year-over-year net impact from the remeasurement of net monetary assets in venezuela, costs incurred for the 2014-2018 restructuring program and higher advertising and consumer promotion costs. these unfavorable items were partially offset by higher net pricing, lower manufacturing costs, the absence of integration program costs in 2014, lower other selling, general and administrative expenses (including $84 million related primarily to vat-related settlements) and lower 2012-2014 restructuring program costs.
2013 compared with 2012:
net revenues decreased $14 million (0.3%), due to unfavorable currency (12.6 pp), mostly offset by higher net pricing (11.4 pp) and favorable volume/mix (0.9 pp). unfavorable currency was due primarily to the venezuelan bolivar devaluation and the strength of the u.s. dollar relative to the brazilian real and argentinean peso, partially offset by the strength of the mexican peso relative to the u.s. dollar. higher net pricing was reflected across the entire region except in mexico. favorable volume/mix was driven primarily by brazil, partially offset by volume/mix declines in argentina and venezuela.
segment operating income decreased $199 million (25.9%), due primarily to higher raw material costs, unfavorable currency including the $54 million impact from the devaluation of net monetary assets in venezuela, higher other selling, general and administrative expenses (including prior-year proceeds from an insurance settlement), higher manufacturing costs, higher 2012-2014 restructuring program costs, and higher advertising and consumer promotion costs. these unfavorable items were partially offset by higher net pricing and lower spin-off costs.

2014 compared with 2013:
net revenues decreased $347 million (7.0%), due to unfavorable volume/mix (5.7 pp) and unfavorable currency (4.2 pp), partially offset by higher net pricing (2.9 pp). unfavorable volume/mix was driven primarily by china, australia/new zealand, indonesia, malaysia and the philippines, partially offset by gains in india. unfavorable currency impacts were due primarily to the strength of the u.s. dollar relative to the australian dollar, indian rupee, indonesian rupiah and japanese yen. higher net pricing was primarily due to india, indonesia, the philippines, australia/new zealand and china.
segment operating income decreased $127 million (24.8%), due primarily to higher raw material costs, unfavorable volume/mix, an intangible asset impairment charge related to a biscuit trademark, higher 2012-2014 restructuring program costs, 2014-2018 restructuring program costs and unfavorable currency. these unfavorable items were partially offset by higher net pricing, lower manufacturing costs, lower advertising and consumer promotion costs, the absence of integration program costs in 2014 and lower other selling, general and administrative expenses (including an unfavorable year-over-year impact from the 2013 gain on a sale of property in india).
2013 compared with 2012:

2014 compared with 2013:
net revenues decreased $277 million (7.1%), due to unfavorable currency (13.4 pp) and the impact of divestitures (0.5 pp), partially offset by higher net pricing (5.7 pp), favorable volume/mix (0.8 pp) and the impact of the february 2013 acquisition of a biscuit operation in morocco (0.3 pp). unfavorable currency impacts were due to the strength of the u.s. dollar relative to most currencies in the region, primarily the russian ruble, ukrainian hryvnya, south african rand and turkish lira. divestitures completed in 2013 resulted in a $20 million decline in net revenues. higher net pricing was reflected across most of the segment, primarily in russia, ukraine and turkey. favorable volume/mix was driven primarily by russia, the gulf cooperation council (gcc) countries and turkey. the acquisition of a biscuit operation in morocco in february 2013 added $14 million in incremental net revenues for 2014 for the period prior to the anniversary date of the acquisition.
segment operating income decreased $52 million (13.7%), due primarily to higher raw material costs, unfavorable currency, higher 2012-2014 restructuring program costs, costs incurred for the 2014-2018 restructuring program and costs associated with the jde coffee transactions. these unfavorable items were partially offset by higher net pricing, lower manufacturing costs, lower integration program and other acquisition integration costs, favorable volume/mix, the impact of 2013 divestitures and lower advertising and consumer promotion costs.
2013 compared with 2012:
net revenues increased $180 million (4.8%), due to favorable volume/mix (11.0 pp) and the impact of the acquisition of a biscuit operation in morocco (2.5 pp), partially offset by unfavorable currency (4.7 pp), the impact of divestitures in turkey and south africa (2.2 pp) and lower net pricing (1.8 pp). favorable volume/mix was driven primarily by russia, ukraine, egypt, west africa, central and east africa and south africa. unfavorable currency was due to the strength of the u.s. dollar relative to most currencies in the region, including the south african rand, russian ruble and egyptian pound. lower net pricing was reflected primarily in russia and ukraine, due to lower coffee and chocolate pricing, partially offset by higher net pricing in the gcc countries, south africa and egypt.
segment operating income decreased $127 million (25.1%), due primarily to higher other selling, general and administrative expenses (including investments in sales capabilities and route-to-market expansion and a write-off of a $15 million vat receivable that is no longer realizable), the 2012 gains on the sales of property in russia and turkey, lower net pricing, higher raw material costs, higher integration program and morocco biscuit acquisition integration costs, unfavorable currency, higher advertising and consumer promotion costs, higher 2012-2014 restructuring program costs and the impact of divestitures in turkey and south africa. these unfavorable items were partially offset by favorable volume/mix, lower manufacturing costs and the impact from the acquisition in morocco.

2014 compared with 2013:
net revenues decreased $147 million (1.0%), due to unfavorable volume/mix (2.3 pp), the impact of the prior years accounting calendar change (0.2 pp) and the impact of divestitures (0.0 pp), partially offset by higher net pricing (1.3 pp) and favorable currency (0.2 pp). unfavorable volume/mix was driven by lower shipments across all categories. the decline was due to pricing-related elasticity across the region and certain pricing-related customer disruptions. the accounting calendar change made in 2013 resulted in a year-over-year decrease in net revenues of $38 million. in addition, divestitures completed in 2013 resulted in an $11 million decline in net revenues. higher net pricing was driven by chocolate and cheese & grocery, partially offset by lower net pricing in all other categories, primarily biscuits and coffee. favorable currency impacts primarily reflected the strength of the british pound sterling relative to the u.s. dollar, partially offset by the strength of the u.s. dollar against the swedish krona, the euro and norwegian krone.
segment operating income increased $71 million (4.2%), due primarily to lower manufacturing costs, higher net pricing, lower integration program costs (including the reversal of a prior-year accrual), lower advertising and consumer promotion costs and lower other selling, general and administrative expenses (net of the unfavorable year-over-year impact from the 2013 gains on the sales of property in the united kingdom, norway and italy, and the benefit from a 2014 gain on a sale of property in the united kingdom). these favorable items were partially offset by higher raw material costs (primarily higher cocoa costs), costs incurred for the 2014-2018 restructuring program, unfavorable volume mix, higher 2012-2014 restructuring program costs, costs associated with the jde coffee transactions, an intangible asset impairment charge related to a candy trademark and the year-over-year impact from last years accounting calendar change.
2013 compared with 2012:
net revenues increased $242 million (1.8%), due to favorable volume/mix (3.2 pp), favorable currency (2.1 pp) and the impact of an accounting calendar change (0.3 pp), partially offset by lower pricing (2.4 pp) and the impact of current and prior-year divestitures (1.4 pp). favorable volume/mix was driven by higher shipments in chocolate, biscuits and coffee, partially offset by lower shipments in gum & candy and cheese & grocery. favorable currency primarily reflected the strength of the euro, swedish krona and polish zloty relative to the u.s. dollar, partially offset by the strength of the u.s. dollar relative to the british pound sterling. lower net pricing was driven primarily by lower coffee prices.
segment operating income decreased $63 million (3.6%), due primarily to lower net pricing, higher 2012-2014 restructuring program costs, the impact of current and prior-year divestitures and higher integration program costs (partially due to the reversal of $45 million of charges due to the outcome of labor negotiations in april 2012). these unfavorable items were partially offset by favorable volume/mix, lower manufacturing costs, favorable currency, lower other selling, general and administrative expenses (including the impacts of gains on the sales of property in the united kingdom, norway and italy and a $44 million reversal in 2012 of reserves carried over from the cadbury acquisition in 2010 no longer required), lower advertising and consumer promotion costs, the impact of an accounting calendar change and lower raw material costs (primarily coffee).

2014 compared with 2013:
net revenues decreased $55 million (0.8%), due to unfavorable currency (1.0 pp) and the impact of divestitures (0.6 pp), partially offset by favorable volume/mix (0.7 pp) and higher net pricing (0.1 pp). unfavorable currency impact was due to the strength of the u.s. dollar relative to the canadian dollar. divestitures completed in 2013 resulted in a $39 million decline in net revenues. favorable volume/mix was driven primarily by higher shipments in biscuits, partially offset by lower shipments in gum. higher net pricing was reflected primarily in biscuits and gum, partially offset by lower net pricing in chocolate.
segment operating income increased $33 million (3.7%), due primarily to lower raw material costs, lower other selling, general and administrative expenses, favorable volume/mix, lower 2012-2014 restructuring program costs, lower advertising and consumer promotion costs and higher net pricing. these favorable items were partially offset by costs incurred for the 2014-2018 restructuring program, higher manufacturing costs and the impact of divestitures.
2013 compared with 2012:
net revenues increased $88 million (1.3%), due to favorable volume/mix (2.5 pp) and higher net pricing (0.4 pp), partially offset by the impact of current and prior-year divestitures (1.0 pp) and unfavorable currency (0.6 pp). favorable volume/mix was driven primarily by higher shipments in biscuits and candy, partially offset by lower shipments in gum. higher net pricing was reflected primarily in biscuits and candy, partially offset by lower net pricing in gum.
segment operating income increased $108 million (13.8%), due primarily to favorable volume/mix, lower pension expenses due to the transfer of certain benefit plan obligations to kraft foods group, inc. in the spin-off, higher net pricing, lower manufacturing costs, lower advertising and consumer promotion costs (including a reversal of some prior-year accruals), lower spin-off costs and lower integration program costs. these favorable items were partially offset by higher 2012-2014 restructuring program costs, higher raw material costs, and the impact of a current and prior-year divestitures.

critical accounting estimates we prepare our condensed consolidated financial statements in conformity with u.s. gaap. the preparation of these financial statements requires the use of estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented. actual results could differ from those estimates and assumptions. note 1, summary of significant accounting policies, to the consolidated financial statements includes a summary of the significant accounting policies we used to prepare our consolidated financial statements. we have discussed the selection and disclosure of our critical accounting policies and estimates with our audit committee. the following is a review of our most significant assumptions and estimates.
goodwill and non-amortizable intangible assets:
we test goodwill and non-amortizable intangible assets for impairment on an annual basis in the fourth quarter. we assess goodwill impairment risk throughout the year by performing a qualitative review of entity-specific, industry, market and general economic factors affecting the reporting units with goodwill. annually, we may perform qualitative testing, or depending on factors such as prior-year test results, current year developments, current risk evaluations and other practical considerations, we may elect to do quantitative testing instead. quantitative impairment testing consists of a two-step evaluation. the first step compares a reporting units estimated fair value with its carrying value. we estimate a reporting units fair value using a discounted cash flow method which incorporates planned growth rates, market-based discount rates and estimates of residual value. this year, for reporting units in our europe and north america segments, we used a market-based, weighted-average cost of capital of 6.9% to discount the projected cash flows of those operations. for our latin america, asia pacific and eemea reporting units, we used a risk-rated discount rate of 9.9%. estimating the fair value of individual reporting units requires us to make assumptions and estimates regarding our future plans and industry and economic conditions, and our actual results and conditions may differ over time. if the carrying value of a reporting units net assets exceeds its fair value, we apply the second step to measure the difference between the carrying value and implied fair value of goodwill. if the carrying value of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value, the goodwill is impaired and its carrying value is reduced to the implied fair value of the goodwill.
on january 1, 2014, an organizational change occurred within our north america region from a country and product category structure to a regional product category structure. as a result, our north america region now has two instead of four reporting units. for any reporting units that were reorganized, the goodwill was allocated to the new reporting unit structure based on relative fair values of the related business units.
in 2014, 2013 and 2012, all reporting units passed our annual goodwill impairment testing. if expectations are not met or specific valuation factors outside of our control, such as discount rates, change significantly, then the estimated fair value of a reporting unit or reporting units might decline and lead to a goodwill impairment in the future.
we test non-amortizable intangible assets for impairment by performing a qualitative review and assessing events and circumstances that could affect the fair value or carrying value of the indefinite-lived intangible assets. if significant potential impairment risk exists for a specific asset, we quantitatively test it for impairment by comparing its estimated fair value with its carrying value. estimated fair value is determined using planned growth rates, market-based discount rates and estimates of royalty rates. if the carrying value of the asset exceeds its estimated fair value, the asset is impaired and its carrying value is reduced to the estimated fair value.
during our 2014 review of non-amortizable intangible assets, we recorded $57 million of impairment charges related to two trademarks. in both cases, the impairments arose due to lower than expected product growth and decisions made in the fourth quarter to redirect support for the products to other regional brands. we recorded a $48 million charge related to a biscuit trademark in our asia pacific segment and a $9 million charge related to a candy trademark in our europe segment. the impairment charges were calculated as the excess of the carrying value over the estimated fair value of the intangible assets on a global basis and were recorded within asset impairment and exit costs. we primarily use a relief of royalty valuation method, which utilizes estimates of future sales, growth rates, royalty rates and discount rates in determining a brands global fair value. during our 2014 intangible asset impairment review, we also noted three brands with $341 million of aggregate book value as of december 31, 2014 that each had a fair value in excess of book value of 10% or less. while these intangible assets passed our annual impairment testing and we believe our current plans for each of these brands will allow them to continue to not be impaired, if expectations are not met or specific valuation factors outside of our control, such as discount rates, change significantly, then a brand or brands could become impaired in the future.
refer also to note 5, goodwill and intangible assets, for additional information.

trade and marketing programs:
we promote our products with advertising, marketing, sales incentives and trade promotions. these programs include, but are not limited to, cooperative advertising, in-store displays, consumer promotions, new product introduction fees, discounts, coupons, rebates and volume-based incentives. we expense advertising costs either in the period the advertising first takes place or as incurred. sales incentive and trade promotion activities are recorded as a reduction to revenues based on amounts estimated due to customers and consumers at the end of a period. we base these estimates principally on historical utilization and redemption rates. for interim reporting purposes, advertising expenses and sales incentives are charged to operations as a percentage of volume, based on estimated volume and estimated program spending. we do not defer costs on our year-end consolidated balance sheet and all marketing costs are recorded as an expense in the year incurred.
employee benefit plans:
we sponsor various employee benefit plans throughout the world. these include primarily pension plans and postretirement healthcare benefits. for accounting purposes, we estimate the pension and post-retirement healthcare benefit obligations utilizing assumptions and estimates for discount rates; expected returns on plan assets; expected compensation increases; employee-related factors such as turnover, retirement age and mortality (during 2014, we applied the new mortality tables in accounting for our u.s. pension plans); and health care cost trends. we review our actuarial assumptions on an annual basis and make modifications to the assumptions based on current rates and trends when appropriate. our assumptions also reflect our historical experiences and managements best judgment regarding future expectations. these and other assumptions affect the annual expense and obligations recognized for the underlying plans.
as permitted by u.s. gaap, we generally amortize the effect of changes in the assumptions over future periods. the cost or benefit of plan changes, such as increasing or decreasing benefits for prior employee service (prior service cost), is deferred and included in expense on a straight-line basis over the average remaining service period of the employees expected to receive benefits.
since pension and post-retirement liabilities are measured on a discounted basis, the discount rate significantly affects our plan obligations and expenses. the expected return on plan assets assumption affects our pension plan expenses, since many of our pension plans are partially funded. the assumptions for discount rates and expected rates of return and our process for setting these assumptions are described in note 10, benefit plans, to the consolidated financial statements.
while we do not anticipate further changes in the 2015 assumptions for our u.s. and non-u.s. pension and postretirement health care plans, as a sensitivity measure, a fifty-basis point change in our discount rates or the expected rate of return on plan assets would have the following effects, increase / (decrease), on our annual benefit plan costs:

postretirement health care costs income taxes:
as a global company, we calculate and provide for income taxes in each tax jurisdiction in which we operate. the provision for income taxes includes the amounts payable or refundable in the current year, the effect of deferred taxes and impacts from uncertain tax positions. our provision for income taxes is significantly affected by shifts in the geographic mix of our pre-tax earnings across tax jurisdictions, changes in tax laws and regulations, tax planning opportunities available in each tax jurisdiction and the ultimate outcome of various tax audits.
42
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial statement and tax bases of our assets and liabilities and for operating losses and tax credit carryforwards. deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates that will apply to taxable income in the years in which those differences are expected to be recovered or settled. valuation allowances are established for deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will not be realized.
we recognize tax benefits in our financial statements from uncertain tax positions only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by tax authorities based on the technical merits of the position. the amount we recognize is measured as the largest benefit that has a greater than 50 percent likelihood of being realized upon settlement. we evaluate uncertain tax positions on an ongoing basis and adjust the related tax liabilities or assets in light of changing facts and circumstances, such as the progress of a tax audit or expiration of a statute of limitations. we believe the estimates and assumptions used to support our evaluation of uncertain tax positions are reasonable. however, final determination of historical tax liabilities, either by settlement with tax authorities or expiration of statutes of limitations, could be materially different from estimates reflected on our consolidated balance sheet and historical income tax provisions. the outcome of these final determinations could have a material effect on our provision for income taxes, net earnings or cash flows in the period in which the determination is made. we believe our tax positions comply with applicable tax laws and that we have adequately accounted for uncertain tax positions.
no taxes have been provided on undistributed foreign earnings that are planned to be indefinitely reinvested. if future events, such as material changes in long-term investment requirements, necessitate that these earnings be distributed, an additional provision for taxes may apply, which could materially affect our future effective tax rate.
see note 15, income taxes, for additional information on our effective tax rate, current and deferred taxes, valuation allowances and unrecognized tax benefits.
contingencies:
see note 11, commitments and contingencies, to the consolidated financial statements.
new accounting guidance:
see note 1, summary of significant accounting policies, to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of new accounting standards.
commodity trends we regularly monitor worldwide supply, commodity cost and currency trends so we can cost-effectively secure ingredients, packaging and fuel required for production. during 2014, the primary drivers of the increase in our aggregate commodity costs were increased cocoa, dairy, packaging, energy and coffee bean costs and higher currency-related costs on our commodity purchases, partially offset by lower costs for sugar and grains and oils due primarily to hedging.
a number of external factors such as weather conditions, commodity market conditions, currency fluctuations and the effects of governmental agricultural or other programs affect the cost and availability of raw materials and agricultural materials used in our products. we address higher commodity costs and currency impacts primarily through hedging, higher pricing and manufacturing and overhead cost control. we use hedging techniques to limit the impact of fluctuations in the cost of our principal raw materials; however, we may not be able to fully hedge against commodity cost changes, and our hedging strategies may not protect us from increases in specific raw material costs. we generally also price to protect gross profit dollars. due to competitive or market conditions, planned trade or promotional incentives, or other factors, our pricing actions may lag commodity cost changes temporarily.
we expect price volatility and a slightly higher aggregate cost environment to continue in 2015. while the costs of our principal raw materials fluctuate, we believe there will continue to be an adequate supply of the raw materials we use and that they will generally remain available from numerous sources.
43
liquidity and capital resources we believe that cash from operations, our $4.5 billion revolving credit facility and our authorized long-term financing will provide sufficient liquidity for our working capital needs, planned capital expenditures, future contractual obligations, share repurchases and payment of our anticipated quarterly dividends. we expect to maintain investment grade credit ratings on our debt. we continue to utilize our commercial paper program, primarily uncommitted international credit lines and long-term debt issuances for regular funding requirements. we also use intercompany loans with our international subsidiaries to improve financial flexibility. overall, we do not expect any negative effects to our funding sources that would have a material effect on our liquidity, including the indefinite reinvestment of our earnings outside of the united states. in venezuela, we consider all undistributed earnings to be indefinitely reinvested and access to cash of $278 million in venezuela to be limited due to the uncertain economic and political environment. we do not expect this limitation to have a material adverse effect on our liquidity. refer to note 1, summary of significant accounting policies  currency translation and highly inflationary accounting, for additional information.
the cash flow activity of the kraft foods group, inc. discontinued operation, which was divested on october 1, 2012, is included within our consolidated cash flow results for periods prior to october 1, 2012.
net cash provided by operating activities:
operating activities provided net cash of $3,562 million in 2014, $6,410 million in 2013 and $3,923 million in 2012. the decrease in operating cash flows in 2014 relative to 2013 was primarily related to our receipt of $2.6 billion of net cash from the resolution of the starbucks arbitration in 2013 and higher related income taxes paid in 2014 and lower relative working capital cash improvements than in 2013, as we decreased our cash conversion cycle (a metric that measures working capital efficiency and utilizes days sales outstanding, days inventory on hand and days payables outstanding) by 10 days in 2014 as compared to a 13 day reduction in 2013. these year-over-year decreases were partially offset by lower interest payments in 2014 following the debt refinancing in the first quarter of 2014 and the fourth quarter of 2013. the increase in operating cash flows in 2013 relative to 2012 was primarily related to the receipt of the $2.6 billion from the starbucks arbitration resolution, lower spending on spin-off costs and the 2012-2014 restructuring program, lengthening of days payables outstanding, increased collection of receivables and lower interest payments.
net cash used in investing activities:
net cash used in investing activities was $1,642 million in 2014, $1,483 million in 2013 and $1,687 million in 2012. the increase in net cash used in investing activities in 2014 relates to lower cash inflows in 2014 to offset higher capital expenditures in 2014. in 2013, we received higher cash proceeds from property sales, net proceeds from divestitures and cash from kraft foods group, inc. in connection with the spin-off, partially offset by cash we paid for an acquisition in morocco. the decrease in net cash used in investing activities in 2013 relative to 2012 related to payments made to kraft foods group, inc. in 2012 in connection with the spin-off, partially offset by cash we paid for the acquisition in morocco and lower proceeds from divestitures in 2013.
capital expenditures were $1,642 million in 2014, $1,622 million in 2013 and $1,610 million in 2012. the 2014 capital expenditures were funded from operating activities and were made primarily to modernize manufacturing facilities and support new product and productivity initiatives. we expect 2015 capital expenditures to be up to $1.8 billion, including capital expenditures required for investments in systems and the 2014-2018 restructuring program. we expect to continue to fund these expenditures from operations.
net cash (used in) / provided by financing activities:
net cash used in or provided by financing activities was $2,688 million used in 2014, $6,687 million used in 2013 and $204 million provided in 2012. the decrease in net cash used in financing activities in 2014 relative to 2013 was primarily due to significantly lower long-term debt repayments and lower share repurchases in 2014, offset in part by decreased proceeds from the issuance of long-term debt and other short-term borrowings and higher dividend payments in 2014. the decrease in net cash provided by financing activities in 2013 relative to 2012 was primarily due to lower net proceeds from the issuance of long-term debt, higher re-payment of long-term debt and repurchases of common stock, partially offset by lower dividend payments reflecting our new capital structure and dividend rate following the spin-off and higher short-term borrowings.
44
debt:
from time to time we refinance long-term and short-term debt. the nature and amount of our long-term and short-term debt and the proportionate amount of each varies as a result of current and expected business requirements, market conditions and other factors. generally, in the first and second quarters of the year, our working capital requirements grow, increasing the need for short-term financing. the third and fourth quarters of the year typically generate higher cash flows. as such, we may issue commercial paper or secure other forms of financing throughout the year to meet short-term working capital needs.
in february 2014, our board of directors approved a $5 billion long-term financing authority that remains available as of december 31, 2014.
in the next 12 months, $1,513 million of long-term debt will mature as follows: $1,029 million in march 2015 and 400 million ($484 million as of december 31, 2014) in june 2015. we expect to fund these repayments with cash from operations and the issuance of commercial paper or additional debt.
our total debt was $16.7 billion at december 31, 2014 and $17.1 billion at december 31, 2013. our debt-to-capitalization ratio was 0.38 at december 31, 2014 and 0.35 at december 31, 2013. at december 31, 2014, the weighted-average term of our outstanding long-term debt was 7.7 years. our average daily commercial borrowings were $1.9 billion in 2014, $1.0 billion in 2013 and $1.0 billion in 2012. we expect to continue to comply with our long-term debt covenants. refer to note 8, debt and borrowing arrangements, for more information on our debt and debt covenants.
equity and dividends stock plans:
see note 12, stock plans, to the consolidated financial statements for more information on our stock plans, grant activity during 2014, 2013 and 2012, and stock award modifications related to the spin-off.
share repurchases:
see note 13, capital stock, to the consolidated financial statements for more information on our share repurchase and accelerated share repurchase programs.
we intend to continue to use a portion of our cash for share repurchases. under our current board of directors authorization to repurchase up to $7.7 billion of our common stock through december 31, 2016, we have repurchased $4.6 billion ($1.9 billion in 2014 and $2.7 billion in 2013) of shares, with $3.1 billion of share repurchase capacity remaining. the number of shares that we ultimately repurchase under our share repurchase program may vary depending on numerous factors, including share price and other market conditions, our ongoing capital allocation planning, levels of cash and debt balances, other demands for cash, such as acquisition activity, general economic or business conditions and board and management discretion. additionally, our share repurchase activity during any particular period may fluctuate. we may accelerate, suspend, delay or discontinue our share repurchase program at any time, without notice.
dividends:
we paid dividends of $964 million in 2014, $943 million in 2013 and $2,058 million in 2012. immediately following the spin-off of kraft foods group, inc. on october 1, 2012, our annual dividend rate changed to $0.52 per common share. on august 6, 2013, our audit committee, with authorization from our board of directors, approved an 8% increase in the quarterly dividend to $0.14 per common share or $0.56 per common share on an annual basis. on august 5, 2014, our audit committee, with authorization from our board of directors, approved a 7% increase in the quarterly dividend to $0.15 per common share or $0.60 per common share on an annual basis. the declaration of dividends is subject to the discretion of our board of directors and depends on various factors, including our net earnings, financial condition, cash requirements, future prospects and other factors that our board of directors deems relevant to its analysis and decision making.
45
off-balance sheet arrangements and aggregate contractual obligations we have no significant off-balance sheet arrangements other than the contractual obligations discussed below.
guarantees:
as discussed in note 11, commitments and contingencies, we enter into third-party guarantees primarily to cover the long-term obligations of our vendors. as part of these transactions, we guarantee that third parties will make contractual payments or achieve performance measures. at december 31, 2014, we had no material third-party guarantees recorded on our consolidated balance sheet.
in addition, at december 31, 2014, we were contingently liable for $743 million of guarantees related to our own performance. these include letters of credit and guarantees related to the payment of custom duties and taxes.
guarantees do not have, and we do not expect them to have, a material effect on our liquidity.
aggregate contractual obligations:
the following table summarizes our contractual obligations at december 31, 2014.

(2)         amounts represent the expected cash payments of our interest expense on our long-term debt. interest calculated on our euro and british pound sterling notes were forecasted using currency exchange rates as of december 31, 2014. an insignificant amount of interest expense was excluded from the table for a portion of our other non-u.s. debt obligations due to the complexities involved in forecasting expected interest payments.

(3)   operating lease payments represent the minimum rental commitments under non-cancelable operating leases.

(4)                purchase obligations for inventory and production costs (such as raw materials, indirect materials and supplies, packaging, co-manufacturing arrangements, storage and distribution) are commitments for projected needs to be utilized in the normal course of business. other purchase obligations include commitments for marketing, advertising, capital expenditures, information technology and professional services. arrangements are considered purchase obligations if a contract specifies all significant terms, including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased, a pricing structure and approximate timing of the transaction. most arrangements are cancelable without a significant penalty and with short notice
(usually 30 days). any amounts reflected on the consolidated balance sheet as accounts payable and accrued liabilities are excluded from the table above.

(5)                         other long-term liabilities include estimated future benefit payments for our postretirement health care plans through december 31, 2024 of $203 million. we are unable to reliably estimate the timing of the payments beyond 2024; as such, they are excluded from the above table. there are also another $280 million of various other long-term liabilities that are expected to be paid over the next 5 years. in addition, the following long-term liabilities included on the consolidated balance sheet are excluded from the table above: accrued pension costs, income taxes, insurance accruals and other accruals. we are unable to reliably estimate the timing of the payments (or contributions beyond 2015, in the case of accrued pension costs) for these items. we currently expect to make approximately $529 million in contributions to our pension plans in 2015. we also expect that our net pension cost will increase to approximately $321 million in 2015.
the increase is primarily due to lower discount rates offset by favorable beginning of the year asset levels and planned contributions. as of december 31, 2014, our total liability for income taxes, including uncertain tax positions and associated accrued interest and penalties, was $1,041 million. we currently estimate payments of approximately $133 million related to these positions over the next 12 months.

non-gaap financial measures we use non-gaap financial information and believe it is useful to investors as it provides additional information to facilitate comparisons of historical operating results, identify trends in our underlying operating results and provide additional transparency on how we evaluate our business. we use certain non-gaap financial measures to budget, make operating and strategic decisions and evaluate our performance. we disclose non-gaap financial measures so that you have the same financial data that we use to assist you in making comparisons to our historical operating results and analyzing our underlying performance.
our non-gaap financial measures reflect how we evaluate our current and prior-year operating results. as new events or circumstances arise, these definitions could change over time:
   organic net revenue is defined as net revenues excluding the impact of acquisitions, divestitures (including businesses under sale agreements and exits of major product lines under a sale or licensing agreement), integration program costs, accounting calendar changes and currency rate fluctuations.

                        adjusted operating income is defined as operating income excluding the impact of spin-off costs, pension costs related to obligations transferred in the spin-off, the 2012-2014 restructuring program, the
2014-2018 restructuring program, the integration program and other acquisition integration costs, the remeasurement of net monetary assets in venezuela, the benefit from the cadbury acquisition-related indemnification resolution, incremental costs associated with the jde coffee transactions, impairment charges related to goodwill and intangible assets, gains or losses on divestitures or acquisitions, acquisition-related costs and the operating results of divestitures (including businesses under sale agreements and exits of major product lines under a sale or licensing agreement). we also evaluate growth in our adjusted operating income on a constant currency basis.

                          adjusted eps is defined as diluted eps attributable to mondelēz international from continuing operations excluding the impact of spin-off costs, pension costs related to the obligations transferred in the spin-off, the 2012-2014 restructuring program, the 2014-2018 restructuring program, the integration program and other acquisition integration costs, the remeasurement of net monetary assets in venezuela, the net benefit from the cadbury acquisition-related indemnification resolution, losses on debt extinguishment and related expenses, the residual tax benefit impact from the resolution of the starbucks arbitration, hedging gains or losses and incremental costs associated with the jde coffee transactions, impairment charges related to goodwill and intangible assets, gains or losses on divestitures or acquisitions, acquisition-related costs and net earnings from divestitures (including businesses under sale agreements and exits of major product lines under a sale or licensing agreement), and including an interest expense adjustment related to the spin-off transaction. we also evaluate growth in our adjusted eps on a constant currency basis.

we believe that the presentation of these non-gaap financial measures, when considered together with our u.s. gaap financial measures and the reconciliations to the corresponding u.s. gaap financial measures, provides you with a more complete understanding of the factors and trends affecting our business than could be obtained absent these disclosures. because non-gaap financial measures may vary among other companies, the non-gaap financial measures presented in this report may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies. our use of these non-gaap financial measures is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for any u.s. gaap financial measure. a limitation of these non-gaap financial measures is they exclude items detailed below that have an impact on our u.s. gaap reported results. the best way this limitation can be addressed is by evaluating our non-gaap financial measures in combination with our u.s. gaap reported results and carefully evaluating the following tables that reconcile u.s. gaap reported figures to the non-gaap financial measures in this form 10-k.

organic net revenue applying the definition of organic net revenue, the adjustments made to net revenues (the most comparable u.s. gaap financial measure) were to exclude the impact of currency, divestitures, an accounting calendar change in 2013 and acquisitions. we believe that organic net revenue better reflects the underlying growth from the ongoing activities of our business and provides improved comparability of results.

item 1a. risk factors statements in this annual report on form 10-k, and elsewhere, that are forward-looking involve risks and uncertainties which may affect the companys actual results of operations. certain of these risks and uncertainties which have affected and, in the future, could affect the companys actual results are discussed below. the company undertakes no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements made due to new information or future events. investors are cautioned not to place undue emphasis on these statements.
the following risk factors should be read carefully in connection with evaluation of the companys business and any forward-looking statements made in this annual report on form 10-k and elsewhere. any of the following risks or others discussed in this annual report on form 10-k or the companys other sec filings could materially adversely affect the companys business, operating results and financial condition.
changes in economic conditions could negatively impact the companys revenues and earnings.
the companys biotechnology products are sold primarily to research scientists at pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies and at university and government research institutions. research and development spending by the companys customers and the availability of government research funding can fluctuate due to changes in available resources, mergers of pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, spending priorities, general economic conditions and institutional and governmental budgetary policies. the u.s. and global economies have experienced a period of economic downturn. such downturns, and other reductions or delays in governmental funding, could cause customers to delay or forego purchases of the companys products. the company carries essentially no backlog of orders and changes in the level of orders received and filled daily can cause fluctuations in quarterly revenues and earnings.
the biotechnology and clinical control industries are very competitive, more so recently due to consolidation trends.
the company faces significant competition across all of its product lines and in each market in which it operates. competitors include companies ranging from start-up companies, which may be able to more quickly respond to customers needs, to large multinational companies, which may have greater financial, marketing, operational, and research and development resources than the company. in addition, consolidation trends in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries have served to create fewer customer accounts and to concentrate purchasing decisions for some customers, resulting in increased pricing pressure on the company. moreover, customers may believe that consolidated businesses are better able to compete as sole source vendors, and therefore prefer to purchase from such businesses. the entry into the market by manufacturers in china and other low-cost manufacturing locations is also creating increased pricing and competitive pressures, particularly in developing markets. failure to anticipate and respond to competitors actions may impact the companys future sales and earnings.
the companys future growth is dependent on the development of new products in a rapidly changing technological environment.
one element of the companys growth strategy is to increase revenues through new product releases. as a result, the company must anticipate industry trends and develop products in advance of customer needs. new product development requires planning, designing and testing at both technological and manufacturing-process levels and may require significant research and development expenditures. there can be no assurance that any products now in development, or that the company may seek to develop in the future, will achieve feasibility or gain market acceptance. there can also be no assurance that the companys competitors will not succeed in developing technologies and products in a more timely and cost effective manner than the company. if the company does not appropriately innovate and invest in new technologies, the companys technologies will become outdated, rendering the companys technologies and products obsolete or noncompetitive. to the extent the company fails to introduce new and innovative products, the company may lose market share to its competitors, which may be difficult or impossible to regain.
10
acquisitions and divestures pose financial, management and other risks and challenges.
the company routinely explores acquiring other businesses and assets. from time to time, the company may also consider disposing of certain assets, subsidiaries, or lines of business. in early fiscal 2014, the company finalized the acquisition of bionostics. in the last quarter of fiscal 2014, the company acquired primegene and announced its investment in cyvek and its intention to acquire the remaining shares of cyvek in the event certain milestones were met. subsequent to the close of fiscal 2014, the company also acquired novus and proteinsimple. acquisitions or divestitures present financial, managerial and operational challenges, including diversion of management attention, difficulty with integrating acquired businesses, integration of different corporate cultures or separating personnel and financial and other systems, increased expenses, assumption of unknown liabilities, indemnities, and potential disputes with the buyers or sellers, and the need to evaluate the financial systems of and establish internal controls for acquired entities. there can be no assurance that the company will engage in any acquisitions or divestitures or that the company will be able to do so on terms that will result in any expected benefits. in addition, acquisitions financed with borrowings could make the company more vulnerable to business downturns and could negatively affect the companys earnings due to higher leverage and interest expense.
the company is subject to risk associated with global operations.
the company engages in business globally, with approximately 47% of the companys sales revenue in fiscal 2014 coming from outside the u.s. this subjects the company to a number of risks, including international economic, political, and labor conditions; tax laws (including u.s. taxes on foreign subsidiaries); increased financial accounting and reporting burdens and complexities; unexpected changes in, or impositions of, legislative or regulatory requirements; failure of laws to protect intellectual property rights adequately; inadequate local infrastructure and difficulties in managing and staffing international operations; delays resulting from difficulty in obtaining export licenses for certain technology; tariffs, quotas and other trade barriers and restrictions; transportation delays; operating in locations with a higher incidence of corruption and fraudulent business practices; and other factors beyond the companys control, including terrorism, war, natural disasters, climate change and diseases.
the application of laws and regulations implicating global transactions is often unclear and may at times conflict. compliance with these laws and regulations may involve significant costs or require changes in the companys business practices that result in reduced revenue and profitability. non-compliance could also result in fines, damages, criminal sanctions, prohibitions business conduct, and damage to the companys reputation. the company incurs additional legal compliance costs associated with its global operations and could become subject to legal penalties in foreign countries if it does not comply with local laws and regulations, which may be substantially different from those in the u.s.
the company conducts and plans to grow its business in developing markets.
the companys efforts to grow its businesses depends, to a degree, on its success in developing market share in additional geographic markets including, but not limited to, china. in some cases, these countries have greater political and economic volatility and greater vulnerability to infrastructure and labor disruptions than the companys other markets. operating and seeking to expand business in a number of different regions and countries exposes the company to multiple and potentially conflicting cultural practices, business practices and legal and regulatory requirements.
in many foreign countries, particularly in those with developing economies, it may be common to engage in business practices that are prohibited by u.s. regulations applicable to the company, such as the foreign corrupt practices act. although the company implements policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with these laws, there can be no assurance that all of the companys employees, contractors, and agents, as well as those companies to which the company outsources certain aspects of its business operations, including those based in foreign countries where practices which violate such u.s. laws may be customary, will comply with the companys internal policies. any such non-compliance, even if prohibited by the companys internal policies, could have an adverse effect on the companys business and result in significant fines or penalties.
11
the company is significantly dependent on sales made through foreign subsidiaries which are subject to changes in exchange rates and changes to the strength of foreign governments and economic conditions.
approximately 30% of the companys net sales in fiscal 2014 were made through its foreign subsidiaries, which transact their sales in foreign currencies. any adverse movement in foreign currency exchange rates could, therefore, negatively affect the companys revenues and earnings. moreover, the financial crisis faced by several eurozone countries, and the ongoing economic instability in that region, may lead to reduced spending on health care and research by eurozone governments, which could adversely affect the companys european sales, as well as its revenues, financial condition and results of operations.
the company may incur losses as a result of its investments in chemocentryx, inc., cyvek, inc. and other companies in which is does not have a majority interest, the success of which is largely out of the companys control.
the companys expansion strategies include collaborations and investments in joint ventures and companies developing new products related to the companys business. these strategies carry risks that objectives will not be achieved and future earnings will be adversely affected.
the company has an approximate 14% equity investment in chemocentryx, inc. (ccxi) that is valued at $37.1 million on the companys june 30, 2014 consolidated balance sheet. ccxi is a biopharmaceutical company focused on discovering, developing and commercializing orally-administered therapeutics to treat autoimmune diseases, inflammatory diseases and cancers. the development of new drugs is a highly risky undertaking. ccxi is dependent on a limited number of products, must achieve favorable clinical trial results, obtain regulatory and marketing approval for these products and is reliant on a strategic alliance with glaxosmithkline. ccxi has also incurred significant losses and has yet to achieve profitability.
the ownership of ccxi shares is very concentrated, the share price is highly volatile and there is limited trading of the shares. these factors make it possible that the company could experience future dilution or a decline in the $7.6 million unrealized gain it has on its ccxi investment and/or its original $29.5 million investment in ccxi. at august 22, 2014, the market value of the companys investment in ccxi was $30.9 million.
on april 1, 2014, the company invested $10 million in cyvek, inc. in exchange for shares of cyveks common stock representing approximately 19.9% of the outstanding voting stock of cyvek. in connection with this investment, the company also became a party to cyveks existing investor agreements and has an observer seat on cyveks board of directors. cyvek is an instrument company that has developed a microfluidics instrument platform and related reagents for performing immunoassays and other assays for the research market. cyvek has incurred significant losses and has not yet achieved profitability. there is no assurance that the companys investment in cyvek will bring sufficient returns, and may in fact result in losses.
the companys success will be dependent on recruiting and retaining highly qualified personnel.
recruiting and retaining qualified scientific, production and management personnel are critical to the companys success. the companys anticipated growth and its expected expansion into areas and activities requiring additional expertise will require the addition of new personnel and the development of additional expertise by existing personnel. the failure to attract and retain such personnel could adversely affect the companys business.
the company is dependent on maintaining its intellectual property rights.
the companys success depends in part on its ability to protect and maintain its intellectual property, including trade secrets. the company attempts to protect trade secrets in part through confidentiality agreements, but those agreements can be breached, and if they are, there may not be an adequate remedy. if trade secrets become publicly known, the company could lose its competitive position.
12
in addition, the companys success depends in part on its ability to operate without infringing the proprietary rights of others, and to obtain licenses where necessary or appropriate. the company has obtained and continues to negotiate licenses to produce a number of products claimed to be owned by others. since the company has not conducted a patent infringement study for each of its products, it is possible that products of the company may unintentionally infringe patents of third parties.
the company has been and may in the future be sued by third parties alleging that the company is infringing their intellectual property rights. these lawsuits are expensive, take significant time, and divert managements focus from other business concerns. if the company is found to be infringing the intellectual property of others, it could be required to cease certain activities, alter its products or processes or pay licensing fees. this would cause unexpected costs and delays which may have a material adverse effect on the company. if the company is unable to obtain a required license on acceptable terms, or unable to design around any third party patent, it may be unable to sell some of its products and services, which could result in reduced revenue. in addition, if the company does not prevail, a court may find damages or award other remedies in favor of the opposing party in any of these suits, which may adversely affect the companys earnings.
the company has entered into and drawn on a revolving credit facility. the burden of this additional debt could adversely affect the company, make it more vulnerable to adverse economic or industry conditions, and prevent it from funding its expansion strategy.
in connection with the acquisition of proteinsimple in july 2014, the company entered into a revolving credit facility, governed by a credit agreement dated july 28, 2014. the credit agreement provides for a revolving credit facility of $150 million, which can be increased by an additional $150 million subject to certain conditions. borrowings under the credit agreement bear interest at a variable rate. as of july 31, 2014, the company had drawn $125 million under the credit agreement.
the terms of the credit agreement and the burden of the indebtedness incurred thereunder could have negative consequences for us, such as:
   limiting our ability to obtain additional financing to fund our working capital, capital expenditures, debt service requirements, expansion strategy, or other needs;

   increasing the companys vulnerability to, and reducing its flexibility in planning for, adverse changes in economic, industry and competitive conditions; and

   increasing the companys vulnerability to increases in interest rates.

the credit agreement also contains negative covenants that limit our ability to engage in specified types of transactions. these covenants limit our ability to, among other things, sell, lease or transfer any properties or assets, with certain exceptions; and enter into certain merger, consolidation or other reorganization transactions, with certain exceptions.
a breach of any of these covenants could result in an event of default under our credit facility. upon the occurrence of an event of default, the lender could elect to declare all amounts outstanding under such facility to be immediately due and payable and terminate all commitments to extend further credit. in addition, the company would be subject to additional restrictions if an event of default exists under the credit agreement, such as a prohibition on the payment of cash dividends.
13
the companys business is subject to governmental laws and regulations.
the companys operations are subject to regulation by various us federal, state and international agencies. laws and regulations enacted and enforced by these agencies impact all aspects of the companys operations including design, development, manufacturing, labeling, selling and the importing and exporting of products across international borders. any changes to laws and regulations governing such activities could have an effect on the companys operations and ability to obtain regulatory clearance or approval of the companys products. if the company fails to comply with any of these regulations, it may become subject to fines, penalties or actions that could impact development, manufacturing and distribution and/or increase costs or reduce sales. the approval process applicable to clinical control products of the type that may be developed by the company may take a year or more. delays in obtaining approvals could adversely affect the marketing of new products developed by the company, and negatively affect the companys revenues.
as a multinational corporation, the company is subject to the tax laws and regulations of u.s. federal, state and local governments and of several international jurisdictions. from time to time, new tax legislation may be implemented which could adversely affect current or future tax filings or negatively impact the companys effective tax rate and thus increase future tax payments.
the company relies heavily on internal manufacturing and related operations to produce, package and distribute its products.
the company manufactures the majority of the products it sells at its minneapolis, minnesota facility. quality control, packaging and distribution operations support all of the companys sales. since the company creates value for its customers through the development of high-quality products, any significant decline in quality or disruption of operations for any reason, particularly at the minneapolis facility, could adversely affect sales and customer relationships, and therefore adversely affect the business. while the company has taken certain steps to manage these operational risks, and while insurance coverage may reimburse, in whole or in part, for losses related to such disruptions, the companys future sales growth and earnings may be adversely affected by perceived disruption risks or actual disruptions.
the design and manufacture of products involves certain inherent risks. manufacturing or design defects could lead to recalls, litigation or alerts relating to the companys products. a recall could result in significant costs and damage to the companys reputation which could reduce demand, particularly for certain of its regulated products.
disruptions in the supply and cost of raw materials could reduce the companys earnings, cash flow, and ability to meet customers needs.
the companys products are made from a wide variety of raw materials that are generally available from alternate sources of supply. however, some of the companys products are available only from a single supplier. if such suppliers were to limit or terminate production or otherwise fail to supply these materials for any reason, such failures could have a material adverse impact on the companys product sales and business. in addition, price increases for raw materials could adversely affect the companys earnings and cash flow.
increased exposure to product liability claims could adversely affect the companys earnings.
product liability is a major risk in testing and marketing biotechnology and pharmaceutical products offered by the companys customers. currently these risks are primarily borne by the companys customers. as the companys products and services are further integrated into customers production processes, the company may become increasingly exposed to product liability and other claims in the event that the use of its products or services is alleged to have resulted in adverse effects. there can be no assurance that a future product liability claim or series of claims brought against the company would not have an adverse effect on the companys business or the results of operations. the companys business may be materially and adversely affected by a successful product liability claim or claims in excess of any insurance coverage that it may have. in addition, product liability claims, regardless of their merits, could be costly, divert managements attention, and adversely affect the companys reputation and demand for its products.
14
any such product liability claims brought against the company could be significant and any adverse determination may result in liabilities in excess of the companys insurance coverage. although the company carries product liability insurance, it cannot be certain that current insurance will be sufficient to cover these claims or that it can be maintained on acceptable terms, if at all.
cyber security risks and the failure to maintain the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the companys computer hardware, software, and internet applications and related tools and functions could result in damage to the companys reputation and/or subject the company to costs, fines, or lawsuits.
the integrity and protection of the companys own data, and that of its customers and employees, is critical to the companys business. the regulatory environment governing information, security and privacy laws is increasingly demanding and continues to evolve. maintaining compliance with applicable security and privacy regulations may increase the companys operating costs and/or adversely impact the companys ability to market its products and services to customers. although the companys computer and communications hardware is protected through physical and software safeguards, it is still vulnerable to fire, storm, flood, power loss, earthquakes, telecommunications failures, physical or software break-ins, software viruses, and similar events. these events could lead to the unauthorized access, disclosure and use of non-public information. the techniques used by criminal elements to attack computer systems are sophisticated, change frequently and may originate from less regulated and remote areas of the world. as a result, the company may not be able to address these techniques proactively or implement adequate preventative measures. if the companys computer systems are compromised, it could be subject to fines, damages, litigation, and enforcement actions, customers could curtail or cease using its applications, and the company could lose trade secrets, the occurrence of which could harm its business.
item 7. managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations forward-looking information this report contains forward-looking statements, which are based on the companys current assumptions and expectations. the principal forward-looking statements in this report include: the companys expectations regarding product releases and strategy, acquisition activity, governmental license renewals, capital expenditures, the performance of the companys investments, future dividend declarations, the construction and lease of certain facilities, the adequacy of owned and leased property for future operations, anticipated financial results and sufficiency of capital resources to meet the companys foreseeable future cash and working capital requirements.
all such forward-looking statements are intended to enjoy the protection of the safe harbor for forward-looking statements contained in the private securities litigation reform act of 1995, as amended. although the company believes there is a reasonable basis for the forward-looking statements, the companys actual results could be materially different. the most important factors which could cause the companys actual results to differ from forward-looking statements are set forth in the companys description of risk factors in item 1a to this annual report on form 10-k.
forward-looking statements speak only as of the date they are made, and the company does not undertake any obligation to update any forward-looking statements.
use of adjusted financial measures the adjusted financial measures used in this annual report on form 10-k quantify the impact the following events had on reported net sales, gross margin percentages and net earnings for fiscal 2014 as compared to fiscal 2013 and 2012:
   fluctuations in exchange rates used to convert transactions in foreign currencies (primarily the euro, british pound sterling and chinese yuan) to u.s.
dollars;

   the acquisition of bionostics holdings, ltd. (bionostics) on july 22, 2013 and shanghai primegene bio-tech co. (primegene) on april 30, 2014, including the impact of amortizing intangible assets and the recognition of costs upon the sale of inventory written-up to fair value;

   professional fees and other costs incurred as part of the acquisition of bionostics and primegene in fiscal 2014, the acquisitions of novus biologicals llc (novus) and proteinsimple, which closed in july 2014, and on-going acquisition activity;

   income tax adjustments related to the reinstatement of the u.s. credit for research and development expenditures in fiscal 2013, the expiration of the credit on december 31, 2013, and the reversal of valuation allowances on deferred tax assets in fiscal 2012; and

   impairment losses related to the companys investments in unconsolidated entities.

these adjusted financial measures are not prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (gaap) and may be different from adjusted financial measures used by other companies. adjusted financial measures should not be considered as a substitute for, or superior to, measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with gaap. the company views these adjusted financial measures to be helpful in assessing the companys ongoing operating results. in addition, these adjusted financial measures facilitate our internal comparisons to historical operating results and comparisons to competitors operating results. these adjusted financial measures are included in this annual report on form 10-k because the company believes they are useful to investors in allowing for greater transparency related to supplemental information used in the companys financial and operational analysis. investors are encouraged to review the reconciliations of adjusted financial measures used in this annual report on form 10-k to their most directly comparable gaap financial measures.

overall results for fiscal 2014, consolidated net sales increased 15% as compared to fiscal 2013. after adjusting for the impact of the bionostics and primegene acquisitions in fiscal 2014, as well as foreign currency fluctuations, organic sales for the year increased 3%. the growth was broad-based, with the company achieving organic growth in both reporting segments and in most regions of the world. commercial investments made globally in fiscal 2014, especially in china, were the biggest contributing factor impacting organic revenue growth.
consolidated gaap net earnings decreased 1% for fiscal 2014 as compared to fiscal 2013. after adjusting for acquisition related costs and certain income tax items in both years, adjusted net earnings increased 6% in fiscal 2014 as compared to fiscal 2013. adjusted earnings growth was driven by increased sales partially offset by a lower margin mix from the acquired bionostics business, as well as investments made in commercial operations and administrative infrastructure during fiscal 2014.
for fiscal 2013, consolidated net sales decreased 1% as compared to fiscal 2012. there were no acquisitions made in fiscal 2013 or fiscal 2012 and the impact from foreign currency fluctuation was minimal. the u.s. market in the biotechnology segment was particularly soft in 2013, with lower national institute of health (nih) funding for our academic customers coupled with industry consolidation in the pharma and biotech markets.
consolidated gaap net earnings were flat for fiscal 2013 as compared to fiscal 2012. after adjusting for acquisition related costs and certain income tax and impairment items in both years, adjusted net earnings decreased 3% in fiscal 2013 as compared to fiscal 2012. the lower earnings in fiscal 2013 resulted from lower revenue coupled with a 5% increase in research and development investment and a 4% increase in selling, general and administrative costs primarily related to investments made in global commercial resources, administrative infrastructure, and annual wage, salary and benefits increases.

$357,763                $310,575                $314,560
in fiscal 2014, biotechnology segment net sales increased 4% from the prior fiscal year. included in fiscal 2014 biotechnology segment net sales was $0.7 million from the acquisition of primegene in april 2014 and the positive impact of foreign currency fluctuations of $3.5 million. excluding these amounts, organic net sales for the segment increased 3% in fiscal 2014, driven by the commercial investments made in china, solid execution from our pacific rim distributors, and a robust pharma and biotech market in the u.s. u.s. academic customers still suffered from decreases in nih funding, but sales to these customers stabilized sequentially throughout fiscal 2014. included in fiscal 2014 net sales were $3.4 million of sales of new biotechnology products released during the fiscal year.
in fiscal 2013, biotechnology segment net sales decreased 2% from the prior fiscal year. biotechnology segment organic net sales, excluding the negative impact of foreign currency fluctuations of $2.6 million, decreased 1% in fiscal 2013, primarily as a result of lower nih funding and pharma consolidation in the u.s. included in fiscal 2013 net sales were $2.8 million of sales of new biotechnology products during the fiscal year.
clinical controls segment net sales increased $34.8 million in fiscal 2014. included in clinical controls segment net sales was $33.1 million from the acquisition of bionostics in july 2013. clinical controls segment organic net sales increased 7% and 5%, respectively, in fiscal 2014 and 2013 from each of the prior fiscal years, primarily as a result of strong end-market demand and operational execution.
gross margins consolidated gross margins were 70%, 74% and 75% in fiscal 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. gaap reported consolidated gross margins were negatively impacted as a result of purchase accounting related to inventory and intangible assets acquired during fiscal 2014 and prior years. under purchase accounting, inventory is valued at fair value less expected selling and marketing costs, resulting in reduced margins in future periods as the inventory is sold. excluding the impact of acquired inventory sold and amortization of intangibles, adjusted gross margins were 74%, 77% and 78% in fiscal 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively.

a reconciliation of the reported consolidated gross margin percentages, adjusted for acquired inventory sold and intangible amortization included in cost of sales, is as follows:
year ended june 30,
2014              2013              2012
consolidated gross margin percentage                      70.3   %          74.4   %          75.0   %
identified adjustments:
costs recognized upon sale of acquired inventory           2.1   %           1.4   %           2.4   %
amortization of intangibles                                1.1   %           1.0   %           1.0   %
adjusted gross margin percentage                          73.5   %          76.8   %          78.4   %
fluctuations in adjusted gross margins, as a percentage of net sales, have primarily resulted from changes in foreign currency exchange rates and changes in product mix. in fiscal 2014, the biggest impact to gross margin, as compared to fiscal 2013, was the change in product mix associated with the acquisition of bionostics. we expect that, in the future, gross margins will continue to be impacted by future acquisitions as well as by the introduction and growth of lower-priced brands that will differentiate from our current premium brands, and allow the company to better compete in more price-sensitive markets.
segment gross margins, as a percentage of net sales, were as follows:
year ended june 30,
2014              2013              2012
biotechnology              76.3   %          76.4   %          76.9   %
clinical controls          38.5   %          49.0   %          48.6   %

interest income interest income for fiscal 2014, 2013 and 2012 was $2.7 million, $2.6 million and $2.6 million, respectively. interest income in fiscal 2014 remained flat from fiscal 2013 as a result of lower cash balances during the fiscal year as a result of the acquisition of bionostics in the first quarter of fiscal 2014. interest income in fiscal 2013 remained flat from fiscal 2012 as a result of increased cash balances offset by lower interest rates.
as discussed further in liquidity and capital resources below, with the opening of a debt facility in july 2014 to partially fund the acquisition of proteinsimple, the company expects to incur net interest expense as opposed to net interest income in fiscal 2015.

income taxes income taxes for fiscal 2014, 2013 and 2012 were provided at rates of 31.3%, 29.9% and 30.7%, respectively, of consolidated earnings before income taxes. in january 2013, the u.s. federal credit for research and development was reinstated for the period of january 2012 through december 2013. as a result, fiscal 2014 included a credit of $0.5 million for the period of july 2013 through december 2013, while fiscal 2013 included a credit of $1.4 million for the period of january 2012 to june 2013.
included in income taxes in fiscal 2012 was a $3.0 million benefit due to the reversal of a deferred tax valuation allowance on the excess tax basis in the companys investments in unconsolidated entities. the company determined such valuation allowance was no longer necessary and included the benefit in fiscal 2012 income taxes. in addition, the fiscal 2012 consolidated tax rate was negatively impacted by the expiration of the u.s. research and development credit on december 31, 2011.
23
u.s. federal taxes have been reduced by the manufacturers deduction provided for under the american jobs creation act of 2004 and the u.s. federal credit for research and development. foreign income taxes have been provided at rates which approximate the tax rates in the countries in which the company has operations.

liquidity and capital resources cash, cash equivalents and available-for-sale investments at june 30, 2014 were $367 million compared to $465 million at june 30, 2013. included in available-for-sale investments at june 30, 2014 and 2013 was the fair value of the companys investment in ccxi of $37.1 million and $89.6 million, respectively.
at june 30, 2014, approximately 76%, 21%, and 3% of the companys cash and equivalent account balances of $319 million were located in the u.s., u.k. and china, respectively. at june 30, 2014, approximately 84% of the companys available-for-sale investment accounts are located in the u.s., with the remaining 16% in china.
the company has either paid u.s. taxes on its undistributed foreign earnings or intends to indefinitely reinvest the undistributed earnings in the foreign operations. management of the company expects to be able to meet its cash and working capital requirements for operations, facility expansion, capital additions, and cash dividends for the foreseeable future, and at least the next 12 months, through currently available funds and cash generated from operations.
subsequent to june 30, 2014, the company acquired novus for approximately $60.0 million and proteinsimple for approximately $300 million. the novus acquisition was financed through cash on hand. the purchase of proteinsimple was financed through cash on hand and a $150 million revolving line of credit facility that was opened in july 2014, of which $125 million was initially drawn to fund the acquisition. this senior unsecured revolving credit facility has a term of five years with an adjustable interest rate equal to the greater of (i) the prime commercial rate, (ii) the per annum federal funds rate plus 0.5%, or (iii) libor + 1.00%  1.75% depending on the existing total leverage ratio of debt to ebitda (as defined in the credit agreement governing the revolving credit facility). the financial covenants of the revolving credit facility require the company to maintain a minimum interest coverage ratio, defined as the ratio of ebit to cash interest expense, of 4.0x and a maximum total leverage ratio of 3.5x. the annualized fee for any unused portion of the credit facility is 15 basis points.
future acquisition strategies may or may not require additional borrowings under the line of credit facility or other outside sources of funding.
24
cash flows from operating activities the company generated cash from operations of $137 million, $124 million and $127 million in fiscal 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. the increase in cash generated from operating activities in fiscal 2014 as compared to fiscal 2013 was mainly the result of increase in net earnings after adjustment for non-cash expenses related to depreciation, amortization, costs recognized on sale of acquired inventory, and stock option expense. operating cash flow also benefitted from the timing of certain trade receivable cash receipts, trade payable cash disbursements, and income tax payments. the decrease in cash generated from operating activities in fiscal 2013 as compared to fiscal 2012 was mainly the result of decrease in net earnings and changes in working capital.
cash flows from investing activities on july 22, 2013, the company acquired for cash all of the outstanding shares of bionostics for a net purchase price of approximately $103 million. the acquisition was financed through cash and cash equivalents on hand. on april 30, 2014, the company acquired all of the ownership interest of primegene for a net purchase price of approximately $18.8 million. the company paid approximately $6.0 million at closing, with the remaining purchase price payable over fiscal years 2015 to 2017. the acquisition cash payment was financed through cash and cash equivalents on hand and sale of certain short-term available-for-sale investments.
on april 1, 2014, the company entered into an agreement of investment and merger (the agreement) with cyvek. pursuant to the terms of the agreement, the company invested $10.0 million in cyvek and received shares of common stock representing approximately 19.9% of the outstanding voting stock of cyvek. the investment was financed through cash and cash equivalents on hand.
if, within twelve months of the date of the agreement, cyvek meets commercial milestones related to the sale of its products and certain other conditions, the company will acquire cyvek through a merger, with cyvek surviving as a wholly-owned subsidiary of the company. if the merger is consummated, the company will make an initial payment of $60.0 million to the other stockholders of cyvek. the purchase price payable at the closing of the merger may be adjusted based on the final levels of cash, indebtedness and transaction expenses of cyvek as of the closing. the company will also pay cyveks other stockholders up to $35.0 million based on the revenue generated by cyveks products and related products before the date that is 30 months from the closing of the merger. the company will also pay cyveks other stockholders 50% of the amount, if any, by which the revenue from cyveks products and related products exceeds $100 million in calendar year 2020.
the companys net purchases (sales) of available-for-sale investments in fiscal 2014, 2013 and 2012 were ($184) million, $9.1 million and $15.3 million, respectively. most of the companys available-for-sale investments in the u.s. (other than its investment in ccxi) were liquidated by fiscal 2014 year-end to prepare for the july purchase of novus and proteinsimple. the companys investment policy is to place excess cash in municipal and corporate bonds with the objective of obtaining the highest possible return while minimizing risk and keeping the funds accessible. in fiscal 2015, this policy will be more applicable in non-u.s. jurisdictions as the company intends to use excess cash from u.s. operation primarily to minimize the outstanding balance on the companys revolving credit facility.

50% of the amount, if any, by which revenues of cyveks products and related products exceeds $100 million in calendar year 2020.

off-balance sheet arrangements the company is not a party to any off-balance sheet transactions, arrangements or obligations that have, or are reasonably likely to have, a current or future material effect on the companys financial condition, changes in the financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources.
critical accounting policies managements discussion and analysis of the companys financial condition and results of operations are based upon the companys consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america (u.s. gaap). the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. on an ongoing basis, management evaluates its estimates. management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.
26
the company has identified the policies outlined below as critical to its business operations and an understanding of results of operations. the listing is not intended to be a comprehensive list of all accounting policies; investors should also refer to note a to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this annual report on form 10-k .
valuation of available-for-sale investments the company considers all of its marketable securities available-for-sale and reports them at fair market value. fair market values are based on assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability in the principal or most advantageous market. unrealized gains and losses on available-for-sale investments are excluded from income, but are included, net of taxes, in other comprehensive income. if an other-than-temporary impairment is determined to exist, the difference between the value of the investment recorded in the financial statements and the companys current estimate of fair value is recognized as a charge to earnings in the period in which the impairment is determined. net unrealized gains on available-for-sale investments at june 30, 2014 were $7.6 million.
valuation of inventory inventories are stated at the lower of cost (first-in, first-out method) or market. the company regularly reviews inventory on hand for slow-moving and obsolete inventory, inventory not meeting quality control standards and inventory subject to expiration.
to meet strict customer quality standards, the company has established a highly controlled manufacturing process for proteins, antibodies and its chemically-based products. these products require the initial manufacture of multiple batches to determine if quality standards can be consistently met. in addition, the company will produce larger batches of established products than current sales requirements due to economies of scale. the manufacturing process for these products, therefore, has and will continue to produce quantities in excess of forecasted usage. the company values its manufactured protein and antibody inventory based on a two-year forecast and its chemically-based products on a five-year forecast. the establishment of a two-year or five-year forecast requires considerable judgment. inventory quantities in excess of the forecast are not valued due to uncertainty over salability. the value of protein, antibody and chemically-based product inventory not valued at june 30, 2014 was $30.3 million.
the fair value of inventory purchased through acquisitions were determined based on quantities acquired, selling prices at the date of acquisition and managements assumptions regarding inventory having future value and the costs to sell such inventories. inventory purchased in fiscal 2014 through the acquisition of bionostics was increased $1.7 million to $5.7 million. substantially all of bionostics acquired inventory was sold as of june 30, 2014. inventory purchased in fiscal 2014 through the acquisition of primegene was increased $0.8 million to $1.0 million. the increase in value of the primegene inventory remaining at june 30, 2104 was $0.6 million.
the value of inventory purchased in fiscal 2011 through acquisitions was increased $25.7 million for a total acquired inventory value of $33.0 million. in addition, the company acquired inventory that was not valued as part of the purchase price allocation as it was in excess of forecasted usage. the increase in value of the fiscal 2011 acquired inventory remaining at june 30, 2014 was $7.6 million.
valuation of intangible assets and goodwill when a business is acquired, the purchase price is allocated, as applicable, between tangible assets, identifiable intangible assets and goodwill. determining the portion of the purchase price allocated to intangible assets requires significant estimates. the fair value of intangible assets acquired, including developed technologies, trade names, customer relationships and non-compete agreements, were based on managements forecasted cash inflows and outflows using a relief-from-royalty and multi-period excess earnings method with consideration to other factors including an independent valuation of managements assumptions. intangible assets are being amortized over their estimated useful lives, ranging from 3 to 15 years. the company reviews the carrying amount of intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. intangible assets, net of accumulated amortization, were $109 million at june 30, 2014.
27
goodwill recognized in connection with a business acquisition represents the excess of the aggregate purchase price over the fair value of net assets acquired. goodwill is tested for impairment annually or more frequently if changes in circumstance or the occurrence of events suggest impairment exists. assessing the impairment of goodwill requires the company to make judgments regarding the fair value of the net assets of its reporting units and the allocation of the carrying amount of shared assets to the reporting units. the companys annual assessment included a qualitative assessment of whether it is more-likely-than-not that a reporting units fair value is less than its carrying value. a significant change in the companys market capitalization or in the carrying amount of net assets of a reporting unit could result in an impairment charge in future periods. the company completed its annual impairment testing of goodwill and concluded that no impairment existed as of june 30, 2014, as the fair values of the companys reporting units exceeded their carrying values. goodwill at june 30, 2014 was $151 million.
valuation of investments the company has made equity investments in several start-up and early development stage companies, including cyvek in fiscal 2014. the accounting treatment of each investment (cost method or equity method) is dependent upon a number of factors, including, but not limited to, the companys share in the equity of the investee and the companys ability to exercise significant influence over the operating and financial policies of the investee. in determining which accounting treatment to apply, the company must make judgments based upon the quantitative and qualitative aspects of the investment.
the company periodically assesses its equity investments for impairment. development stage companies of the type the company has invested in are dependent on their ability to raise additional funds to continue research and development efforts and on receiving patent protection and/or fda clearance to market their products. if such funding were unavailable or inadequate to fund operations or if patent protection or fda clearance were not received, the company would potentially recognize an impairment loss to the extent of its remaining net investment.

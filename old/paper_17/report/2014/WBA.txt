we are exposed to interest rate volatility with regard to future issuances of fixed-rate debt, and existing and future issuances of floating-rate debt. primary exposures include u.s. treasury rates, libor, and commercial paper rates. from time to time, we use interest rate swaps and forward-starting interest rate swaps to hedge our exposure to interest rate changes, to reduce the volatility of our financing costs and, based on current and projected market conditions, achieve a desired proportion of fixed versus floating-rate debt. generally under these swaps, we agree with a counterparty to exchange the difference between fixed-rate and floating-rate interest amounts based on an agreed upon notional principal amount.  in september 2014, we entered into an additional forward-starting interest rate swap for a $250 million notional amount.
information regarding our interest rate swap transactions is set forth in note 10 to our consolidated financial statements in part ii, item 8 of this form 10-k.  these financial instruments are sensitive to changes in interest rates.  on august 31, 2014, we had $1.0 billion in long-term debt obligations that had floating interest rates.  a one percentage point increase or decrease in interest rates would increase or decrease the annual interest expense we recognize and the cash we pay for interest expense by approximately $10 million.
in connection with our purchase and option agreement with alliance boots and the transactions contemplated thereby, our exposure to foreign currency risks, primarily with respect to the british pound sterling, and to a lesser extent the euro and certain other foreign currencies, is expected to increase.  we are exposed to the translation of foreign currency earnings to the u.s. dollar as a result of our 45% interest in alliance boots, which we account for using the equity method of accounting on a three-month lag.  this exposure will further increase if the second step transaction is completed.  foreign currency forward contracts and other derivative instruments may be used from time to time in some instances to hedge in full or in part certain risks relating to foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities, intercompany transactions, and in connection with acquisitions, joint ventures or investments outside the united states.  as of august 31, 2014 and august 31, 2013, we did not have any outstanding foreign exchange derivative instruments.
changes in amerisourcebergen common stock price and equity volatility may have a significant impact on the value of the warrants to acquire amerisourcebergen common stock described in note 10 to our consolidated financial statements in part ii, item 8 of this form 10-k.  as of august 31, 2014, a one dollar change in amerisourcebergen's common stock would, holding other factors constant, increase or decrease the fair value of the company's warrants by $22 million and a one percent change in amerisourcebergen's equity volatility would, holding other factors constant, increase or decrease the fair value of the company's warrants by $2 million.   additionally, the company holds an investment in amerisourcebergen common stock.  as of august 31, 2014, a one dollar change in amerisourcebergen's common stock would increase or decrease the fair value of the company's investment by $12
million.

inventories inventories are valued on a lower of last-in, first-out (lifo) cost or market basis.  at august 31, 2014 and 2013, inventories would have been greater by $2.3 billion and $2.1 billion, respectively, if they had been valued on a lower of first-in, first-out (fifo) cost or market basis.  as a result of declining inventory levels, the fiscal
2014, 2013 and 2012 lifo provisions were reduced by lifo liquidations of $187 million, $194 million and $268
million, respectively.  inventory includes product costs, inbound freight, warehousing costs and vendor allowances not classified as a reduction of advertising expense.
equity method investments the company uses the equity method to account for investments in companies if the investment provides the ability to exercise significant influence, but not control, over operating and financial policies of the investee.  the company's proportionate share of the net income or loss of these companies is included in consolidated net earnings.  judgment regarding the level of influence over each equity method investment includes considering key factors such as the company's ownership interest, representation on the board of directors, participation in policy-making decisions and material intercompany transactions.
the company purchases inventory from alliance boots in the ordinary course of business.  these related party inventory purchases, which began in fiscal 2013, were not material in fiscal 2014 or 2013.
the underlying net assets of the company's equity method investment in alliance boots include goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets.  these assets are evaluated for impairment annually or more frequently if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value.  based on the company's evaluation as of august 31, 2014, the fair value of one alliance boots pharmaceutical wholesale reporting unit did not exceed its carrying amount by a significant amount.  goodwill allocated to this reporting unit by alliance boots as of may 31, 2014 was £255 million, £115 million based on the company's 45% ownership percentage (approximately $193 million using may 31, 2014 exchange rates).  the company utilizes a three-month lag in reporting its share of equity income in alliance boots, including this reporting unit.  the company will continue to monitor this reporting unit in accordance with accounting standards codification 350, intangibles - goodwill and other.
property and equipment depreciation is provided on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of owned assets. leasehold improvements and leased properties under capital leases are amortized over the estimated useful life of the property or over the term of the lease, whichever is shorter. estimated useful lives range from 10 to 39 years for land improvements, buildings and building improvements; and 2 to 13 years for equipment. major repairs, which extend the useful life of an asset, are capitalized; routine maintenance and repairs are charged against earnings.
the majority of the business uses the composite method of depreciation for equipment. therefore, gains and losses on retirement or other disposition of such assets are included in earnings only when an operating location is closed, completely remodeled or impaired. fully depreciated property and equipment are removed from the cost and related accumulated depreciation and amortization accounts. property and equipment consists of (in millions):

depreciation expense for property and equipment was $923 million in fiscal 2014, $894 million in fiscal 2013 and
$841 million in fiscal 2012.
the company capitalizes application stage development costs for significant internally developed software projects, such as upgrades to the store point-of-sale system. these costs are amortized over a five-year period. amortization expense was $111 million in fiscal 2014, $100 million in fiscal 2013 and $70 million in fiscal 2012.  unamortized costs at august 31, 2014 and august 31, 2013, were $410 million and $374 million, respectively.
goodwill and other intangible assets goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed.  the company accounts for goodwill and intangibles under asc topic 350, intangibles - goodwill and other, which does not permit amortization, but requires the company to test goodwill and other indefinite-lived assets for impairment annually or whenever events or circumstances indicate impairment may exist.
impaired assets and liabilities for store closings the company tests long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that a certain asset may be impaired. store locations that have been open at least five years are reviewed for impairment indicators at least annually. once identified, the amount of the impairment is computed by comparing the carrying value of the assets to the fair value, which is based on the discounted estimated future cash flows. impairment charges included in selling, general and administrative expenses were $167 million in fiscal 2014, primarily resulting from the company's store optimization plan.  impairment charges recognized in fiscal 2013 and 2012 were $30 million and $27
million, respectively.
the company also provides for future costs related to closed locations. the liability is based on the present value of future rent obligations and other related costs (net of estimated sublease rent) to the first lease option date.
the reserve for store closings, including $137 million from locations closed under the company's optimization plan, was $257 million as of august 31, 2014 compared to $123 million as of august 31 2013. see note 2 for additional disclosure regarding the company's reserve for future costs related to closed locations.
financial instruments the company had $151 million and $197 million of outstanding letters of credit at august 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively, which guarantee the purchase of foreign goods, and additional outstanding letters of credit of $259
million and $263 million at august 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively, which guarantee payments of insurance claims.
the insurance claim letters of credit are annually renewable and will remain in place until the insurance claims are paid in full. letters of credit of $9 million and $4 million were outstanding at august 31, 2014, and august
31, 2013, respectively, to guarantee performance of construction contracts. the company pays a facility fee to the financing bank to keep these letters of credit active. the company had real estate development purchase commitments of $169 million and $185 million at august 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively.
the company uses interest rate swaps to manage its interest rate exposure associated with some of its fixed-rate borrowings.  at august 31, 2014, the company had $1 billion of fixed-rate debt swapped to floating designated as fair value hedges.  the company also manages its interest rate exposure associated with its anticipated debt issuance.  in fiscal 2014, the company entered into a series of forward starting interest rate swap transactions locking in the then current three-month libor interest rate on $1.5 billion of anticipated debt issuance.  these forward starting swap transactions are designated as cash flow hedges.  the company's fair value and cash flow hedges are accounted for according to asc topic 815, derivatives and hedging, and measured at fair value in accordance with asc topic 820, fair value measurement and disclosures.  see notes 10 and 11 for additional disclosure regarding financial instruments.
revenue recognition the company recognizes revenue at the time the customer takes possession of the merchandise. customer returns are immaterial. sales taxes are not included in revenue.
gift cards the company sells walgreens gift cards to retail store customers and through its website.  the company does not charge administrative fees on unused gift cards and most gift cards do not have an expiration date.  income from gift cards is recognized when (1) the gift card is redeemed by the customer; or (2) the likelihood of the gift card being redeemed by the customer is remote (gift card breakage) and there is no legal obligation to remit the value of unredeemed gift cards to the relevant jurisdictions.  the company's gift card breakage rate is determined based upon historical redemption patterns.  gift card breakage income, which is included in selling, general and administrative expenses, was not significant in fiscal 2014, 2013 or 2012.
loyalty program the company's rewards program, balance ® rewards, is accrued as a charge to cost of sales at the time a point is earned.  points are funded internally and through vendor participation, and are credited to cost of sales at the time a vendor-sponsored point is earned.  breakage is recorded as points expire as a result of a member's inactivity or if the points remain unredeemed after three years.  breakage income, which is reported in cost of sales, was not significant in fiscal 2014 or 2013.
cost of sales cost of sales is derived based upon point-of-sale scanning information with an estimate for shrinkage and is adjusted based on periodic inventories.  in addition to product costs, cost of sales includes warehousing costs, purchasing costs, freight costs, cash discounts and vendor allowances.
vendor allowances vendor allowances are principally received as a result of purchases, sales or promotion of vendors' products.
allowances are generally recorded as a reduction of inventory and are recognized as a reduction of cost of sales when the related merchandise is sold.  those allowances received for promoting vendors' products are offset against advertising expense and result in a reduction of selling, general and administrative expenses to the extent of advertising costs incurred, with the excess treated as a reduction of inventory costs.
selling, general and administrative expenses selling, general and administrative expenses mainly consist of store salaries, occupancy costs, and expenses directly related to stores.  in addition, other costs included are headquarters' expenses, advertising costs (net of advertising revenue) and insurance.
advertising costs advertising costs, which are reduced by the portion funded by vendors, are expensed as incurred.  net advertising expenses, which are included in selling, general and administrative expenses, were $265 million in fiscal 2014,
$286 million in fiscal 2013 and $291 million in fiscal 2012.  included in net advertising expenses were vendor advertising allowances of $256 million in fiscal 2014, $240 million in fiscal 2013 and $239 million in fiscal 2012.
insurance the company obtains insurance coverage for catastrophic exposures as well as those risks required by law to be insured.  it is the company's policy to retain a significant portion of certain losses related to workers'
compensation, property, comprehensive general, pharmacist and vehicle liability.  liabilities for these losses are recorded based upon the company's estimates for claims incurred and are not discounted.  the provisions are estimated in part by considering historical claims experience, demographic factors and other actuarial assumptions.
available-for-sale investments the company, alliance boots and amerisourcebergen corporation (amerisourcebergen) entered into a framework agreement dated as of march 18, 2013, pursuant to which walgreens and alliance boots together were granted the right to purchase a minority equity position in amerisourcebergen, beginning with the right, but not the obligation, to purchase up to 19,859,795 shares of amerisourcebergen common stock (approximately 7 percent of the then fully diluted equity of amerisourcebergen, assuming the exercise in full of the warrants described below) in open market transactions.  as of august 31, 2014, the company held 11.5 million shares of amerisourcebergen common stock which are classified as available-for-sale.  see note 6 for additional disclosure regarding the company's available-for-sale investments.
warrants the company and alliance boots were each issued (a) a warrant to purchase shares of amerisourcebergen common stock exercisable during a six-month period beginning in march 2016, and (b) a warrant to purchase shares of amerisourcebergen common stock exercisable during a six-month period beginning in march 2017.  the company's warrants are valued at the date of issuance and the end of the period using a monte carlo simulation.  key assumptions used in the valuation include risk-free interest rates using constant maturity treasury rates; the dividend yield for amerisourcebergen's common stock; amerisourcebergen's common stock price at the valuation date;
amerisourcebergen's equity volatility; the number of shares of amerisourcebergen's common stock outstanding; the number of employee stock options and the exercise price; and the details specific to the warrants. the fair value of the company's warrants on march 18, 2013, the date of issuance, was $77 million.  the company recorded the fair value of its warrants as a non-current asset with a corresponding deferred credit in its consolidated balance sheets.  the deferred credit attributable to the warrants will be amortized over the life of the warrants.  the fair value of the company's warrants at august 31, 2014 and 2013 was $553 million and $188 million, respectively, resulting in the company recording other income of $366 million and $111 million within its consolidated statements of earnings.  the increase in the fair value of the warrants was primarily attributable to the increase in the price of amerisourcebergen's common stock.  in addition, the company recorded $19 million and $9 million in fiscal
2014 and 2013, respectively, of other income relating to the amortization of the deferred credit.  see note 10 for additional disclosure regarding the company's warrants.
pre-opening expenses non-capital expenditures incurred prior to the opening of a new or remodeled store are expensed as incurred.
stock-based compensation plans in accordance with asc topic 718, compensation - stock compensation, the company recognizes compensation expense on a straight-line basis over the employee's vesting period or to the employee's retirement eligible date, if earlier.  total stock-based compensation expense for fiscal 2014, 2013 and 2012 was $114 million, $104 million and
$99 million, respectively.  the recognized tax benefit was $31 million, $30 million and $9 million for fiscal 2014,
2013 and 2012, respectively.  unrecognized compensation cost related to non-vested awards at august 31, 2014, was
$188 million.  this cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted average of three years.  see note 14 for more information on the company's stock-based compensation plans.
interest expense the company capitalized $6 million, $7 million and $9 million of interest expense as part of significant construction projects during fiscal 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively.  interest paid, which is net of capitalized interest, was $161 million in fiscal 2014, $158 million in fiscal 2013 and $108 million in fiscal 2012.
income taxes the company accounts for income taxes according to the asset and liability method.  under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized based upon the estimated future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases.  deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured pursuant to tax laws using rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled.  the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rate is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date.  valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amounts more likely than not to be realized.
in determining the company's provision for income taxes, an annual effective income tax rate based on full-year income, permanent differences between book and tax income, and statutory income tax rates are used.  the effective income tax rate also reflects the company's assessment of the ultimate outcome of tax audits in addition to any foreign-based income deemed to be taxable in the united states.  discrete events such as audit settlements or changes in tax laws are recognized in the period in which they occur.
the company is subject to routine income tax audits that occur periodically in the normal course of business.  u.s.
federal, state and local and foreign tax authorities raise questions regarding the company's tax filing positions, including the timing and amount of deductions and the allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions.  in evaluating the tax benefits associated with its various tax filing positions, the company records a tax benefit for uncertain tax positions using the highest cumulative tax benefit that is more likely than not to be realized.
adjustments are made to the liability for unrecognized tax benefits in the period in which the company determines the issue is effectively settled with the tax authorities, the statute of limitations expires for the return containing the tax position or when more information becomes available.  the company's liability for unrecognized tax benefits, including accrued penalties and interest, is included in other long-term liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets and in income tax expense in the consolidated statements of earnings.
earnings per share the dilutive effect of outstanding stock options on earnings per share is calculated using the treasury stock method.  stock options are anti-dilutive and excluded from the earnings per share calculation if the exercise price exceeds the average market price of the common shares.  outstanding options to purchase common shares that were anti-dilutive and excluded from earnings per share totaled 3,510,395, 12,316,949 and 32,593,870 in fiscal 2014,
2013 and 2012, respectively.
new accounting pronouncements in may 2014, the financial accounting standards board (fasb) issued asu 2014-09, revenue from contracts with customers, as a new topic, asc topic 606.  the new revenue recognition standard provides a five-step analysis of transactions to determine when and how revenue is recognized.  the core principle is that a company should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services.  this asu is effective for annual periods beginning after december 15, 2016 (fiscal 2018) and shall be applied retrospectively to each period presented or as a cumulative-effect adjustment as of the date of adoption.  the company is evaluating the effect of adopting this new accounting guidance, but does not expect adoption will have a material impact on the company's results of operations, cash flows or financial position.
in april 2014, the fasb issued asu 2014-08, reporting discontinued operations and disclosures of disposals of components of an entity. this asu raises the threshold for a disposal to qualify as discontinued operations and requires new disclosures for individually material disposal transactions that do not meet the definition of a discontinued operation. under the new standard, companies report discontinued operations when they have a disposal that represents a strategic shift that has or will have a major impact on operations or financial results.  this update will be applied prospectively and is effective for annual periods, and interim periods within those years, beginning after december 15, 2014 (fiscal 2016). early adoption is permitted provided the disposal was not previously disclosed.  this update will not have a material impact on the company's reported results of operations and financial position.  this asu is non-cash in nature and will not affect the company's cash position.
in may 2013, the fasb reissued an exposure draft on lease accounting that would require entities to recognize assets and liabilities arising from lease contracts on the balance sheet.  the proposed exposure draft states that lessees and lessors should apply a "right-of-use model" in accounting for all leases.  under the proposed model, lessees would recognize an asset for the right to use the leased asset, and a liability for the obligation to make rental payments over the lease term. when measuring the asset and liability, variable lease payments are excluded, whereas renewal options that provide a significant economic incentive upon renewal would be included.  the accounting by a lessor would reflect its retained exposure to the risks or benefits of the underlying leased asset.
a lessor would recognize an asset representing its right to receive lease payments based on the expected term of the lease. the lease expense from real estate based leases would continue to be recorded under a straight-line approach, but other leases not related to real estate would be expensed using an effective interest method that would accelerate lease expense. a final standard is currently expected to be issued in calendar 2014 and would be effective no earlier than annual reporting periods beginning on january 1, 2017 (fiscal 2018 for the company).  the proposed standard, as currently drafted, would have a material impact on the company's financial position and the impact on the company's reported results of operations is being evaluated.  the impact of this exposure draft is non-cash in nature and would not affect the company's cash position.
(2)  store closures in march 2014, the board of directors approved a plan to close underperforming stores in efforts to optimize and focus resources in a manner intended to increase shareholder value.  total pre-tax charges associated with the plan are estimated to be between $240 million and $280 million.  in fiscal 2014, the company incurred pre-tax charges of
$209 million as a result of closing 67 stores; $137 million from lease termination costs, $71 million from asset impairment charges and $1 million of other charges.
(3)  leases the company owns approximately 20% of its operating locations; the remaining locations are leased premises.
initial terms are typically 20 to 25 years, followed by additional terms containing renewal options at five-year intervals, and may include rent escalation clauses.  the commencement date of all lease terms is the earlier of the date the company becomes legally obligated to make rent payments or the date the company has the right to control the property.  the company recognizes rent expense on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease.  in addition to minimum fixed rentals, some leases provide for contingent rentals based upon a portion of sales.
the company continuously evaluates its real estate portfolio in conjunction with its capital needs.  in fiscal
2014, the company entered into several sale-leaseback transactions.  in some of these transactions, the company negotiated fixed rate renewal options which constitute a form of continuing involvement, resulting in the assets remaining on the balance sheet and a corresponding finance lease obligation.
minimum rental commitments at august 31, 2014, under all leases having an initial or remaining non-cancelable term of more than one year are shown below (in millions):

the company provides for future costs related to closed locations.  the liability is based on the present value of future rent obligations and other related costs (net of estimated sublease rent) to the first lease option date.
in fiscal 2014, 2013 and 2012, the company recorded charges of $177 million, $43 million and $20 million, respectively, for facilities that were closed or relocated under long-term leases, including stores closed through the company's store optimization plan.  these charges are reported in selling, general and administrative expenses on the consolidated statements of earnings.

water street owns a majority interest in the new company while walgreens owns a significant minority interest and has representatives on the new company's board of directors.  the value of the investment at august 31, 2014 was
$67 million.  the company recognized an immaterial gain on the transaction.
in november 2013, the company completed its acquisition of certain assets of kerr drug and its affiliates for $173
million, subject to adjustment in certain circumstances.  this acquisition included 76 retail locations as well as a specialty pharmacy business and a distribution center.  the preliminary purchase accounting for the kerr drug acquisition added $45 million to goodwill and $54 million to intangible assets, primarily prescription files and payer contracts, with $74 million allocated to net tangible assets.  this allocation is subject to change as the company finalizes purchase accounting.
the aggregate purchase price of all business and intangible asset acquisitions, excluding kerr drug, was $171
million in fiscal 2014.  these acquisitions added $13 million to goodwill and $119 million to intangible assets, primarily prescription files.  the remaining fair value relates to immaterial amounts of tangible assets, less liabilities assumed.  operating results of businesses acquired have been included in the consolidated statements of earnings from their respective acquisition dates forward and were not material.

alliance boots on august 2, 2012, pursuant to a purchase and option agreement dated june 18, 2012, by and among the company, alliance boots gmbh and ab acquisitions holdings limited (the purchase and option agreement), the company acquired
45% of the issued and outstanding share capital of alliance boots in exchange for $4.025 billion in cash and approximately 83.4 million shares of company common stock.  on august 5, 2014, the company entered into an amendment to the purchase and option agreement, which among other things, accelerated the option period from august
5, 2014 to february 5, 2015.  the purchase and option agreement, as amended on august 5, 2014, provides, subject to the satisfaction or waiver of specified conditions, a call option that gives the company the right, but not the obligation, to acquire the remaining 55% of alliance boots (second step transaction) in exchange for an additional
£3.1 billion in cash (approximately $5.2 billion using august 31, 2014 exchange rates) as well as an additional
144.3 million company shares, subject to certain adjustments.  pursuant to the amended option agreement, the company exercised its option on august 5, 2014.  in certain circumstances, if the second step transaction does not close, the company's ownership of alliance boots will reduce from 45% to 42% in exchange for nominal consideration.
the company's equity earnings, initial investment and the call option exclude the alliance boots minority interest in galenica ltd. (galenica).  the alliance boots investment in galenica was distributed to the alliance boots shareholders other than the company in may 2013, which had no impact on the company's financial results.
the call option, prior to its amendment and subsequent exercise, was valued using a monte carlo simulation using assumptions surrounding walgreens equity value as well as the potential impacts of certain provisions of the purchase and option agreement that are described in the form 8-k filed by the company on june 19, 2012.  the call option was accounted for at cost and subsequently adjusted for foreign currency translation gains or losses.  the final purchase price allocation resulted in $6.1 billion of the total consideration being allocated to the investment and $866 million being allocated to the call option based on their relative fair values.  the amendment to the call option was accounted for as a non-monetary exchange with the amended call option valued as an out-of-
the-money option using a monte carlo simulation.  the $866 million remeasurement loss was recorded in other
(expense)/income on the consolidated statements of earnings.
the company accounts for its 45% investment in alliance boots using the equity method of accounting.   investments accounted for under the equity method are recorded initially at cost and subsequently adjusted for the company's share of the net income or loss and cash contributions and distributions to or from these entities.  because the underlying net assets in alliance boots are denominated in a foreign currency, translation gains or losses will impact the recorded value of the company's investment.  the company utilizes a three-month lag in reporting equity income in alliance boots.  due to the lag and timing of the investment, only 10 months results of alliance boots were recorded in fiscal 2013 compared to 12 months of results recorded in fiscal 2014.  the company's investment is recorded as "equity investment in alliance boots" in the consolidated balance sheets.
the company's initial investment in alliance boots exceeded its proportionate share of the net assets of alliance boots by $2.4 billion.  this premium of $2.4 billion is recognized as part of the carrying value in the company's equity investment in alliance boots.  the difference is primarily related to the fair value of alliance boots indefinite-lived intangible assets and goodwill.  the company's equity method income from the investment in alliance boots is adjusted to reflect the amortization of fair value adjustments in certain definite-lived assets of alliance boots.  the company's incremental amortization expense associated with the alliance boots investment was approximately $42 million in fiscal 2014.  in fiscal 2013, the company recognized approximately $57 million, including the inventory step-up, which was amortized over the first inventory turn.
during july 2013, the uk government enacted a law to reduce the uk corporate tax rate effective april 2014 with a further reduction scheduled to take effect in april 2015.  the non-cash impact of $71 million was recorded in fiscal 2014 due to the three-month lag.
other equity method investments other equity method investments relate to joint ventures associated with the company's infusion and respiratory business and its equity method investment received through the sale of the take care employer business.  these investments are included within other non-current assets on the consolidated balance sheets.  the company's share of equity income is reported within selling, general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of earnings.

(1) net assets in alliance boots are translated at the may 31, 2014 spot rate of $1.68 to one british pound sterling, corresponding to the three-month lag.  fiscal 2013 net assets in alliance boots were translated at a spot rate of $1.52 to one british pound sterling.
(2) shareholders' equity at august 31, 2014 and 2013, includes $257 million and $374 million related to non-
controlling interests, respectively.
(3) the company utilizes a three-month lag in reporting its share of equity income in alliance boots.  the fiscal year ended august 31, 2013 included only ten month's results for alliance boots because of the three-month lag and the timing of the investment on august 2, 2012, compared to twelve months results recorded in fiscal 2014.
earnings in alliance boots are translated at the average exchange rate of $1.61 and $1.57 to one british pound sterling for the years ended august 31, 2014 and 2013 respectively.  walgreens boots alliance development gmbh operations are excluded from these results as the company consolidates the joint venture.
(6)  available-for-sale investments in conjunction with its long-term relationship with amerisourcebergen, the company has the right to acquire up to
7% of the common shares of amerisourcebergen through open market transactions.  the company's cost basis of common shares acquired in fiscal 2014 and 2013 were $493 million and $224 million, respectively.  the available-for-sale investment is classified as long-term and reported at fair value within other non-current assets in the consolidated balance sheets.  the company also holds other investments with maturities greater than 90 days that are reported at fair value within other current assets in the consolidated balance sheets.
fair value adjustments are based on quoted stock prices with the unrealized holding gains and losses reported in other comprehensive income.  unrealized holding gains at august 31, 2014 and 2013 were $170 million and $1 million, respectively.  see note 11 for additional fair value disclosures.  available-for-sale investments reported at fair value at august 31, 2014 and 2013 were $887 million and $225 million, respectively.
(7)  goodwill and other intangible assets goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets are not amortized, but are evaluated for impairment annually during the fourth quarter, or more frequently if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value.  as part of the company's impairment analysis for each reporting unit, the company engaged a third party appraisal firm to assist in the determination of estimated fair value for each unit.  this determination included estimating the fair value using both the income and market approaches.  the income approach requires management to estimate a number of factors for each reporting unit, including projected future operating results, economic projections, anticipated future cash flows and discount rates.  the market approach estimates fair value using comparable marketplace fair value data from within a comparable industry grouping.
the determination of the fair value of the reporting units and the allocation of that value to individual assets and liabilities within those reporting units requires the company to make significant estimates and assumptions.
these estimates and assumptions primarily include, but are not limited to: the selection of appropriate peer group companies; control premiums appropriate for acquisitions in the industries in which the company competes; the discount rate; terminal growth rates; and forecasts of revenue, operating income, depreciation and amortization and capital expenditures.  the allocation requires several analyses to determine the fair value of assets and liabilities including, among other things, purchased prescription files, customer relationships and trade names.
although the company believes its estimates of fair value are reasonable, actual financial results could differ from those estimates due to the inherent uncertainty involved in making such estimates.  changes in assumptions concerning future financial results or other underlying assumptions could have a significant impact on either the fair value of the reporting units, the amount of the goodwill impairment charge, or both.  the company also compared the sum of the estimated fair values of its reporting units to the company's total value as implied by the market value of its equity and debt securities.  this comparison indicated that, in total, its assumptions and estimates were reasonable.  however, future declines in the overall market value of the company's equity and debt securities may indicate that the fair value of one or more reporting units has declined below its carrying value.
one measure of the sensitivity of the amount of goodwill impairment charges to key assumptions is the amount by which each reporting unit "passed" (fair value exceeds the carrying amount) or "failed" (the carrying amount exceeds fair value) the first step of the goodwill impairment test.  the company's reporting units' fair values exceeded their carrying amounts ranging from approximately 12% to more than 117%.
generally, changes in estimates of expected future cash flows would have a similar effect on the estimated fair value of the reporting unit.  that is, a 1% change in estimated future cash flows would change the estimated fair value of the reporting unit by approximately 1%.  the estimated long-term rate of net sales growth can have a significant impact on the estimated future cash flows, and therefore, the fair value of each reporting unit.  of the other key assumptions that impact the estimated fair values, most reporting units have the greatest sensitivity to changes in the estimated discount rate.  the company believes that its estimates of future cash flows and discount rates are reasonable, but future changes in the underlying assumptions could differ due to the inherent uncertainty in making such estimates.

we have periodically borrowed under our commercial paper program during the current fiscal year, and may continue to borrow in future periods.  we had average daily short-term borrowings of $4 million of commercial paper outstanding at a weighted average interest rate of 0.23% for the fiscal year ended august 31, 2014.  we had no commercial paper outstanding at august 31, 2014.  in connection with the commercial paper program, the company maintains two unsecured backup syndicated lines of credit that total $1.35 billion.  the first $500 million facility expires on july 20, 2015, and allows for the issuance of up to $250 million in letters of credit.  the second $850 million facility expires on july 23, 2017, and allows for the issuance of up to $200 million in letters of credit.  the issuance of letters of credit under either of these facilities reduces available borrowings.  the company's ability to access these facilities is subject to compliance with the terms and conditions of the credit facilities, including financial covenants.  the covenants require the company to maintain certain financial ratios related to minimum net worth and priority debt, along with limitations on the sale of assets and purchases of investments.  at august 31, 2014, the company was in compliance with all such covenants.  the company pays a facility fee to the financing banks to keep these lines of credit active.  at august 31, 2014, there were no letters of credit issued against these credit facilities and the company does not anticipate any future letters of credit to be issued against these facilities.
(10)  financial instruments the company uses derivative instruments to manage its interest rate exposure associated with some of its fixed-rate borrowings.  the company does not use derivative instruments for trading or speculative purposes.  all derivative instruments are recognized in the consolidated balance sheets at fair value.  the company designates interest rate swaps as fair value hedges of fixed-rate borrowings.  for derivatives designated as fair value hedges, the change in the fair value of both the derivative instrument and the hedged item are recognized in earnings in the current period.  the company's forward starting interest rate swaps used to hedge anticipated debt issuances are designated as cash flow hedges.  changes in the fair value of cash flow hedges deemed effective are recognized in other comprehensive income.  at the inception of a hedge transaction, the company formally documents the hedge relationship and the risk management objective for undertaking the hedge.  in addition, it assesses both at inception of the hedge and on an ongoing basis whether the derivative in the hedging transaction has been highly effective in offsetting changes in fair value of the hedged item and whether the derivative is expected to continue to be highly effective.  the impact of any ineffectiveness is recognized currently in earnings.
counterparties to derivative financial instruments expose the company to credit-related losses in the event of nonperformance, but the company regularly monitors the credit worthiness of each counterparty.
fair value hedges in prior fiscal years, the company entered into a series of interest rate swaps converting $750 million of its
5.250% fixed rate notes to a floating interest rate based on the six-month libor in arrears plus a constant spread and an interest rate swap converting $250 million of its 5.250% fixed rate notes to a floating interest rate based on the one-month libor in arrears plus a constant spread.  all swap termination dates coincide with the notes maturity date, january 15, 2019.  the changes in fair value of the notes attributable to the hedged risk are included in short-term and long-term debt on the consolidated condensed balance sheets.  no material gains or losses were recorded in fiscal 2014 or 2013 from ineffectiveness.
cash flow hedges in the current fiscal year, the company entered into a series of forward starting interest rate swap transactions locking in the then current three-month libor interest rate on $1.5 billion of anticipated debt issuance, with expected maturity tenures of 10 and 30 years.  the swap transactions are designated as cash flow hedges.  changes in the fair value of swaps are recorded in other comprehensive income.  any ineffectiveness is recognized in interest expense on the consolidated balance sheets.

the changes in fair value of the company's debt that was swapped from fixed to variable rate and designated as fair value hedges are included in long-term debt on the consolidated balance sheets (see note 9).  at august 31, 2014, the cumulative fair value adjustments resulted in an increase in long-term debt of $12 million compared to a decrease in fair value of $3 million at august 31, 2013.
changes in fair value of the cash flow hedges are included in other comprehensive income, with any ineffectiveness recorded directly to interest expense.  the fair value change in fiscal 2014 reported in other comprehensive income was $44 million, $27 million net of tax, at august 31, 2014.  upon termination of the cash flow hedges, cumulative changes included in other comprehensive income will be amortized with the debt's cash flow.  no material fair value changes or ineffectiveness was recorded through other comprehensive income in fiscal 2014.

(11)  fair value measurements the company measures certain assets and liabilities in accordance with asc topic 820, fair value measurements and disclosures. asc topic 820 defines fair value as the price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. in addition, it establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes observable and unobservable inputs used to measure fair value into three broad levels:
level 1 -  quoted prices in active markets that are accessible at the measurement date for identical assets and liabilities. the fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to level 1 inputs.
level 2 -  observable inputs other than quoted prices in active markets.
level 3 -  unobservable inputs for which there is little or no market data available. the fair value hierarchy gives the lowest priority to level 3 inputs.

the company reports its debt instruments under the guidance of asc topic 825, financial instruments, which requires disclosure of the fair value of the company's debt in the footnotes to the consolidated financial statements.  see note 9 for further details.
(12)  commitments and contingencies the company is involved in legal proceedings and is subject to investigations, inspections, audits, inquiries and similar actions by governmental authorities, arising in the normal course of the company's business, including the matters described below.  legal proceedings, in general, and securities and class action litigation, in particular, can be expensive and disruptive.  some of these suits may purport or may be determined to be class actions and/or involve parties seeking large and/or indeterminate amounts, including punitive or exemplary damages, and may remain unresolved for several years.  from time to time, the company is also involved in legal proceedings as a plaintiff involving antitrust, tax, contract, intellectual property and other matters.  gain contingencies, if any, are recognized when they are realized.  the results of legal proceedings are often uncertain and difficult to predict, and the costs incurred in litigation can be substantial, regardless of the outcome.  the company believes that its defenses and assertions in pending legal proceedings have merit, and does not believe that any of these pending matters, after consideration of applicable reserves and rights to indemnification, will have a material adverse effect on the company's consolidated financial position.  however, substantial unanticipated verdicts, fines and rulings do sometimes occur.  as a result, the company could from time to time incur judgments, enter into settlements or revise its expectations regarding the outcome of certain matters, and such developments could have a material adverse effect on its results of operations in the period in which the amounts are accrued and/or its cash flows in the period in which the amounts are paid.
on a quarterly basis, the company assesses its liabilities and contingencies for outstanding legal proceedings and reserves are established on a case-by-case basis for those legal claims for which management concludes that it is probable that a loss will be incurred and that the amount of such loss can be reasonably estimated. substantially all of these contingencies are subject to significant uncertainties and, therefore, determining the likelihood of a loss and/or the measurement of any loss can be complex.  with respect to litigation and other legal proceedings where the company has determined that a loss is reasonably possible, the company is unable to estimate the amount or range of reasonably possible loss in excess of amounts reserved due to the inherent difficulty of predicting the outcome of and uncertainties regarding such litigation and legal proceedings.  the company's assessments are based on estimates and assumptions that have been deemed reasonable by management, but that may prove to be incomplete or inaccurate, and unanticipated events and circumstances may occur that might cause the company to change those estimates and assumptions.  therefore, it is possible that an unfavorable resolution of one or more pending litigation or other contingencies could have a material adverse effect on the company's consolidated financial statements in a future fiscal period.  management's assessment of current litigation and other legal proceedings, including the corresponding accruals, could change because of the discovery of facts with respect to legal actions or other proceedings pending against the company which are not presently known. adverse rulings or determinations by judges, juries, governmental authorities or other parties could also result in changes to management's assessment of current liabilities and contingencies.  accordingly, the ultimate costs of resolving these claims may be substantially higher or lower than the amounts reserved.
on june 11, 2013, the company entered into a settlement and memorandum of agreement (the agreement) with the united states department of justice and the united states drug enforcement administration (dea) that settled and resolved all administrative and civil matters arising out of dea's previously-disclosed concerns relating to the company's distribution and dispensing of controlled substances. under the terms of the agreement, the company paid an $80
million settlement amount, surrendered its dea registrations for six pharmacies in florida until may 26, 2014, and for its jupiter, florida distribution center until sept. 13, 2014, and agreed to implement certain remedial actions.  in addition, the company dismissed with prejudice its petition with the united states court of appeals for the district of columbia circuit that challenged certain enforcement authority of the dea. on july 31, 2013 and august 13, 2013, putative shareholders filed derivative actions in federal court in the northern district of illinois against the walgreens board of directors and walgreen co. as a nominal defendant (collectively, the defendants), arising out of the company's june 2013 settlement with the dea described above.  the actions assert claims for breach of fiduciary duty on the grounds that the directors allegedly should have prevented the events that led to the settlement.  the plaintiffs filed an amended consolidated complaint on october 4, 2013, pursuant to which they seek damages and other relief on behalf of the company.  the defendants filed their motion to dismiss on december 3, 2013.  subsequent thereto, the plaintiffs filed an opposition brief on february 7, 2014 and the defendants filed their reply brief on march 10, 2014.  in june 2014, the parties executed a settlement term sheet reflecting an agreement in principle to settle this matter, subject to, among other things, the execution of final settlement documentation and court approval.  on september 11, 2014, the defendants, denying all wrongdoing and liability, entered into a stipulation and agreement of settlement whereby the company agreed to certain corporate governance measures and the payment of up to $3.5 million for plaintiffs' counsel fees and costs in exchange for a complete release of all claims against all defendants.  the court entered an order preliminarily approving the stipulation and agreement of settlement on september 19, 2014.  a final hearing to approve the settlement is scheduled for december 9, 2014.  settlement of this matter on the agreed terms would not have a material adverse effect on the company's consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows.
(13)  capital stock the company's long-term capital policy is to maintain a strong balance sheet and financial flexibility; reinvest in its core strategies; invest in strategic opportunities that reinforce its core strategies and meet return requirements; and return surplus cash flow to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases over the long term.  in connection with the company's capital policy, the board of directors set a long-term dividend payout ratio target between 30 and 35 percent of net income.  on july 13, 2011, the board of directors authorized the 2012
repurchase program, which allows for the repurchase of up to $2.0 billion of the company's common stock prior to its expiration on december 31, 2015.  in august 2014, the board of directors approved the 2014 share repurchase program, which replaces the 2012 repurchase program, that allows for the purchase of up to $3.0 billion of the company's common stock prior to its expiration on august 31, 2016.

the company determines the timing and amount of repurchases from time to time based on its assessment of various factors including prevailing market conditions, alternate uses of capital, liquidity, the economic environment and other factors.  the timing and amount of these purchases may change at any time and from time to time.  the company has and may from time to time in the future repurchase shares on the open market through rule 10b5-1 plans, which enable a company to repurchase shares at times when it otherwise might be precluded from doing so under insider trading laws.
in addition, the company continued to repurchase shares to support the needs of the employee stock plans.  shares totaling $705 million were purchased to support the needs of the employee stock plans during fiscal 2014 as compared to $615 million in fiscal 2013.  at august 31, 2014, 48.4 million shares of common stock were reserved for future issuances under the company's various employee benefit plans.
(14)  stock compensation plans the walgreen co. omnibus incentive plan (the "omnibus plan") which became effective in fiscal 2013, provides for incentive compensation to walgreens non-employee directors, officers and employees, and consolidates into a single plan several previously existing equity compensation plans: the executive stock option plan, the long-term performance incentive plan, the broad based employee stock option plan, and the nonemployee director stock plan
(collectively, the "former plans").  as of the effective date of the omnibus plan, no further grants may be made under the former plans and shares that were available for issuance under the former plans and not subject to outstanding awards became available for issuance (in addition to newly authorized shares) under the omnibus plan.
a total of 60.4 million shares became available for delivery under the omnibus plan.

we have audited the internal control over financial reporting of walgreen co. and subsidiaries (the "company") as of august 31, 2014, based on criteria established in internal control - integrated framework (1992) issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission. the company's management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying management's report on internal control.
our responsibility is to express an opinion on the company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.
we conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the public company accounting oversight board (united states). those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. we believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
a company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the company's principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, and effected by the company's board of directors, management, and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. a company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
because of the inherent limitations of internal control over financial reporting, including the possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls, material misstatements due to error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. also, projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that the controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
in our opinion, the company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of august 31, 2014, based on the criteria established in internal control - integrated framework
(1992) issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission.
we have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the public company accounting oversight board (united states), the consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended august 31, 2014 of the company and our report dated october 20, 2014 (except for the other matters section of note 1 as to which the date is november 3,
2014) expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements based on our audit and the report of other auditors.
/s/ deloitte & touche llp chicago, illinois october 20, 2014
to the board of alliance boots gmbh:
we have audited the non-statutory consolidated financial statements of alliance boots gmbh and its subsidiaries
(the "group", not presented separately herein), which comprise the group statements of financial position as at 31
may 2014 and 2013, and the related group income statements, group statements of comprehensive income, group statements of changes in equity and group statements of cash flows for the year ended 31 may 2014 and ten months ended 31 may 2013.  these non-statutory consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the group's management.  our responsibility is to express an opinion on these non-statutory consolidated financial statements based on our audits.
we conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the public company accounting oversight board (united states).  those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the non-statutory consolidated financial statements are free from material misstatement.  an audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the non-statutory consolidated financial statements.  an audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and the significant accounting estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the non-statutory consolidated financial statements.  we believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
in our opinion, the non-statutory consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the group as at 31 may 2014 and 2013, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the year ended 31 may 2014 and ten months ended 31 may 2013 in conformity with international financial reporting standards as issued by the international accounting standards board, including the requirements of ias
34, interim financial reporting.

evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures management conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this form 10-k.  the controls evaluation was conducted under the supervision and with the participation of the company's management, including its chief executive officer (ceo) and chief financial officer (cfo). based upon the controls evaluation, our ceo and cfo have concluded that, as of the end of the period covered by this report, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in our exchange act reports is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified by the sec, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to management, including the ceo and cfo, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.
report on internal control over financial reporting management's report on internal control over financial reporting and the report of deloitte & touche llp, the company's independent registered public accounting firm, related to their assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting are included in part ii, item 8 of this form 10-k and are incorporated in this item 9a by reference.
changes in internal control over financial reporting in connection with the evaluation pursuant to exchange act rule 13a-15(d) of the company's internal control over financial reporting (as defined in exchange act rule 13a-15(f)) by the company's management, including its ceo and cfo, no changes during the quarter ended august 31, 2014 were identified that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the company's internal control over financial reporting.  the company plans to transition to a new general ledger system in the fiscal quarter ending november 30, 2014.  this is part of an ongoing initiative to enhance the overall design and operating effectiveness of the company's financial reporting controls and is not in response to an identified internal control deficiency.  management believes that controls over project development and implementation are adequate to assure there will be no material effect, or a reasonable likelihood of a material effect, on our internal control over financial reporting.
inherent limitations on effectiveness of controls our management, including the ceo and cfo, do not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal control over financial reporting will prevent or detect all errors and all fraud.  a control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the control system's objectives will be met.  the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs.  further, because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that misstatements due to error or fraud will not occur or that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within the company have been detected.  these inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake.  controls can also be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people, or by management override of the controls.  the design of any system of controls is based in part on certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions.  projections of any evaluation of controls effectiveness to future periods are subject to risks.  over time, controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or deterioration in the degree of compliance with policies or procedures.

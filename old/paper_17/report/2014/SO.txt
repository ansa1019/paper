item 1a. risk factors in addition to the other information in this form 10-k, including management's discussion and analysis - future earnings potential in item 7 of each registrant, and other documents filed by southern company and/or its subsidiaries with the sec from time to time, the following factors should be carefully considered in evaluating southern company and its subsidiaries. such factors could affect actual results and cause results to differ materially from those expressed in any forward-looking statements made by, or on behalf of, southern company and/or its subsidiaries.
utility regulatory, legislative, and litigation risks southern company and its subsidiaries are subject to substantial governmental regulation. compliance with current and future regulatory requirements and procurement of necessary approvals, permits, and certificates may result in substantial costs to southern company and its subsidiaries.
southern company and its subsidiaries, including the traditional operating companies and southern power, are subject to substantial regulation from federal, state, and local regulatory agencies. southern company and its subsidiaries are required to comply with numerous laws and regulations and to obtain numerous permits, approvals, and certificates from the governmental agencies that regulate various aspects of their businesses, including rates and charges, service regulations, retail service territories, sales of securities, asset acquisitions and sales, accounting policies and practices, physical security and cyber-security policies and practices, and the construction and operation of fossil-fuel, nuclear, hydroelectric, solar, wind, and biomass generating facilities, as well as transmission and distribution facilities. for example, the respective state pscs must approve the traditional operating companies' requested rates for retail customers. the traditional operating companies seek to recover their costs (including a reasonable return on invested capital) through their retail rates, and there can be no assurance that a state psc, in a future rate proceeding, will not alter the timing or amount of certain costs for which recovery is allowed or modify the current authorized rate of return. additionally, the rates charged to wholesale customers by the traditional operating companies and by southern power must be approved by the ferc. these wholesale rates could be affected by changes to southern power's ability to conduct business pursuant to ferc market-based rate authority. the ferc rules related to retaining the authority to sell electricity at market-based rates in the wholesale markets are important for the traditional operating companies and southern power if they are to remain competitive in the wholesale markets in which they operate.
the impact of any future revision or changes in interpretations of existing regulations or the adoption of new laws and regulations applicable to southern company or any of its subsidiaries cannot now be predicted. changes in regulation or the imposition of additional regulations could influence the operating environment of southern company and its subsidiaries and may result in substantial costs.
the southern company system's costs of compliance with environmental laws are significant. the costs of compliance with current and future environmental laws, including laws and regulations designed to address air quality, water, ccr, global climate change, renewable energy standards, and other matters and the incurrence of environmental liabilities could negatively impact the net income, cash flows, and financial condition of southern company, the traditional operating companies, and/or southern power.
the southern company system is subject to extensive federal, state, and local environmental requirements which, among other things, regulate air emissions, water usage and discharges, and the management and disposal of waste in order to adequately protect the environment. compliance with these environmental requirements requires the traditional operating companies and southern power to commit significant expenditures for installation of pollution control equipment, environmental monitoring, emissions fees, and permits at substantially all of their respective facilities. southern company, the traditional operating companies, and southern power expect that these expenditures will continue to be significant in the future. through december 31, 2014, the traditional operating companies had invested approximately $10.6 billion in environmental capital retrofit projects to comply with these requirements. the epa has adopted and is in the process of implementing regulations governing the emission of nitrogen oxide, sulfur dioxide, fine particulate matter, mercury, and other air pollutants under the clean air act through the national ambient air quality standards, csapr, the mats rule, and other air quality regulations and is in the process of considering additional revisions. in addition, the epa has recently finalized regulations governing cooling water intake structures and has proposed revisions to the effluent guidelines for steam electric generating plants and the definition of waters of the united states under the clean water act. the epa has also recently finalized regulations governing the disposal of ccr, including coal ash and gypsum, in landfills and surface impoundments at active generating power plants.
existing environmental laws and regulations may be revised or new laws and regulations related to air quality, water, ccr, global climate change, endangered species, or other environmental and health concerns may be adopted or become applicable to the traditional operating companies and/or southern power.
in addition, the epa has published three sets of proposed standards that would limit co2 emissions from new, existing, and i-17
index to financial statements modified or reconstructed fossil-fuel-fired electric generating units. on january 8, 2014, the epa published proposed standards for new units, and, on june 18, 2014, the epa published proposed standards governing existing units, known as the clean power plan, and separate standards governing co2 emissions from modified and reconstructed units. the epa's proposed clean power plan establishes guidelines for states to develop plans to address co2 emissions from existing fossil fuel-fired electric generating units. the epa's proposed guidelines establish state-specific interim and final co2 emission rate goals to be achieved between 2020 and 2029 and in 2030 and thereafter. the proposed guidelines and standards could result in operational restrictions and material compliance costs, including capital expenditures, which could affect future unit retirement and replacement decisions.
the southern company system filed comments on the epa's proposed clean power plan on december 1, 2014. these comments addressed legal and technical issues in addition to providing a preliminary estimated cost of complying with the proposed guidelines utilizing one of the epa's compliance scenarios. costs associated with this proposal could be significant to the utility industry and the southern company system. however, the ultimate financial and operational impact of the proposed clean power plan on the southern company system cannot be determined at this time and will depend upon numerous known and unknown factors.
the southern company system's ultimate environmental compliance strategy, including potential unit retirement and replacement decisions, and future environmental capital expenditures will be affected by the final requirements of new or revised environmental regulations; the time periods over which compliance with regulations is required; individual state implementation of regulations, as applicable; the outcome of any legal challenges to the environmental rules and any additional rulemaking activities in response to legal challenges and court decisions; the cost, availability, and existing inventory of emissions allowances; the impact of future changes in generation and emissions-related technology and costs; and the fuel mix of the electric utilities. compliance costs may arise from existing unit retirements, installation of additional environmental controls, upgrades to the transmission system, closure and monitoring of ccr facilities, and adding or changing fuel sources for certain existing units. environmental compliance spending over the next several years may differ materially from the amounts estimated. such expenditures could affect unit retirement and replacement decisions and results of operations, cash flows, and financial condition if such costs are not recovered on a timely basis through regulated rates or long-term wholesale agreements for the traditional operating companies or market-based rates for southern power. further, higher costs that are recovered through regulated rates could contribute to reduced demand for electricity, which could negatively affect results of operations, cash flows, and financial condition. additionally, if southern company, any traditional operating company, or southern power fails to comply with environmental laws and regulations, even if caused by factors beyond its control, that failure may result in the assessment of civil or criminal penalties and fines and/or remediation costs. the epa has filed civil actions against alabama power and georgia power and issued notices of violation to gulf power and mississippi power alleging violations of the new source review provisions of the clean air act. an adverse outcome in any of these matters could require substantial capital expenditures that cannot be determined at this time and could possibly require payment of substantial penalties.
litigation over environmental issues and claims of various types, including property damage, personal injury, common law nuisance, and citizen enforcement of environmental requirements such as air quality and water standards, has occurred throughout the united states. this litigation has included claims for damages alleged to have been caused by co2 and other emissions, ccr, and alleged exposure to hazardous materials, and/or requests for injunctive relief in connection with such matters.
the ultimate cost impact of proposed and final legislation and regulations and litigation are likely to result in significant and additional costs and could result in additional operating restrictions.
the net income of southern company, the traditional operating companies, and southern power could be negatively impacted by changes in regulations related to transmission planning processes and competition in the wholesale electric markets.
the traditional operating companies currently own and operate transmission facilities as part of a vertically integrated utility. a small percentage of transmission revenues are collected through the wholesale electric tariff but the majority of transmission revenues are collected through retail rates. ferc rules pertaining to regional transmission planning and cost allocation present challenges to transmission planning and the wholesale market structure in the southeast. the key impacts of these rules include:
•   possible disruption of the integrated resource planning processes within the states in the southern company system's service territory;
•   delays and additional processes for developing transmission plans; and
•   possible impacts on state jurisdiction of approving, certifying, and pricing of new transmission facilities.
the ferc rules related to transmission are intended to spur the development of new transmission infrastructure to promote and i-18
index to financial statements encourage the integration of renewable sources of supply as well as facilitate competition in the wholesale market by providing more choices to wholesale power customers. in addition to the impacts on transactions contemplating physical delivery of energy, financial laws and regulations also impact power hedging and trading based on futures contracts and derivatives that are traded on various commodities exchanges as well as over-the-counter. finally, technology changes in the power and fuel industries continue to create significant impacts to wholesale transaction cost structures. southern company, the traditional operating companies, and southern power cannot predict the impact of these and other such developments, nor can they predict the effect of changes in levels of wholesale supply and demand, which are typically driven by factors beyond their control. the financial condition, net income, and cash flows of southern company, the traditional operating companies, and southern power could be adversely affected by these and other changes.
the traditional operating companies and southern power could be subject to higher costs as a result of implementing and maintaining compliance with the north american electric reliability corporation mandatory reliability standards along with possible associated penalties for non-compliance.
owners and operators of bulk power systems, including the traditional operating companies, are subject to mandatory reliability standards enacted by the north american electric reliability corporation and enforced by the ferc. compliance with or changes in the mandatory reliability standards may subject the traditional operating companies, southern power, and southern company to higher operating costs and/or increased capital expenditures. if any traditional operating company or southern power is found to be in noncompliance with the mandatory reliability standards, such traditional operating company or southern power could be subject to sanctions, including substantial monetary penalties.
operational risks the financial performance of southern company and its subsidiaries may be adversely affected if the subsidiaries are unable to successfully operate their facilities or perform certain corporate functions.
the financial performance of southern company and its subsidiaries depends on the successful operation of its subsidiaries' electric generating, transmission, and distribution facilities and the successful performance of necessary corporate functions. there are many risks that could affect these operations and performance of corporate functions, including:
•   operator error or failure of equipment or processes, particularly with older generating facilities;
•   operating limitations that may be imposed by environmental or other regulatory requirements;
•   labor disputes;
•   terrorist attacks;
•   fuel or material supply interruptions;
•   transmission disruption or capacity constraints, including with respect to the southern company system's transmission facilities and third party transmission facilities;
•   compliance with mandatory reliability standards, including mandatory cyber security standards;
•   implementation of technologies with which the southern company system is developing experience;
•   information technology system failure;
•   cyber intrusion;
•   an environmental event, such as a spill or release; and
•   catastrophic events such as fires, earthquakes, explosions, floods, droughts, hurricanes, pandemic health events such as influenzas, or other similar occurrences.
a decrease or elimination of revenues from the electric generation, transmission, or distribution facilities or an increase in the cost of operating the facilities would reduce the net income and cash flows and could adversely impact the financial condition of the affected traditional operating company or southern power and of southern company. in addition, an investment in a subsidiary with such generation, transmission, or distribution facilities could be adversely impacted.
i-19
index to financial statements operation of nuclear facilities involves inherent risks, including environmental, safety, health, regulatory, natural disasters, terrorism, and financial risks, that could result in fines or the closure of the nuclear units owned by alabama power or georgia power and which may present potential exposures in excess of insurance coverage.
alabama power owns, and contracts for the operation of, two nuclear units and georgia power holds undivided interests in, and contracts for the operation of, four existing nuclear units. the six existing units are operated by southern nuclear and represent approximately 3,680 mws, or 7.9%, of the southern company system's generation capacity as of december 31, 2014. in addition, these units generated approximately 23% and 22% of the total kwhs generated by alabama power and georgia power, respectively, in the year ended december 31, 2014. in addition, southern nuclear, on behalf of georgia power and the other co-owners, is overseeing the construction of plant vogtle units 3 and 4. due solely to the increase in nuclear generating capacity, the below risks are expected to increase incrementally once plant vogtle units 3 and 4 are operational. nuclear facilities are subject to environmental, safety, health, operational, and financial risks such as:
•   the potential harmful effects on the environment and human health and safety resulting from a release of radioactive materials in connection with the operation of nuclear facilities and the storage, handling, and disposal of radioactive material, including spent nuclear fuel;
•   uncertainties with respect to the ability to dispose of spent nuclear fuel and the need for longer term on-site storage;
•   uncertainties with respect to the technological and financial aspects of decommissioning nuclear plants at the end of licensed lives and the ability to maintain and anticipate adequate capital reserves for decommissioning;
•   limitations on the amounts and types of insurance commercially available to cover losses that might arise in connection with the nuclear operations of alabama power and georgia power or those of other commercial nuclear facility owners in the united states;
•   potential liabilities arising out of the operation of these facilities;
•   significant capital expenditures relating to maintenance, operation, security, and repair of these facilities, including repairs and upgrades required by the nrc;
•   the threat of a possible terrorist attack, including a potential cyber security attack; and
•   the potential impact of an accident or natural disaster.
it is possible that damages, decommissioning, or other costs could exceed the amount of decommissioning trusts or external insurance coverage, including statutorily required nuclear incident insurance.
the nrc has broad authority under federal law to impose licensing and safety-related requirements for the operation of nuclear generation facilities. in the event of non-compliance with nrc licensing and safety-related requirements, the nrc has the authority to impose fines and/or shut down any unit, depending upon its assessment of the severity of the situation, until compliance is achieved. nrc orders or regulations related to increased security measures and any future safety requirements promulgated by the nrc could require alabama power and georgia power to make substantial operating and capital expenditures at their nuclear plants. in addition, if a serious nuclear incident were to occur, it could result in substantial costs to alabama power or georgia power and southern company. a major incident at a nuclear facility anywhere in the world could cause the nrc to limit, prohibit, or require significant changes to the operation or licensing of any domestic nuclear unit that could result in substantial costs. moreover, a major incident at any nuclear facility in the united states, including facilities owned and operated by third parties, could require alabama power and georgia power to make material contributory payments.
in addition, potential terrorist threats and increased public scrutiny of utilities could result in increased nuclear licensing or compliance costs that are difficult to predict.
physical or cyber attacks, both threatened and actual, could impact the ability of the traditional operating companies and southern power to operate and could adversely affect financial results and liquidity.
the traditional operating companies and southern power face the risk of physical and cyber attacks, both threatened and actual, against their respective generation facilities, the transmission and distribution infrastructure used to transport power, and their information technology systems and network infrastructure, which could negatively impact the ability of the traditional operating companies or southern power to generate, transport, and deliver power, or otherwise operate their respective facilities in the most efficient manner or at all. in addition, physical or cyber attacks against key suppliers or service providers could have a similar effect on southern company and its subsidiaries.
i-20
index to financial statements the traditional operating companies and southern power operate in a highly regulated industry that requires the continued operation of sophisticated information technology systems and network infrastructure, which are part of an interconnected regional grid. in addition, in the ordinary course of business, the traditional operating companies and southern power collect and retain sensitive information including personal identification information about customers and employees and other confidential information. the traditional operating companies and southern power face on-going threats to their assets. despite the implementation of robust security measures, all assets are potentially vulnerable to disability, failures, or unauthorized access due to human error, natural disasters, technological failure, or internal or external physical or cyber attacks. if the traditional operating companies' or southern power's assets were to fail, be physically damaged, or be breached and were not recovered in a timely way, the traditional operating companies or southern power may be unable to fulfill critical business functions, and sensitive and other data could be compromised. any physical security breach, cyber breach or theft, damage, or improper disclosure of sensitive electronic data may also subject the applicable traditional operating company or southern power to penalties and claims from regulators or other third parties.
these events could harm the reputation of and negatively affect the financial results of southern company, the traditional operating companies, or southern power through lost revenues, costs to recover and repair damage, and costs associated with governmental actions in response to such attacks.
the traditional operating companies and southern power may not be able to obtain adequate fuel supplies, which could limit their ability to operate their facilities.
the traditional operating companies and southern power purchase fuel, including coal, natural gas, uranium, fuel oil, and biomass, from a number of suppliers. disruption in the delivery of fuel, including disruptions as a result of, among other things, transportation delays, weather, labor relations, force majeure events, or environmental regulations affecting any of these fuel suppliers, could limit the ability of the traditional operating companies and southern power to operate their respective facilities, and thus reduce the net income of the affected traditional operating company or southern power and southern company.
the traditional operating companies are dependent on coal for a portion of their electric generating capacity. the traditional operating companies depend on coal supply contracts, and there can be no assurance that the counterparties to these agreements will fulfill their obligations to supply coal to the traditional operating companies. the suppliers under these agreements may experience financial or technical problems which inhibit their ability to fulfill their obligations to the traditional operating companies. in addition, the suppliers under these agreements may not be required to supply coal to the traditional operating companies under certain circumstances, such as in the event of a natural disaster. if the traditional operating companies are unable to obtain their coal requirements under these contracts, the traditional operating companies may be required to purchase their coal requirements at higher prices, which may not be recoverable through rates.
in addition, the traditional operating companies and southern power to a greater extent have become more dependent on natural gas for a portion of their electric generating capacity. in many instances, the cost of purchased power for the traditional operating companies and southern power is influenced by natural gas prices. historically, natural gas prices have been more volatile than prices of other fuels. in recent years, domestic natural gas prices have been depressed by robust supplies, including production from shale gas. these market conditions, together with additional regulation of coal-fired generating units, have increased the traditional operating companies' reliance on natural gas-fired generating units.
natural gas supplies can be subject to disruption in the event production or distribution is curtailed, such as in the event of a hurricane or a pipeline failure. the availability of shale gas and potential regulations affecting its accessibility may have a material impact on the supply and cost of natural gas.
in addition, world market conditions for fuels can impact the cost and availability of natural gas, coal, and uranium.
the revenues of southern company, the traditional operating companies, and southern power depend in part on sales under ppas. the failure of a counterparty to one of these ppas to perform its obligations, or the failure to renew the ppas or successfully remarket the related generating capacity, could have a negative impact on the net income and cash flows of the affected traditional operating company or southern power and of southern company.
most of southern power's generating capacity has been sold to purchasers under ppas. in addition, the traditional operating companies enter into ppas with non-affiliated parties. revenues are dependent on the continued performance by the purchasers of their obligations under these ppas. the failure of one of the purchasers to perform its obligations could have a negative impact on the net income and cash flows of the affected traditional operating company or southern power and of southern company. although the credit evaluations undertaken and contractual protections implemented by southern power and the traditional operating companies take into account the possibility of default by a purchaser, actual exposure to a default by a purchaser may be greater than predicted or specified in the applicable contract. additionally, neither southern power nor any traditional operating company can predict whether the ppas will be renewed at the end of their respective terms or on what terms any renewals may be made.
i-21
index to financial statements changes in technology may make southern company's electric generating facilities owned by the traditional operating companies and southern power less competitive.
a key element of the business models of southern company, the traditional operating companies, and southern power is that generating power at central station power plants achieves economies of scale and produces power at a competitive cost. there are distributed generation technologies that produce power, including fuel cells, microturbines, wind turbines, and solar cells. advances in technology or changes in laws or regulations could reduce the cost of these or other alternative methods of producing power to a level that is competitive with that of most central station power electric production or result in smaller-scale, more fuel efficient, and/or more cost effective distributed generation. broader use of distributed generation by retail electric customers may also result from customers' changing perceptions of the merits of utilizing existing generation technology or tax or other economic incentives. additionally, there can be no assurance that a state psc or legislature will not attempt to modify certain aspects of the traditional operating companies' business as a result of these advances in technology. if these technologies became cost competitive and achieved sufficient scale, the market share of the traditional operating companies and southern power could be eroded, and the value of their respective electric generating facilities could be reduced. it is also possible that rapid advances in central station power generation technology could reduce the value of the current electric generating facilities owned by the traditional operating companies and southern power. changes in technology could also alter the channels through which electric customers buy or utilize power, which could reduce the revenues or increase the expenses of southern company, the traditional operating companies, or southern power. if state pscs fail to adjust rates to reflect the impact of any changes in loads, increasing self-generation, and the growth of distributed generation, the financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows of southern company and the traditional operating companies could be materially adversely affected.
failure to attract and retain an appropriately qualified workforce could negatively impact southern company's and its subsidiaries' results of operations.
events such as an aging workforce without appropriate replacements, mismatch of skill sets to future needs, or unavailability of contract resources may lead to operating challenges such as lack of resources, loss of knowledge, and a lengthy time period associated with skill development, especially with the workforce needs associated with the kemper igcc and plant vogtle units 3 and 4 construction. the southern company system's costs, including costs for contractors to replace employees, productivity costs, and safety costs, may rise. failure to hire and adequately obtain replacement employees, including the ability to transfer significant internal historical knowledge and expertise to the new employees, or the future availability and cost of contract labor may adversely affect southern company and its subsidiaries' ability to manage and operate their businesses. if southern company and its subsidiaries, including the traditional operating companies, are unable to successfully attract and retain an appropriately qualified workforce, results of operations could be negatively impacted.
construction risks southern company, the traditional operating companies, and/or southern power may incur additional costs or delays in the construction of new plants or other facilities and may not be able to recover their investments. also, existing facilities of the traditional operating companies and southern power require ongoing capital expenditures, including those to meet environmental standards.
general the businesses of the registrants require substantial capital expenditures for investments in new facilities and capital improvements to transmission, distribution, and generation facilities, including those to meet environmental standards. certain of the traditional operating companies and southern power are in the process of constructing new generating facilities and adding environmental controls equipment at existing generating facilities. the southern company system intends to continue its strategy of developing and constructing other new facilities, expanding existing facilities, and adding environmental control equipment. these types of projects are long-term in nature and in some cases include the development and construction of facilities with designs that have not been finalized or previously constructed. the completion of these types of projects without delays or significant cost overruns is subject to substantial risks, including:
•   shortages and inconsistent quality of equipment, materials, and labor;
•   labor costs and productivity;
•   work stoppages;
•   contractor or supplier delay or non-performance under construction or other agreements or non-performance by other major participants in construction projects;
i-22
index to financial statements
•   delays in or failure to receive necessary permits, approvals, tax credits, and other regulatory authorizations;
•   delays associated with start-up activities, including major equipment failure, system integration, and operations, and/or unforeseen engineering problems;
•   impacts of new and existing laws and regulations, including environmental laws and regulations;
•   the outcome of legal challenges to projects, including legal challenges to regulatory approvals;
•   failure to construct in accordance with licensing requirements;
•   continued public and policymaker support for such projects;
•   adverse weather conditions or natural disasters;
•   other unforeseen engineering problems;
•   changes in project design or scope;
•   environmental and geological conditions;
•   delays or increased costs to interconnect facilities to transmission grids; and
•   unanticipated cost increases, including materials and labor, and increased financing costs as a result of changes in market interest rates or as a result of construction schedule delays.
in addition, with respect to the construction of plant vogtle units 3 and 4 and the operation of existing nuclear units, a major incident at a nuclear facility anywhere in the world could cause the nrc to delay or prohibit construction of new nuclear units or require additional safety measures at new and existing units.
if a traditional operating company or southern power is unable to complete the development or construction of a facility or decides to delay or cancel construction of a facility, it may not be able to recover its investment in that facility and may incur substantial cancellation payments under equipment purchase orders or construction contracts. even if a construction project is completed, the total costs may be higher than estimated and there is no assurance that the traditional operating company will be able to recover such expenditures through regulated rates. in addition, construction delays and contractor performance shortfalls can result in the loss of revenues and may, in turn, adversely affect the net income and financial position of a traditional operating company or southern power and of southern company.
construction delays could result in the loss of otherwise available investment tax credits, production tax credits, and other tax incentives. furthermore, if construction projects are not completed according to specification, a traditional operating company or southern power and southern company may incur liabilities and suffer reduced plant efficiency, higher operating costs, and reduced net income.
once facilities come into commercial operation, ongoing capital expenditures are required to maintain reliable levels of operation. significant portions of the traditional operating companies' existing facilities were constructed many years ago. older generation equipment, even if maintained in accordance with good engineering practices, may require significant capital expenditures to maintain efficiency, to comply with changing environmental requirements, or to provide reliable operations.
the two largest construction projects currently underway in the southern company system are the construction of plant vogtle units 3 and 4 and the kemper igcc.
plant vogtle units 3 and 4 construction southern nuclear, on behalf of georgia power and the other co-owners, is overseeing the construction of and will operate plant vogtle units 3 and 4 (each, an approximately 1,100 mw ap1000 nuclear generating unit). georgia power owns 45.7% of the new units. the nrc certified the westinghouse electric company llc's design control document, as amended (dcd), for the ap1000 nuclear reactor design, in late 2011, and issued combined cols in early 2012. receipt of the cols allowed full construction to begin. there have been technical and procedural challenges to the construction and licensing of plant vogtle units 3 and 4, at the federal and state level, and additional challenges are expected as construction proceeds.
georgia power, opc, meag power, and dalton (collectively, vogtle owners) and westinghouse electric company llc (westinghouse) and stone & webster, inc., a subsidiary of the shaw group inc., which was acquired by chicago bridge & iron company n.v. (collectively, contractor) are involved in litigation regarding the costs associated with design changes to the dcd and the delays in the timing of approval of the dcd and issuance of the cols, including the assertion by the contractor i-23
index to financial statements that the vogtle owners are responsible for these costs under the terms of the agreement with the contractor (vogtle 3 and 4 agreement). also in 2012, georgia power and the other vogtle owners filed suit against the contractor in the u.s. district court for the southern district of georgia seeking a declaratory judgment that the vogtle owners are not responsible for these costs. in 2012, the contractor also filed suit against georgia power and the other vogtle owners in the u.s. district court for the district of columbia alleging the vogtle owners are responsible for these costs. in august 2013, the u.s. district court for the district of columbia dismissed the contractor's suit, ruling that the proper venue is the u.s. district court for the southern district of georgia. the contractor appealed the decision to the u.s. court of appeals for the district of columbia circuit in september 2013. the portion of additional costs claimed by the contractor in its initial complaint that would be attributable to georgia power (based on georgia power's ownership interest) is approximately $425 million (in 2008 dollars). the contractor also asserted it is entitled to extensions of the guaranteed substantial completion dates of april 2016 and april 2017 for plant vogtle units 3 and 4, respectively. on may 22, 2014, the contractor filed an amended counterclaim to the suit pending in the u.s. district court for the southern district of georgia alleging that (i) the design changes to the dcd imposed by the nrc delayed module production and the impacts to the contractor are recoverable by the contractor under the vogtle 3 and 4 agreement and (ii) the changes to the basemat rebar design required by the nrc caused additional costs and delays recoverable by the contractor under the vogtle 3 and 4 agreement. the contractor did not specify in its amended counterclaim the amounts relating to these new allegations; however, the contractor has subsequently asserted related minimum damages (based on georgia power's ownership interest) of $113 million. the contractor may from time to time continue to assert that it is entitled to additional payments with respect to these allegations, any of which could be substantial. georgia power has not agreed to the proposed cost or to any changes to the guaranteed substantial completion dates or that the vogtle owners have any responsibility for costs related to these issues. litigation is ongoing and georgia power intends to vigorously defend the positions of the vogtle owners. georgia power also expects negotiations with the contractor to continue with respect to cost and schedule during which negotiations the parties may reach a mutually acceptable compromise of their positions.
georgia power is required to file semi-annual vogtle construction monitoring (vcm) reports with the georgia psc by february 28 and august 31 each year. if the projected certified construction capital costs to be borne by georgia power increase by 5% or the projected in-service dates are significantly extended, georgia power is required to seek an amendment to the plant vogtle units 3 and 4 certificate from the georgia psc. georgia power's eighth vcm report filed in february 2013 requested an amendment to the certificate to increase the estimated in-service capital cost of plant vogtle units 3 and 4 from $4.4 billion to $4.8 billion and to extend the estimated in-service dates to the fourth quarter 2017 and the fourth quarter 2018 for plant vogtle units 3 and 4, respectively.
in september 2013, the georgia psc approved a stipulation (2013 stipulation) entered into by georgia power and the georgia psc staff to waive the requirement to amend the plant vogtle units 3 and 4 certificate, until the completion of plant vogtle unit 3, or earlier if deemed appropriate by the georgia psc and georgia power. in accordance with the georgia integrated resource planning act, any costs incurred by georgia power in excess of the certified amount will be included in rate base, provided georgia power shows the costs to be reasonable and prudent. in addition, financing costs on any construction-related costs in excess of the certified amount likely would be subject to recovery through afudc instead of the nuclear construction cost recovery tariff.
the georgia psc has approved eleven vcm reports covering the periods through june 30, 2014, including construction capital costs incurred, which through that date totaled $2.8 billion.
on january 29, 2015, georgia power announced that it was notified by the contractor of the contractor's revised forecast for completion of plant vogtle units 3 and 4, which would incrementally delay the previously disclosed estimated in-service dates by 18 months (from the fourth quarter of 2017 to the second quarter of 2019 for unit 3 and from the fourth quarter of 2018 to the second quarter of 2020 for unit 4). georgia power has not agreed to any changes to the guaranteed substantial completion dates of april 2016 and april 2017 for plant vogtle units 3 and 4, respectively. georgia power does not believe that the contractor's revised forecast reflects all efforts that may be possible to mitigate the contractor's delay.
in addition, georgia power believes that, pursuant to the vogtle 3 and 4 agreement, the contractor is responsible for the contractor's costs related to the contractor's delay (including any related construction and mitigation costs, which could be material) and that the vogtle owners are entitled to recover liquidated damages for the contractor's delay beyond the guaranteed substantial completion dates of april 2016 and april 2017 for plant vogtle units 3 and 4, respectively. consistent with the contractor's position in the pending litigation described above, georgia power expects the contractor to contest any claims for liquidated damages and to assert that the vogtle owners are responsible for additional costs related to the contractor's delay. the contractor's liability to the vogtle owners for schedule and performance liquidated damages and warranty claims is subject to a cap. in addition, the vogtle 3 and 4 agreement provides for limited cost sharing by the vogtle owners for contractor costs under certain conditions (which have not occurred), with maximum additional capital costs under this provision attributable to georgia power (based on georgia power's ownership interest) of approximately $114 million.

index to financial statements on february 27, 2015, georgia power filed its twelfth vcm report with the georgia psc covering the period from july 1 through december 31, 2014, which requests approval for an additional $0.2 billion of construction capital costs incurred during that period and reflects the contractor's revised forecast for completion of plant vogtle units 3 and 4 as well as additional estimated owner-related costs of approximately $10 million per month expected to result from the contractor's proposed 18-month delay, including property taxes, oversight costs, compliance costs, and other operational readiness costs. no contractor costs related to the contractor's proposed 18-month delay are included in the twelfth vcm report. additionally, while georgia power has not agreed to any change to the guaranteed substantial completion dates, the twelfth vcm report includes a requested amendment to the plant vogtle units 3 and 4 certificate to reflect the contractor's revised forecast, to include the estimated owner's costs associated with the proposed 18-month contractor delay, and to increase the estimated total in-service capital cost of plant vogtle units 3 and 4 to $5.0 billion.
georgia power will continue to incur financing costs of approximately $30 million per month until plant vogtle units 3 and 4 are placed in service. the twelfth vcm report estimates total associated financing costs during the construction period to be approximately $2.5 billion.
processes are in place that are designed to assure compliance with the requirements specified in the dcd and the cols, including inspections by southern nuclear and the nrc that occur throughout construction. as a result of such compliance processes, certain license amendment requests have been filed and approved or are pending before the nrc. various design and other licensing-based compliance issues are expected to arise as construction proceeds, which may result in additional license amendments or require other resolution. if any license amendment requests or other licensing-based compliance issues are not resolved in a timely manner, there may be delays in the project schedule that could result in increased costs either to the vogtle owners or the contractor or to both.
as construction continues, the risk remains that ongoing challenges with contractor performance including additional challenges in its fabrication, assembly, delivery, and installation of the shield building and structural modules, delays in the receipt of the remaining permits necessary for the operation of plant vogtle units 3 and 4, or other issues could arise and may further impact project schedule and cost. in addition, the irs allocated production tax credits to each of plant vogtle units 3 and 4, which require the applicable unit to be placed in service before 2021. additional claims by the contractor or georgia power (on behalf of the vogtle owners) are also likely to arise throughout construction. these claims may be resolved through formal and informal dispute resolution procedures under the engineering, procurement, and construction agreement for plant vogtle units 3 and 4, but also may be resolved through litigation.
kemper igcc construction in 2012, the mississippi psc issued a detailed order confirming the cpcn originally approved by the mississippi psc in 2010 authorizing the acquisition, construction, and operation of the kemper igcc (2012 mpsc cpcn order). the 2012 mpsc cpcn order included a certificated cost estimate of $2.4 billion, net of the doe grants and excluding the cost cap exceptions described below, and approved a construction cost cap of up to $2.88 billion, with recovery of prudently-incurred costs subject to approval by the mississippi psc. as discussed below, the 2013 settlement agreement, among other things, established processes for resolving matters regarding cost recovery (both during construction and startup and following commercial operation of the kemper igcc), including the treatment of costs in excess of the $2.88 billion cost cap.
the kemper igcc was originally projected to be placed in service in may 2014. mississippi power placed the combined cycle and the associated common facilities portion of the kemper igcc in service on natural gas on august 9, 2014 and continues to focus on completing the remainder of the kemper igcc, including the gasifier and the gas clean-up facilities, for which the in-service date is currently expected to occur in the first half of 2016.
mississippi power does not intend to seek any rate recovery or joint owner contributions for any costs related to the construction of the kemper igcc that exceed the $2.88 billion cost cap, net of the doe grants and excluding the cost of the lignite mine and equipment, the cost of the co2 pipeline facilities, afudc, and certain general exceptions, including change of law, force majeure, and beneficial capital (which exists when mississippi power demonstrates that the purpose and effect of the construction cost increase is to produce efficiencies that will result in a neutral or favorable effect on customers relative to the original proposal for the cpcn) (cost cap exceptions). through december 31, 2014, southern company and mississippi power recorded pre-tax charges to income as a result of increases to the cost estimate of $2.05 billion ($1.26 billion after tax). primarily as a result of these charges, mississippi power incurred net losses after dividends on preferred stock of $328.7 million and $476.6 million in the years ended december 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. the current estimate includes costs through march 31, 2016. any further extension of the in-service date is currently estimated to result in additional base costs of approximately $25 million to $30 million per month, which includes maintaining necessary levels of start-up labor, materials, and fuel, as well as operational resources required to execute start-up and commissioning activities. any further extension of the in-service date with respect to the kemper igcc would also increase costs for the cost cap exceptions, which are not i-25
index to financial statements subject to the $2.88 billion cost cap established by the mississippi psc. these costs include afudc, which is currently estimated to total approximately $13 million per month, as well as carrying costs and operating expenses on kemper igcc assets placed in service and consulting and legal fees, which are being deferred as regulatory assets and are estimated to total approximately $7 million per month.
any further cost increases and/or extensions of the in-service date with respect to the kemper igcc may result from factors including, but not limited to, labor costs and productivity, adverse weather conditions, shortages and inconsistent quality of equipment, materials, and labor, contractor or supplier delay, non-performance under construction or other agreements, operational readiness, including specialized operator training and required site safety programs, unforeseen engineering or design problems, start-up activities for this first-of-a-kind technology (including major equipment failure and system integration), and/or operational performance (including additional costs to satisfy any operational parameters ultimately adopted by the mississippi psc). in subsequent periods, any further changes in the estimated costs to complete construction and start-up of the kemper igcc subject to the $2.88 billion cost cap, net of the doe grants and excluding the cost cap exceptions, will be reflected in southern company's and mississippi power's statements of income and these changes could be material.
under the 2013 settlement agreement, mississippi power agreed to limit the portion of prudently-incurred kemper igcc costs to be included in retail rate base to the $2.4 billion certificated cost estimate, plus the cost cap exceptions, but excluding afudc, and any other costs permitted or determined to be excluded from the $2.88 billion cost cap by the mississippi psc. the 2013 settlement agreement also allowed mississippi power to secure alternate financing for costs not otherwise recovered in any mississippi psc rate proceedings contemplated by the 2013 settlement agreement.
legislation to authorize a multi-year rate plan and legislation to provide for alternate financing through securitization of up to $1.0 billion of prudently-incurred costs was enacted into law in february 2013. mississippi power's intent under the 2013 settlement agreement was to securitize (1) prudently-incurred costs in excess of the certificated cost estimate and up to the $2.88 billion cost cap, net of the doe grants and excluding the cost cap exceptions, (2) accrued afudc, and (3) other prudently-incurred costs, which include carrying costs from the estimated in-service date until securitization is finalized and other costs not included in the rate mitigation plan (described below) as approved by the mississippi psc.
consistent with the terms of the 2013 settlement agreement, in march 2013, the mississippi psc issued a rate order (2013 mpsc rate order), approving retail rate increases of 15% effective march 19, 2013 and 3% effective january 1, 2014, which collectively were designed to collect $156 million annually beginning in 2014. for the period from march 2013 through december 31, 2014, $257.2 million had been collected primarily to be used to mitigate customer rate impacts after the kemper igcc is placed in service.
on august 18, 2014, mississippi power provided the mississippi psc with an analysis of the costs and benefits of placing the combined cycle and the associated common facilities portion of the kemper igcc in service, including the expected accounting treatment. mississippi power's analysis requested, among other things, confirmation by the mississippi psc of the continued collection of rates as prescribed by the 2013 mpsc rate order, with the current recognition as revenue of the related equity return on all assets placed in service and the deferral of all remaining rate collections under the 2013 mpsc rate order to a regulatory liability account. as discussed further below, a february 2015 decision of the mississippi supreme court would discontinue the collection of, and require the refund of, all amounts previously collected under the 2013 mpsc rate order.
in addition, mississippi power's august 18, 2014 filing with the mississippi psc requested confirmation of mississippi power's accounting treatment by the mississippi psc of the continued accrual of afudc through the in-service date of the remainder of the kemper igcc and the deferral of operating costs as regulatory assets. any action by the mississippi psc that is inconsistent with the treatment requested by mississippi power could have a material impact on the results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity of mississippi power and southern company.
also consistent with the 2013 settlement agreement, mississippi power has filed with the mississippi psc a rate recovery plan for the kemper igcc for cost recovery through 2020 (rate mitigation plan), which is still under review by the mississippi psc. the revenue requirements set forth in the rate mitigation plan assume the sale of a 15% undivided interest in the kemper igcc to smepa and utilization of bonus depreciation, which currently requires that the related long-term asset be placed in service in 2015.
on february 12, 2015, the mississippi supreme court (court) issued its decision in the legal challenge to the 2013 mpsc rate order filed by thomas a. blanton. the court reversed the 2013 mpsc rate order based on, among other things, its findings that (1) the collection of $156 million annually to be set aside in a regulatory liability account for use in mitigating future rate impacts for customers (mirror cwip) was not provided for under the baseload act and (2) the mississippi psc should have determined the prudence of kemper igcc costs before approving rate recovery through the 2013 mpsc rate order. the court also found the 2013 settlement agreement unenforceable due to a lack of public notice for the related proceedings. the court's ruling remands the matter to the mississippi psc to (1) fix by order the rates that were in existence prior to the 2013 mpsc i-26
index to financial statements rate order, (2) fix no rate increases until the mississippi psc is in compliance with the court's ruling, and (3) enter an order refunding amounts collected under the 2013 mpsc rate order. through december 31, 2014, mississippi power had collected $257.2 million through rates under the 2013 mpsc rate order. any required refunds would also include carrying costs. the court's decision will become legally effective upon the issuance of a mandate to the mississippi psc. absent specific instruction from the court, the mississippi psc will determine the method and timing of the refund. mississippi power is reviewing the court's decision and expects to file a motion for rehearing which would stay the court's mandate until either the case is reheard and decided or seven days after the court issues its order denying mississippi power's request for rehearing. mississippi power is also evaluating its regulatory options.
to the extent that refunds of amounts collected under the 2013 mpsc rate order are required on a schedule different from the amortization schedule proposed in the rate mitigation plan, the customer billing impacts proposed under the rate mitigation plan would no longer be viable.
in the event that the mirror cwip regulatory liability is refunded to customers prior to the in-service date of the kemper igcc and is, therefore, not available to mitigate rate impacts under the rate mitigation plan, the mississippi psc does not approve a refund schedule that facilitates rate mitigation, or mississippi power withdraws the rate mitigation plan, mississippi power would seek rate recovery through alternate means, which could include a traditional rate case.
in addition to current estimated costs at december 31, 2014 of $6.20 billion, mississippi power anticipates that it will incur additional costs after the kemper igcc in-service date until the kemper igcc cost recovery approach is finalized. these costs include, but are not limited to, regulatory costs and additional carrying costs which could be material. recovery of these costs would be subject to approval by the mississippi psc.
the mississippi psc's review of kemper igcc costs is ongoing. on august 5, 2014, the mississippi psc ordered that a consolidated prudence determination of all kemper igcc costs be completed after the entire project has been placed in service and has demonstrated availability for a reasonable period of time as determined by the mississippi psc and the mississippi public utilities staff. the mississippi psc has encouraged the parties to work in good faith to settle contested issues and mississippi power is working to reach a mutually acceptable resolution. as a result of the court's decision, mississippi power intends to request that the mississippi psc reconsider its prudence review schedule.
mississippi power expects the mississippi psc to include operational parameters in its evaluation of the rate mitigation plan and other related proceedings during the operation of the kemper igcc. to the extent the kemper igcc does not satisfy the operational parameters ultimately adopted by the mississippi psc or mississippi power incurs additional costs in order to satisfy such parameters, there could be a material adverse effect on southern company's and mississippi power's results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity.
in addition, any failure to place the kemper igcc in-service by april 15, 2016 or to capture and sequester (via enhanced oil recovery) at least 65% of the carbon dioxide produced by the kemper igcc during operations in accordance with irs requirements would result in the loss of phase ii tax credits that have been allocated to the kemper igcc. through december 31, 2014, southern company and mississippi power have recorded tax benefits totaling $276 million, of which approximately $210 million have been utilized through that date.
the ultimate outcome of these matters, including the resolution of legal challenges, determinations of prudency, and the specific manner of recovery of prudently-incurred costs, is subject to further regulatory actions and cannot be determined at this time.
financial, economic, and market risks the generation operations and energy marketing operations of southern company, the traditional operating companies, and southern power are subject to risks, many of which are beyond their control, including changes in power prices and fuel costs, that may reduce southern company's, the traditional operating companies', and/or southern power's revenues and increase costs.
the generation operations and energy marketing operations of the southern company system are subject to changes in power prices and fuel costs, which could increase the cost of producing power or decrease the amount received from the sale of power. the market prices for these commodities may fluctuate significantly over relatively short periods of time. among the factors that could influence power prices and fuel costs are:
•   prevailing market prices for coal, natural gas, uranium, fuel oil, biomass, and other fuels used in the generation facilities of the traditional operating companies and southern power, including associated transportation costs, and supplies of such commodities;
•   demand for energy and the extent of additional supplies of energy available from current or new competitors;
i-27
index to financial statements
•   liquidity in the general wholesale electricity market;
•   weather conditions impacting demand for electricity;
•   seasonality;
•   transmission or transportation constraints, disruptions, or inefficiencies;
•   availability of competitively priced alternative energy sources;
•   forced or unscheduled plant outages for the southern company system, its competitors, or third party providers;
•   the financial condition of market participants;
•   the economy in the service territory, the nation, and worldwide, including the impact of economic conditions on demand for electricity and the demand for fuels;
•   natural disasters, wars, embargos, acts of terrorism, and other catastrophic events; and
•   federal, state, and foreign energy and environmental regulation and legislation.
certain of these factors could increase the expenses of the traditional operating companies or southern power and southern company. for the traditional operating companies, such increases may not be fully recoverable through rates. other of these factors could reduce the revenues of the traditional operating companies or southern power and southern company.
historically, the traditional operating companies from time to time have experienced underrecovered fuel cost balances and may experience such balances in the future. while the traditional operating companies are generally authorized to recover underrecovered fuel costs through fuel cost recovery clauses, recovery may be denied if costs are deemed to be imprudently incurred, and delays in the authorization of such recovery could negatively impact the cash flows of the affected traditional operating company and southern company.
southern company, the traditional operating companies, and southern power are subject to risks associated with a changing economic environment, customer behaviors, and adoption patterns of technologies by the customers of the traditional operating companies and southern power.
the consumption and use of energy are fundamentally linked to economic activity. this relationship is affected over time by changes in the economy, customer behaviors, and technologies. any economic downturn could negatively impact customer growth and usage per customer, thus reducing the sales of electricity and revenues. additionally, any economic downturn or disruption of financial markets, both nationally and internationally, could negatively affect the financial stability of customers and counterparties of the traditional operating companies and southern power.
outside of economic disruptions, changes in customer behaviors in response to changing conditions and preferences or changes in the adoption of technologies could affect the relationship of economic activity to the consumption of electricity. on the customer behavior side, federal and state programs exist to influence how customers use energy, and several of the traditional operating companies have psc mandates to promote energy efficiency. the adoption of technology by customers can have both positive and negative impacts on sales. many new technologies utilize less energy than in the past. however, new electric technologies such as electric vehicles can create additional demand. there can be no assurance that the southern company system's planning processes will appropriately estimate and incorporate the impacts of changes in customer behavior, state and federal programs, psc mandates, and technology.
all of the factors discussed above could adversely affect southern company's, the traditional operating companies', and/or southern power's results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity.
the operating results of southern company, the traditional operating companies, and southern power are affected by weather conditions and may fluctuate on a seasonal and quarterly basis. in addition, significant weather events, such as hurricanes, tornadoes, floods, droughts, and winter storms, could result in substantial damage to or limit the operation of the properties of the traditional operating companies and/or southern power and could negatively impact results of operation, financial condition, and liquidity.
electric power supply is generally a seasonal business. in many parts of the country, demand for power peaks during the summer months, with market prices also peaking at that time. in other areas, power demand peaks during the winter. as a result, the overall operating results of southern company, the traditional operating companies, and southern power may fluctuate substantially on a seasonal basis. in addition, the traditional operating companies and southern power have historically sold less power when weather conditions are milder. unusually mild weather in the future could reduce the i-28
index to financial statements revenues, net income, and available cash of southern company, the traditional operating companies, and/or southern power.
in addition, volatile or significant weather events could result in substantial damage to the transmission and distribution lines of the traditional operating companies and the generating facilities of the traditional operating companies and southern power. the traditional operating companies and southern power have significant investments in the atlantic and gulf coast regions which could be subject to major storm activity. further, severe drought conditions can reduce the availability of water and restrict or prevent the operation of certain generating facilities.
in the event a traditional operating company experiences any of these weather events or any natural disaster or other catastrophic event, recovery of costs in excess of reserves and insurance coverage is subject to the approval of its state psc. historically, the traditional operating companies from time to time have experienced deficits in their storm cost recovery reserve balances and may experience such deficits in the future. any denial by the applicable state psc or delay in recovery of any portion of such costs could have a material negative impact on a traditional operating company's and southern company's results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity.
in addition, damages resulting from significant weather events within the service territory of any traditional operating company or affecting southern power's customers may result in the loss of customers and reduced demand for electricity for extended periods. any significant loss of customers or reduction in demand for electricity could have a material negative impact on a traditional operating company's or southern power's and southern company's results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity.
acquisitions and dispositions may not result in anticipated benefits and may present risks not originally contemplated, which may have a material adverse effect on the liquidity, results of operations, and financial condition of southern company and its subsidiaries.
southern company and its subsidiaries have made significant acquisitions and dispositions in the past and may in the future make additional acquisitions and dispositions. southern power, in particular, continually seeks opportunities to create value through various transactions, including acquisitions or sales of assets.
southern company and its subsidiaries may face significant competition for acquisition opportunities and there can be no assurance that anticipated acquisitions will be completed on acceptable terms or at all. in addition, these transactions are intended to, but may not, result in the generation of cash or income, the realization of savings, the creation of efficiencies, or the reduction of risk. these transactions may also affect the liquidity, results of operations, and financial condition of southern company and its subsidiaries.
these transactions also involve risks, including:
•   any acquisitions may not result in an increase in income or provide an adequate return of capital or other anticipated benefits;
•   any acquisitions may not be successfully integrated into the acquiring company's operations and internal controls;
•   the due diligence conducted prior to an acquisition may not uncover situations that could result in financial or legal exposure or the acquiring company may not appropriately evaluate the likelihood or quantify the exposure from identified risks;
•   any disposition may result in decreased earnings, revenue, or cash flow;
•   use of cash for acquisitions may adversely affect cash available for capital expenditures and other uses; or
•   any dispositions, investments, or acquisitions could have a material adverse effect on the liquidity, results of operations, or financial condition of southern company or its subsidiaries.
southern company may be unable to meet its ongoing and future financial obligations and to pay dividends on its common stock if its subsidiaries are unable to pay upstream dividends or repay funds to southern company.
southern company is a holding company and, as such, southern company has no operations of its own. substantially all of southern company's consolidated assets are held by subsidiaries. southern company's ability to meet its financial obligations and to pay dividends on its common stock is primarily dependent on the net income and cash flows of its subsidiaries and their ability to pay upstream dividends or to repay funds to southern company. prior to funding southern company, southern company's subsidiaries have regulatory restrictions and financial obligations that must be satisfied, including among others, debt service and preferred and preference stock dividends. southern company's subsidiaries are separate legal entities and have no obligation to provide southern company with funds.
i-29
index to financial statements a downgrade in the credit ratings of southern company, any of the traditional operating companies, or southern power company could negatively affect their ability to access capital at reasonable costs and/or could require southern company, the traditional operating companies, or southern power company to post collateral or replace certain indebtedness.
there are a number of factors that rating agencies evaluate to arrive at credit ratings for southern company, the traditional operating companies, and southern power company, including capital structure, regulatory environment, the ability to cover liquidity requirements, and other commitments for capital. southern company, the traditional operating companies, and southern power company could experience a downgrade in their ratings if any rating agency concludes that the level of business or financial risk of the industry or southern company, the traditional operating companies, or southern power company has deteriorated. changes in ratings methodologies by the agencies could also have a negative impact on credit ratings. if one or more rating agencies downgrade southern company, the traditional operating companies, or southern power company, borrowing costs would increase, the pool of investors and funding sources would likely decrease, and, particularly for any downgrade to below investment grade, significant collateral requirements may be triggered in a number of contracts. any credit rating downgrades could require a traditional operating company or southern power company to alter the mix of debt financing currently used, and could require the issuance of secured indebtedness and/or indebtedness with additional restrictive covenants.
demand for power could decrease or fail to grow at expected rates, resulting in stagnant or reduced revenues, limited growth opportunities, and potentially stranded generation assets.
southern company, the traditional operating companies, and southern power each engage in a long-term planning process to estimate the optimal mix and timing of new generation assets required to serve future load obligations. this planning process must look many years into the future in order to accommodate the long lead times associated with the permitting and construction of new generation facilities. inherent risk exists in predicting demand this far into the future as these future loads are dependent on many uncertain factors, including regional economic conditions, customer usage patterns, efficiency programs, and customer technology adoption. because regulators may not permit the traditional operating companies to adjust rates to recover the costs of new generation assets while such assets are being constructed, the traditional operating companies may not be able to fully recover these costs or may have exposure to regulatory lag associated with the time between the incurrence of costs of additional capacity and the traditional operating companies' recovery in customers' rates. in addition, under southern power's model of selling capacity and energy at negotiated market-based rates under long-term ppas, southern power might not be able to fully execute its business plan if market prices drop below original forecasts. southern power and/or the traditional operating companies may not be able to extend existing ppas or to find new buyers for existing generation assets as existing ppas expire, or they may be forced to market these assets at prices lower than originally intended. these situations could have negative impacts on net income and cash flows for the affected traditional operating company or southern power and for southern company.
demand for power could exceed supply capacity, resulting in increased costs for purchasing capacity in the open market or building additional generation and transmission facilities.
the traditional operating companies and southern power are currently obligated to supply power to retail customers and wholesale customers under long-term ppas. at peak times, the demand for power required to meet this obligation could exceed the southern company system's available generation capacity. market or competitive forces may require that the traditional operating companies or southern power purchase capacity on the open market or build additional generation and transmission facilities. because regulators may not permit the traditional operating companies to pass all of these purchase or construction costs on to their customers, the traditional operating companies may not be able to recover some or all of these costs or may have exposure to regulatory lag associated with the time between the incurrence of costs of purchased or constructed capacity and the traditional operating companies' recovery in customers' rates. under southern power's long-term fixed price ppas, southern power would not have the ability to recover any of these costs. these situations could have negative impacts on net income and cash flows for the affected traditional operating company or southern power and for southern company.
energy conservation and energy price increases could negatively impact financial results.
customers could voluntarily reduce their consumption of electricity in response to decreases in their disposable income, increases in energy prices, or individual conservation efforts, which could negatively impact the results of operations of southern company, the traditional operating companies, and southern power. in addition, a number of regulatory and legislative bodies have proposed or introduced requirements and/or incentives to reduce energy consumption by certain dates. conservation programs could impact the financial results of southern company, the traditional operating companies, and southern power in different ways. for example, if any traditional operating company is required to invest in conservation measures that result in reduced sales from effective conservation, regulatory lag in adjusting rates for the impact of these measures could have a negative financial impact on such traditional operating company and southern company.
i-30
index to financial statements certain of the traditional operating companies actively promote energy conservation programs, which have been approved by their respective state pscs. for certain of such traditional operating companies, regulatory mechanisms have been established that provide for the recovery of costs related to such programs and lost revenues as a result of such programs. however, to the extent conservation results in reduced energy demand or significantly slows the growth in demand beyond what is anticipated, the value of generation assets of the traditional operating companies and/or southern power and other unregulated business activities could be adversely impacted and the traditional operating companies could be negatively impacted depending on the regulatory treatment of the associated impacts. in addition, the failure of those traditional operating companies that actively promote energy conservation programs to achieve the energy conservation targets established by their respective state pscs could negatively impact such traditional operating companies' ability to recover costs and lost revenues as a result of such progress and ability to receive certain benefits related to such programs.
southern company, the traditional operating companies, and southern power are unable to determine what impact, if any, conservation and increases in energy prices will have on their respective financial condition or results of operations.
the businesses of southern company, the traditional operating companies, and southern power are dependent on their ability to successfully access funds through capital markets and financial institutions. the inability of southern company, any traditional operating company, or southern power to access funds may limit its ability to execute its business plan by impacting its ability to fund capital investments or acquisitions that southern company, the traditional operating companies, or southern power may otherwise rely on to achieve future earnings and cash flows.
southern company, the traditional operating companies, and southern power rely on access to both short-term money markets and longer-term capital markets as a significant source of liquidity for capital requirements not satisfied by the cash flow from their respective operations. if southern company, any traditional operating company, or southern power is not able to access capital at competitive rates or on favorable terms, its ability to implement its business plan will be limited by impacting its ability to fund capital investments or acquisitions that southern company, the traditional operating companies, or southern power may otherwise rely on to achieve future earnings and cash flows. in addition, southern company, the traditional operating companies, and southern power rely on committed bank lending agreements as back-up liquidity which allows them to access low cost money markets. each of southern company, the traditional operating companies, and southern power believes that it will maintain sufficient access to these financial markets based upon current credit ratings. however, certain events or market disruptions may increase the cost of borrowing or adversely affect the ability to raise capital through the issuance of securities or other borrowing arrangements or the ability to secure committed bank lending agreements used as back-up sources of capital. such disruptions could include:
•   an economic downturn or uncertainty;
•   bankruptcy or financial distress at an unrelated energy company, financial institution, or sovereign entity;
•   capital markets volatility and disruption, either nationally or internationally;
•   changes in tax policy such as dividend tax rates;
•   market prices for electricity and gas;
•   terrorist attacks or threatened attacks on southern company's facilities or unrelated energy companies' facilities;
•   war or threat of war; or
•   the overall health of the utility and financial institution industries.
in addition, georgia power's ability to make future borrowings through its term loan credit facility with the federal financing bank is subject to the satisfaction of customary conditions, as well as certification of compliance with the requirements of the loan guarantee program under title xvii of the energy policy act of 2005, including accuracy of project-related representations and warranties, delivery of updated project-related information and evidence of compliance with the prevailing wage requirements of the davis-bacon act of 1931, as amended, compliance with the cargo preference act of 1954, and certification from the doe's consulting engineer that proceeds of the advances are used to reimburse certain costs of construction relating to plant vogtle units 3 and 4 that are eligible for financing under the title xvii loan guarantee program.
market performance and other changes may decrease the value of benefit plans and nuclear decommissioning trust assets or may increase plan costs, which then could require significant additional funding.
the performance of the capital markets affects the values of the assets held in trust under southern company's pension and postretirement benefit plans and the assets held in trust to satisfy obligations to decommission alabama power's and georgia power's nuclear plants. the southern company system has significant obligations related to pension and postretirement benefit i-31
index to financial statements plans. alabama power and georgia power each hold significant assets in the nuclear decommissioning trusts. these assets are subject to market fluctuations and will yield uncertain returns, which may fall below projected return rates. a decline in the market value of these assets may increase the funding requirements relating to benefit plan liabilities of the southern company system and alabama power's and georgia power's nuclear decommissioning obligations. additionally, changes in interest rates affect the liabilities under pension and postretirement benefit plans of the southern company system; as interest rates decrease, the liabilities increase, potentially requiring additional funding. further, changes in demographics, including an increased number of retirements or changes in life expectancy assumptions, may also increase the funding requirements of the obligations related to the pension benefit plans. southern company and its subsidiaries are also facing rising medical benefit costs, including the current costs for active and retired employees. it is possible that these costs may increase at a rate that is significantly higher than anticipated. if the southern company system is unable to successfully manage benefit plan assets and medical benefit costs and alabama power and georgia power are unable to successfully manage the nuclear decommissioning trust funds, results of operations and financial position could be negatively affected.
southern company, the traditional operating companies, and southern power are subject to risks associated with their ability to obtain adequate insurance at acceptable costs.
the financial condition of some insurance companies, the threat of terrorism, and natural disasters, among other things, could have disruptive effects on insurance markets. the availability of insurance covering risks that southern company, the traditional operating companies, southern power, and their respective competitors typically insure against may decrease, and the insurance that southern company, the traditional operating companies, and southern power are able to obtain may have higher deductibles, higher premiums, and more restrictive policy terms. further, there is no guarantee that the insurance policies maintained by the southern company, the traditional operating companies, and southern power will cover all of the potential exposures or the actual amount of loss incurred.
any losses not covered by insurance, or any increases in the cost of applicable insurance, could adversely affect the results of operations, cash flows, or financial condition of southern company, the traditional operating companies, or southern power.
the use of derivative contracts by southern company and its subsidiaries in the normal course of business could result in financial losses that negatively impact the net income of southern company and its subsidiaries.
southern company and its subsidiaries, including the traditional operating companies and southern power, use derivative instruments, such as swaps, options, futures, and forwards, to manage their commodity and interest rate exposures and, to a lesser extent, engage in limited trading activities. southern company and its subsidiaries could recognize financial losses as a result of volatility in the market values of these contracts or if a counterparty fails to perform. these risks are managed through risk management policies, limits, and procedures. these risk management policies, limits, and procedures might not work as planned and cannot entirely eliminate the risks associated with these activities. in addition, derivative contracts entered for hedging purposes might not off-set the underlying exposure being hedged as expected, resulting in financial losses. in the absence of actively quoted market prices and pricing information from external sources, the valuation of these financial instruments can involve management's judgment or use of estimates. the factors used in the valuation of these instruments become more difficult to predict and the calculations become less reliable the further into the future these estimates are made. as a result, changes in the underlying assumptions or use of alternative valuation methods could affect the value of the reported fair value of these contracts.

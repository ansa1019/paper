item 1a.    risk factors this annual report on form 10-k contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of section 27a of the securities act of 1933, section 21e of the exchange act and the private securities litigation reform act of 1995. also, documents that we "incorporate by reference" into this annual report on form 10-k, including documents that we subsequently file with the sec will contain forward-looking statements. when we refer to forward-looking statements or information, sometimes we use words such as "may," "will," "could," "should," "plans," "intends," "expects," "believes," "estimates," "anticipates" and "continues." in particular, the below risk factors describe forward-looking information. the risk factors describe risks that may affect these statements but are not all-inclusive, particularly with respect to possible future events. many things can happen that can cause actual results to be different from those we describe. these factors include, but are not limited to the following:
revenue from our properties may be reduced or limited if the retail operations of our tenants are not successful.
revenue from our properties depends primarily on the ability of our tenants to pay the full amount of rent and other charges due under their leases on a timely basis. some of our leases provide for the payment, in addition to base rent, of additional rent above the base amount according to a specified percentage of the gross sales generated by the tenants and generally provide for reimbursement of real estate taxes and expenses of operating the property. economic conditions may impact the success of our tenants' retail operations and therefore the amount of rent and expense reimbursements we receive from our tenants. demand for our retail spaces has been strong and while there can be no assurance that this will continue, we remain optimistic given the trends we have seen over the past few years. however, any reduction in our tenants' abilities to pay base rent, percentage rent or other charges on a timely basis, including the filing by any of our tenants for bankruptcy protection, will adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. in the event of default by a tenant, we may experience delays and unexpected costs in enforcing our rights as landlord under lease terms, which may also adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.
our net income depends on the success and continued presence of our "anchor" tenants.
our net income could be adversely affected in the event of a downturn in the business, or the bankruptcy or insolvency, of any anchor store or anchor tenant. anchor tenants generally occupy large amounts of square footage, pay a significant portion of the total rents at a property and contribute to the success of other tenants by drawing significant numbers of customers to a property. the closing of one or more anchor stores at a property could adversely affect that property and result in lease terminations by, or reductions in rent from, other tenants whose leases may permit termination or rent reduction in those circumstances or whose own operations may suffer as a result. while our anchor tenant space is currently well occupied, we have seen an overall decrease in the number of tenants available to fill anchor spaces. therefore, tenant demand for certain of our anchor spaces may decrease and as a result, we may see an increase in vacancy and/or a decrease in rents for those spaces that could have a negative impact to our net income.
we may be unable to collect balances due from tenants that file for bankruptcy protection.
if a tenant or lease guarantor files for bankruptcy, we may not be able to collect all pre-petition amounts owed by that party. in addition, a tenant that files for bankruptcy protection may terminate our lease in which event we would have a general unsecured claim that would likely be for less than the full amount owed to us for the remainder of the lease term, which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.
we may experience difficulty or delay in renewing leases or re-leasing space.
we derive most of our revenue directly or indirectly from rent received from our tenants. we are subject to the risks that, upon expiration or termination of leases, whether by their terms, as a result of a tenant bankruptcy, general economic conditions or otherwise, leases for space in our properties may not be renewed, space may not be re-leased, or the terms of renewal or re-lease, including the cost of required renovations or concessions to tenants, may be less favorable than current lease terms and may include decreases in rental rates. as a result, our net income could be reduced.
the amount of debt we have and the restrictions imposed by that debt could adversely affect our business and financial condition.
as of december 31, 2014, we had approximately $2.4 billion of debt outstanding. of that outstanding debt, approximately $563.7 million was secured by all or a portion of 14 of our real estate projects and approximately $71.6 million represented capital lease obligations on four of our properties. in addition, we own a 30% interest in a joint venture that had $34.4 million of debt secured by two properties as of december 31, 2014. approximately $2.4 billion (99.6%) of our debt as of december 31, 2014 is fixed rate debt, which includes all of our property secured debt, our capital lease obligations and our $275.0 million term loan as the rate is effectively fixed by two interest rate swap agreements. our unconsolidated joint venture's debt of $34.4
7
million is also fixed rate debt. our organizational documents do not limit the level or amount of debt that we may incur. the amount of our debt outstanding from time to time could have important consequences to our shareholders. for example, it could:
•   require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to payments on our debt, thereby reducing funds available for operations, property acquisitions, redevelopments and other appropriate business opportunities that may arise in the future;
•   limit our ability to make distributions on our outstanding common shares and preferred shares;
•   make it difficult to satisfy our debt service requirements;
•   require us to dedicate increased amounts of our cash flow from operations to payments on debt upon refinancing or on our variable rate, unhedged debt, if interest rates rise;
•   limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the factors that affect the profitability of our business;
•   limit our ability to obtain any additional debt or equity financing we may need in the future for working capital, debt refinancing, capital expenditures, acquisitions, redevelopments or other general corporate purposes or to obtain such financing on favorable terms; and/or
•   limit our flexibility in conducting our business, which may place us at a disadvantage compared to competitors with less debt or debt with less restrictive terms.
our ability to make scheduled payments of the principal of, to pay interest on, or to refinance our indebtedness will depend primarily on our future performance, which to a certain extent is subject to economic, financial, competitive and other factors beyond our control. there can be no assurance that our business will continue to generate sufficient cash flow from operations in the future to service our debt or meet our other cash needs. if we are unable to generate this cash flow from our business, we may be required to refinance all or a portion of our existing debt, sell assets or obtain additional financing to meet our debt obligations and other cash needs, including the payment of dividends required to maintain our status as a real estate investment trust. we cannot assure you that any such refinancing, sale of assets or additional financing would be possible on terms that we would find acceptable.
we are obligated to comply with financial and other covenants pursuant to our debt obligations that could restrict our operating activities, and the failure to comply with such covenants could result in defaults that accelerate payment under our debt agreements.
our revolving credit facility, term loan and certain series of notes include financial covenants that may limit our operating activities in the future. we are also required to comply with additional covenants that include, among other things, provisions:
•   relating to the maintenance of property securing a mortgage;
•   restricting our ability to pledge assets or create liens;
•   restricting our ability to incur additional debt;
•   restricting our ability to amend or modify existing leases at properties securing a mortgage;
•   restricting our ability to enter into transactions with affiliates; and
•   restricting our ability to consolidate, merge or sell all or substantially all of our assets.
as of december 31, 2014, we were in compliance with all of our financial covenants. if we were to breach any of our debt covenants, including the covenants listed above, and did not cure the breach within any applicable cure period, our lenders could require us to repay the debt immediately, and, if the debt is secured, could immediately begin proceedings to take possession of the property securing the loan. many of our debt arrangements, including our public notes, term loan and our revolving credit facility, are cross-defaulted, which means that the lenders under those debt arrangements can put us in default and require immediate repayment of their debt if we breach and fail to cure a default under certain of our other debt obligations. as a result, any default under our debt covenants could have an adverse effect on our financial condition, our results of operations, our ability to meet our obligations and the market value of our shares.
our development activities have inherent risks.
the ground-up development of improvements on real property, as opposed to the renovation and redevelopment of existing improvements, presents substantial risks. we generally do not look to acquire raw land for future development; however, we do intend to complete the development and construction of future phases of projects we already own, such as santana row in san jose, california, assembly row in somerville, massachusetts, and pike & rose in north bethesda, maryland. we may undertake development of these and other projects on our own or bring in third parties if it is justifiable on a risk-adjusted return basis. we may also choose to delay completion of a project if market conditions do not allow an appropriate return. if conditions arise and we are not able or decide not to complete a project or if the expected cash flows of our project do not exceed the book value, an impairment of the project may be required. if additional phases of any of our existing projects or if any new projects are not successful, it may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.
8
during 2014, construction on phase i of both assembly row and pike & rose continued with portions of both projects opening in 2014 and the remainder of phase i of both projects expected to be completed in 2015. additionally, we plan to proceed with the development of phase ii at pike & rose with construction expected to commence in the first half of 2015. at santana row, we completed and stabilized the new 212 unit residential building and commenced construction in q4 2014 on a new 225,500 square foot office building. a further discussion of these projects, expected costs, and current status can be found in item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in the "outlook" subsection.
in addition to the risks associated with real estate investment in general, as described elsewhere and the specific risks above, the risks associated with our remaining development activities include:
•   contractor changes may delay the completion of development projects and increase overall costs;
•   significant time lag between commencement and stabilization subjects us to greater risks due to fluctuations in the general economy;
•   delivery of residential product (both rental units and for sale condominium units) into uncertain residential environments may result in lower rents or sale prices than underwritten;
•   substantial amount of our investment is related to infrastructure, the value of which may be negatively impacted if we do not complete subsequent phases;
•   failure or inability to obtain construction or permanent financing on favorable terms;
•   failure or inability to obtain public funding from governmental agencies to fund infrastructure projects, including expected public funding in connection with our development at assembly row;
•   expenditure of money and time on projects that may never be completed;
•   the third-party developer of office or other buildings may not deliver or may encounter delays in delivering space as planned;
•   difficulty securing key anchor or other tenants may impact occupancy rates and projected revenue;
•   inability to achieve projected rental rates or anticipated pace of lease-up;
•   higher than estimated construction or operating costs, including labor and material costs; and
•   possible delay in completion of a project because of a number of factors, including weather, labor disruptions, construction delays or delays in receipt of zoning or other regulatory approvals, acts of terror or other acts of violence, or acts of god (such as fires, earthquakes or floods).
redevelopments and acquisitions may fail to perform as expected.
our investment strategy includes the redevelopment and acquisition of high quality, retail focused properties in densely populated areas with high average household incomes and significant barriers to adding competitive retail supply. the redevelopment and acquisition of properties entail risks that include the following, any of which could adversely affect our results of operations and our ability to meet our obligations:
•   our estimate of the costs to improve, reposition or redevelop a property may prove to be too low, or the time we estimate to complete the improvement, repositioning or redevelopment may be too short. as a result, the property may fail to achieve the returns we have projected, either temporarily or for a longer time;
•   we may not be able to identify suitable properties to acquire or may be unable to complete the acquisition of the properties we identify;
•   we may not be able to integrate an acquisition into our existing operations successfully;
•   properties we redevelop or acquire may fail to achieve the occupancy or rental rates we project, within the time frames we project, at the time we make the decision to invest, which may result in the properties' failure to achieve the returns we projected;
•   our pre-acquisition evaluation of the physical condition of each new investment may not detect certain defects or identify necessary repairs until after the property is acquired, which could significantly increase our total acquisition costs or decrease cash flow from the property; and
•   our investigation of a property or building prior to our acquisition, and any representations we may receive from the seller of such building or property, may fail to reveal various liabilities, which could reduce the cash flow from the property or increase our acquisition cost.
our ability to grow will be limited if we cannot obtain additional capital.
our growth strategy is focused on the redevelopment of properties we already own and the acquisition of additional properties. we believe that it will be difficult to fund our expected growth with cash from operating activities because, in addition to other requirements, we are generally required to distribute to our shareholders at least 90% of our taxable income each year to continue to qualify as a reit for federal income tax purposes. as a result, we must rely primarily upon the availability of debt or equity capital, which may or may not be available on favorable terms or at all. debt could include the sale of debt securities and mortgage loans from third parties. if economic conditions and conditions in the capital markets are not favorable at the time we need to raise capital, we may need to obtain capital on less favorable terms. additionally, we cannot guarantee that
9
additional financing, refinancing or other capital will be available in the amounts we desire or on favorable terms. our access to debt or equity capital depends on a number of factors, including the market's perception of our growth potential and risk profile, our ability to pay dividends, and our current and potential future earnings. depending on the outcome of these factors as well as the impact of the economic environment, we could experience delay or difficulty in implementing our growth strategy on satisfactory terms, or be unable to implement this strategy.
rising interest rates could adversely affect our cash flow and the market price of our outstanding debt and preferred shares.
of our approximately $2.4 billion of debt outstanding as of december 31, 2014, approximately $284.4 million bears interest at variable rates of which $275.0 million is effectively fixed through two interest rate swap agreements. we have a $600.0 million revolving credit facility, on which no balance is outstanding at december 31, 2014, that bears interest at libor plus 90 basis points. we may borrow additional funds at variable interest rates in the future. increases in interest rates would increase the interest expense on our variable rate debt and reduce our cash flow, which could adversely affect our ability to service our debt and meet our other obligations and also could reduce the amount we are able to distribute to our shareholders. the interest rate on our $275.0 million term loan is currently fixed at 2.62% as a result of two interest rate swap agreements. we may enter into this type of hedging arrangements or other transactions for all or a portion of our variable rate debt to limit our exposure to rising interest rates. however, the amounts we are required to pay under the term loan and any other variable rate debt to which hedging or similar arrangements relate may increase in the event of non-performance by the counterparties to any of our hedging arrangements. in addition, an increase in market interest rates may lead purchasers of our debt securities and preferred shares to demand a higher annual yield, which could adversely affect the market price of our outstanding debt securities and preferred shares and the cost and/or timing of refinancing or issuing additional debt securities or preferred shares.
the market value of our debt and equity securities is subject to various factors that may cause significant fluctuations or volatility.
as with other publicly traded securities, the market price of our debt and equity securities depends on various factors, which may change from time to time and/or may be unrelated to our financial condition, operating performance or prospects that may cause significant fluctuations or volatility in such prices. these factors include, among others:
•   general economic and financial market conditions;
•   level and trend of interest rates;
•   our ability to access the capital markets to raise additional capital;
•   the issuance of additional equity or debt securities;
•   changes in our funds from operations ("ffo") or earnings estimates;
•   changes in our debt or analyst ratings;
•   our financial condition and performance;
•   market perception of our business compared to other reits; and
•   market perception of reits, in general, compared to other investment alternatives.
loss of our key management could adversely affect performance and the value of our common shares.
we are dependent on the efforts of our key management. although we believe qualified replacements could be found for any departures of key executives, the loss of their services could adversely affect our performance and the value of our common shares.
our performance and value are subject to general risks associated with the real estate industry.
our economic performance and the value of our real estate assets, and, consequently, the value of our investments, are subject to the risk that if our properties do not generate revenues sufficient to meet our operating expenses, including debt service and capital expenditures, our cash flow and ability to pay distributions to our shareholders will be adversely affected. as a real estate company, we are susceptible to the following real estate industry risks:
•   economic downturns in general, or in the areas where our properties are located;
•   adverse changes in local real estate market conditions, such as an oversupply or reduction in demand;
•   changes in tenant preferences that reduce the attractiveness of our properties to tenants;
•   zoning or regulatory restrictions;
•   decreases in market rental rates;
•   weather conditions that may increase or decrease energy costs and other weather-related expenses;
•   costs associated with the need to periodically repair, renovate and re-lease space; and
•   increases in the cost of adequate maintenance, insurance and other operating costs, including real estate taxes, associated with one or more properties, which may occur even when circumstances such as market factors and
10
competition cause a reduction in revenues from one or more properties, although real estate taxes typically do not increase upon a reduction in such revenues.
each of these risks could result in decreases in market rental rates and increases in vacancy rates, which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operation.
many real estate costs are fixed, even if income from our properties decreases.
our financial results depend primarily on leasing space in our properties to tenants on terms favorable to us. costs associated with real estate investment, such as real estate taxes, insurance and maintenance costs, generally are not reduced even when a property is not fully occupied, rental rates decrease, or other circumstances cause a reduction in income from the property. as a result, cash flow from the operations of our properties may be reduced if a tenant does not pay its rent or we are unable to rent our properties on favorable terms. under those circumstances, we might not be able to enforce our rights as landlord without delays and may incur substantial legal costs. additionally, new properties that we may acquire or redevelop may not produce any significant revenue immediately, and the cash flow from existing operations may be insufficient to pay the operating expenses and debt service associated with such new properties until they are fully occupied.
competition may limit our ability to purchase new properties and generate sufficient income from tenants.
numerous commercial developers and real estate companies compete with us in seeking tenants for our existing properties and properties for acquisition. this competition may:
•   reduce properties available for acquisition;
•   increase the cost of properties available for acquisition;
•   reduce rents payable to us;
•   interfere with our ability to attract and retain tenants;
•   lead to increased vacancy rates at our properties; and
•   adversely affect our ability to minimize expenses of operation.
retailers at our properties also face increasing competition from online retailers, outlet stores, discount shopping clubs and other forms of sales and marketing of goods, such as direct mail. this competition could contribute to lease defaults and insolvency of tenants. if we are unable to continue to attract appropriate retail tenants to our properties, or to purchase new properties in our geographic markets, it could materially affect our ability to generate net income, service our debt and make distributions to our shareholders.
we may be unable to sell properties when appropriate because real estate investments are illiquid.
real estate investments generally cannot be sold quickly. in addition, there are some limitations under federal income tax laws applicable to real estate and to reits in particular that may limit our ability to sell our assets. we may not be able to alter our portfolio promptly in response to changes in economic or other conditions including being unable to sell a property at a return we believe is appropriate due to the economic environment. our inability to respond quickly to adverse changes in the performance of our investments could have an adverse effect on our ability to meet our obligations and make distributions to our shareholders.
our insurance coverage on our properties may be inadequate.
we currently carry comprehensive insurance on all of our properties, including insurance for liability, fire, flood, earthquake, environmental matters, rental loss and acts of terrorism. all of these policies contain coverage limitations. we believe these coverages are of the types and amounts customarily obtained for or by an owner of similar types of real property assets located in the areas where our properties are located. we intend to obtain similar insurance coverage on subsequently acquired properties.
the availability of insurance coverage may decrease and the prices for insurance may increase as a consequence of significant losses incurred by the insurance industry and other factors outside our control. as a result, we may be unable to renew or duplicate our current insurance coverage in adequate amounts or at reasonable prices. in addition, insurance companies may no longer offer coverage against certain types of losses, such as losses due to terrorist acts and toxic mold, or, if offered, the expense of obtaining these types of insurance may not be justified. we therefore may cease to have insurance coverage against certain types of losses and/or there may be decreases in the limits of insurance available. if an uninsured loss or a loss in excess of our insured limits occurs, we could lose all or a portion of the capital we have invested in a property, as well as the anticipated future revenue from the property, but still remain obligated for any mortgage debt or other financial obligations related to the property. we cannot guarantee that material losses in excess of insurance proceeds will not occur in the future. if any of our properties were to experience a catastrophic loss, it could seriously disrupt our operations, delay revenue and result
11
in large expenses to repair or rebuild the property. also, due to inflation, changes in codes and ordinances, environmental considerations and other factors, it may not be feasible to use insurance proceeds to replace a building after it has been damaged or destroyed. further, we may be unable to collect insurance proceeds if our insurers are unable to pay or contest a claim. events such as these could adversely affect our results of operations and our ability to meet our obligations, including distributions to our shareholders.
we may have limited flexibility in dealing with our jointly owned investments.
our organizational documents do not limit the amount of funds that we may invest in properties and assets owned jointly with other persons or entities. as of december 31, 2014, we held seven predominantly retail real estate projects jointly with other persons in addition to our joint venture with affiliates of a discretionary fund created and advised by ing clarion partners ("clarion") and properties owned in a "downreit" structure. additionally, in fourth quarter 2014, we entered into a joint venture agreement related to the hotel component of phase ii of our pike & rose development project. we may make additional joint investments in the future. our existing and future joint investments may subject us to special risks, including the possibility that our partners or co-investors might become bankrupt, that those partners or co-investors might have economic or other business interests or goals which are unlike or incompatible with our business interests or goals, that those partners or co-investors might be in a position to take action contrary to our suggestions or instructions, or in opposition to our policies or objectives, and that disputes may develop with our joint venture partners over decisions affecting the property or the joint venture, which may result in litigation or arbitration or some other form of dispute resolution. although as of december 31, 2014, we held the managing general partnership or membership interest in all of our existing co-investments (except the hotel investment discussed above) we generally must obtain the consent of the co-investor or meet defined criteria to sell or to finance these properties. joint ownership gives a third party the opportunity to influence the return we can achieve on some of our investments and may adversely affect our ability to make distributions to our shareholders. we may also be liable for the actions of our co-investors.
on july 1, 2004, we entered into a joint venture with clarion for purposes of acquiring properties. although we are the managing general partner of that entity, we have only a 30% ownership interest in that entity. our partner's consent is required to take certain actions with respect to the properties acquired by the venture and, as a result, we may not be able to take actions that we believe are necessary or desirable to protect or increase the value of the property or the property's income stream. pursuant to the terms of our partnership, we must obtain our partner's consent to do the following:
•   enter into new anchor tenant leases, modify existing anchor tenant leases or enforce remedies against anchor tenants;
•   make certain repairs, renovations or other changes or improvements to properties; and
•   sell or finance the property with secured debt.
our joint venture with clarion is subject to a buy-sell provision which is customary for real estate joint venture agreements and the industry. either partner may initiate these provisions at any time, which could result in either the sale of our interest or the use of available cash or borrowings to acquire clarion's interest. our investment in this joint venture is also subject to the risks described above for jointly owned investments. as of december 31, 2014, this joint venture owned six properties.
environmental laws and regulations could reduce the value or profitability of our properties.
all real property and the operations conducted on real property are subject to federal, state and local laws, ordinances and regulations relating to hazardous materials, environmental protection and human health and safety. under various federal, state and local laws, ordinances and regulations, we and our tenants may be required to investigate and clean up certain hazardous or toxic substances released on or in properties we own or operate, and also may be required to pay other costs relating to hazardous or toxic substances. this liability may be imposed without regard to whether we or our tenants knew about the release of these types of substances or were responsible for their release. the presence of contamination or the failure to properly remediate contamination at any of our properties may adversely affect our ability to sell or lease those properties or to borrow funds by using those properties as collateral. the costs or liabilities could exceed the value of the affected real estate. we are not aware of any environmental condition with respect to any of our properties that management believes would have a material adverse effect on our business, assets or results of operations taken as a whole. the uses of any of our properties prior to our acquisition of the property and the building materials used at the property are among the property-specific factors that will affect how the environmental laws are applied to our properties. if we are subject to any material environmental liabilities, the liabilities could adversely affect our results of operations and our ability to meet our obligations.
we cannot predict what other environmental legislation or regulations will be enacted in the future, how existing or future laws or regulations will be administered or interpreted or what environmental conditions may be found to exist on the properties in the future. compliance with existing and new laws and regulations may require us or our tenants to spend funds to remedy environmental problems. our tenants, like many of their competitors, have incurred, and will continue to incur, capital and
12
operating expenditures and other costs associated with complying with these laws and regulations, which will adversely affect their potential profitability.
generally, our tenants must comply with environmental laws and meet remediation requirements. our leases typically impose obligations on our tenants to indemnify us from any compliance costs we may incur as a result of the environmental conditions on the property caused by the tenant. if a lease does not require compliance or if a tenant fails to or cannot comply, we could be forced to pay these costs. if not addressed, environmental conditions could impair our ability to sell or re-lease the affected properties in the future or result in lower sales prices or rent payments.
the americans with disabilities act of 1990 could require us to take remedial steps with respect to existing or newly acquired properties.
our existing properties, as well as properties we may acquire, as commercial facilities, are required to comply with title iii of the americans with disabilities act of 1990. investigation of a property may reveal non-compliance with this act. the requirements of this act, or of other federal, state or local laws or regulations, also may change in the future and restrict further renovations of our properties with respect to access for disabled persons. future compliance with this act may require expensive changes to the properties.
the revenues generated by our tenants could be negatively affected by various federal, state and local laws to which they are subject.
we and our tenants are subject to a wide range of federal, state and local laws and regulations, such as local licensing requirements, consumer protection laws and state and local fire, life-safety and similar requirements that affect the use of the properties. the leases typically require that each tenant comply with all laws and regulations. failure to comply could result in fines by governmental authorities, awards of damages to private litigants, or restrictions on the ability to conduct business on such properties. non-compliance of this sort could reduce our revenues from a tenant, could require us to pay penalties or fines relating to any non-compliance, and could adversely affect our ability to sell or lease a property.
failure to qualify as a reit for federal income tax purposes would cause us to be taxed as a corporation, which would substantially reduce funds available for payment of distributions.
we believe that we are organized and qualified as a reit for federal income tax purposes and currently intend to operate in a manner that will allow us to continue to qualify as a reit under the code. however, we cannot assure you that we will remain qualified as such in the future.
qualification as a reit involves the application of highly technical and complex code provisions and applicable income tax regulations that have been issued under the code. certain facts and circumstances not entirely within our control may affect our ability to qualify as a reit. for example, in order to qualify as a reit, at least 95% of our gross income in any year must be derived from qualifying rents and certain other income. satisfying this requirement could be difficult, for example, if defaults by tenants were to reduce the amount of income from qualifying rents. as a reit, we must generally make annual distributions to shareholders of at least 90% of our taxable income. in addition, new legislation, new regulations, new administrative interpretations or new court decisions may significantly change the tax laws with respect to qualification as a reit or the federal income tax consequences of such qualification. any modification in the tax treatment of reits could have a significant adverse impact to our net income.
if we fail to qualify as a reit:
•   we would not be allowed a deduction for distributions to shareholders in computing taxable income;
•   we would be subject to federal income tax at regular corporate rates;
•   we could be subject to the federal alternative minimum tax;
•   unless we are entitled to relief under specific statutory provisions, we could not elect to be taxed as a reit for four taxable years following the year during which we were disqualified;
•   we could be required to pay significant income taxes, which would substantially reduce the funds available for investment or for distribution to our shareholders for each year in which we failed or were not permitted to qualify; and
•   we would no longer be required by law to make any distributions to our shareholders.
13
we may be required to incur additional debt to qualify as a reit.
as a reit, we must generally make annual distributions to shareholders of at least 90% of our taxable income. we are subject to income tax on amounts of undistributed taxable income and net capital gain. in addition, we would be subject to a 4% excise tax if we fail to distribute sufficient income to meet a minimum distribution test based on our ordinary income, capital gain and aggregate undistributed income from prior years. we intend to make distributions to shareholders to comply with the code's distribution provisions and to avoid federal income and excise tax. we may need to borrow funds to meet our distribution requirements because:
•   our income may not be matched by our related expenses at the time the income is considered received for purposes of determining taxable income; and
•   non-deductible capital expenditures, creation of reserves, or debt service requirements may reduce available cash but not taxable income.
in these circumstances, we might have to borrow funds on terms we might otherwise find unfavorable and we may have to borrow funds even if our management believes the market conditions make borrowing financially unattractive. current tax law also allows us to pay a portion of our distributions in shares instead of cash.
to maintain our status as a reit, we limit the amount of shares any one shareholder can own.
the code imposes certain limitations on the ownership of the stock of a reit. for example, not more than 50% in value of our outstanding shares of capital stock may be owned, directly or indirectly, by five or fewer individuals (as defined in the code) during the last half of any taxable year. to protect our reit status, our declaration of trust prohibits any one shareholder from owning (actually or constructively) more than 9.8% in value of the outstanding common shares or of any class or series of outstanding preferred shares. the constructive ownership rules are complex. shares of our capital stock owned, actually or constructively, by a group of related individuals and/or entities may be treated as constructively owned by one of those individuals or entities. as a result, the acquisition of less than 9.8% in value of the outstanding common shares and/or a class or series of preferred shares (or the acquisition of an interest in an entity that owns common shares or preferred shares) by an individual or entity could cause that individual or entity (or another) to own constructively more than 9.8% in value of the outstanding capital stock. if that happened, either the transfer of ownership would be void or the shares would be transferred to a charitable trust and then sold to someone who can own those shares without violating the 9.8% ownership limit.
the board of trustees may waive these restrictions on a case-by-case basis. in addition, the board of trustees and two-thirds of our shareholders eligible to vote at a shareholder meeting may remove these restrictions if they determine it is no longer in our best interests to attempt to qualify, or to continue to qualify, as a reit. the 9.8% ownership restrictions may delay, defer or prevent a transaction or a change of our control that might involve a premium price for the common shares or otherwise be in the shareholders' best interest.
we cannot assure you we will continue to pay dividends at historical rates.
our ability to continue to pay dividends on our common shares at historical rates or to increase our common share dividend rate, and our ability to pay preferred share dividends and service our debt securities, will depend on a number of factors, including, among others, the following:
•   our financial condition and results of future operations;
•   the performance of lease terms by tenants;
•   the terms of our loan covenants; and
•   our ability to acquire, finance, develop or redevelop and lease additional properties at attractive rates.
if we do not maintain or increase the dividend on our common shares, it could have an adverse effect on the market price of our common shares and other securities. any preferred shares we may offer in the future may have a fixed dividend rate that would not increase with any increases in the dividend rate of our common shares. conversely, payment of dividends on our common shares may be subject to payment in full of the dividends on any preferred shares and payment of interest on any debt securities we may offer.
certain tax and anti-takeover provisions of our declaration of trust and bylaws may inhibit a change of our control.
certain provisions contained in our declaration of trust and bylaws and the maryland general corporation law, as applicable to maryland reits, may discourage a third party from making a tender offer or acquisition proposal to us. if this were to happen, it could delay, deter or prevent a change in control or the removal of existing management. these provisions also may delay or prevent the shareholders from receiving a premium for their common shares over then-prevailing market prices. these provisions include:
•   the reit ownership limit described above;
14
•   authorization of the issuance of our preferred shares with powers, preferences or rights to be determined by the board of trustees;
•   special meetings of our shareholders may be called only by the chairman of the board, the chief executive officer, the president, by one-third of the trustees or by shareholders possessing no less than 25% of all the votes entitled to be cast at the meeting;
•   the board of trustees, without a shareholder vote, can classify or reclassify unissued shares of beneficial interest, including the reclassification of common shares into preferred shares and vice-versa;
•   a two-thirds shareholder vote is required to approve some amendments to the declaration of trust; and
•   advance-notice requirements for proposals to be presented at shareholder meetings.
in addition, if we elect to be governed by it in the future, the maryland control share acquisition law could delay or prevent a change in control. under maryland law, unless a reit elects not to be subject to this law, "control shares" acquired in a "control share acquisition" have no voting rights except to the extent approved by shareholders by a vote of two-thirds of the votes entitled to be cast on the matter, excluding shares owned by the acquirer and by officers or trustees who are employees of the reit. "control shares" are voting shares that would entitle the acquirer to exercise voting power in electing trustees within specified ranges of voting power. a "control share acquisition" means the acquisition of control shares, with some exceptions.
our bylaws state that the maryland control share acquisition law will not apply to any acquisition by any person of our common shares. this bylaw provision may be repealed, in whole or in part, at any time, whether before or after an acquisition of control shares, by a vote of a majority of the shareholders entitled to vote, and, upon such repeal, may, to the extent provided by any successor bylaw, apply to any prior or subsequent control share acquisition.
we may amend or revise our business policies without your approval.
our board of trustees may amend or revise our operating policies without shareholder approval. our investment, financing and borrowing policies and policies with respect to all other activities, such as growth, debt, capitalization and operations, are determined by the board of trustees. the board of trustees may amend or revise these policies at any time and from time to time at its discretion. a change in these policies could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations, and the market price of our securities.
the current business plan adopted by our board of trustees focuses on our investment in high quality retail based properties that are typically neighborhood and community shopping centers or mixed-use properties, principally through redevelopments and acquisitions. if this business plan is not successful, it could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.
given these uncertainties, readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on any forward-looking statements that we make, including those in this annual report on form 10-k. except as may be required by law, we make no promise to update any of the forward-looking statements as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. you should carefully review the above risks and the risk factors.
natural disasters and severe weather conditions could have an adverse impact on our cash flow and operating results.
changing weather patterns and climatic conditions, such as global warming, may have added to the unpredictability and frequency of natural disasters and severe weather conditions and created additional uncertainty as to future trends and exposures.  our operations are located in areas that are subject to natural disasters and severe weather conditions such as hurricanes, earthquakes, droughts, snow storms, floods and fires.  the occurrence of natural disasters or severe weather conditions can delay new development projects, increase investment costs to repair or replace damaged properties, increase operation costs, increase future property insurance costs, and negatively impact the tenant demand for lease space.  if insurance is unavailable to us or is unavailable on acceptable terms, or if our insurance is not adequate to cover business interruption or losses from these events, our earnings, liquidity or capital resources could be adversely affected.
we face risks relating to cybersecurity attacks that could cause loss of confidential information and other business disruptions.
we rely extensively on computer systems to process transactions and manage our business, and our business is at risk from and may be impacted by cybersecurity attacks. these could include attempts to gain unauthorized access to our data and computer systems. attacks can be both individual and/or highly organized attempts organized by very sophisticated hacking organizations. we employ a number of measures to prevent, detect and mitigate these threats, which include password encryption, frequent password change events, firewall detection systems, anti-virus software in-place, frequent backups, a redundant data system for core applications and annual penetration testing; however, there is no guarantee such efforts will be
15
successful in preventing a cyber attack. a cybersecurity attack could compromise the confidential information of our employees, tenants and vendors. a successful attack could disrupt and otherwise adversely affect our business operations.
changes in accounting standards may adversely impact our financial results.
the financial accounting standards board ("fasb"), in conjunction with the sec, has several key projects on their agenda that could impact how we currently account for our material transactions, including lease accounting and other convergence projects with the international accounting standards board. at this time, we are unable to predict with certainty which, if any, proposals may be passed or what level of impact any such proposal could have on the presentation of our consolidated financial statements, our results of operations and our financial ratios required by our debt covenants.

overview we are an equity real estate investment trust ("reit") specializing in the ownership, management, and redevelopment of high quality retail and mixed-use properties located primarily in densely populated and affluent communities in strategically selected metropolitan markets in the northeast and mid-atlantic regions of the united states, as well as in california. as of december 31, 2014, we owned or had a majority interest in community and neighborhood shopping centers and mixed-use properties which are operated as 89 predominantly retail real estate projects comprising approximately 20.2 million square feet. in total, the real estate projects were 95.6% leased and 94.7% occupied at december 31, 2014. a joint venture in which we own a 30% interest owned six retail real estate projects totaling approximately 0.8 million square feet as of december 31, 2014. in total, the joint venture properties in which we own a 30% interest were 86.1% leased and 82.8% occupied at december 31, 2014. we have paid quarterly dividends to our shareholders continuously since our founding in 1962 and have increased our dividends per common share for 47 consecutive years.
critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america, referred to as "gaap", requires management to make estimates and assumptions that in certain circumstances affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities, and revenues and expenses. these estimates are prepared using management's best judgment, after considering past and current events and economic conditions. in addition, information relied upon by management in preparing such estimates includes internally generated financial and operating information, external market information, when available, and when necessary, information obtained from consultations with third party experts. actual results could differ from these estimates. a discussion of possible risks which may affect these estimates is included in "item 1a. risk factors" of this report. management considers an accounting estimate to be critical if changes in the estimate could have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial condition.
our significant accounting policies are more fully described in note 2 to the consolidated financial statements; however, the most critical accounting policies, which involve the use of estimates and assumptions as to future uncertainties and, therefore, may result in actual amounts that differ from estimates, are as follows:
revenue recognition and accounts receivable our leases with tenants are classified as operating leases. substantially all such leases contain fixed escalations which occur at specified times during the term of the lease. base rents are recognized on a straight-line basis from when the tenant controls the space through the term of the related lease, net of valuation adjustments, based on management's assessment of credit, collection and other business risk. percentage rents, which represent additional rents based upon the level of sales achieved by certain tenants, are recognized at the end of the lease year or earlier if we have determined the required sales level is achieved and the percentage rents are collectible. real estate tax and other cost reimbursements are recognized on an accrual basis over the periods in which the related expenditures are incurred. for a tenant to terminate its lease agreement prior to the end of the agreed term, we may require that they pay a fee to cancel the lease agreement. lease fees for which the tenant has relinquished control of the space are generally recognized on the termination date. when a lease is terminated early but the tenant continues to control the space under a modified lease agreement, the lease termination fee is generally recognized evenly over the remaining term of the modified lease agreement.
current accounts receivable from tenants primarily relate to contractual minimum rent and percentage rent as well as real estate tax and other cost reimbursements. accounts receivable from straight-line rent is typically longer term in nature and relates to the cumulative amount by which straight-line rental income recorded to date exceeds cash rents billed to date under the contractual lease agreement.
we make estimates of the collectability of our current accounts receivable and straight-line rents receivable which requires significant judgment by management. the collectability of receivables is affected by numerous factors including current economic conditions, bankruptcies, and the ability of the tenant to perform under the terms of their lease agreement. while we make estimates of potentially uncollectible amounts and provide an allowance for them through bad debt expense, actual collectability could differ from those estimates which could affect our net income. with respect to the allowance for current uncollectible tenant receivables, we assess the collectability of outstanding receivables by evaluating such factors as nature and age of the receivable, past history and current financial condition of the specific tenant including our assessment of the tenant's ability to meet its contractual lease obligations, and the status of any pending disputes or lease negotiations with the tenant. at december 31, 2014 and 2013, our allowance for doubtful accounts was $12.4 million and $12.7 million, respectively. historically, we have recognized bad debt expense between 0.4% and 1.3% of rental income and it was 0.3% in 2014 reflecting positive economic changes and their impact to our tenants. a change in the estimate of collectability of a receivable would result in a change to our allowance for doubtful accounts and correspondingly bad debt expense and net income. for example,
30
in the event our estimates were not accurate and we were required to increase our allowance by 1% of rental income, our bad debt expense would have increased and our net income would have decreased by $6.7 million.
due to the nature of the accounts receivable from straight-line rents, the collection period of these amounts typically extends beyond one year. our experience relative to unbilled straight-line rents is that a portion of the amounts otherwise recognizable as revenue is never billed to or collected from tenants due to early lease terminations, lease modifications, bankruptcies and other factors. accordingly, the extended collection period for straight-line rents along with our evaluation of tenant credit risk may result in the nonrecognition of a portion of straight-line rental income until the collection of such income is reasonably assured. if our evaluation of tenant credit risk changes indicating more straight-line revenue is reasonably collectible than previously estimated and realized, the additional straight-line rental income is recognized as revenue. if our evaluation of tenant credit risk changes indicating a portion of realized straight-line rental income is no longer collectible, a reserve and bad debt expense is recorded. at december 31, 2014 and 2013, accounts receivable includes approximately $66.1 million and $60.6 million, respectively, related to straight-line rents. correspondingly, these estimates of collectability have a direct impact on our net income.
real estate the nature of our business as an owner, redeveloper and operator of retail shopping centers and mixed-use properties means that we invest significant amounts of capital. depreciation and maintenance costs relating to our properties constitute substantial costs for us as well as the industry as a whole. we capitalize real estate investments and depreciate them on a straight-line basis in accordance with gaap and consistent with industry standards based on our best estimates of the assets' physical and economic useful lives. we periodically review the estimated lives of our assets and implement changes, as necessary, to these estimates and, therefore, to our depreciation rates. these reviews may take into account such factors as the historical retirement and replacement of our assets, expected redevelopments, and general economic and real estate factors. certain events, such as unforeseen competition or changes in customer shopping habits, could substantially alter our assumptions regarding our ability to realize the expected return on investment in the property and therefore reduce the economic life of the asset and affect the amount of depreciation expense to be charged against both the current and future revenues. these assessments have a direct impact on our net income. the longer the economic useful life, the lower the depreciation expense will be for that asset in a fiscal period, which in turn will increase our net income. similarly, having a shorter economic useful life would increase the depreciation for a fiscal period and decrease our net income.
land, buildings and real estate under development are recorded at cost. we compute depreciation using the straight-line method with useful lives ranging generally from 35 years to a maximum of 50 years on buildings and major improvements. maintenance and repair costs are charged to operations as incurred. tenant work and other major improvements, which improve or extend the life of the asset, are capitalized and depreciated over the life of the lease or the estimated useful life of the improvements, whichever is shorter. minor improvements, furniture and equipment are capitalized and depreciated over useful lives ranging from 2 to 20 years.
capitalized costs associated with leases are depreciated or amortized over the base term of the lease. unamortized leasing costs are charged to expense if the applicable tenant vacates before the expiration of its lease. undepreciated tenant work is written-off if the applicable tenant vacates and the tenant work is replaced or has no future value. additionally, we make estimates as to the probability of certain development and redevelopment projects being completed. if we determine the redevelopment is no longer probable of completion, we immediately expense all capitalized costs which are not recoverable.
interest costs on developments and major redevelopments are capitalized as part of developments and redevelopments not yet placed in service. capitalization of interest commences when development activities and expenditures begin and end upon completion, which is when the asset is ready for its intended use. generally, rental property is considered substantially complete and ready for its intended use upon completion of tenant improvements, but no later than one year from completion of major construction activity. we make judgments as to the time period over which to capitalize such costs and these assumptions have a direct impact on net income because capitalized costs are not subtracted in calculating net income. if the time period for capitalizing interest is extended, more interest is capitalized, thereby decreasing interest expense and increasing net income during that period.
certain external and internal costs directly related to the development, redevelopment and leasing of real estate, including pre-construction costs, real estate taxes, insurance, construction costs and salaries and related costs of personnel directly involved, are capitalized. we capitalized external and internal costs related to both development and redevelopment activities of $277 million and $7 million, respectively, for 2014 and $275 million and $6 million, respectively, for 2013. we capitalized external and internal costs related to other property improvements of $45 million and $2 million, respectively, for 2014 and $48 million and $1 million, respectively, for 2013. we capitalized external and internal costs related to leasing activities of $29 million and $7 million, respectively, for 2014 and $9 million and $6 million, respectively, for 2013. the amount of capitalized internal costs
31
for salaries and related benefits for development and redevelopment activities, other property improvements, and leasing activities were $7 million, $1 million, and $6 million, respectively, for 2014 and $6 million, $1 million, and $5 million, respectively, for 2013. total capitalized costs were $367 million and $345 million for 2014 and 2013, respectively.
when applicable, as lessee, we classify our leases of land and building as operating or capital leases. we are required to use judgment and make estimates in determining the lease term, the estimated economic life of the property and the interest rate to be used in determining whether or not the lease meets the qualification of a capital lease and is recorded as an asset.
real estate acquisitions upon acquisition of operating real estate properties, we estimate the fair value of assets and liabilities acquired including land, building, improvements, leasing costs, intangibles such as in-place leases, assumed debt, and current assets and liabilities, if any.  based on these estimates, we allocate the purchase price to the applicable assets and liabilities. we utilize methods similar to those used by independent appraisers in estimating the fair value of acquired assets and liabilities. the value allocated to in-place leases is amortized over the related lease term and reflected as rental income in the statement of operations. we consider qualitative and quantitative factors in evaluating the likelihood of a tenant exercising a below market renewal option and include such renewal options in the calculation of in-place lease value when we consider these to be bargain renewal options. if the value of below market lease intangibles includes renewal option periods, we include such renewal periods in the amortization period utilized. if a tenant vacates its space prior to contractual termination of its lease, the unamortized balance of any in-place lease value is written off to rental income.
long-lived assets and impairment there are estimates and assumptions made by management in preparing the consolidated financial statements for which the actual results will be determined over long periods of time. this includes the recoverability of long-lived assets, including our properties that have been acquired or redeveloped and our investment in certain joint ventures. management's evaluation of impairment includes review for possible indicators of impairment as well as, in certain circumstances, undiscounted and discounted cash flow analysis. since most of our investments in real estate are wholly-owned or controlled assets which are held for use, a property with impairment indicators is first tested for impairment by comparing the undiscounted cash flows, including residual value, to the current net book value of the property. if the undiscounted cash flows are less than the net book value, the property is written down to expected fair value.
the calculation of both discounted and undiscounted cash flows requires management to make estimates of future cash flows including revenues, operating expenses, required maintenance and development expenditures, market conditions, demand for space by tenants and rental rates over long periods. because our properties typically have a long life, the assumptions used to estimate the future recoverability of book value requires significant management judgment. actual results could be significantly different from the estimates. these estimates have a direct impact on net income, because recording an impairment charge results in a negative adjustment to net income.
contingencies we are sometimes involved in lawsuits, warranty claims, and environmental matters arising in the ordinary course of business. management makes assumptions and estimates concerning the likelihood and amount of any potential loss relating to these matters. we accrue a liability for litigation if an unfavorable outcome is probable and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. if an unfavorable outcome is probable and a reasonable estimate of the loss is a range, we accrue the best estimate within the range; however, if no amount within the range is a better estimate than any other amount, the minimum within the range is accrued. any difference between our estimate of a potential loss and the actual outcome would result in an increase or decrease to net income.
in addition, we reserve for estimated losses, if any, associated with warranties given to a buyer at the time an asset is sold or other potential liabilities relating to that sale, taking any insurance policies into account. these warranties may extend up to ten years and the calculation of potential liability requires significant judgment. if changes in facts and circumstances indicate that warranty reserves are understated, we will accrue additional reserves at such time a liability has been incurred and the costs can be reasonably estimated. warranty reserves are released once the legal liability period has expired or all related work has been substantially completed. any changes to our estimated warranty losses would result in an increase or decrease in net income.
self-insurance we are self-insured for general liability costs up to predetermined retained amounts per claim, and we believe that we maintain adequate accruals to cover our retained liability. we currently do not maintain third party stop-loss insurance policies to cover liability costs in excess of predetermined retained amounts. our accrual for self-insurance liability is determined by
32
management and is based on claims filed and an estimate of claims projected to be incurred but not yet reported. management considers a number of factors, including third-party actuarial analysis and future increases in costs of claims, when making these determinations. if our liability costs differ from these accruals, it will increase or decrease our net income.
recently adopted and recently issued accounting pronouncements see note 2 to the consolidated financial statements.
2014 significant property acquisitions and disposition effective january 1, 2014, we acquired a controlling interest in the grove at shrewsbury, a 187,000 square foot shopping center in shrewsbury, new jersey, and brook 35, a 99,000 square foot shopping center in sea girt, new jersey for a gross value of $161 million. our effective economic interest approximates 84% and was funded by the assumption of our share of $68 million of mortgage debt, 632,000 downreit operating partnership units, and $13 million of cash (which was in an escrow account at december 31, 2013). approximately $1.7 million and $2.3 million of net assets acquired were allocated to other assets for "above market leases" and other liabilities for "below market leases," respectively. additionally, $71.1 million was allocated to redeemable and nonredeemable noncontrolling interests. we incurred $2.0 million of acquisition costs, of which $1.0 million were incurred in 2014, and are included in "general and administrative expenses" in 2014 and 2013 on the accompanying consolidated statements of comprehensive income.
we entered into an agreement to acquire the interest of one of the noncontrolling interest holders in the grove at shrewsbury in 2015. as this noncontrolling interest is mandatorily redeemable, it has been classified as a liability of approximately $9 million and is included in "other liabilities and deferred credits" on the december 31, 2014 consolidated balance sheet. an additional noncontrolling interest holder has the right to require us to acquire its interests in the grove at shrewsbury and brook 35 at the then current fair market value beginning on january 1, 2017.
on july 24, 2014, the joint venture arrangement with affiliates of a discretionary fund created and advised by ing clarion partners sold the fee interest in pleasant shops in weymouth, massachusetts for a sales price of $34.3 million, resulting in a gain on sale of $14.5 million. our share of the gain was $4.4 million. the joint venture partners received distributions totaling $32.8 million as a result of the sale, of which our distribution was $10.4 million.
subsequent event - 2015 property acquisition in january 2015, we acquired a controlling interest in san antonio center, a 376,000 square foot shopping center in mountain view, california based on a total value of $62.2 million. our effective interest approximates 80% and was funded by the assumption of our share of $18.7 million of mortgage debt, which has a stated interest rate of 5.27% and matures on january 1, 2016, approximately 58,000 downreit operating partnership units and approximately $27 million of cash. we incurred $0.7 million of acquisition costs in 2014 which are included in "general and administrative expenses."
2014 significant debt and equity transactions in connection with the acquisition of the grove at shrewsbury and brook 35 on january 1, 2014, we assumed mortgage loans with a face amount of $68.3 million and a fair value of $73.8 million. the mortgage loans are secured by the individual properties with the following contractual terms:

(2) the redemption price of $134.5 million included a make-whole premium of approximately $9.2 million and accrued but unpaid interest of $0.2 million. the make-whole premium is included in "early extinguishment of debt" in 2014.
on august 28, 2014, we amended our term loan agreement and lowered the spread over libor by 40 basis points from 130 basis points to 90 basis points based on our current credit rating. the amendment also provides us the option to extend the maturity date by one year.
on february 12, 2014 we replaced our existing at the market ("atm") equity program with a new atm equity program in which we may from time to time offer and sell common shares having an aggregate offering price of up to $300.0 million. we intend to use the net proceeds to fund potential acquisition opportunities, fund our development and redevelopment pipeline, repay amounts outstanding under our revolving credit facility and/or for general corporate purposes. for the three months ended december 31, 2014, we issued 469,200 common shares at the weighted average price per share of $132.54 for net cash proceeds of $61.5 million and paid $0.6 million in commissions and less than $0.1 million in additional offering expenses related to the sales of these common shares. for the year ended december 31, 2014, we issued 1,768,583 common shares at a weighted average price per share of $122.09 for net cash proceeds of $213.6 million and paid $2.2 million in commissions and $0.2 million in additional offering expenses related to the sales of these common shares. as of december 31, 2014, we had the capacity to issue up to $84.1 million in common shares under our atm equity program.
outlook we seek growth in earnings, funds from operations, and cash flows primarily through a combination of the following:
•   growth in our same-center portfolio,
•   growth in our portfolio from property development and redevelopments, and
•   expansion of our portfolio through property acquisitions.
our same-center growth is primarily driven by increases in rental rates on new leases and lease renewals and changes in portfolio occupancy. over the long-term, the infill nature and strong demographics of our properties provide a strategic advantage allowing us to maintain relatively high occupancy and increase rental rates. we have generally continued to see an encouraging operating environment for many of our tenants as well as strong levels of interest from prospective tenants for our retail spaces. while there can be no assurance that these conditions will continue, we remain optimistic given the trends we have seen over the past few years. we believe the locations of our centers and diverse tenant base partially mitigates any negative change in the economic environment; however, any significant reduction in our tenants' abilities to pay base rent, percentage rent or other charges, will adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. we seek to maintain a mix of strong national, regional, and local retailers. at december 31, 2014, no single tenant accounted for more than 3.1% of annualized base rent.
34
our properties are located primarily in densely populated and/or affluent areas with high barriers to entry which allow us to take advantage of redevelopment opportunities that enhance our operating performance through renovation, expansion, reconfiguration, and/or retenanting. we evaluate our properties on an ongoing basis to identify these types of opportunities. in 2015, we expect to have redevelopment projects stabilizing with projected costs of approximately $67 million.
we continue our ongoing redevelopment efforts at santana row. our most recent 212 unit residential building was completed during second quarter. the building was 98.6% leased as of december 31, 2014, and had a total cost of $76 million. we are also proceeding with our next phase of redevelopment which is a six story building including approximately 225,500 square feet of office space, 1,500 square feet of retail space, and 670 parking spaces. after current phases, we have approximately 9 acres remaining for further redevelopment and entitlements in place for an additional 348 residential units and 69,000 square feet of commercial space. we are currently in the process of seeking additional entitlements and have under control an additional 12 acres of land adjacent to santana row.
we continue to invest in the development at assembly row which is a long-term development project we expect to be involved in over the coming years. the carrying value of the development portion of this project at december 31, 2014 is approximately $359 million. the project currently has zoning entitlements to build 3.4 million square feet of commercial-use buildings, 1,843 residential units, and a 170 room hotel. the first phase consists of approximately 326,000 square feet of retail space and 98,000 square feet of office space (both owned by the trust) and 450 residential units owned by avalonbay communities. the massachusetts bay transit authority (mbta) constructed the new orange line t-stop at the property, which opened in september 2014. minimal amounts of construction remain to be completed on the first phase. the retail space in phase i opened during 2014 and currently is 97.3% leased; the office space will open in 2015. phase i is expected to stabilize in 2015/2016. total expected costs for phase i of assembly row range from $190 million to $200 million (net of reimbursements) of which $189 million has been incurred to date. in total, we invested $74 million in assembly row in 2014, net of public funding, and expect to invest between $20 million and $30 million in assembly row in 2015.
additionally, we entered into a ground lease agreement with partners healthcare to bring more than 700,000 square feet of office space and an additional 100,000 square feet of retail space to assembly row. the ground lease agreement includes a purchase option. partners healthcare commenced construction on this new building in september 2014 and plans to relocate over 4,500 employees to assembly row starting in 2016.
our pike & rose project in north bethesda, md, a long-term multi-phased mixed-use project, currently has zoning entitlements to build 1.6 million square feet of commercial-use buildings and 1,605 residential units. phase i of pike & rose involved demolition of roughly 25% of the gross leasable area at mid-pike plaza (which was completed during the second quarter of 2012). the remainder of mid-pike plaza was fully demolished in the third quarter of 2014. phase i of pike & rose includes 493 residential units, 151,000 square feet of retail space and 79,000 square feet of office space. in late june 2014, our 174 unit residential building opened and is 85.1% leased as of december 31, 2014. approximately 79,000 square feet of the retail space in phase i opened in 2014 and we expect the remaining retail, office and 319 unit residential building to open in 2015. we expect phase i to stabilize in 2015/2016. total expected costs for phase i of pike & rose range from $255 million to $265 million of which $217 million has been incurred to date.
additionally, we are proceeding with development of phase ii of pike & rose and expect building construction to commence in the first half of 2015. phase ii is expected to include approximately 185,000 square feet of retail space, a 177-room select-service hotel and 264 residential units. total expected costs range from $195 million to $200 million and stabilization is expected in 2018/2019. the hotel will be owned and operated by a joint venture in which we will be a partner. phase ii is also expected to include 104 for-sale condominium units with an expected cost of $50 million to $53 million. we invested $128 million in pike & rose in 2014 and expect to invest between $80 million and $110 million in pike & rose in 2015.
the development of future phases of assembly row, pike & rose and santana row will be pursued opportunistically based on, among other things, market conditions, tenant demand, and our evaluation of whether those phases will generate an appropriate financial return.
we continue to review acquisition opportunities in our primary markets that complement our portfolio and provide long-term growth opportunities. initially, some of our acquisitions do not contribute significantly to earnings growth; however, we believe they provide long-term re-leasing growth, redevelopment opportunities, and other strategic opportunities. any growth from acquisitions is contingent on our ability to find properties that meet our qualitative standards at prices that meet our financial hurdles. changes in interest rates may affect our success in achieving earnings growth through acquisitions by affecting both the price that must be paid to acquire a property, as well as our ability to economically finance the property acquisition. generally, our acquisitions are initially financed by available cash and/or borrowings under our revolving credit facility which may be repaid later with funds raised through the issuance of new equity or new long-term debt. we may also finance our
35
acquisitions through the issuance of common shares, preferred shares, or downreit units as well as through new or assumed mortgages.
at december 31, 2014, the leasable square feet in our properties was 94.7% occupied and 95.6% leased. the leased rate is higher than the occupied rate due to leased spaces that are being redeveloped or improved or that are awaiting permits and, therefore, are not yet ready to be occupied. our occupancy and leased rates are subject to variability over time due to factors including acquisitions, the timing of the start and stabilization of our redevelopment projects, lease expirations and tenant bankruptcies.
same-center throughout this section, we have provided certain information on a "same-center" basis. information provided on a same-center basis includes the results of properties that we owned and operated for the entirety of both periods being compared except for properties for which significant redevelopment or expansion occurred during either of the periods being compared and properties classified as discontinued operations. for the year ended december 31, 2014 and the comparison of 2014 and 2013, all or a portion of 78 properties were considered same-center and thirteen properties were considered redevelopment or expansion. for the year ended december 31, 2014, two properties were moved from same-center to redevelopment, one property was moved from redevelopment to same-center, and one property was moved from redevelopment as it was vacant and was demolished in 2014, compared to the designations as of december 31, 2013. for the year ended december 31, 2013 and the comparison of 2013 and 2012, all or a portion of 79 properties were considered same-center and eleven properties were considered redevelopment or expansion. for the year ended december 31, 2013, three properties were moved from acquisition to same-center and one property was moved from redevelopment to same-center compared to the designations as of december 31, 2012. while there is judgment surrounding changes in designations, we typically move redevelopment properties to same-center once they have stabilized, which is typically considered 95% occupancy or when the growth expected from the redevelopment has been included in the comparable periods.  we typically remove properties from same center when the redevelopment has or is expected to have a significant impact to property operating income within the calendar year.  acquisitions are moved to same-center once we have owned the property for the entirety of comparable periods and the property is not under significant redevelopment or expansion.

property revenues total property revenue increased $48.7 million, or 7.6%, to $686.1 million in 2014 compared to $637.4 million in 2013. the percentage occupied at our shopping centers decreased to 94.7% at december 31, 2014 compared to 95.1% at december 31, 2013. changes in the components of property revenue are discussed below.
rental income rental income consists primarily of minimum rent, cost reimbursements from tenants and percentage rent. rental income increased $46.2 million, or 7.5%, to $666.3 million in 2014 compared to $620.1 million in 2013 due primarily to the following:
•   an increase of $17.7 million at same-center properties due primarily to higher rental rates of approximately $9.4 million and a $7.4 million increase in recovery income (largely the result of reimbursements for higher snow removal costs),
•   an increase of $16.6 million attributable to properties acquired in 2014 and 2013,
•   an increase of $8.0 million at redevelopment properties due primarily to the lease-up of our new 212 unit residential building at santana row and the net impact of other redevelopment properties, and
•   an increase of $6.4 million from assembly row and pike &amp;rose as portions of both projects opened in 2014, partially offset by,
•   a decrease of $1.9 million from mid-pike plaza as the property was demolished in 2014 for the future development of pike &amp; rose.
37
other property income other property income increased $2.6 million, or 21.3%, to $14.8 million in 2014 compared to $12.2 million in 2013. included in other property income are items which, although recurring, inherently tend to fluctuate more than rental income from period to period, such as lease termination fees. this increase is primarily due to an increase in lease termination fees at same-center properties.
property expenses total property expenses increased $21.5 million, or 11.3%, to $211.9 million in 2014 compared to $190.5 million in 2013. changes in the components of property expenses are discussed below.
rental expenses rental expenses increased $16.7 million, or 14.1%, to $135.4 million in 2014 compared to $118.7 million in 2013. this increase is primarily due to the following:
•   an increase of $5.6 million in repairs and maintenance expenses at same-center and redevelopment properties primarily due to higher snow removal costs,
•   an increase of $5.4 million related to assembly row and pike &amp; rose, as portions of these projects opened in 2014,
•   an increase of $3.2 million related to properties acquired in 2014 and 2013,
•   an increase of $1.6 million in bad debt expense at same-center properties, and
•   an increase of $0.8 million in utilities at our same-center and redevelopment properties primarily due to higher electric costs and usage as a result of the harsh winter.
as a result of the changes in rental income and rental expenses as discussed above, rental expenses as a percentage of rental income plus other property income increased to 19.9% for the year ended december 31, 2014 from 18.8% for the year ended december 31, 2013.
real estate taxes real estate tax expense increased $4.7 million, or 6.6% to $76.5 million in 2014 compared to $71.8 million in 2013 due primarily to higher assessments and lower refunds at our same-center and redevelopment properties and real estate taxes on properties acquired in 2014 and 2013.
property operating income property operating income increased $27.2 million, or 6.1%, to $474.2 million in 2014 compared to $447.0 million in 2013. this increase is primarily due to growth in earnings at same-center properties, properties acquired in 2014 and 2013, and earnings from our redevelopment properties, partially offset by a decline in earnings at mid-pike plaza, which was demolished in 2014.
other interest expense interest expense decreased $11.0 million, or 10.5%, to $93.9 million in 2014 compared to $105.0 million in 2013. this decrease is due primarily to the following:
•   a decrease of $12.0 million due to a lower overall weighted average borrowing rate, and
•   an increase of $4.8 million in capitalized interest due primarily to our ongoing development projects at assembly row and pike &amp; rose, partially offset by
•   an increase of $5.6 million due to higher borrowings.
gross interest costs were $114.9 million and $121.2 million in 2014 and 2013, respectively. capitalized interest was $21.0 million and $16.2 million in 2014 and 2013, respectively.
38
early extinguishment of debt the $10.5 million early extinguishment of debt in 2014 relates to the make-whole premium paid as part of the early redemption of our 5.65% senior notes, the prepayment premium on our east bay bridge mortgage loan, and the related write-off of unamortized debt fees and mortgage premium balance.
the $13.3 million early extinguishment of debt in 2013 relates to the make-whole premiums paid as part of the early redemption of our 5.40% senior notes and 5.95% senior notes, the prepayment premium on our 7.5% mortgage loans, and the related write-off of unamortized debt fees.
depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization expense increased $10.0 million, or 6.2%, to $170.8 million in 2014 from $160.8 million in 2013. this increase is due primarily to 2014 acquisitions and redevelopment projects placed in service in 2014, partially offset by accelerated depreciation in 2013 due to the change in use of a redevelopment property.
discontinued operations- income income from discontinued operations represents the operating income of properties that were disposed prior to january 1, 2014, which were required to be reported separately from results of ongoing operations. the reported operating income of $0.9 million for 2013 primarily represents the operating income for the period during which we owned properties sold in 2013.
discontinued operations-gain on sale of real estate the $23.9 million gain on sale of real estate from discontinued operations for 2013 is due to the sale of the fee interest in our final building at fifth avenue on july 22, 2013 and the sale of the fee interest in our building in forest hills on september 10, 2013.
gain on sale of real estate the $4.4 million gain on sale of real estate for 2014 is due to our portion of the gain resulting from the partnership's sale of the fee interest in pleasant shops in weymouth, massachusetts.
the $5.0 million gain on sale of real estate for 2013 is primarily due to the sale of the fee interest in the land under an office building at our village of shirlington property in arlington, virginia, that was subject to a long term ground lease. the ground lease included an option for the tenant to purchase the fee interest.

property revenues total property revenue increased $31.6 million, or 5.2%, to $637.4 million in 2013 compared to $605.8 million in 2012. the percentage occupied at our shopping centers increased to 95.1% at december 31, 2013 compared to 94.9% at december 31, 2012. changes in the components of property revenue are discussed below.
rental income rental income consists primarily of minimum rent, cost reimbursements from tenants and percentage rent. rental income increased $40.0 million, or 6.9%, to $620.1 million in 2013 compared to $580.1 million in 2012 due primarily to the following:
•   an increase of $23.3 million at same-center properties due primarily to higher rental rates of approximately $11.6 million, higher occupancy of approximately $3.9 million, and an increase in recovery income due to higher recoverable expenses,
•   an increase of $14.0 million attributable to properties acquired in 2013 and 2012, and
•   an increase of $2.0 million at redevelopment properties due primarily to the lease-up and stabilization of certain of our redevelopment properties partially offset by lower income from mid-pike plaza as the property was prepared for the development of pike &amp; rose.
other property income other property income decreased $8.0 million, or 39.8%, to $12.2 million in 2013 compared to $20.2 million in 2012. included in other property income are items which, although recurring, inherently tend to fluctuate more than rental income from period to period, such as lease termination fees. this decrease is primarily due to lower lease termination fees at same-center properties, largely from a $6.0 million lease termination fee received in 2012 from an anchor tenant at ellisburg shopping center.
40
property expenses total property expenses increased $11.4 million, or 6.4%, to $190.5 million in 2013 compared to $179.1 million in 2012. changes in the components of property expenses are discussed below.
rental expenses rental expenses increased $6.1 million, or 5.4%, to $118.7 million in 2013 compared to $112.6 million in 2012. this increase is primarily due to the following:
•   an increase of $4.0 million in repairs and maintenance expenses at same-center and redevelopment properties primarily due to snow removal costs,
•   an increase of $2.1 million related to properties acquired in 2013 and 2012,
•   an increase of $1.3 million in marketing expenses primarily at our assembly row and pike &amp; rose projects, partially offset by
•   a decrease of $1.7 million in bad debt expense.
rental expenses as a percentage of rental income plus other property income was 18.8% for the years ended december 31, 2013 and 2012.
real estate taxes real estate tax expense increased $5.3 million, or 8.0% to $71.8 million in 2013 compared to $66.5 million in 2012 due primarily to net higher assessments at same-center properties and properties acquired in 2013 and 2012.
property operating income property operating income increased $20.2 million, or 4.7%, to $447.0 million in 2013 compared to $426.7 million in 2012. this increase is primarily due to growth in earnings at same-center properties, properties acquired in 2013 and 2012, and redevelopment properties.
other interest expense interest expense decreased $8.4 million, or 7.4%, to $105.0 million in 2013 compared to $113.3 million in 2012. this decrease is due primarily to the following:
•   a decrease of $11.6 million due to a lower overall weighted average borrowing rate, and
•   an increase of $6.1 million in capitalized interest, partially offset by
•   an increase of $9.3 million due to higher borrowings.
gross interest costs were $121.2 million and $123.4 million in 2013 and 2012, respectively. capitalized interest was $16.2 million and $10.1 million in 2013 and 2012, respectively.
early extinguishment of debt the $13.3 million early extinguishment of debt in 2013 relates to the make-whole premiums paid as part of the early redemption of our 5.40% senior notes and 5.95% senior notes, the prepayment premium on our 7.5% mortgage loans, and the related write-off of unamortized debt fees.
general and administrative expense general and administrative expense increased $0.8 million, or 2.6%, to $32.0 million in 2013 from $31.2 million in 2012. this increase is due primarily to an increase in employee related costs and transaction costs partially offset by costs incurred in 2012 related to the cfo transition.
41
depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization expense increased $19.1 million, or 13.5%, to $160.8 million in 2013 from $141.7 million in 2012. this increase is due primarily to 2013 and 2012 acquisitions and accelerated depreciation due to the change in use of a redevelopment property.
discontinued operations- income income from discontinued operations represents the operating income of properties that were disposed prior to january 1, 2014, which were required to be reported separately from results of ongoing operations. the reported operating income of $0.9 million and $1.4 million for 2013 and 2012, respectively, primarily represents the operating income for the period during which we owned properties sold in 2013.
discontinued operations-gain on sale of real estate the $23.9 million gain on sale of real estate from discontinued operations for 2013 is due to the sale of the fee interest in our final building at fifth avenue on july 22, 2013 and the sale of the fee interest in our building in forest hills on september 10, 2013.
gain on sale of real estate the $5.0 million gain on sale of real estate for 2013 is primarily due to the sale of the fee interest in the land under an office building at our village of shirlington property in arlington, virginia, that was subject to a long term ground lease. the ground lease included an option for the tenant to purchase the fee interest.
the $11.9 million gain on sale of real estate in 2012 is due to the sale of our newbury street partnership's entire portfolio of three buildings on october 31, 2011. due to the timing of receiving information from the general partner, our share of earnings was recorded one quarter in arrears. therefore, we recognized the gain on sale of $11.9 million in 2012.
liquidity and capital resources due to the nature of our business and strategy, we typically generate significant amounts of cash from operations. the cash generated from operations is primarily paid to our common and preferred shareholders in the form of dividends. as a reit, we must generally make annual distributions to shareholders of at least 90% of our taxable income.
our short-term liquidity requirements consist primarily of normal recurring operating expenses, obligations under our capital and operating leases, regular debt service requirements (including debt service relating to additional or replacement debt, as well as scheduled debt maturities), recurring expenditures, non-recurring expenditures (such as tenant improvements and redevelopments) and dividends to common and preferred shareholders. our long-term capital requirements consist primarily of maturities under our long-term debt agreements, development and redevelopment costs and potential acquisitions.
we intend to operate with and maintain a conservative capital structure that will allow us to maintain strong debt service coverage and fixed-charge coverage ratios as part of our commitment to investment-grade debt ratings. in the short and long term, we may seek to obtain funds through the issuance of additional equity, unsecured and/or secured debt financings, joint venture relationships relating to existing properties or new acquisitions, and property dispositions that are consistent with this conservative structure.
at december 31, 2014, we had $48.0 million of cash and cash equivalents and no borrowings outstanding on our $600.0 million revolving credit facility that matures on april 21, 2017, subject to a one-year extension at our option. in addition, we have an option (subject to bank approval) to increase the credit facility through an accordion feature to $1.0 billion. our $275.0 million unsecured term loan that matures on november 21, 2018, subject to a one-year extension at our option, also has an option (subject to bank approval) to increase the term loan through an accordion feature to $350.0 million. as of december 31, 2014, we had the capacity to issue up to $84.1 million in common shares under our atm equity program.
for 2014, the maximum amount of borrowings outstanding under our revolving credit facility was $79.5 million, the weighted average amount of borrowings outstanding was $12.5 million and the weighted average interest rate, before amortization of debt fees, was 1.07%. in november 2014, we accessed the public debt markets issuing $250 million of 30-year unsecured senior notes which bear interest at 4.5%.  the opportunistic issuance resulted in net proceeds of $244.6 million which were used to address $186 million of our 2016 debt maturities.
42
we currently believe that cash flows from operations, cash on hand, our atm equity program, our revolving credit facility and our general ability to access the capital markets will be sufficient to finance our operations and fund our debt service requirements and capital expenditures.
our overall capital requirements during 2015 will depend upon acquisition opportunities, the level of improvements and redevelopments on existing properties and the timing and cost of development of assembly row, pike & rose and future phases of santana row. while the amount of future expenditures will depend on numerous factors, we expect to continue to see higher levels of capital investments in our properties under development and redevelopment in 2015 which is the result of the continued development at both assembly row and pike & rose with openings of portions of both projects in 2015, the commencement of construction on phase ii of pike & rose, and the current phase of santana row. with respect to other capital investments related to our existing properties, we expect to incur levels consistent with prior years. our capital investments will be funded on a short-term basis with cash flow from operations, cash on hand and/or our revolving credit facility, and on a long-term basis, with long-term debt or equity including shares issued under our atm equity program. if necessary, we may access the debt or equity capital markets to finance significant acquisitions. given our past ability to access the capital markets, we expect debt or equity to be available to us. although there is no intent at this time, if market conditions deteriorate, we may also delay the timing of certain development and redevelopment projects as well as limit future acquisitions, reduce our operating expenditures, or re-evaluate our dividend policy.
in addition to conditions in the capital markets which could affect our ability to access those markets, the following factors could affect our ability to meet our liquidity requirements:
•   restrictions in our debt instruments or preferred shares may limit us from incurring debt or issuing equity at all, or on acceptable terms under then-prevailing market conditions; and
•   we may be unable to service additional or replacement debt due to increases in interest rates or a decline in our operating performance.

net cash provided by operating activities increased $31.6 million to $346.1 million during 2014 from $314.5 million during 2013. the increase was primarily attributable to higher net income before certain non-cash items.
net cash used in investing activities increased $51.0 million to $396.2 million during 2014 from $345.2 million during 2013. the increase was primarily attributable to:
•   $93.7 million increase in capital investments and leasing costs in 2014 primarily related to our development projects at assembly row and pike &amp; rose,
•   $42.9 million in proceeds from the sale of real estate in 2013, and
•   $6.7 million contribution to our real estate partnership to repay the mortgage loans of two of its properties, partially offset by
•   $78.1 million decrease in acquisitions of real estate,
•   $10.4 million in distributions from our real estate partnership from the sale of pleasant shops in july 2014, and
•   $3.6 million received from the payoff of a mortgage loan receivable in july 2014.
43
net cash provided by financing activities decreased $73.6 million to $9.0 million during 2014 from $82.6 million in 2013. the decrease was primarily attributable to:
•   $319.8 million decrease from net proceeds on senior note issuances due to $244.6 million from our 4.50% senior notes issued in november 2014 as compared to $564.4 million from the issuance of our 2.75% senior notes in may 2013 and our 3.95% senior notes in december 2013, and
•   $22.2 million increase in dividends paid to shareholders due to an increase in the dividend rate and increased number of shares outstanding, partially offset by
•   $159.1 million decrease due to the redemption of $125.0 million of senior notes in 2014, as compared to the redemption of $285.0 million of senior notes in 2013,
•   $79.3 million decrease in repayment of mortgages, capital leases and notes payable due to the payoff of two mortgages totaling $84.3 million in 2014 compared to the repayment of six mortgages totaling $161.7 million in 2013, and
•   $29.6 million increase in net proceeds from the issuance of common shares due primarily to the sale of 1.8 million shares under our atm equity program at a weighted average price of $122.09 during 2014 compared to 1.7 million shares at a weighted average price of $108.01 during 2013.

_____________________
(1)   fixed rate debt includes our $275.0 million term loan as the rate is effectively fixed by two interest rate swap agreements.
(2)   amounts reflect our share of principal and interest payments on our unconsolidated joint venture's fixed rate debt.
(3)   variable rate debt includes a $9.4 million bond that had an interest rate of 0.06% at december 31, 2014 and our revolving credit facility, which currently has no outstanding balance and bears interest at libor plus 0.90%.
(4)   a master lease on melville mall includes a fixed price put option requiring us to purchase the property for $5.0 million. this obligation is included in real estate commitments.
(5)   includes a $9 million liability to one of the noncontrolling interest holders in the grove at shrewsbury which is expected to be settled in 2015.
in addition to the amounts set forth in the table above and other liquidity requirements previously discussed, the following potential commitments exist:
(a) under the terms of the congressional plaza partnership agreement, from and after january 1, 1986, an unaffiliated third party has the right to require us and the other minority partner to purchase its 29.47% interest in congressional plaza at the interest's then-current fair market value. if the other minority partner defaults in their obligation, we must purchase the full
44
interest. based on management's current estimate of fair market value as of december 31, 2014, our estimated liability upon exercise of the put option would range from approximately $72 million to $76 million.
(b) under the terms of a partnership which owns a project in southern california, if certain leasing and revenue levels are obtained for the property owned by the partnership, the other partner may require us to purchase their 10% partnership interest at a formula price based upon property operating income. the purchase price for the partnership interest will be paid using our common shares or, subject to certain conditions, cash. if the other partner does not redeem their interest, we may choose to purchase the partnership interest upon the same terms.
(c) under the terms of various other partnership agreements, the partners have the right to exchange their operating partnership units for cash or the same number of our common shares, at our option. as of december 31, 2014, a total of 917,255 operating partnership units are outstanding.
(d) the other member in montrose crossing has the right to require us to purchase all of its 10.1% interest in montrose crossing at the interest's then-current fair market value. if the other member fails to exercise its put option, we have the right to purchase its interest on or after december 27, 2021 at fair market value. based on management's current estimate of fair market value as of december 31, 2014, our estimated maximum liability upon exercise of the put option would range from approximately $9 million to $10 million.
(e) two of the members in plaza el segundo have the right to require us to purchase their 10.0% and 11.8% ownership interests at the interests' then-current fair market value. if the members fail to exercise their put options, we have the right to purchase each of their interests on or after december 30, 2026 at fair market value. based on management's current estimate of fair market value as of december 31, 2014, our estimated maximum liability upon exercise of the put option would range from approximately $18 million to $21 million. also, between january 1, 2017 and february 1, 2017, we have an option to purchase the preferred interest of another member in plaza el segundo. the purchase price will be the lesser of fair value or the $4.9 million stated value of the preferred interest plus any accrued and unpaid preferred returns.
(f) effective january 1, 2017, the other member in the grove at shrewsbury and brook 35 has the right to require us to purchase all of its approximately 4.8% interest in the grove at shrewsbury and approximately 8.8% interest in brook 35 at the interests' then-current fair market value.
(g) at december 31, 2014, we had letters of credit outstanding of approximately $13.0 million which are collateral for existing indebtedness and other obligations of the trust.
off-balance sheet arrangements we have a joint venture arrangement (the "partnership") with affiliates of a discretionary fund created and advised by ing clarion partners ("clarion"). we own 30% of the equity in the partnership and clarion owns 70%. we hold a general partnership interest, however, clarion also holds a general partnership interest and has substantive participating rights. we cannot make significant decisions without clarion's approval. accordingly, we account for our interest in the partnership using the equity method. as of december 31, 2014, the partnership owned six retail real estate properties. we are the manager of the partnership and its properties, earning fees for acquisitions, management, leasing and financing. we also have the opportunity to receive performance-based earnings through our partnership interest. the partnership is subject to a buy-sell provision which is customary in real estate joint venture agreements and the industry. either partner may initiate this provision at any time, which could result in either the sale of our interest or the use of available cash or borrowings to acquire clarion's interest. accounting policies for the partnership are similar to accounting policies followed by the trust. at december 31, 2014, our investment in the partnership was $32.4 million and the partnership had approximately $34.4 million of mortgages payable outstanding.
other than the joint venture described above and items disclosed in the contractual commitments table, we have no off-balance sheet arrangements as of december 31, 2014 that are reasonably likely to have a current or future material effect on our financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources.

1)   mortgages payable do not include our 30% share ($10.3 million) of the $34.4 million debt of the partnership with a discretionary fund created and advised by ing clarion partners.
2)   we entered into two interest rate swap agreements that fix the libor portion of the interest rate on the term loan at 1.72%. the spread on the term loan was reduced from 130 basis points to 90 basis points on august 28, 2014 resulting in a fixed rate of 2.62%.
3)   the bonds require monthly interest only payments through maturity. the bonds bear interest at a variable rate determined weekly, which would enable the bonds to be remarketed at 100% of their principal amount. the escondido promenade property is not encumbered by a lien.
4)   the maximum amount drawn under our revolving credit facility during 2014 was $79.5 million and the weighted average effective interest rate on borrowings under our revolving credit facility, before amortization of debt fees, was 1.07%.
our revolving credit facility, term loan and other debt agreements include financial and other covenants that may limit our operating activities in the future. as of december 31, 2014, we were in compliance with all of the financial and other covenants. if we were to breach any of our debt covenants and did not cure the breach within an applicable cure period, our lenders could require us to repay the debt immediately and, if the debt is secured, could immediately begin proceedings to take possession of the property securing the loan. many of our debt arrangements, including our public notes, term loan and our revolving credit facility, are cross-defaulted, which means that the lenders under those debt arrangements can put us in default and require immediate repayment of their debt if we breach and fail to cure a default under certain of our other debt obligations. as a result, any default under our debt covenants could have an adverse effect on our financial condition, our results of operations, our ability to meet our obligations and the market value of our shares. our organizational documents do not limit the level or amount of debt that we may incur.
the following is a summary of our scheduled principal repayments as of december 31, 2014:

1)   our $600.0 million revolving credit facility matures on april 21, 2017, subject to a one-year extension at our option. as of december 31, 2014, there was no balance outstanding under this credit facility.
2)   the total debt maturities differs from the total reported on the consolidated balance sheet due to the unamortized net premium or discount on certain mortgage loans and senior notes as of december 31, 2014.

interest rate hedging we may use derivative instruments to manage exposure to variable interest rate risk. we generally enter into interest rate swaps to manage our exposure to variable interest rate risk and treasury locks to manage the risk of interest rates rising prior to the issuance of debt. we enter into derivative instruments that qualify as cash flow hedges and do not enter into derivative instruments for speculative purposes.
the interest rate swaps associated with our cash flow hedges are recorded at fair value on a recurring basis. we assess effectiveness of our cash flow hedges both at inception and on an ongoing basis. the effective portion of changes in fair value of the interest rate swaps associated with our cash flow hedges is recorded in other comprehensive (loss) income which is included in accumulated other comprehensive loss on our consolidated balance sheet and our consolidated statement of shareholders' equity. our cash flow hedges become ineffective if critical terms of the hedging instrument and the debt instrument do not perfectly match such as notional amounts, settlement dates, reset dates, calculation period and libor rate. in addition, we evaluate the default risk of the counterparty by monitoring the credit worthiness of the counterparty which includes reviewing debt ratings and financial performance. however, management does not anticipate non-performance by the counterparty. if a cash flow hedge is deemed ineffective, the ineffective portion of changes in fair value of the interest rate swaps associated with our cash flow hedges is recognized in earnings in the period affected.
as of december 31, 2014, we are party to two interest rate swap agreements that effectively fixed the rate on the term loan at 2.62%. both swaps were designated and qualified as cash flow hedges and were recorded at fair value. hedge ineffectiveness has not impacted earnings in 2014, 2013 and 2012, and we do not anticipate it will have a significant effect in the future.
reit qualification we intend to maintain our qualification as a reit under section 856(c) of the code. as a reit, we generally will not be subject to corporate federal income taxes on income we distribute to our shareholders as long as we satisfy certain technical requirements of the code, including the requirement to distribute at least 90% of our taxable income to our shareholders.
funds from operations funds from operations ("ffo") is a supplemental non-gaap financial measure of real estate companies' operating performance. the national association of real estate investment trusts ("nareit") defines ffo as follows: net income, computed in accordance with the u.s. gaap, plus real estate related depreciation and amortization and excluding extraordinary items and gains and losses on the sale of real estate. we compute ffo in accordance with the nareit definition, and we have historically reported our ffo available for common shareholders in addition to our net income and net cash provided by operating activities. it should be noted that ffo:
•   does not represent cash flows from operating activities in accordance with gaap (which, unlike ffo, generally reflects all cash effects of transactions and other events in the determination of net income);
•   should not be considered an alternative to net income as an indication of our performance; and
•   is not necessarily indicative of cash flow as a measure of liquidity or ability to fund cash needs, including the payment of dividends.
we consider ffo available for common shareholders a meaningful, additional measure of operating performance primarily because it excludes the assumption that the value of the real estate assets diminishes predictably over time, as implied by the historical cost convention of gaap and the recording of depreciation. we use ffo primarily as one of several means of assessing our operating performance in comparison with other reits. comparison of our presentation of ffo to similarly titled measures for other reits may not necessarily be meaningful due to possible differences in the application of the nareit definition used by such reits.
an increase or decrease in ffo available for common shareholders does not necessarily result in an increase or decrease in aggregate distributions because our board of trustees is not required to increase distributions on a quarterly basis unless necessary for us to maintain reit status. however, we must distribute at least 90% of our taxable income to remain qualified as a reit. therefore, a significant increase in ffo will generally require an increase in distributions to shareholders although not necessarily on a proportionate basis.
in addition to ffo, we have also included ffo excluding the "early extinguishment of debt" charges in 2014 and 2013 which relate to the early redemption of our 5.65% senior notes and east bay bridge mortgage loan in 2014, and our 5.40% senior notes, 5.95% senior notes, and 7.50% mortgages loans in 2013. we believe the unusual nature of these charges, being make-whole payments on the remaining principal and interest on the redeemed notes/mortgages, is worthy of separate evaluation and consequently have provided both relevant metrics.

_____________________
(1)   the weighted average common shares used to compute ffo per diluted common share includes operating partnership units that were excluded from the computation of diluted eps. conversion of these operating partnership units is dilutive in the computation of ffo per diluted common share but is anti-dilutive for the computation of diluted eps for the periods presented.

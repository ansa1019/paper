item 1a. risk factors the following risk factors should be read carefully in connection with evaluating our business and the forward-looking statements contained in this annual report on form 10-k. any of the following risks could materially adversely affect our business, our results of operations, our cash flows, our financial position and the actual outcome of matters as to which forward-looking statements are made in this annual report on form 10-k.
we (1) may from time to time make written or oral forward-looking statements, including earnings guidance and other statements contained in filings with the sec, reports to security holders, press releases and investor webcasts. you can identify these forward-looking statements by use of words such as "strategy," "expects," "continues," "plans," "anticipates," "believes," "will," "estimates," "forecasts," "intends," "projects," "goals," "objectives," "guidance," "targets" and other words of similar meaning. you can also identify them by the fact that they do not relate strictly to historical or current facts.
we cannot guarantee that any forward-looking statement will be realized, although we believe we have been prudent in our plans and assumptions. achievement of future results is subject to risks, uncertainties and assumptions that may prove to be inaccurate. should known or unknown risks or uncertainties materialize, or should underlying assumptions prove inaccurate, actual results could vary materially from those anticipated, estimated or projected. you should bear this in mind as you consider forward-looking statements and whether to invest in or remain invested in altria group, inc.'s securities. in connection with the "safe harbor" provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of 1995, we are identifying important factors that, individually or in the aggregate, could cause actual results and outcomes to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements made by us; any such statement is qualified by reference to the following cautionary statements. ___________________________________________________
1 this section uses the terms "we," "our" and "us" when it is not necessary to distinguish among altria group, inc. and its various operating subsidiaries or when any distinction is clear from the context.

we elaborate on these and other risks we face throughout this document, particularly in the "business environment" sections preceding our discussion of operating results of our subsidiaries' businesses in item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations of this annual report on form 10-k ("item 7"). you should understand that it is not possible to predict or identify all risk factors. consequently, you should not consider the following to be a complete discussion of all potential risks or uncertainties. we do not undertake to update any forward-looking statement that we may make from time to time except as required by applicable law.
unfavorable litigation outcomes could materially adversely affect the consolidated results of operations, cash flows or financial position of altria group, inc., or the businesses of one or more of its subsidiaries.
legal proceedings covering a wide range of matters are pending or threatened in various united states and foreign jurisdictions against altria group, inc. and its subsidiaries, including pm usa and ust and its subsidiaries, as well as their respective indemnitees. various types of claims may be raised in these proceedings, including product liability, consumer protection, antitrust, tax, contraband-related claims, patent infringement, employment matters, claims for contribution and claims of competitors and distributors.
litigation is subject to uncertainty and it is possible that there could be adverse developments in pending or future cases. an unfavorable outcome or settlement of pending tobacco-related or other litigation could encourage the commencement of additional litigation. damages claimed in some tobacco-related or other litigation are significant and, in certain cases, range in the billions of dollars. the variability in pleadings in multiple jurisdictions, together with the actual experience of management in litigating claims, demonstrate that the monetary relief that may be specified in a lawsuit bears little relevance to the ultimate outcome. in certain cases, plaintiffs claim that defendants' liability is joint and several. in such cases, altria group, inc. or its subsidiaries may face the risk that one or more co-defendants decline or otherwise fail to participate in the bonding required for an appeal or to pay their proportionate or jury-allocated share of a judgment.  as a result, altria group, inc. or its subsidiaries under certain circumstances may have to pay more than their proportionate share of any bonding- or judgment-related amounts. furthermore, in those cases where plaintiffs are successful, altria group, inc. or its subsidiaries may also be required to pay interest and attorneys' fees.
although pm usa has historically been able to obtain required bonds or relief from bonding requirements in order to prevent plaintiffs from seeking to collect judgments while adverse verdicts have been appealed, there remains a risk that such relief may not be obtainable in all cases. this risk has been substantially reduced given that 46 states and puerto rico now limit the dollar amount of bonds or require no bond at all. as discussed in note 18, contingencies to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 ("note 18"), tobacco litigation plaintiffs have challenged the constitutionality of florida's bond cap statute in several cases and plaintiffs may challenge state bond cap statutes in other jurisdictions as well. such challenges may include the applicability of state bond caps in federal court. although we cannot predict the outcome of such challenges, it is possible that the consolidated results of operations, cash flows or financial position of altria group, inc., or the businesses of one or more of its subsidiaries, could be materially adversely affected in a particular fiscal quarter or fiscal year by an unfavorable outcome of one or more such challenges.
in certain litigation, pm usa faces potentially significant non-monetary remedies. for example, in the lawsuit brought by the united states department of justice, discussed in note 18, the district court did not impose monetary penalties but ordered significant non-monetary remedies, including the issuance of "corrective statements" in various media.
altria group, inc. and its subsidiaries have achieved substantial success in managing litigation. nevertheless, litigation is subject to uncertainty, and significant challenges remain.
it is possible that the consolidated results of operations, cash flows or financial position of altria group, inc., or the businesses of one or more of its subsidiaries, could be materially adversely affected in a particular fiscal quarter or fiscal year by an unfavorable outcome or settlement of certain pending litigation. altria group, inc. and each of its subsidiaries named as a defendant believe, and each has been so advised by counsel handling the respective cases, that it has valid defenses to the litigation pending against it, as well as valid bases for appeal of adverse verdicts. each of the companies has defended, and will continue to defend, vigorously against litigation challenges. however, altria group, inc. and its subsidiaries may enter into settlement discussions in particular cases if they believe it is in the best interests of altria group, inc. to do so. see item 3. legal proceedings of this annual report on form 10-k ("item 3"), note 18 and exhibits 99.1 and 99.2 to this annual report on form 10-k for a discussion of pending tobacco-related litigation.
significant federal, state and local governmental actions, including actions by the fda, and various private sector actions may continue to have an adverse impact on our tobacco subsidiaries' businesses.
as described in tobacco space - business environment in item 7, pm usa faces significant governmental and private sector actions, including efforts aimed at reducing the incidence of tobacco use and efforts seeking to hold pm usa responsible for the adverse health effects associated with both smoking and exposure to environmental tobacco smoke. these actions, combined with the diminishing social acceptance of smoking, have resulted in reduced cigarette industry volume, and we expect that these factors will continue to reduce cigarette consumption levels.
actions by the fda, other federal, state or local governments or agencies, including those actions described in tobacco space - business environment in item 7, may impact the consumer acceptability of tobacco products, limit adult tobacco consumer choices, delay or prevent the launch of new or modified tobacco
5
products or products with claims of reduced risk, restrict communications to adult tobacco consumers, restrict the ability to differentiate tobacco products, create a competitive advantage or disadvantage for certain tobacco companies, impose additional manufacturing, labeling or packing requirements, require the recall or removal of tobacco products from the marketplace (including without limitation as a result of product contamination), interrupt manufacturing or otherwise significantly increase the cost of doing business, or restrict or prevent the use of specified tobacco products in certain locations or the sale of tobacco products by certain retail establishments. any one or more of these actions may have a material adverse impact on the business, consolidated results of operations, cash flows or financial position of altria group, inc. and its tobacco subsidiaries.
tobacco products are subject to substantial taxation, which could have an adverse impact on sales of the tobacco products of altria group, inc.'s tobacco subsidiaries.
tobacco products are subject to substantial excise taxes, and significant increases in tobacco product-related taxes or fees have been proposed or enacted and are likely to continue to be proposed or enacted within the united states at the state, federal and local levels. tax increases are expected to continue to have an adverse impact on sales of the tobacco products of our tobacco subsidiaries through lower consumption levels and the potential shift in adult consumer purchases from the premium to the non-premium or discount segments or to other low-priced or low-taxed tobacco products or to counterfeit and contraband products. such shifts may have an adverse impact on the reported share performance of tobacco products of altria group, inc.'s tobacco subsidiaries. for further discussion, see tobacco space - business environment - excise taxes in item 7.
our tobacco businesses face significant competition and their failure to compete effectively could have an adverse effect on the business of altria group, inc.'s tobacco subsidiaries.
each of altria group, inc.'s tobacco subsidiaries operates in highly competitive tobacco categories. settlements of certain tobacco litigation in the united states, among other factors, have resulted in substantial cigarette price increases. pm usa faces competition from lowest priced brands sold by certain united states and foreign manufacturers that have cost advantages because they are not parties to these settlements. these manufacturers may fail to comply with related state escrow legislation or may avoid escrow deposit obligations on the majority of their sales by concentrating on certain states where escrow deposits are not required or are required on fewer than all such manufacturers' cigarettes sold in such states. additional competition has resulted from diversion into the united states market of cigarettes intended for sale outside the united states, the sale of counterfeit cigarettes by third parties, the sale of cigarettes by third parties over the internet and by other means designed to avoid collection of applicable taxes, and imports of foreign lowest priced brands. usstc faces significant competition in the smokeless tobacco category and has experienced consumer down-trading to lower-priced brands. in the cigar category, additional competition has resulted from increased imports of machine-made large cigars manufactured offshore.
altria group, inc. and its subsidiaries may be unsuccessful in anticipating changes in adult consumer preferences, responding to changes in consumer purchase behavior or managing through difficult economic conditions.
each of our tobacco and wine subsidiaries is subject to intense competition and changes in adult consumer preferences. to be successful, they must continue to:
▪promote brand equity successfully;
▪   anticipate and respond to new and evolving adult consumer preferences;
▪   develop, manufacture, market and distribute products that appeal to adult consumers (including, where appropriate, through arrangements with, or investments in, third parties);
▪improve productivity; and
▪   protect or enhance margins through cost savings and price increases.
see tobacco space - business environment - summary in item 7 for additional discussion concerning evolving adult tobacco consumer preferences, including increased consumer awareness of, and expenditures on, e-vapor products. continued growth of this product category could further contribute to reductions in cigarette consumption levels and cigarette industry sales volume and could adversely affect the growth rates of other tobacco products.
the willingness of adult consumers to purchase premium consumer product brands depends in part on economic conditions, which could have a material adverse effect on the business, consolidated results of operations, cash flows or financial position of altria group, inc. and its subsidiaries. in periods of economic uncertainty, adult consumers may purchase more discount brands and/or, in the case of tobacco products, consider lower-priced tobacco products. our tobacco and wine subsidiaries work to broaden their brand portfolios to compete effectively with lower-priced products.
our financial services business (conducted through pmcc) holds investments in finance leases, principally in transportation (including aircraft), power generation and manufacturing equipment and facilities. its lessees are also subject to intense competition and economic conditions. if parties to pmcc's leases fail to manage through difficult economic and competitive conditions, pmcc may have to increase its allowance for losses, which would adversely affect our earnings.
altria group, inc.'s tobacco subsidiaries may be unsuccessful in developing and commercializing innovative tobacco products that may reduce the health risks associated with current tobacco products and that appeal to adult tobacco consumers.
6
altria group, inc.'s tobacco subsidiaries continue to develop and commercialize innovative tobacco products, including new product technologies that may reduce the health risks associated with current tobacco products, while continuing to offer adult tobacco consumers (within and outside the united states) products that meet their taste expectations and evolving preferences. examples include tobacco-containing and nicotine-containing products that reduce or eliminate exposure to cigarette smoke and/or constituents identified by public health authorities as harmful. these efforts may include arrangements with, or investments in, third parties. our tobacco subsidiaries may not succeed in these efforts, which would have an adverse effect on the ability to grow new revenue streams.
further, we cannot predict whether regulators, including the fda, will permit the marketing or sale of products with claims of reduced risk to consumers, the speed with which they may make such determinations or whether regulators will impose an unduly burdensome regulatory framework on such products. nor can we predict whether adult tobacco consumers' purchasing decisions would be affected by such claims if permitted. adverse developments on any of these matters could negatively impact the commercial viability of such products.
if our tobacco subsidiaries do not succeed in their efforts to develop and commercialize innovative tobacco products or to obtain regulatory approval for the marketing or sale of products with claims of reduced risk, but one or more of their competitors do succeed, our tobacco subsidiaries may be at a competitive disadvantage.
altria group, inc. and its subsidiaries' ability to grow new revenue streams may be limited if our operating companies are unable to move successfully into complementary products or processes.
altria group, inc. and its subsidiaries have adjacency growth strategies involving moves and potential moves into complementary products or processes. we cannot guarantee that these strategies, or any products introduced in connection with these strategies, will be successful. see the immediately preceding paragraph for a related discussion concerning new product technologies.
significant changes in tobacco leaf price, availability or quality could have an adverse effect on the profitability and business of altria group, inc.'s tobacco subsidiaries.
any significant change in tobacco leaf prices, quality or availability could adversely affect our tobacco subsidiaries' profitability and business. for further discussion, see tobacco space - business environment - price, availability and quality of agricultural products in item 7.
because altria group, inc.'s tobacco subsidiaries rely on a few significant facilities and a small number of significant suppliers, an extended disruption at a facility or in service by a supplier could have a material adverse effect on the business, the consolidated results of operations, cash flows or financial position of altria group, inc. and its tobacco subsidiaries.
altria group, inc.'s tobacco subsidiaries face risks inherent in reliance on a few significant facilities and a small number of significant suppliers. a natural or man-made disaster or other disruption that affects the manufacturing operations of any of altria group, inc.'s tobacco subsidiaries or the operations of any significant suppliers of any of altria group, inc.'s tobacco subsidiaries could adversely impact the operations of the affected subsidiaries. an extended disruption in operations experienced by one or more of altria group, inc.'s subsidiaries or significant suppliers could have a material adverse effect on the business, the consolidated results of operations, cash flows or financial position of altria group, inc. and its tobacco subsidiaries.
altria group, inc. may be unable to attract and retain the best talent due to the impact of decreasing social acceptance of tobacco usage and tobacco control actions.
our ability to implement our strategy of attracting and retaining the best talent may be impaired by the impact of decreasing social acceptance of tobacco usage and tobacco regulation and control actions. the tobacco industry competes for talent with the consumer products industry and other companies that enjoy greater societal acceptance.  as a result, we may be unable to attract and retain the best talent.
acquisitions or other events may adversely affect altria group, inc.'s credit rating, and altria group, inc. may not achieve its anticipated strategic or financial objectives.
altria group, inc. from time to time considers acquisitions and may engage in confidential acquisition negotiations that are not publicly announced unless and until those negotiations result in a definitive agreement. although we seek to maintain or improve our credit ratings over time, it is possible that completing a given acquisition or other event could impact our credit ratings or the outlook for those ratings. furthermore, acquisition opportunities are limited, and acquisitions present risks of failing to achieve efficient and effective integration, strategic objectives and anticipated revenue improvements and cost savings. there can be no assurance that we will be able to acquire attractive businesses on favorable terms, that we will realize any of the anticipated benefits from an acquisition or that acquisitions will be quickly accretive to earnings.
disruption and uncertainty in the debt capital markets could adversely affect altria group, inc.'s access to the debt capital markets, earnings and dividend rate.
access to the debt capital markets is important for us to satisfy our liquidity and financing needs. disruption and uncertainty in the credit and debt capital markets and any resulting adverse impact on credit availability, pricing and/or credit terms may negatively affect the amount of credit available to us and may also increase our costs and adversely affect our earnings or our dividend rate.
7
altria group, inc.'s reported earnings from and carrying value of its equity investment in sabmiller may be adversely affected by unfavorable foreign currency exchange rates and other factors.
for purposes of financial reporting, the earnings from and carrying value of our equity investment in sabmiller are translated into u.s. dollars from various local currencies. during times of a strengthening u.s. dollar against these currencies, our reported earnings from and carrying value of our equity investment in sabmiller will be reduced because the local currencies will translate into fewer u.s. dollars. the earnings from and carrying value of our equity investment in sabmiller are also subject to the risks encountered by sabmiller in its business.
altria group, inc. may be required to write down intangible assets, including goodwill, due to impairment, which would reduce earnings.
we periodically calculate the fair value of our reporting units and intangible assets to test for impairment. this calculation may be affected by several factors, including general economic conditions, regulatory developments, changes in category growth rates as a result of changing adult consumer preferences, success of planned new product introductions, competitive activity and tobacco-related taxes. if an impairment is determined to exist, we will incur impairment losses, which will reduce our earnings.
competition, unfavorable changes in grape supply and new governmental regulations or revisions to existing governmental regulations could adversely affect ste. michelle's wine business.
ste. michelle's business is subject to significant competition, including from many large, well-established domestic and international companies. the adequacy of ste. michelle's grape supply is influenced by consumer demand for wine in relation to industry-wide production levels as well as by weather and crop conditions, particularly in eastern washington. supply shortages related to any one or more of these factors could increase production costs and wine prices, which ultimately may have a negative impact on ste. michelle's sales. in addition, federal, state and local governmental agencies regulate the alcohol beverage industry through various means, including licensing requirements, pricing, labeling and advertising restrictions, and distribution and production policies. new regulations or revisions to existing regulations, resulting in further restrictions or taxes on the manufacture and sale of alcoholic beverages, may have an adverse effect on ste. michelle's wine business. for further discussion, see wine segment - business environment in item 7.
the failure of altria group, inc.'s information systems to function as intended, or the penetration by outside parties intent on disrupting business processes, could result in significant costs, loss of revenue, assets or personal or other sensitive data and reputational harm.
altria group, inc. and its subsidiaries use information systems to help manage business processes, collect and interpret business data and communicate internally and externally with employees, investors, suppliers, trade customers, adult tobacco consumers and others. many of these information systems are managed by third-party service providers. we have backup systems and business continuity plans in place and we take care to protect our systems and data from unauthorized access. nevertheless, failure of our systems to function as intended, or penetration of our systems by outside parties intent on extracting or corrupting information or otherwise disrupting business processes, could result in loss of revenue, assets or personal or other sensitive data, cause damage to the reputation of our companies and their brands and result in legal challenges and significant remediation and other costs to altria group, inc. and its subsidiaries.
unfavorable outcomes of any governmental investigations could materially affect the businesses of altria group, inc. and its subsidiaries.
from time to time, altria group, inc. and its subsidiaries are subject to governmental investigations on a range of matters. we cannot predict whether new investigations may be commenced or the outcome of such investigations, and it is possible that our business could be materially adversely affected by an unfavorable outcome of future investigations.
expanding international business operations subjects altria group, inc. and its subsidiaries to various united states and foreign laws and regulations, and violations of such laws or regulations could result in reputational harm, legal challenges and/or significant costs.
while altria group, inc. and its subsidiaries are primarily engaged in business activities in the united states, they do engage (directly or indirectly) in certain international business activities that are subject to various united states and foreign laws and regulations, such as the u.s. foreign corrupt practices act and other laws prohibiting bribery and corruption.  although we have a code of conduct and a compliance system designed to prevent and detect violations of applicable law, no system can provide assurance that it will always protect against improper actions by employees or third parties. violations of these laws, or allegations of such violations, could result in reputational harm, legal challenges and/or significant costs.
item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations.
the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the other sections of this annual report on form 10-k, including the consolidated financial statements and related notes contained in item 8, and the discussion of cautionary factors that may affect future results in item 1a.
description of the company at december 31, 2014, altria group, inc.'s wholly-owned subsidiaries included pm usa, which is engaged predominantly in the manufacture and sale of cigarettes in the united states; middleton, which is engaged in the manufacture and sale of machine-made large cigars and pipe tobacco, and is a wholly-owned subsidiary of pm usa; and ust, which through its wholly-owned subsidiaries, including usstc and ste. michelle, is engaged in the manufacture and sale of smokeless tobacco products and wine. altria group, inc.'s other operating companies included nu mark, a wholly-owned subsidiary that is engaged in the manufacture and sale of innovative tobacco products, and pmcc, a wholly-owned subsidiary that maintains a portfolio of finance assets, substantially all of which are leveraged leases. other altria group, inc. wholly-owned subsidiaries included altria group distribution company, which provides sales, distribution and consumer engagement services to certain altria group, inc. operating subsidiaries, and altria client services inc., which provides various support services, such as legal, regulatory, finance, human resources and external affairs, to altria group, inc. and its subsidiaries. in addition, nu mark and middleton use third-party contract manufacturing arrangements in the manufacture of their products. altria group, inc.'s access to the operating cash flows of its wholly-owned subsidiaries consists of cash received from the payment of dividends and distributions, and the payment of interest on intercompany loans by its subsidiaries. at december 31, 2014, altria group, inc.'s principal wholly-owned subsidiaries were not limited by long-term debt or other agreements in their ability to pay cash dividends or make other distributions with respect to their equity interests.
at december 31, 2014, altria group, inc. also held approximately 27% of the economic and voting interest of sabmiller, which altria group, inc. accounts for under the equity method of accounting. altria group, inc. receives cash dividends on its interest in sabmiller if and when sabmiller pays such dividends.
altria group, inc.'s reportable segments are smokeable products, smokeless products and wine. the financial services and the innovative tobacco products businesses are included in an all other category due to the continued reduction of the lease portfolio of pmcc and the relative financial contribution of altria group, inc.'s innovative tobacco products businesses to altria group, inc.'s consolidated results.
executive summary the following executive summary is intended to provide significant highlights of the discussion and analysis that follows.
consolidated results of operations the changes in altria group, inc.'s net earnings and diluted earnings per share ("eps") attributable to altria group, inc. for the year ended december 31, 2014, from the year ended december 31, 2013, were due primarily to the following:

see the discussion of events affecting the comparability of statement of earnings amounts in the consolidated operating results section of the following discussion and analysis.
▪   fewer shares outstanding: fewer shares outstanding during 2014 compared with 2013 were due primarily to shares repurchased by altria group, inc. under its share repurchase programs.
▪   change in tax rate: the change in tax rate was due primarily to a reduction in certain consolidated tax benefits in 2013 resulting from the 2013 debt tender offer, and an increased recognition of foreign tax credits in 2014 primarily associated with sabmiller dividends.
▪   operations: the increase of $238 million in operations shown in the table above was due primarily to the following:
▪   higher income from the smokeable products segment; and
▪lower interest and other debt expense, net;
partially offset by:
13
▪   higher investment spending in the innovative tobacco products businesses; and
▪lower income from the financial services business.
for further details, see the consolidated operating results and operating results by business segment sections of the following discussion and analysis.
2015 forecasted results in january 2015, altria group, inc. forecasted that its 2015 full-year adjusted diluted eps growth rate is expected to be in the range of 7% to 9% over 2014 full-year adjusted diluted eps. this forecasted growth rate excludes the net expenses in the table below.

see item 3.
altria group, inc. reports its financial results in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america ("u.s. gaap"). altria group, inc.'s management reviews certain financial results, including diluted eps, on an adjusted basis, which exclude certain income and expense items that management believes are not part of underlying operations. these items may include, for example, loss on early extinguishment of debt, restructuring charges, sabmiller special items, certain tax items, charges associated with tobacco and health litigation items, and settlements of, and determinations made in connection with, disputes with certain states and territories related to the non-participating manufacturer ("npm") adjustment provision under the 1998 master settlement agreement (the "msa") for the years 2003-2012 (such settlements and determinations are referred to collectively as "npm adjustment items" and are more fully described in health care cost recovery litigation - npm adjustment disputes in note 18). altria group, inc.'s management does not view any of these special items to be part of altria group, inc.'s sustainable results as they may be highly variable, are difficult to predict and can distort underlying business trends and results. altria group, inc.'s management believes that these adjusted financial measures provide useful insight into underlying business trends and results and provide a more meaningful comparison of year-over-year results. adjusted financial measures are used by management and regularly provided to altria group, inc.'s chief operating decision maker for planning, forecasting and evaluating business and financial performance, including allocating resources and evaluating results relative to employee compensation targets. these adjusted financial measures are not consistent with u.s. gaap, and should thus be considered as supplemental in nature and not considered in isolation or as a substitute for the related financial information prepared in accordance with u.s. gaap.
altria group, inc.'s full-year adjusted diluted eps guidance excludes the impact of certain income and expense items, including those items noted in the preceding paragraph. altria group, inc.'s management cannot estimate on a forward-looking basis the impact of these items on altria group, inc.'s reported diluted eps because these items, which could be significant, are difficult to predict and may be highly variable. as a result, altria group, inc. does not provide a corresponding u.s. gaap measure for, or a reconciliation to, its adjusted diluted eps guidance.
discussion and analysis critical accounting policies and estimates note 2 includes a summary of the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of altria group, inc.'s consolidated financial statements. in most instances, altria group, inc. must use an accounting policy or method because it is the only policy or method permitted under u.s. gaap.
the preparation of financial statements includes the use of estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent liabilities at the dates of the financial statements and the reported amounts of net revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. if actual amounts are ultimately different from previous estimates, the revisions are included in altria group, inc.'s consolidated results of operations for the period in which the actual amounts become known. historically, the aggregate differences, if any, between altria group, inc.'s estimates and actual amounts in any year have not had a significant impact on its consolidated financial statements.
the following is a review of the more significant assumptions and estimates, as well as the accounting policies and methods, used in the preparation of altria group, inc.'s consolidated financial statements:
▪consolidation: the consolidated financial statements include altria group, inc., as well as its wholly-owned and majority-owned subsidiaries. investments in which altria group, inc. exercises significant influence are accounted for under the equity method of accounting. all intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated.
▪revenue recognition: altria group, inc.'s businesses recognize revenues, net of sales incentives and sales returns, and including shipping and handling charges billed to
14
customers, upon shipment of goods when title and risk of loss pass to customers. payments received in advance of revenue recognition are deferred and recorded in other accrued liabilities until revenue is recognized. altria group, inc.'s businesses also include excise taxes billed to customers in net revenues. shipping and handling costs are classified as part of cost of sales.
▪depreciation, amortization, impairment testing and asset valuation: altria group, inc. depreciates property, plant and equipment and amortizes its definite-lived intangible assets using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets. machinery and equipment are depreciated over periods up to 25 years, and buildings and building improvements over periods up to 50 years. definite-lived intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives up to 25 years.
altria group, inc. reviews long-lived assets, including definite-lived intangible assets, for impairment whenever events or changes in business circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets may not be fully recoverable. altria group, inc. performs undiscounted operating cash flow analyses to determine if an impairment exists. these analyses are affected by general economic conditions and projected growth rates. for purposes of recognition and measurement of an impairment for assets held for use, altria group, inc. groups assets and liabilities at the lowest level for which cash flows are separately identifiable. if an impairment is determined to exist, any related impairment loss is calculated based on fair value. impairment losses on assets to be disposed of, if any, are based on the estimated proceeds to be received, less costs of disposal. altria group, inc. also reviews the estimated remaining useful lives of long-lived assets whenever events or changes in business circumstances indicate the lives may have changed.
goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets recorded by altria group, inc. at december 31, 2014 relate primarily to the acquisitions of green smoke in 2014, ust in 2009 and middleton in 2007. altria group, inc. conducts a required annual review of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for potential impairment, and more frequently if an event occurs or circumstances change that would require altria group, inc. to perform an interim review. if the carrying value of goodwill exceeds its fair value, which is determined using discounted cash flows, goodwill is considered impaired. the amount of impairment loss is measured as the difference between the carrying value and the implied fair value. if the carrying value of an indefinite-lived intangible asset exceeds its fair value, which is determined using discounted cash flows, the intangible asset is considered impaired and is reduced to fair value.
goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets, by reporting unit at december 31, 2014 were as follows:
(in millions)           goodwill         indefinite-livedintangible assets cigarettes                    $-                                        $2

during 2014, 2013 and 2012, altria group, inc. completed its quantitative annual impairment test of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets, and no impairment charges resulted.
at december 31, 2014, (i) the estimated fair values of the indefinite-lived intangible assets within the smokeless products, cigars and wine reporting units (except for the skoal trademark in the smokeless products reporting unit and the columbia crest trademark in the wine reporting unit) substantially exceeded their carrying values, (ii) the carrying values of the skoal and columbia crest trademarks were $3.9 billion and $54 million, respectively, and (iii) the estimated fair value of the smokeless products reporting unit did not substantially exceed its carrying value.
at december 31, 2014, the estimated fair value of the skoal trademark exceeded its carrying value by approximately 17%, and the estimated fair value of the smokeless products reporting unit exceeded its carrying value by approximately 20%. in the smokeless products reporting unit, 2014 results for skoal were impacted by strategies to enhance skoal's equity and targeted investments to narrow price gaps, which are expected to strengthen the brand over the long term. in addition, usstc estimates that the smokeless products category volume growth rate slowed to approximately 2% for 2014 as compared to approximately 5.5% for 2013. usstc continues to believe that the smokeless category's growth rate is best determined over a longer time horizon and will continue to monitor industry volume closely.
in 2014, altria group, inc. used an income approach to estimate the fair values of its reporting units and its indefinite-lived intangible assets. the income approach reflects the discounting of expected future cash flows to their present value at a rate of return that incorporates the risk-free rate for the use of those funds, the expected rate of inflation and the risks associated with realizing expected future cash flows. the average discount rate used in performing the valuations was approximately 10%.
in performing the 2014 discounted cash flow analysis, altria group, inc. made various judgments, estimates and assumptions, the most significant of which were volume, income, growth rates and discount rates. the analysis incorporated assumptions used in altria group, inc.'s long-term financial forecast and also included market participant assumptions regarding the highest and best use of altria group, inc.'s indefinite-lived intangible assets. assumptions are also
15
made for perpetual growth rates for periods beyond the long-term financial forecast. fair value calculations are sensitive to changes in these estimates and assumptions, some of which relate to broader macroeconomic conditions outside of altria group, inc.'s control.
although altria group, inc.'s discounted cash flow analysis is based on assumptions that are considered reasonable and based on the best available information at the time that the discounted cash flow analysis is developed, there is significant judgment used in determining future cash flows. the following factors have the most potential to impact expected future cash flows and, therefore, altria group, inc.'s impairment conclusions: general economic conditions; federal, state and local regulatory developments; changes in category growth rates as a result of changing consumer preferences; success of planned new product introductions; competitive activity; and tobacco-related taxes.
while altria group, inc.'s management believes that the estimated fair values of each reporting unit and indefinite-lived intangible asset are reasonable, actual performance in the short-term or long-term could be significantly different from forecasted performance, which could result in impairment charges in future periods.
for additional information on goodwill and other intangible assets, see note 4.
▪marketing costs: altria group, inc.'s businesses promote their products with consumer engagement programs, consumer incentives and trade promotions. such programs include, but are not limited to, discounts, coupons, rebates, in-store display incentives, event marketing and volume-based incentives. consumer engagement programs are expensed as incurred. consumer incentive and trade promotion activities are recorded as a reduction of revenues, a portion of which is based on amounts estimated as being due to customers and consumers at the end of a period, based principally on historical utilization and redemption rates. for interim reporting purposes, consumer engagement programs and certain consumer incentive expenses are charged to operations as a percentage of sales, based on estimated sales and related expenses for the full year.
▪contingencies: as discussed in note 18 and item 3, legal proceedings covering a wide range of matters are pending or threatened in various united states and foreign jurisdictions against altria group, inc. and its subsidiaries, including pm usa and ust and its subsidiaries, as well as their respective indemnitees. in 1998, pm usa and certain other u.s. tobacco product manufacturers entered into the msa with 46 states and various other governments and jurisdictions to settle asserted and unasserted health care cost recovery and other claims. pm usa and certain other u.s. tobacco product manufacturers had previously entered into agreements to settle similar claims brought by mississippi, florida, texas and minnesota (together with the msa, the "state settlement agreements"). pm usa's portion of ongoing adjusted payments and legal fees is based on its relative share of the settling manufacturers' domestic cigarette shipments, including roll-your-own cigarettes, in the year preceding that in which the payment is due. pm usa, usstc and middleton were also subject to payment obligations imposed by fetra. the fetra payment obligations expired after the third quarter of 2014. in addition, in june 2009, pm usa and usstc became subject to quarterly user fees imposed by the fda as a result of the fsptca. payments under the state settlement agreements, fetra and the fda user fees are based on variable factors, such as volume, market share and inflation, depending on the subject payment. altria group, inc.'s subsidiaries account for the cost of the state settlement agreements, fetra and fda user fees as a component of cost of sales. as a result of the state settlement agreements, fetra and fda user fees, altria group, inc.'s subsidiaries recorded approximately $4.9 billion, $4.4 billion and $5.1 billion of charges to cost of sales for the years ended december 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. the 2014 and 2013 amounts included reductions to cost of sales of $43 million and $664 million, respectively, related to the npm adjustment items discussed further below and in health care cost recovery litigation - npm adjustment disputes in note 18. in addition, the 2014 amount included a decrease in the charge to cost of sales of approximately $100 million, reflecting the expiration of the obligations imposed by fetra after the third quarter of 2014.
altria group, inc. and its subsidiaries record provisions in the consolidated financial statements for pending litigation when they determine that an unfavorable outcome is probable and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. at the present time, while it is reasonably possible that an unfavorable outcome in a case may occur, except to the extent discussed in note 18 and item 3: (i) management has concluded that it is not probable that a loss has been incurred in any of the pending tobacco-related cases; (ii) management is unable to estimate the possible loss or range of loss that could result from an unfavorable outcome in any of the pending tobacco-related cases; and (iii) accordingly, management has not provided any amounts in the consolidated financial statements for unfavorable outcomes, if any. litigation defense costs are expensed as incurred and included in marketing, administration and research costs on the consolidated statements of earnings.
▪employee benefit plans: as discussed in note 16. benefit plans to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 ("note 16"), altria group, inc. provides a range of benefits to its employees and retired employees, including pensions, postretirement health care and postemployment benefits (primarily severance). altria group, inc. records annual amounts relating to these plans based on calculations specified by u.s. gaap, which include various actuarial assumptions as to discount rates, assumed rates of return on plan assets, mortality, compensation increases, turnover rates and health care cost trend rates. altria group, inc. reviews its actuarial assumptions on an annual basis and makes modifications to the assumptions based on current rates and trends when it is deemed appropriate to do so. any effect of the modifications is generally amortized over future periods.
16
altria group, inc. recognizes the funded status of its defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans on the consolidated balance sheet and records as a component of other comprehensive earnings (losses), net of deferred income taxes, the gains or losses and prior service costs or credits that have not been recognized as components of net periodic benefit cost.
at december 31, 2014, altria group, inc.'s discount rate assumptions for its pension and postretirement plans decreased to 4.1% and 4.0%, respectively, from 4.9% and 4.8%, respectively, at december 31, 2013. in addition, at december 31, 2014, altria group, inc. updated its mortality assumptions to reflect longer life expectancy for its defined benefit pension plan and postretirement health care plan participants. altria group, inc. presently anticipates an increase of approximately $100 million in its 2015 pre-tax pension and postretirement expense versus 2014, not including amounts in each year, if any, related to termination, settlement and curtailment. this anticipated increase is due primarily to the impact of the updated mortality assumptions ($70 million). the impact of the lower discount rate was largely offset by the impact of higher than expected returns on plan assets. a 50 basis point decrease (increase) in altria group, inc.'s discount rates would increase (decrease) altria group, inc.'s pension and postretirement expense by approximately $52 million. similarly, a 50 basis point decrease (increase) in the expected return on plan assets would increase (decrease) altria group, inc.'s pension expense by approximately $34 million. see note 16 for a sensitivity discussion of the assumed health care cost trend rates.
▪income taxes: significant judgment is required in determining income tax provisions and in evaluating tax positions. altria group, inc.'s deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the difference between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities, using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse. altria group, inc. records a valuation allowance when it is more-likely-than-not that some portion or all of a deferred tax asset will not be realized.
altria group, inc. recognizes a benefit for uncertain tax positions when a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return is more-likely-than-not to be sustained upon examination by taxing authorities. the amount recognized is measured as the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50% likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement. altria group, inc. recognizes accrued interest and penalties associated with uncertain tax positions as part of the provision for income taxes on its consolidated statements of earnings.
as discussed in note 14. income taxes to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 ("note 14"), altria group, inc. recognized income tax benefits and charges in the consolidated statements of earnings during 2014, 2013 and 2012 as a result of various tax events.
▪leasing: substantially all of pmcc's net revenues in 2014 related to income on leveraged leases and related gains on asset sales. income attributable to leveraged leases is initially recorded as unearned income, which is included in the line item finance assets, net, on altria group, inc.'s consolidated balance sheets and subsequently recognized as revenue over the terms of the respective leases at constant after-tax rates of return on the positive net investment balances. as discussed in note 7, pmcc lessees are affected by bankruptcy filings, credit rating changes and financial market conditions.
pmcc's investment in leases is included in the line item finance assets, net, on the consolidated balance sheets as of december 31, 2014 and 2013. at december 31, 2014, pmcc's net finance receivables of approximately $1.7 billion, which are included in finance assets, net, on altria group, inc.'s consolidated balance sheet, consisted of rents receivable ($3.4 billion) and the residual value of assets under lease ($0.8 billion), reduced by third-party nonrecourse debt ($2.1 billion) and unearned income ($0.4 billion). the repayment of the nonrecourse debt is collateralized by lease payments receivable and the leased property, and is nonrecourse to the general assets of pmcc. as required by u.s. gaap, the third-party nonrecourse debt has been offset against the related rents receivable and has been presented on a net basis within finance assets, net, on altria group, inc.'s consolidated balance sheets. finance assets, net, of $1.6 billion at december 31, 2014 also included an allowance for losses.
estimated residual values represent pmcc's estimate at lease inception as to the fair values of assets under lease at the end of the non-cancelable lease terms. the estimated residual values are reviewed annually by pmcc's management, which includes analysis of a number of factors, including activity in the relevant industry. if necessary, revisions are recorded to reduce the residual values. in 2014 and 2012, pmcc's annual review of estimated residual values resulted in a decrease of $63 million and $19 million, respectively, to unguaranteed residual values. these decreases in unguaranteed residual values resulted in a reduction to pmcc's net revenues of $26 million and $8 million in 2014 and 2012, respectively. there were no such adjustments in 2013.
pmcc considers rents receivable past due when they are beyond the grace period of their contractual due date. pmcc stops recording income ("non-accrual status") on rents receivable when contractual payments become 90 days past due or earlier if management believes there is significant uncertainty of collectability of rent payments, and resumes recording income when collectability of rent payments is reasonably certain. payments received on rents receivable that are on non-accrual status are used to reduce the rents receivable balance. write-offs to the allowance for losses are recorded when amounts are deemed to be uncollectible. there were no rents receivable on non-accrual status at december 31, 2014.
to the extent that rents receivable due to pmcc may be uncollectible, pmcc records an allowance for losses against its finance assets. losses on such leases are recorded when probable and estimable. pmcc regularly performs a systematic assessment of each individual lease in its portfolio to determine potential credit or collection issues that might indicate impairment. impairment takes into consideration both the probability of default and the likelihood of recovery if
17
default were to occur. pmcc considers both quantitative and qualitative factors of each investment when performing its assessment of the allowance for losses. for further discussion, see note 7.

as discussed further in note 15, altria group, inc.'s chief operating decision maker reviews operating companies income to evaluate the performance of, and allocate resources to, the segments. operating companies income for the segments is defined as operating income before amortization of intangibles and general corporate expenses. management believes it is appropriate to disclose this measure to help investors analyze the business performance and trends of the various business segments.
the following events that occurred during 2014, 2013 and 2012 affected the comparability of statement of earnings amounts.
▪npm adjustment items:  for the years ended december 31, 2014 and 2013, pre-tax income for npm adjustment items was recorded in altria group, inc.'s consolidated statements of earnings as follows:
(in millions)                             2014   2013
smokeable products segment                 $43          $664

total                                      $90          $664
the amounts shown in the table above for the smokeable products segment were recorded by pm usa as reductions to costs of sales, which increased operating companies income in the smokeable products segment. for further discussion, see health care cost recovery litigation - npm adjustment disputes in note 18.
▪tobacco and health litigation items: for the years ended december 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, pre-tax charges related to certain tobacco and health litigations items were recorded in altria group, inc.'s consolidated statements of earnings as follows:
(in millions)                             2014        2013        2012

during the second quarter of 2014, altria group, inc. and pm usa recorded an aggregate pre-tax charge of $31 million in marketing, administration and research costs for the estimated costs of implementing the corrective communications remedy in connection with the federal government's lawsuit against altria group, inc. and pm usa. for further discussion, see health care cost recovery litigation - federal government lawsuit in note 18.
▪asset impairment, exit, integration and acquisition-related costs: pre-tax asset impairment, exit, integration and acquisition-related costs for the years ended december 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012 were $21 million, $11 million and $61 million, respectively.
for 2014, these costs consisted primarily of integration and acquisition-related costs of $28 million related to the acquisition of green smoke, partially offset by a pre-tax gain of $10 million from the sale of pm usa's cabarrus, north carolina manufacturing facility during the second quarter of 2014. for further discussion of the green smoke acquisition, see note 3.
for 2012, these costs were primarily due to altria group, inc.'s cost reduction program announced in 2011 (the "2011 cost reduction program").
for a breakdown of asset impairment and exit costs by segment, see note 15.
▪pmcc leveraged lease benefit: during the second quarter of 2012, altria group, inc. entered into a closing agreement (the "closing agreement") with the internal revenue service ("irs") that conclusively resolved the federal income tax treatment for all prior and future tax years of certain leveraged lease transactions entered into by pmcc. as a result of the closing agreement, altria group, inc. recorded a one-time net earnings benefit of $68 million during the second quarter of 2012 due primarily to lower than estimated interest on tax underpayments. see note 7 and note 14 for a further discussion of the closing agreement.

▪loss on early extinguishment of debt: during the fourth quarter of 2014, ust redeemed in full its $300 million (aggregate principal amount) 5.75% senior notes due 2018.
in addition, during the fourth quarter of 2013 and the third quarter of 2012, altria group, inc. completed debt tender offers to purchase for cash certain of its senior unsecured notes in aggregate principal amounts of $2.1 billion and $2.0 billion, respectively.
as a result of the ust debt redemption and the altria group, inc. debt tender offers, pre-tax losses on early extinguishment of debt were recorded as follows:

item 1a. risk   factors

as a financial services organization, we are subject to a number of risks inherent in our transactions and present in the business decisions we make. described below are the primary risks and uncertainties that if realized could have a material and adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows, and our access to liquidity. the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only risks we face.
18
our erm program incorporates risk management throughout our organization to identify, understand, and manage the risks presented by our business activities. our erm program identifies keys major risk categories as: credit risk, compliance risk, operational risk, capital and liquidity risk, market risk, reputation risk, strategic risk, and model risk. these risk factors, and other risks we may face, are discussed in more detail in other sections of this report.
i.  credit risk should the fundamentals of the commercial real estate market deteriorate, our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.
the u.s. economy remains vulnerable, and any reversal in broad macro trends would threaten the recovery in commercial real estate. the improvement of certain economic factors, such as unemployment and real estate asset values and rents, has continued to lag behind the overall economy. these economic factors generally affect certain industries like real estate and financial services more significantly. a significant portion of our clients are active in these industries. furthermore, financial services companies with a substantial lending business, like ours, are dependent upon the ability of their borrowers to make debt service payments on loans.
a portion of our commercial real estate loans are construction loans. typically these properties are not fully leased at loan origination; the borrower may require additional leasing through the life of the loan to provide cash flow to support debt service payments. if we experienced weaknesses similar to those experienced at the height of the economic downturn, then we would experience a slowing in the execution of new leases, which may also lead to existing lease turnover.
we are subject to the risk of defaults by our loan counterparties and clients.
many of our routine transactions expose us to credit risk in the event of default of our counterparty or client. our credit risk may be exacerbated when the collateral held cannot be realized upon or is liquidated at prices insufficient to recover the full amount of the loan or derivative exposure due us. in deciding whether to extend credit or enter into other transactions, we may rely on information furnished by or on behalf of counterparties and clients, including financial statements, credit reports and other information. we may also rely on representations of those counterparties, clients, or other third parties as to the accuracy and completeness of that information. the inaccuracy of that information or those representations affects our ability to accurately evaluate the default risk of a counterparty or client.
various factors may cause our allowance for loan and lease losses to increase.
we maintain an alll (a reserve established through a provision for loan and lease losses charged to expense) that represents our estimate of losses based on our evaluation of risks within our existing portfolio of loans. the level of the allowance reflects our ongoing evaluation of industry concentrations; specific credit risks; loan and lease loss experience; current loan portfolio quality; present economic, political and regulatory conditions; and incurred losses inherent in the current loan portfolio. the determination of the appropriate level of the alll inherently involves a degree of subjectivity and requires that we make significant estimates of current credit risks and future trends, all of which may undergo material changes. changes in economic conditions affecting borrowers, the stagnation of certain economic indicators that we are more susceptible to, such as unemployment and real estate values, new information regarding existing loans, identification of additional problem loans and other factors, both within and outside of our control, may recommend an increase in the alll. bank regulatory agencies periodically review our alll and, based on judgments that can differ somewhat from those of our own management, may recommend an increase in the provision for loan and lease losses or the recognition of further loan charge-offs. in addition, if charge-offs in future periods exceed the alll (i.e., if the loan and lease allowance is inadequate), we will need additional loan and lease loss provisions to increase the alll, which would decrease our net income and capital.
19
declining asset prices could adversely affect us.
during the great recession, the volatility and disruption that the capital and credit markets experienced reached extreme levels. this severe market disruption led to the failure of several substantial financial institutions, causing the widespread liquidation of assets and constraining the credit markets. these asset sales, along with asset sales by other leveraged investors, including some hedge funds, rapidly drove down prices and valuations across a wide variety of traded asset classes. asset price deterioration has a negative effect on the valuation of many of the asset categories represented on our balance sheet, and reduces our ability to sell assets at prices we deem acceptable. a further recession would likely reverse recent positive trends in asset prices.
we have concentrated credit exposure in commercial, financial and agricultural loans.
as of december 31, 2014, approximately 72% of our loan portfolio consisted of commercial, financial and agricultural loans, commercial real estate loans, including commercial mortgage and construction loans, and commercial leases. these types of loans are typically larger than residential real estate loans and consumer loans, and have a different risk profile that includes, among other risks, a borrowers failure to comply with applicable environmental laws and regulations. the deterioration of a larger loan or a group of these loans could cause a significant increase in nonperforming loans, which would result in net loss of earnings from these loans, an increase in the provision for loan and lease losses, and an increase in loan charge-offs.
ii.  compliance risk we are subject to extensive and increasing government regulation and supervision.
as a financial services institution, we are subject to extensive federal and state regulation and supervision, which has increased in recent years due to the implementation of the dodd-frank act and other financial reform initiatives. banking regulations are primarily intended to protect depositors funds, the dif, consumers, taxpayers, and the banking system as a whole, not our debtholders or shareholders. these regulations increase our costs and affect our lending practices, capital structure, investment practices, dividend policy, ability to repurchase our common shares, and growth, among other things.
we face increased regulation of our industry as a result of current and future initiatives intended to provide financial market stability and enhance the liquidity and solvency of financial institutions. we expect continued intense scrutiny from our bank supervisors in the examination process and aggressive enforcement of regulations at the federal and state levels, particularly due to keybanks and keycorps status as covered institutions under the dodd-frank acts heightened prudential standards and regulations. we also face increased regulation from efforts designed to protect consumers from financial abuse. although many parts of the dodd-frank act are now in effect, other parts continue to be implemented. as a result, some uncertainty remains as to the aggregate impact upon key of the dodd-frank act.
changes to existing statutes, regulations or regulatory policies or their interpretation or implementation, and becoming subject to additional heightened regulatory practices, requirements, or expectations, could affect us in substantial and unpredictable ways. these changes may subject us to additional costs and increase our litigation risk should we fail to appropriately comply. such changes may also limit the types of financial services and products we may offer, affect the investments we make, and change the manner in which we operate.
additionally, federal banking law grants substantial enforcement powers to federal banking regulators. this enforcement authority includes, among other things, the ability to assess civil money penalties, to issue cease and desist or removal orders and to initiate injunctive actions against banking organizations and affiliated parties. these enforcement actions may be initiated for violations of laws and regulations, for practices determined to be unsafe or unsound, or for practices or acts that are determined to be unfair, deceptive, or abusive.
for more information, see supervision and regulation in item 1 of this report.
20
changes in accounting policies, standards, and interpretations could materially affect how we report our financial condition and results of operations.
the fasb, regulatory agencies, and other bodies that establish accounting standards periodically change the financial accounting and reporting standards governing the preparation of keys financial statements. additionally, those bodies that establish and interpret the accounting standards (such as the fasb, sec, and banking regulators) may change prior interpretations or positions on how these standards should be applied. these changes can be difficult to predict and can materially affect how key records and reports its financial condition and results of operations. in some cases, key could be required to retroactively apply a new or revised standard, resulting in changes to previously reported financial results.
iii.  operational risk our information systems may experience an interruption or breach in security.
we rely heavily on communications, information systems (both internal and provided by third parties) and the internet to conduct our business. our business is dependent on our ability to process and monitor large numbers of daily transactions in compliance with legal, regulatory and internal standards and specifications. in addition, a significant portion of our operations relies heavily on the secure processing, storage and transmission of personal and confidential information, such as the personal information of our customers and clients. these risks may increase in the future as we continue to increase mobile payments and other internet-based product offerings and expand our internal usage of web-based products and applications.
in the event of a failure, interruption or breach of our information systems, we may be unable to avoid impact to our customers. other u.s. financial service institutions and companies have reported breaches, some severe, in the security of their websites or other systems and several financial institutions, including key, experienced significant distributed denial-of-service attacks, some of which involved sophisticated and targeted attacks intended to disable or degrade service, or sabotage systems. other potential attacks have attempted to obtain unauthorized access to confidential information or destroy data, often through the introduction of computer viruses or malware, phishing, cyberattacks, and other means. to date, none of these efforts has had a material adverse effect on our business or operations. such security attacks can originate from a wide variety of sources, including persons who are involved with organized crime or who may be linked to terrorist organizations or hostile foreign governments. those same parties may also attempt to fraudulently induce employees, customers or other users of our systems to disclose sensitive information in order to gain access to our data or that of our customers or clients. our security systems may not be able to protect our information systems from similar attacks due to the rapid evolution and creation of sophisticated cyberattacks. we are also subject to the risk that our employees may intercept and transmit unauthorized confidential or proprietary information. an interception, misuse or mishandling of personal, confidential or proprietary information being sent to or received from a customer or third party could result in legal liability, remediation costs, regulatory action, and reputational harm.
we rely on third parties to perform significant operational services for us.
third parties perform significant operational services on our behalf. these third-party vendors are subject to similar risks as key relating to cybersecurity, breakdowns or failures of their own systems or employees. one or more of our vendors may experience a cybersecurity event or operational disruption and, if any such event does occur, it may not be adequately addressed, either operationally or financially, by the third-party vendor. certain of our vendors may have limited indemnification obligations or may not have the financial capacity to satisfy their indemnification obligations. financial or operational difficulties of a vendor could also impair our operations if those difficulties interfere with the vendors ability to serve us. additionally, some of our outsourcing arrangements are located overseas and, therefore, are subject to risks unique to the regions in which they operate. if a critical vendor is unable to meet our needs in a timely manner or if the services or products provided by such a vendor are terminated or otherwise delayed and if we are not able to develop alternative sources for these services and products quickly and cost-effectively, it could have a material adverse effect on
21
our business. additionally, regulatory guidance adopted by federal banking regulators in 2013 related to how banks select, engage and manage their outside vendors may affect the circumstances and conditions under which we work with third parties and the cost of managing such relationships.
we are subject to claims and litigation.
from time to time, customers, vendors or other parties may make claims and take legal action against us. we maintain reserves for certain claims when deemed appropriate based upon our assessment that a loss is probable, consistent with applicable accounting guidance. at any given time we have a variety of legal actions asserted against us in various stages of litigation. resolution of a legal action can often take years. whether any particular claims and legal actions are founded or unfounded, if such claims and legal actions are not resolved in our favor, they may result in significant financial liability and adversely affect how the market perceives us and our products and services as well as impact customer demand for those products and services.
we are also involved, from time to time, in other reviews, investigations and proceedings (both formal and informal) by governmental and self-regulatory agencies regarding our business, including, among other things, accounting and operational matters, certain of which may result in adverse judgments, settlements, fines, penalties, injunctions or other relief. the number and risk of these investigations and proceedings has increased in recent years with regard to many firms in the financial services industry due to legal changes to the consumer protection laws provided for by the dodd-frank act and the creation of the cfpb.
there have also been a number of highly publicized legal claims against financial institutions involving fraud or misconduct by employees, and we run the risk that employee misconduct could occur. it is not always possible to deter or prevent employee misconduct, and the precautions we take to prevent and detect this activity may not be effective in all cases.
we are subject to operational risk.
we are subject to operational risk, which represents the risk of loss resulting from human error, inadequate or failed internal processes and systems, and external events. operational risk includes the risk of fraud by employees, clerical and record-keeping errors, nonperformance by vendors, threats to cybersecurity, and computer/telecommunications malfunctions. operational risk also encompasses compliance and legal risk, which is the risk of loss from violations of, or noncompliance with, laws, rules, regulations, prescribed practices or ethical standards, as well as the risk of our noncompliance with contractual and other obligations. we are also exposed to operational risk through our outsourcing arrangements, and the effect that changes in circumstances or capabilities of our outsourcing vendors can have on our ability to continue to perform operational functions necessary to our business, such as certain loan processing functions. for example, breakdowns or failures of our vendors systems or employees could be a source of operational risk to us. resulting losses from operational risk could take the form of explicit charges, increased operational costs, harm to our reputation, inability to secure insurance, litigation, regulatory intervention or sanctions or foregone business opportunities.
our controls and procedures may fail or be circumvented, and our methods of reducing risk exposure may not be effective.
we regularly review and update our internal controls, disclosure controls and procedures, and corporate governance policies and procedures. we also maintain an erm program designed to identify, measure, monitor, report and analyze our risks. any system of controls and any system to reduce risk exposure, however well designed and operated, is based in part on certain assumptions and can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurances that the objectives of the system are met. additionally, instruments, systems and strategies used to hedge or otherwise manage exposure to various types of market compliance, credit, liquidity, operational and business risks and enterprise-wide risk could be less effective than anticipated. as a result, we may not be able to effectively mitigate our risk exposures in particular market environments or against particular types of risk.
22
severe weather, natural disasters, acts of war or terrorism and other external events could significantly impact our business.
natural disasters, including severe weather events of increasing strength and frequency, acts of war or terrorism and other adverse external events could have a significant impact on our ability to conduct business or upon our customers. such events could affect the stability of our deposit base, impair the ability of borrowers to repay outstanding loans, impair the value of collateral securing loans, cause significant property damage, result in lost revenue or cause us to incur additional expenses.
iv.  capital and liquidity risk capital and liquidity requirements imposed by the dodd-frank act require banks and bhcs to maintain more and higher quality capital and higher quality, lower-yielding liquid assets than has historically been the case.
new and evolving capital standards resulting from the dodd-frank act and the regulatory capital rules adopted by our regulators will have a significant impact on banks and bhcs, including key. for a detailed explanation of the new capital and liquidity rules that became effective for us on a phased-in basis on january 1, 2015, see the section titled regulatory capital and liquidity under the heading supervision and regulation in item 1 of this report.
the federal reserves new capital standards will require key to maintain more and higher quality capital and could limit our business activities (including lending) and our ability to expand organically or through acquisitions. they could also result in our taking steps to increase our capital that may be dilutive to shareholders or limit our ability to pay dividends or otherwise return capital to shareholders.
in addition, the new liquidity standards will require us to increase our holdings of higher-quality, lower-yielding liquid assets, may require us to change our mix of investment alternatives, and may impact business relationships with certain customers. they could reduce our ability to invest in longer-term assets even if more desirable from a balance sheet management perspective.
in addition, the federal reserve requires bank holding companies to obtain approval before making a capital distribution, such as paying or increasing dividends, implementing common stock repurchase programs, or redeeming or repurchasing capital instruments. the federal reserve has detailed the processes that bank holding companies should maintain to ensure they hold adequate capital under severely adverse conditions and have ready access to funding before engaging in any capital activities. these rules could limit keys ability to make distributions, including paying out dividends or buying back shares. for more information, see supervision and regulation in item 1 of this report.
federal agencies may take actions that disrupt the stability of the u.s. financial system.
since 2008, the federal government has taken unprecedented steps to provide stability to and confidence in the financial markets. for example, the federal reserve maintains a variety of stimulus policy measures designed to maintain a low interest rate environment. in light of recent moderate improvements in the u.s. economy, federal agencies may no longer support such initiatives. the discontinuation of such initiatives may have a negative impact, perhaps severe, on the financial markets. these effects could include a sudden move to higher debt yields, which could have a chilling effect on borrowing. in addition, new initiatives or legislation may not be implemented, or, if implemented, may not be adequate to counter any negative effects of discontinuing programs or, in the event of an economic downturn, to support and stabilize a troubled economy.
we rely on dividends by our subsidiaries for most of our funds.
we are a legal entity separate and distinct from our subsidiaries. with the exception of cash that we may raise from debt and equity issuances, we receive substantially all of our cash flow from dividends by our subsidiaries. dividends by our subsidiaries are the principal source of funds for the dividends we pay on our equity securities
23
and interest and principal payments on our debt. federal banking law and regulations limit the amount of dividends that keybank (keycorps largest subsidiary) can pay. for further information on the regulatory restrictions on the payment of dividends by keybank, see supervision and regulation in item 1 of this report.
in the event keybank is unable to pay dividends to us, we may not be able to service debt, pay obligations or pay dividends on our equity securities. in addition, our right to participate in a distribution of assets upon a subsidiarys liquidation or reorganization is subject to the prior claims of the subsidiarys creditors.
we are subject to liquidity risk, which could negatively affect our funding levels.
market conditions or other events could negatively affect the level of or cost of funding, affecting our ongoing ability to accommodate liability maturities and deposit withdrawals, meet contractual obligations, or fund asset growth and new business initiatives at a reasonable cost, in a timely manner and without adverse consequences.
although we have implemented strategies to maintain sufficient and diverse sources of funding to accommodate planned as well as unanticipated changes in assets, liabilities, and off-balance sheet commitments under various economic conditions (including by reducing our reliance on wholesale funding sources), a substantial, unexpected or prolonged change in the level or cost of liquidity could have a material adverse effect on us. if the cost effectiveness or the availability of supply in these credit markets is reduced for a prolonged period of time, our funding needs may require us to access funding and manage liquidity by other means. these alternatives may include generating client deposits, securitizing or selling loans, extending the maturity of wholesale borrowings, borrowing under certain secured wholesale facilities, using relationships developed with a variety of fixed income investors, and further managing loan growth and investment opportunities. these alternative means of funding may not be available under stressed conditions.
our credit ratings affect our liquidity position.
the rating agencies regularly evaluate the securities of keycorp and keybank, and their ratings of our long-term debt and other securities are based on a number of factors, including our financial strength, ability to generate earnings, and other factors. some of these factors are not entirely within our control, such as conditions affecting the financial services industry and the economy and changes in rating methodologies as a result of the dodd-frank act. we may not be able to maintain our current credit ratings. a downgrade of the securities of keycorp or keybank could adversely affect our access to liquidity and could significantly increase our cost of funds, trigger additional collateral or funding requirements, and decrease the number of investors and counterparties willing to lend to us, reducing our ability to generate income.
v.  market risk a reversal of the u.s. economic recovery and a return to volatile or recessionary conditions in the u.s. or abroad could negatively affect our business or our access to capital markets.
a worsening of economic and market conditions, downside shocks, or a return to recessionary economic conditions could result in adverse effects on key and others in the financial services industry. additionally, the prolonged low-interest rate environment, despite a generally improving economy, has presented a challenge for key and affected our business and financial performance. the low-interest rate environment may persist for some time even as the economy continues to improve, and may continue to have a negative impact on our performance.
in particular, we could face some of the following risks, and other unforeseeable risks, in connection with a downturn in the economic and market environment or in the face of downside shocks or a recession, whether in the united states or internationally:
¿   a loss of confidence in the financial services industry and the equity markets by investors, placing pressure on the price of keys common shares or decreasing the credit or liquidity available to key;

24
¿   a decrease in consumer and business confidence levels generally, decreasing credit usage and investment or increasing delinquencies and defaults;

¿   a decrease in household or corporate incomes, reducing demand for keys products and services;

¿   a decrease in the value of collateral securing loans to keys borrowers or a decrease in the quality of keys loan portfolio, increasing loan charge-offs and reducing keys net income;

¿   a decrease in our ability to liquidate positions at market prices;

¿   the extended continuation of the current low-interest rate environment, continuing or increasing downward pressure to our net interest income;

¿   a decrease in the accuracy and viability of our quantitative models;

¿   an increase in competition and consolidation in the financial services industry;

¿   increased concern over and scrutiny of the capital and liquidity levels of financial institutions generally, and those of our transaction counterparties specifically;

¿   a decrease in confidence in the creditworthiness of the united states or other governments whose securities we hold; and

¿   an increase in limitations on or the regulation of financial services companies like key.

we are subject to interest rate risk, which could adversely affect net interest income.
our earnings are largely dependent upon our net interest income. net interest income is the difference between interest income earned on interest-earning assets such as loans and securities and interest expense paid on interest-bearing liabilities such as deposits and borrowed funds. interest rates are highly sensitive to many factors that are beyond our control, including general economic conditions, the competitive environment within our markets, consumer preferences for specific loan and deposit products and policies of various governmental and regulatory agencies, in particular, the federal reserve. changes in monetary policy, including changes in interest rate controls being applied by the federal reserve, could influence the amount of interest we receive on loans and securities, the amount of interest we pay on deposits and borrowings, our ability to originate loans and obtain deposits, and the fair value of our financial assets and liabilities. if the interest we pay on deposits and other borrowings increases at a faster rate than the interest we receive on loans and other investments, net interest income, and therefore our earnings, would be adversely affected. conversely, earnings could also be adversely affected if the interest we receive on loans and other investments falls more quickly than the interest we pay on deposits and other borrowings.
our methods for simulating and analyzing our interest rate exposure are discussed more fully under the heading risk management  management of interest risk exposure found in item 7. managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation.
our profitability depends upon economic conditions in the geographic regions where we have significant operations and on certain market segments with which we conduct significant business.
we have concentrations of loans and other business activities in geographic regions where our bank branches are located  pacific; rocky mountains; indiana; west ohio/michigan; east ohio; western new york; eastern new york; and new england  and potential exposure to geographic regions outside of our branch footprint. the moderate u.s. economic recovery has been experienced unevenly in the various regions where we operate, and continued improvement in the overall u.s. economy may not result in similar improvement, or any improvement at all, in the economy of any particular geographic region. adverse conditions in a geographic region such as inflation, unemployment, recession, natural disasters, or other factors beyond our control could impact the ability of borrowers in these regions to repay their loans, decrease the value of collateral securing loans made in these regions, or affect the ability of our customers in these regions to continue conducting business with us.
25
additionally, a significant portion of our business activities are concentrated with the real estate, health care and utilities market segments. the profitability of some of these market segments depends upon the health of the overall economy, seasonality, the impact of regulation, and other factors that are beyond our control and may be beyond the control of our customers in these market segments.
an economic downturn in one or more geographic regions where we conduct our business, or any significant or prolonged impact on the profitability of one or more of the market segments with which we conduct significant business activity, could adversely affect the demand for our products and services, the ability of our customers to repay loans, the value of the collateral securing loans, and the stability of our deposit funding sources.
the soundness of other financial institutions could adversely affect us.
our ability to engage in routine funding transactions could be adversely affected by the actions and commercial soundness of other financial institutions. we have exposure to many different industries and counterparties in the financial services industries, and we routinely execute transactions with such counterparties, including brokers and dealers, commercial banks, investment banks, mutual and hedge funds, and other institutional clients. financial services institutions are interrelated as a result of trading, clearing, counterparty or other relationships. defaults by one or more financial services institutions have led to, and may cause, market-wide liquidity problems and losses. many of our transactions with other financial institutions expose us to credit risk in the event of default of a counterparty or client. in addition, our credit risk may be affected when the collateral held by us cannot be realized or is liquidated at prices not sufficient to recover the full amount of the loan or derivatives exposure due us.
vi.  reputation risk damage to our reputation could significantly harm our businesses.
our ability to attract and retain customers, clients, investors, and highly-skilled management and employees is affected by our reputation. public perception of the financial services industry has declined as a result of the great recession. we face increased public and regulatory scrutiny resulting from the financial crisis and economic downturn. significant harm to our reputation can also arise from other sources, including employee misconduct, actual or perceived unethical behavior, litigation or regulatory outcomes, failing to deliver minimum or required standards of service and quality, compliance failures, disclosure of confidential information, significant or numerous failures, interruptions or breaches of our information systems, and the activities of our clients, customers and counterparties, including vendors. actions by the financial services industry generally or by certain members or individuals in the industry may have a significant adverse effect on our reputation. we could also suffer significant reputational harm if we fail to properly identify and manage potential conflicts of interest. management of potential conflicts of interests has become increasingly complex as we expand our business activities through more numerous transactions, obligations and interests with and among our clients. the actual or perceived failure to adequately address conflicts of interest could affect the willingness of clients to deal with us, which could adversely affect our businesses.
vii.   strategic risk we may not realize the expected benefits of our strategic initiatives.
our ability to compete depends on a number of factors, including among others, our ability to develop and successfully execute our strategic plans and initiatives. our strategic priorities include growing profitably and maintaining financial strength; effectively managing risk and reward; engaging a high-performing, talented, and diverse workforce; and embracing the changes required by our clients and the marketplace. acquiring and expanding customer relationships, including by cross-selling additional or new products to them, is also very important to our business model and our ability to grow revenue and earnings. our inability to execute on or achieve the anticipated outcomes of our strategic priorities may affect how the market perceives us and could impede our growth and profitability.
26
we operate in a highly competitive industry.
we face substantial competition in all areas of our operations from a variety of competitors, some of which are larger and may have more financial resources than us. our competitors primarily include national and super-regional banks as well as smaller community banks within the various geographic regions in which we operate. we also face competition from many other types of financial institutions, including, without limitation, savings associations, credit unions, mortgage banking companies, finance companies, mutual funds, insurance companies, investment management firms, investment banking firms, broker-dealers and other local, regional, national, and global financial services firms. in addition, technology has lowered barriers to entry and made it possible for nonbanks to offer products and services traditionally provided by banks. mergers and acquisitions have led to increased concentration in the banking industry, placing added competitive pressure on keys core banking products and services. we expect the competitive landscape of the financial services industry to become even more intensified as a result of legislative, regulatory, structural and technological changes.
our ability to compete successfully depends on a number of factors, including: our ability to develop and execute strategic plans and initiatives; our ability to develop, maintain and build long-term customer relationships based on quality service and competitive prices; our ability to develop competitive products and technologies demanded by our customers, maintaining our high ethical standards and safe and sound assets; and industry and general economic trends. increased competition in the financial services industry, and our failure to perform in any of these areas, could significantly weaken our competitive position, which could adversely affect our growth and profitability.
maintaining or increasing our market share depends upon our ability to adapt our products and services to evolving industry standards and consumer preferences, while maintaining competitive prices.
the continuous, widespread adoption of new technologies, including internet services and mobile devices (including smartphones and tablets), requires us to evaluate our product and service offerings to ensure they remain competitive. our success depends, in part, on our ability to adapt our products and services, as well as our distribution of them, to evolving industry standards and consumer preferences. new technologies have altered consumer behavior by allowing consumers to complete transactions such as paying bills or transferring funds directly without the assistance of banks. new products allow consumers to maintain funds in brokerage accounts or mutual funds that would have historically been held as bank deposits. the process of eliminating banks as intermediaries, known as disintermediation, could result in the loss of fee income, as well as the loss of customer deposits and related income generated from those deposits.
the increasing pressure from our competitors, both bank and nonbank, to keep pace and adopt new technologies and products and services requires us to incur substantial expense. we may be unsuccessful in developing or introducing new products and services, modifying our existing products and services, adapting to changing consumer preferences and spending and saving habits, achieving market acceptance or regulatory approval, sufficiently developing or maintaining a loyal customer base or offering products and services at prices lower than the prices offered by our competitors. these risks may affect our ability to achieve growth in our market share and could reduce both our revenue streams from certain products and services and our revenues from our net interest income.
we may not be able to attract and retain skilled people.
our success depends, in large part, on our ability to attract, retain, motivate, and develop key people. competition for the best people in most of our business activities is ongoing and can be intense, and we may not be able to retain or hire the people we want or need to serve our customers. to attract and retain qualified employees, we must compensate these employees at market levels. typically, those levels have caused employee compensation to be our greatest expense.
27
various restrictions on compensation of certain executive officers were imposed under the dodd-frank act and other legislation and regulations. in addition, our incentive compensation structure is subject to review by the federal reserve, who may identify deficiencies in the structure, causing us to make changes that may affect our ability to offer competitive compensation to these individuals. our ability to attract and retain talented employees may be affected by these developments, or any new executive compensation limits and regulations.
potential acquisitions or strategic partnerships may disrupt our business and dilute shareholder value.
acquiring other banks, bank branches, or other businesses involves various risks commonly associated with acquisitions or partnerships, including exposure to unknown or contingent liabilities of the target company; diversion of our managements time and attention; significant integration risk with respect to employees, accounting systems, and technology platforms; our inability to realize anticipated revenue and cost benefits and synergies; increased regulatory scrutiny; and, the possible loss of key employees and customers of the target company. we regularly evaluate merger and acquisition and strategic partnership opportunities and conduct due diligence activities related to possible transactions. as a result, mergers or acquisitions involving cash, debt or equity securities may occur at any time. acquisitions may involve the payment of a premium over book and market values. therefore, some dilution of our tangible book value and net income per common share could occur in connection with any future transaction. additionally, if an acquisition or strategic partnership were to occur, we may fail to realize the expected revenue increases, cost savings, increases in geographic or product presence, or other projected benefits.
viii.  model risk we rely on quantitative models to manage certain accounting, risk management and capital planning functions.
we use quantitative models to help manage certain aspects of our business and to assist with certain business decisions, including estimating probable loan losses, measuring the fair value of financial instruments when reliable market prices are unavailable, estimating the effects of changing interest rates and other market measures on our financial condition and results of operations, managing risk, and for capital planning purposes (including during the ccar capital planning process). our modeling methodologies rely on many assumptions, historical analyses and correlations. these assumptions may be incorrect, particularly in times of market distress, and the historical correlations on which we rely may no longer be relevant. additionally, as businesses and markets evolve, our measurements may not accurately reflect this evolution. even if the underlying assumptions and historical correlations used in our models are adequate, our models may be deficient due to errors in computer code, bad data, misuse of data, or the use of a model for a purpose outside the scope of the models design.
as a result, our models may not capture or fully express the risks we face, may suggest that we have sufficient capitalization when we do not, or may lead us to misjudge the business and economic environment in which we will operate. if our models fail to produce reliable results on an ongoing basis, we may not make appropriate risk management, capital planning, or other business or financial decisions. furthermore, strategies that we employ to manage and govern the risks associated with our use of models may not be effective or fully reliable, and as a result, we may realize losses or other lapses.
banking regulators continue to focus on the models used by banks and bank holding companies in their businesses. the failure or inadequacy of a model may result in increased regulatory scrutiny on us or may result in an enforcement action or proceeding against us by one of our regulators.

throughout the notes to consolidated financial statements and managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations, we use certain acronyms and abbreviations. these terms are defined in note 1 (summary of significant accounting policies), which begins on page 114.

introduction this section reviews the financial condition and results of operations of keycorp and its subsidiaries for each of the past three years. some tables include additional periods to comply with disclosure requirements or to illustrate trends in greater depth. when you read this discussion, you should also refer to the consolidated financial statements and related notes in this report. the page locations of specific sections that we refer to are presented in the table of contents.
terminology throughout this discussion, references to key, we, our, us, and similar terms refer to the consolidated entity consisting of keycorp and its subsidiaries. keycorp refers solely to the parent holding company, and keybank refers solely to keycorps subsidiary bank, keybank national association. keybank (consolidated) refers to the consolidated entity consisting of keybank and its subsidiaries.
we want to explain some industry-specific terms at the outset so you can better understand the discussion that follows.
¿     we use the phrase continuing operations in this document to mean all of our businesses other than the education lending business, victory, and austin. the education lending business and austin have been accounted for as discontinued operations since 2009. victory was classified as a discontinued operation in our first quarter 2013 financial reporting as a result of the sale of this business as announced on february 21, 2013, and closed on july 31, 2013.

¿   our exit loan portfolios are separate from our discontinued operations. these portfolios, which are in a run-off mode, stem from product lines we decided to cease because they no longer fit with our corporate strategy. these exit loan portfolios are included in other segments.

¿                       we engage in capital markets activities primarily through business conducted by our key corporate bank segment. these activities encompass a variety of products and services. among other things, we trade securities as a dealer, enter into derivative contracts (both to accommodate clients financing needs and to mitigate certain risks), and conduct transactions in foreign currencies (both to accommodate clients needs and to benefit from fluctuations in exchange rates).

¿                      for regulatory purposes, capital is divided into two classes. federal regulations currently prescribe that at least one-half of a bank or bhcs total risk-based capital must qualify as tier 1
capital. both total and tier 1 capital serve as bases for several measures of capital adequacy, which is an important indicator of financial stability and condition. as described under the heading regulatory capital and liquidity
 capital planning and stress testing in the section entitled supervision and regulation in item 1 of this report, the regulators are required to conduct a supervisory capital assessment of all bhcs with assets of at least $50 billion, including keycorp. as part of this capital adequacy review, banking regulators evaluate a component of tier 1 capital, known as tier 1 common equity. the section entitled capital  capital adequacy
in this md&amp;a provides more information on total capital, tier 1 capital, and tier 1 common equity and describes how the three measures are calculated.

additionally, a comprehensive list of the acronyms and abbreviations used throughout this discussion is included in note 1 (summary of significant accounting policies).

economic overview the economy continued its modest recovery in 2014, with overall gdp starting slowly and accelerating as the year progressed, resulting in 2.4% growth. the year began with gdp contracting 2.1% in the first quarter, due to extreme weather halting consumer spending and investment. in the second quarter, growth of 4.6% more than reversed the first quarters decline. pent-up consumer demand was the largest contributor to the growth, as the impact of extreme weather conditions in the first quarter faded. in the third quarter, growth accelerated as consumers spent money saved at the gas pump. oil prices dropped 46% over the last half of the year, giving consumers a boost in discretionary income. the fourth quarter saw growth slow to 2.6% as consumer spending continued to be a bright spot. the stock market continued its climb in 2014, with the s&p 500 equity index increasing 11%, compared to a 30% increase in 2013. globally, the economic recovery slowed; central banks in developed nations maintained easy money policies. in europe, the recovery stalled and the risk of deflation rose, leading the european central bank to consider further action. emerging markets struggled as well  demand decreased, exports dropped, and china grew at its slowest rate in 24 years.
for 2014, 2.95 million new jobs were added in the u.s. the unemployment rate fell further, from 6.97% at december 31, 2013, to 5.70% at december 31, 2014. while job growth was a factor, the majority of the improvement was driven by a decrease in the labor force participation rate, which declined to its lowest level in over 35 years. wage growth deteriorated through much of the year and income growth was weak, indicative of slack in the labor market. however, consumer spending held up reasonably well, resulting in a falling savings rate. a slowing rate of inflation supported real incomes, and therefore spending, throughout the year. by december 2014, headline inflation was down to .8%, compared to 1.5% one year ago, mainly due to the decline in fuel prices. core inflation also remained low throughout the year, ending 2014 at 1.6%, down from 1.7% in 2013.
as the economy expanded further and job growth accelerated, the housing market gained traction, with slight improvement across nearly all metrics in 2014. slow household formation continues to be a factor, however, and sales growth remains relatively modest. existing home sales finished 2014 at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 5.04 million, up slightly from december 2013. new home sales ended the year on a solid note, reaching a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 481,000 in december 2014, up 8.8% from 2013. the pace of price appreciation slowed, with the median price for existing homes up 5.5% year-over-year in november 2014, compared to 9.9% in 2013. housing starts accelerated further, up 9% over 2013, driven primarily by substantial gains in both single and multi-family construction.
the federal reserve remained active and accommodative in 2014, keeping the federal funds target rate near zero, expanding its balance sheet further, and making significant changes to its communications. janet yellen replaced ben bernanke as the federal reserve chairman in february 2014. the federal reserve started tapering the pace of asset purchases by $10 billion, from $85 billion per month to $75 billion per month, in january and concluded purchasing securities in october. however, the federal open market committee (fomc) decided to maintain the existing policy of reinvesting principal payments to help accommodate financial conditions. in addition, the federal reserve kept its forward guidance unchanged in december, explicitly stating that the federal funds rate will be kept near zero for a considerable time. low inflation remains a concern; the fmoc acknowledged lower energy prices were a factor in holding inflation under their longer-run objective of 2.0%. the 10-year u.s. treasury yield began the year at 3.0%, and was range-bound from 2.7% to 2.9% for the first quarter of the year, driven by disappointing weather-related economic data. around the years halfway point, with rising concerns over global growth, the 10-year u.s. treasury yield began to decrease, approaching 2.0% by the end of the year as the stock market continued to rally.

corporate strategy we remain committed to enhancing long-term shareholder value by continuing to execute our relationship business model, growing our franchise, and being disciplined in our management of capital. our 2014/2015 strategic focus is to add new clients and to expand our relationships with existing clients. we intend to pursue this strategy by continuing to control and reduce expenses; being more productive from the front office to the back office; effectively balancing risk and rewards within our moderate risk profile; and engaging, retaining and inspiring our diverse and high performing workforce. our strategic priorities for enhancing long-term shareholder value are described below.
¿                         grow profitably  we will continue to focus on growing revenue and creating a more efficient operating environment. we expect our relationship business model to keep generating organic growth as it helps us expand engagement with existing clients and attract new customers. we will leverage our continuous improvement culture to create a more efficient cost structure that is aligned, sustainable, and consistent with the current operating environment and supports our relationship business model.

¿   acquire and expand targeted relationships  we have taken purposeful steps to enhance our ability to acquire and expand targeted relationships. our local delivery of a broad product set and industry expertise allows us to match client needs and market conditions to deliver the best solutions.

¿   effectively manage risk and rewards  our risk management activities are focused on ensuring we properly identify, measure, and manage risks across the entire company to maintain safety and soundness and maximize profitability.

36
¿   maintain financial strength  with the foundation of a strong balance sheet, we will remain focused on sustaining strong reserves, liquidity and capital. we will work closely with our board of directors and regulators to manage capital to support our clients needs and create shareholder value. our capital remains a competitive advantage for us.

¿   engage a high performing, talented and diverse workforce  every day our employees provide our clients with great ideas, extraordinary service and smart solutions. we will continue to engage our high performing, talented and diverse workforce to create an environment where they can make a difference, own their careers, be respected and feel a sense of pride.

strategic developments we initiated the following actions during 2014 to support our corporate strategy:
¿                  we continued to take actions to drive growth and efficiency. these actions included leadership changes to leverage our alignment, accelerate momentum, and drive growth. we also focused on growing our commercial payments business and maximizing the return from our recent investments, which included the launch of purchase and prepaid cards in the first quarter of 2014. in addition to these new payment products, we continued to invest in, and build out, our online and mobile capabilities. during the first quarter of 2014, we expanded our online account-opening tools to include more products and services. during the second quarter of 2014, we introduced the new keybank hassle-free account for banking customers who want straightforward ways to make deposits, track money, obtain cash, and make payments without worrying about potential overdraft fees or other unexpected fees. in addition, as part of our actions to drive efficiency, we closed 34 branches and reduced headcount in our fixed income trading business during 2014.

¿                    we also made progress on other strategic initiatives, including improving sales productivity and strengthening our business mix through targeted investments and exiting businesses that are not a strategic fit. key community bank strengthened its sales management process and saw a lift in sales productivity. key corporate bank continued to see growth in new and expanded client relationships. in the first quarter of 2014, we announced that we would be exiting our international leasing operation, which had limited scale and connectivity to our other businesses. this decision was consistent with our commitment to allocate our capital to businesses that fit our strategy and generate appropriate risk-adjusted returns. late in the third quarter of 2014, we closed the acquisition of pacific crest securities, a leading technology-focused investment bank and capital markets firm. this acquisition underscores our commitment to creating the leading corporate and investment bank serving middle market companies. the transaction brings together two firms with a shared vision of enhancing their differentiation in the market by capitalizing on the convergence of technology across traditional industry verticals.

¿   our strong risk management practices and a more favorable credit environment resulted in another year of positive credit quality trends. for 2014, net loan charge-offs were .20% of average loans, well below our targeted range, and nonperforming assets decreased 17.9% from the year-ago period.

¿               capital management remained a priority. during 2014, we completed $355 million of common share repurchases under our 2014 capital plan authorization. in addition, we completed $141 million of common share repurchases in the first quarter of 2014 under our 2013 capital plan for a total of $496 million of open market common share repurchases during 2014. common share repurchases under the 2014 capital plan are expected to be executed through the first quarter of
2015.

¿                      the board declared a quarterly dividend of $.055 per common share for the first quarter of 2014. our 2014 capital plan proposed an 18% increase in our quarterly common share dividend to $.065 per share, which was approved by our board in may 2014. consistent with the 2014 capital plan, we made a dividend payment of $.065 per share on our common shares during each of the second, third, and fourth quarters of 2014, which brought our annual dividend to $.25 per common share for 2014.

¿   at december 31, 2014, our capital ratios remained strong with a tier 1 common equity ratio of 11.17%, our loan loss reserves were adequate at
1.38% to period-end loans, and we were core funded with a loan-to-

37
deposit ratio of 85%. we believe our strong capital position provides us with the flexibility to support our clients and our business needs, and to evaluate other appropriate capital deployment opportunities.

highlights of our 2014 performance financial performance for 2014, we announced net income from continuing operations attributable to key common shareholders of $917 million, or $1.04 per common share. these results compare to net income from continuing operations attributable to key common shareholders of $847 million, or $.93 per common share, for 2013.

(b)   eps may not foot due to rounding.

our 2014 full-year results reflect success in executing our strategy by generating positive operating leverage and maintaining strong risk management and disciplined capital management. we continued to invest in our businesses to accelerate growth. during the third quarter of 2014, we acquired pacific crest securities, a leading technology-focused investment bank and capital markets firm. we added bankers across our franchise, expanded our payment capabilities, and enhanced technology in areas such as mobile, online, and cyber security. in addition, as part of our actions to drive efficiency, we closed 34 branches and exited nonstrategic assets that were not consistent with our relationship strategy, such as international leasing. we remain committed to generating positive operating leverage and delivering on our long-term goal of achieving a cash efficiency ratio below 60%.
our taxable-equivalent net interest income for 2014 was $2.3 billion, and the net interest margin was 2.97%. these results compare to taxable-equivalent net interest income of $2.3 billion and a net interest margin of 3.12% for the prior year. the decreases in net interest income, which declined $31 million, and the net interest margin were attributable to lower earning asset yields. these decreases were partially offset by loan growth, the maturity of higher-rate certificates of deposit, and a more favorable mix of lower-cost deposits. in 2015, we expect net interest income and net interest margin to benefit from anticipated higher rates, with net interest income growth in the low- to mid-single-digit percentage range compared to 2014 and net interest margin to be stable to slightly higher later in 2015.
38
our noninterest income was $1.8 billion, up $31 million, or 1.8%, from 2013. investment banking and debt placement fees benefited from our business model and had a record high year, increasing $64 million from 2013. net gains (losses) from principal investing were $26 million higher than prior year, and trust and investment services income increased $10 million. these increases were partially offset by declines of $21 million in operating lease income and other leasing, $20 million in service charges on deposits accounts, $12 million in mortgage servicing fees, and $9 million in consumer mortgage income. other income also decreased $15 million. in 2015, we expect mid-single-digit growth compared to 2014, including the full-year impact of the recently-acquired pacific crest securities.
our noninterest expense was $2.8 billion, a decrease of $61 million, or 2.2%, from 2013. we recognized $80 million of efficiency- and pension-related charges in 2014 compared to $117 million in 2013. personnel expense declined $18 million, driven by lower net technology contract labor, severance, and employee benefits, partially offset by higher incentive compensation and stock-based compensation. nonpersonnel expense decreased $43 million, primarily due to declines in net occupancy costs of $14 million, provision (credit) for losses on lending-related commitments of $10 million, and equipment expense of $8 million. in 2015, we expect noninterest expense to be relatively stable with 2014.
average loans totaled $55.7 billion for 2014, compared to $53.1 billion in 2013. commercial, financial and agricultural loan growth of $2.7 billion from the prior year was broad-based across our commercial lines of business. consumer loans remained relatively stable, as modest increases across our core consumer loan portfolio, primarily home equity loans and direct term loans, were mostly offset by run-off in our designated consumer exit portfolio. for 2015, we anticipate average loans growth in the mid-single-digit range, benefiting from the strength in our commercial businesses.
average deposits, excluding deposits in foreign office, totaled $67.3 billion for 2014, an increase of $1.9 billion compared to 2013. demand deposits and now and money market deposit accounts each increased $1.4 billion, mostly due to growth related to commercial client inflows as well as increases related to the commercial mortgage servicing business. these increases were partially offset by run-off in certificates of deposit. our consolidated loan to deposit ratio was 84.6% at december 31, 2014, compared to 83.8% at december 31, 2013.
our asset quality statistics continued to improve during 2014. the provision for loan and lease losses was $59 million for 2014 compared to $130 million for 2013. net loan charge-offs declined to $113 million, or .20%, of average loan balances for 2014, compared to $168 million, or .32%, for 2013. in addition, our nonperforming loans declined to $418 million, or .73%, of period-end loans at december 31, 2014, compared to $508 million, or ..93%, at december 31, 2013. our alll was $794 million, or 1.38%, of period-end loans, compared to $848 million, or 1.56%, at december 31, 2013, and represented 190% and 166.9% coverage of nonperforming loans at december 31, 2014, and december 31, 2013, respectively. in 2015, we expect net loan charge-offs to average loans to remain below our long-term targeted range of 40 to 60 basis points and the provision for loan and lease losses to approximate net loan charge-offs.
our tangible common equity ratio and tier 1 common ratio both remain strong at december 31, 2014, at 9.88% and 11.17% respectively, compared to 9.80% and 11.22%, respectively, at december 31, 2013. we have identified four primary uses of capital:
1.    investing in our businesses, supporting our clients, and loan growth;

2.    maintaining or increasing our common share dividend;

3.    returning capital in the form of common share repurchases to our shareholders; and

4.    remaining disciplined and opportunistic about how we invest in our franchise to include selective acquisitions over time.

our capital management remains focused on creating value. during 2014, we announced an 18% increase in the common share dividend and repurchased $496 million of common shares, resulting in a peer-leading shareholder payout of approximately 82% of our 2014 net income.

the federal reserve is currently reviewing of our 2015 capital plan under the ccar process. until such time as it has completed its review and has no objection to our plan, we are not permitted to implement our capital plan for periods after the first quarter of 2015. should we receive an objection to our plan, it would likely delay any actions on capital management until later in the calendar year. for more information about the ccar process, see capital planning and stress testing under supervision and regulation in item 1 of this report.
figure 4 presents certain non-gaap financial measures related to tangible common equity, return on tangible common equity, tier 1 common equity, pre-provision net revenue, cash efficiency ratio, and common equity tier 1 under the regulatory capital rules (estimates).
the tangible common equity ratio and the return on tangible common equity ratio have been a focus for some investors, and management believes these ratios may assist investors in analyzing keys capital position without regard to the effects of intangible assets and preferred stock. tier 1 common equity, a non-gaap financial measure, is a component of tier 1 risk-based capital. tier 1 common equity is neither formally defined by gaap nor prescribed in amount by federal banking regulations applicable to us before january 1, 2015. however, since analysts and banking regulators may assess our capital adequacy using tangible common equity and tier 1 common equity, we believe it is useful to enable investors to assess our capital adequacy on these same bases. figure 4 also reconciles the gaap performance measures to the corresponding non-gaap measures.
traditionally, the banking regulators have assessed bank and bhc capital adequacy based on both the amount and the composition of capital, the calculation of which is prescribed in federal banking regulations. the federal reserve focuses its assessment of capital adequacy on a component of tier 1 capital known as tier 1 common equity. because the federal reserve has long indicated that voting common shareholders equity (essentially tier 1 risk-based capital less preferred stock, qualifying capital securities and noncontrolling interests in subsidiaries) generally should be the dominant element in tier 1 risk-based capital, this focus on tier 1 common equity is consistent with existing capital adequacy categories. the regulatory capital rules, described in more detail under the section supervision and regulation in item 1 of this report, also make tier 1 common equity a priority. the regulatory capital rules change the regulatory capital standards that apply to bhcs by, among other changes, phasing out the treatment of trust preferred securities and cumulative preferred securities as tier 1 eligible capital. by 2016, our trust preferred securities will only be included in tier 2 capital.
figure 4 also shows the computation for pre-provision net revenue, which is not formally defined by gaap. we believe that eliminating the effects of the provision for loan and lease losses makes it easier to analyze our results by presenting them on a more comparable basis.
the cash efficiency ratio is a ratio of two non-gaap performance measures. accordingly, there is no directly comparable gaap performance measure. the cash efficiency ratio excludes the impact of our intangible asset amortization from the calculation. we believe this ratio provides greater consistency and comparability between our results and those of our peer banks. additionally, this ratio is used by analysts and investors as they develop earnings forecasts and peer bank analysis.
non-gaap financial measures have inherent limitations, are not required to be uniformly applied, and are not audited. although these non-gaap financial measures are frequently used by investors to evaluate a company, they have limitations as analytical tools, and should not be considered in isolation, or as a substitute for analyses of results as reported under gaap.

results of operations net interest income one of our principal sources of revenue is net interest income. net interest income is the difference between interest income received on earning assets (such as loans and securities) and loan-related fee income, and interest expense paid on deposits and borrowings. there are several factors that affect net interest income, including:
¿   the volume, pricing, mix, and maturity of earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities;

¿   the volume and value of net free funds, such as noninterest-bearing deposits and equity capital;

¿   the use of derivative instruments to manage interest rate risk;

¿   interest rate fluctuations and competitive conditions within the marketplace; and

¿   asset quality.

to make it easier to compare results among several periods and the yields on various types of earning assets (some taxable, some not), we present net interest income in this discussion on a taxable-equivalent basis (i.e., as if it were all taxable and at the same rate). for example, $100 of tax-exempt income would be presented as $154, an amount that  if taxed at the statutory federal income tax rate of 35%  would yield $100.
figure 5 shows the various components of our balance sheet that affect interest income and expense, and their respective yields or rates over the past five years. this figure also presents a reconciliation of taxable-equivalent net interest income to net interest income reported in accordance with gaap for each of those years. the net interest margin, which is an indicator of the profitability of the earning assets portfolio less cost of funding, is calculated by dividing taxable-equivalent net interest income by average earning assets.
taxable-equivalent net interest income for 2014 was $2.317 billion, and the net interest margin was 2.97%. these results compare to taxable-equivalent net interest income of $2.348 billion and a net interest margin of 3.12% for the prior year. the decreases in net interest income, which declined $31 million, and the net interest margin were attributable to lower earning asset yields. these decreases were partially offset by loan growth, the maturity of higher-rate certificates of deposit, and a more favorable mix of lower-cost deposits and wholesale borrowings.
taxable-equivalent net interest income for 2013 increased $60 million compared to 2012 due to an increase in average loans, a more favorable funding mix, and higher loan fees, partially offset by lower earning asset yields. the net interest margin declined nine basis points primarily resulting from lower earning asset yields, which were partially offset by a more favorable funding mix.
average earning assets totaled $78.1 billion for 2014, compared to $75.4 billion in 2013. commercial, financial and agricultural loan growth of $2.7 billion from the prior year was broad-based across our commercial lines of business. consumer loans remained relatively stable, as modest increases across our core consumer loan portfolio, primarily home equity loans and direct term loans, were mostly offset by run-off in our designated consumer exit portfolio.
average deposits, excluding deposits in foreign office, totaled $67.3 billion for 2014, an increase of $1.9 billion compared to 2013. demand deposits and now and money market deposit accounts each increased $1.4 billion, mostly due to growth related to commercial client inflows as well as increases related to the commercial mortgage servicing business. these increases were partially offset by run-off in certificates of deposit.

noninterest income as shown in figure 7, noninterest income for 2014 was $1.8 billion, up $31 million, or 1.8%, from 2013. investment banking and debt placement fees benefited from our business model and had a record high year, increasing $64 million from 2013. net gains (losses) from principal investing were $26 million higher than prior year, and trust and investment services income increased $10 million, primarily due to the third quarter 2014 acquisition of pacific crest securities. these increases were partially offset by declines of $21 million in operating lease income and other leasing, $20 million in service charges on deposits accounts, $12 million in mortgage servicing fees, and $9 million in consumer mortgage income. other income also decreased $15 million.
in 2013, noninterest income decreased $90 million, or 4.8%, compared to 2012. operating lease income and other leasing gains decreased $84 million, primarily due to fewer early terminations in the leveraged lease portfolio. consumer mortgage income declined $21 million, and net gains (losses) from principal investing decreased $20 million. other income also declined $46 million, primarily due to gains on the redemption of trust preferred securities in the prior year. these decreases were partially offset by increases of $34 million in mortgage servicing fees, $27 million in cards and payments income, and $18 million in trust and investment services income.

(a)                                             for the year ended december 31, 2014, income of $4 million related to foreign exchange, interest rate, and commodity derivative trading was offset by losses related to equity securities trading, fixed income, and credit portfolio management activities. for the year ended december 31, 2013, income of $3 million related to foreign exchange and interest rate derivative trading was offset by losses related to fixed income, equity securities trading, commodity derivative trading, and credit portfolio management activities. for the year ended december 31, 2012, equity securities trading and credit portfolio management securities trading constitute the majority of this amount. these losses were partially offset by income of $6 million related to fixed income, foreign exchange, interest rate, and commodity derivative trading activities.

(b)                                          the allocation between proprietary and nonproprietary is made based upon whether the trade is conducted for the benefit of key or keys clients rather than based upon rulemaking under the volcker rule. the prohibitions and restrictions on proprietary trading activities contemplated by the volcker rule were detailed in a final rule approved by federal banking regulators in december 2013, which became effective april 1, 2014. for more information, see the discussion under the heading other regulatory developments under the dodd-frank act  volcker rule in the section entitled supervision and regulation in item 1 of this report.

the following discussion explains the composition of certain elements of our noninterest income and the factors that caused those elements to change.
trust and investment services income trust and investment services income is one of our largest sources of noninterest income and consists of brokerage commissions, trust and asset management commissions, and insurance income. the assets under management that primarily generate these revenues are shown in figure 9. for 2014, trust and investment services income increased $10 million, or 2.5%, from the prior year primarily due to the third quarter 2014 acquisition of pacific crest securities. for 2013, trust and investment services income increased $18 million, or 4.8%, from the prior year.
a significant portion of our trust and investment services income depends on the value and mix of assets under management. at december 31, 2014, our bank, trust, and registered investment advisory subsidiaries had assets under management of $39.2 billion, compared to $36.9 billion at december 31, 2013 and $34.7 billion at december 31, 2012. as shown in figure 9, increases across all portfolios were primarily attributable to market appreciation.

investment banking and debt placement fees investment banking and debt placement fees consist of syndication fees, debt and equity financing fees, financial advisor fees, gains on sales of commercial mortgages, and agency origination fees. for 2014, investment banking and debt placement fees increased $64 million, or 19.2%, from the prior year. for 2013, investment banking and debt placement fees increased $6 million, or 1.8%. these increases reflect the benefits of our business model  focusing on targeted industries  including the addition of the technology sector with the 2014 acquisition of pacific crest securities.
service charges on deposit accounts service charges on deposit accounts declined $20 million, or 7.1%, in 2014 compared to the prior year, and $6 million, or 2.1%, in 2013 compared to the prior year due to lower maintenance fees and overdraft charges.
operating lease income and other leasing gains operating lease income and other leasing gains decreased $21 million, or 17.9%, during 2014 compared to the prior year, and $84 million, or 41.8%, in 2013 compared to 2012 due to lower gains on the early terminations of leveraged leases. product run-off also contributed to the declines between years. accordingly, as shown in figure 10, operating lease expense related to the rental of leased equipment also declined between years.
corporate services income corporate services income increased $6 million, or 3.5%, in 2014 compared to 2013, driven by higher non-yield loan fees, and $4 million, or 2.4%, in 2013 compared to 2012 primarily due to an increase in letter of credit fees.
cards and payments income cards and payments income, which consists of debit card, consumer and commercial credit card, and merchant services income, increased $4 million, or 2.5%, in 2014 compared to 2013. credit card fees were higher due to growth in both rate and volume while increased merchant fees were driven by volume. cards and payments income increased $27 million, or 20%, in 2013 compared to 2012 primarily due to the third quarter 2012 credit card portfolio acquisition.
consumer mortgage income consumer mortgage income declined $9 million, or 47.4%, in 2014 compared to 2013, and $21 million, or 52.5%, in 2013 compared to 2012 primarily due to lower mortgage originations caused by increasing mortgage interest rates.
mortgage servicing fees mortgage servicing fees decreased $12 million, or 20.7%, in 2014 compared to 2013 due to lower special servicing fees. mortgage servicing fees increased $34 million, or 141.7%, in 2013 compared to 2012 due to higher levels of core servicing and special servicing fees as a result of the 2013 acquisition of a commercial mortgage servicing portfolio.
48
other income other income, which consists primarily of gain on sale of certain loans, other service charges, and certain dealer trading income, decreased $15 million, or 25.4%, in 2014 compared to 2013, and $46 million, or 43.8%, in 2013 compared to 2012 due to declines in various miscellaneous income categories.
noninterest expense as shown in figure 10, noninterest expense for 2014 was $2.8 billion, a decrease of $61 million, or 2.2%, from 2013. we recognized $80 million of efficiency- and pension-related charges in 2014 compared to $117 million in 2013. we also recognized $22 million of noninterest expense related to pacific crest securities, which we acquired in the third quarter of 2014. as shown in figure 11, personnel expense declined $18 million, driven by lower net technology contract labor, severance, and employee benefits, partially offset by higher incentive compensation and stock-based compensation. nonpersonnel expense decreased $43 million, primarily due to declines in net occupancy costs of $14 million, provision (credit) for losses on lending-related commitments of $10 million, and equipment expense of $8 million.
noninterest expense for 2013 was $2.8 billion, up $2 million, or .1%, from 2012. in 2013, expenses attributable to the 2012 acquisitions of the credit card portfolios and western new york branches increased $40 million, and we recognized $117 million of expenses related to our efficiency initiative and a pension settlement charge. as shown in figure 11, personnel expense increased by $39 million in 2013, driven by higher levels of incentive compensation, employee benefits, and severance expense, partially offset by a decline in stock-based compensation. nonpersonnel expense decreased $37 million, primarily due to declines in several expense categories: $39 million in business services and professional fees, $17 million in marketing, $11 million in other expense, and $10 million in operating lease expense. these declines in nonpersonnel expense were partially offset by increases of $24 million in provision (credit) for losses on lending-related commitments, $21 in intangible asset amortization, and $15 million in net occupancy costs.

the following discussion explains the composition of certain elements of our noninterest expense and the factors that caused those elements to change.
personnel as shown in figure 11, personnel expense, the largest category of our noninterest expense, decreased by $18 million, or 1.1%, in 2014 compared to 2013. declines in net technology contract labor of $17 million, severance
49
of $14 million, and employee benefits of $12 million all contributed to the decrease in personnel expense. these declines were partially offset by increases in incentive compensation of $19 million and stock-based compensation of $9 million related to the performance of our business and the third quarter 2014 acquisition of pacific crest securities.
personnel expense increased by $39 million, or 2.5%, from 2012 to 2013. incentive compensation increased $28 million. severance expense and employee benefits increased $15 million and $12 million, respectively, as a result of staff reductions related to our efficiency initiative. employee benefits included a $27 million pension settlement charge. these increases in personnel expense were partially offset by a decrease of $14 million in stock-based compensation.

operating lease expense operating lease expense decreased $5 million, or 10.6%, in 2014 compared to 2013, and $10 million, or 17.5%, in 2013 compared to 2012 primarily due to product run-off. income related to the rental of leased equipment is presented in figure 7 as operating lease income and other leasing gains.
intangible asset amortization intangible asset amortization decreased $5 million, or 11.4%, in 2014 compared to 2013 due to the accelerated basis of amortization for the core deposit and pccr intangibles. intangible asset amortization increased $21 million, or 91.3%, in 2013 compared to 2012 due to the 2012 acquisitions of the credit card portfolio and western new york branches. additional information regarding our intangible assets can be found in note 10 (goodwill and other intangible assets).
other expense other expense comprises various miscellaneous expense items such as travel and entertainment, technology service providers, and franchise and business taxes. other expense declined $4 million, or 1.2%, in 2014 compared to 2013, and $11 million, or 3.2%, in 2013 compared to 2012 due to fluctuations in several of those line items.
income taxes we recorded a tax provision from continuing operations of $326 million for 2014, compared to a tax provision of $271 million for 2013, and $231 million for 2012. the effective tax rate, which is the provision for income taxes as a percentage of income from continuing operations before income taxes, was 25.6% for 2014, compared to 23.7% for 2013, and 21.4% for 2012.

our federal tax (benefit) expense differs from the amount that would be calculated using the federal statutory tax rate, primarily because we generate income from investments in tax-advantaged assets, such as corporate-owned life insurance, earn credits associated with investments in low-income housing projects, and make periodic adjustments to our tax reserves. in 2014, our effective tax rate was positively impacted by a settlement with the irs on tax refund claims for prior years, partially offset by the write-off of a foreign deferred tax asset due to the sale of certain foreign leasing assets. in addition, in 2014, 2013 and 2012, our effective tax rate was lower due to the early termination of certain leveraged leases that resulted in nontaxable gains pursuant to a prior settlement with the irs.
we recorded a valuation allowance of $.3 million at december 31, 2014, compared to $1 million at december 31, 2013, and $3 million at december  31, 2012, against the gross deferred tax assets for certain state net operating loss and state credit carryforwards.

key community bank summary of operations as shown in figure 13, key community bank recorded net income attributable to key of $234 million for 2014, compared to $205 million for 2013, and $162 million for 2012. the increase in 2014 was primarily due to a reduced provision for loan and lease losses and lower noninterest expense.

taxable-equivalent net interest income declined $84 million, or 5.5%, from 2013. average loans and leases grew $794 million while average deposits increased $521 million compared to 2013. the positive contribution to net interest income from loan and deposit growth was more than offset by a reduction in the value of deposits in 2014 compared to one year ago.
noninterest income decreased $15 million, or 1.9%, from 2013. service charges on deposit accounts declined $19 million from 2013 primarily due to reduced overdraft fees resulting from changes in posting order. consumer mortgage income decreased $9 million from 2013 due to lower refinancing activity, and operating leasing income and other leasing gains declined $4 million. these decreases in noninterest income were partially offset by an $8 million increase in cards and payments income and a $9 million increase in other miscellaneous income.
the provision for loan and lease losses declined $81 million, or 52.3%, from 2013. net loan charge-offs decreased $31 million from 2013 as a result of continued progress in the economic environment and further improvement in the credit quality of the portfolio.
noninterest expense declined $65 million, or 3.5%, from 2013. personnel expense decreased $26 million, primarily due to declines in salaries, incentive compensation, and employee benefits. nonpersonnel expense declined $39 million, primarily due to decreases in outside loan servicing fees, computer processing, intangible asset amortization, and other support costs.
in 2013, key community banks net income attributable to key increased $43 million from the prior year. taxable-equivalent net interest income declined $5 million from 2012. the positive contribution to net interest income from loan and deposit growth was offset by a reduction in the value of deposits in 2013 driven by the prolonged low rate environment. noninterest income increased $13 million from 2012. trust and investment services income increased due to higher assets under management resulting from market appreciation and increased production. cards and payments income increased due to the full-year impact of the credit card portfolio acquisition in 2012. these increases in noninterest income were partially offset by a decline in consumer mortgage income primarily due to lower originations. the provision for loan and lease losses increased $5 million. noninterest expense declined $65 million from 2012 due to keys efficiency initiative. personnel expense decreased primarily due to declines in salaries and employee benefits. nonpersonnel expense declined primarily due to decreases in business services and professional fees, computer processing, and other support costs.

key corporate bank summary of operations as shown in figure 14, key corporate bank recorded net income attributable to key of $497 million for 2014, compared to $475 million for 2013 and $425 million for 2012. the 2014 increase was driven by an increase in net interest income and noninterest income, partially offset by an increase in noninterest expense.
taxable-equivalent net interest income increased $45 million, or 5.7%, in 2014 compared to 2013. the growth was primarily driven by a $28 million increase in the earning asset spread, as the increase in earning asset balances more than offset the decrease in the spread rate year-over-year. in addition, there were increases in other components of net interest income.
noninterest income increased $49 million, or 6.5%, from 2013. investment banking and debt placement fees increased $63 million driven by the strength of keys business model. corporate services income increased $11 million due to growth in non-yield loan fees associated with increases in loans. trust and investment services income increased $8 million due to the recently-acquired pacific crest securities. these increases were partially offset by a $17 million decrease in other noninterest income mostly due to lower gains realized on the disposition of certain investments held by the real estate capital line of business, and a $12 million decline in mortgage servicing fees due to lower special servicing fees.
the provision for loan and lease losses was a credit of $2 million in 2014, compared to a credit of $3 million in 2013. the 2014 credit was driven by continued improvement in credit quality within the portfolio, as the quality of new business volume exceeded that of the legacy portfolio. net loan charge-offs decreased from $3 million in 2013 to a $19 million recovery in 2014.
noninterest expense increased $49 million, or 6.1%, from 2013. this increase was primarily driven by a $38 million increase in personnel expense due to higher incentive compensation expense related to the performance

of the key corporate bank and the impact of the recently-acquired pacific crest securities. in addition, there were increases in various other expense categories.
in 2013, key corporate banks net income attributable to key increased $50 million from the prior year. taxable-equivalent net interest income increased $4 million in 2013 compared to 2012, as increases in earning asset spread from higher earning asset balances offset a decrease in deposit spread from a decline in rates. noninterest income increased $33 million as increases in mortgage servicing fees, gains realized on the disposition of certain investments held by the real estate capital line of business, and investment banking and debt placement fees more than offset decreases in operating lease income and other leasing gains. the provision for loan and lease losses decreased $33 million due to improved credit quality with the portfolio. noninterest expense increased $6 million driven by higher provision (credit) for losses on lending-related commitments and personnel expense. these expense increases were partially offset by decreases in operating lease expense and net oreo expense.

commercial, financial and agricultural loans increased $3 billion, or 12.1%, from the same period last year, with key corporate bank increasing $2.7 billion and key community bank up $553 million. we have experienced

growth in new high credit quality loan commitments and utilization with clients in our middle market segment and institutional and capital markets business. our two largest industry classifications  services and manufacturing  increased by .3% and 9%, respectively, when compared to one year ago. the services and manufacturing industries represented 22% and 17%, respectively, of the total commercial, financial and agricultural loan portfolio at december 31, 2014, and 24% and 17%, respectively, at december 31, 2013. at the end of each period provided in figure 16 above, loans in the services and manufacturing industry classifications accounted for approximately 40% of our total commercial, financial and agricultural loan portfolio.
services, manufacturing, and public utilities are focus areas where we maintain dedicated industry verticals that are staffed by relationship managers who possess deep industry experience and knowledge. our loans in the services classification grew by $17 million, or .3%, compared to last year. loans in the manufacturing classification grew by $383 million, or 9% compared to the same period one year ago. increases in lending to large corporate, middle market, and business banking clients accounted for the majority of the growth in this classification.
our loans in the financial services and transportation classifications increased 32% and 48%, respectively, compared to the prior year. the increase in financial services loans was primarily attributable to higher issuances of revolving facilities to finance companies and additional reit balances. the increase in transportation loans was primarily attributable to loan growth for rail cars and shipping containers.
our oil and gas loan portfolio focuses on lending to middle market companies and represents 2% of total loans outstanding at december 31, 2014. we have over 10 years of experience in energy lending with over 20 specialists dedicated to oil and gas. credit quality on these loans remains solid.
commercial real estate loans.    cre loans represent 16% of our total loan portfolio at december 31, 2014, and december 31, 2013. these cre loans, including both owner- and nonowner-occupied properties, represented 22% of our commercial loan portfolio at december 31, 2014, compared to 23% one year ago. these loans have increased $334 million, or 3.8%, to $9.1 billion at december 31, 2014, from $8.8 billion at december 31, 2013. our cre lending business is conducted through two primary sources: our 12-state banking franchise, and keybank real estate capital, a national line of business that cultivates relationships with owners of cre located both within and beyond the branch system. this line of business deals primarily with nonowner-occupied properties (generally properties for which at least 50% of the debt service is provided by rental income from nonaffiliated third parties) and accounted for approximately 61% of our average year-to-date cre loans, compared to 56% one year ago. keybank real estate capital generally focuses on larger owners and operators of cre.
figure 17 includes commercial mortgage and construction loans in both key community bank and key corporate bank. as shown in figure 17, this loan portfolio is diversified by both property type and geographic location of the underlying collateral.
as presented in figure 17, at december 31, 2014, our cre portfolio included mortgage loans of $8 billion and construction loans of $1.1 billion, representing 14% and 2%, respectively, of our total loans. nonowner-occupied loans represented 11% of our total loans and owner-occupied loans represented 5% of our total loans. the average size of mortgage loans originated during 2014 was $4.9 million, and our largest mortgage loan at december 31, 2014, had a balance of $105 million. at december 31, 2014, our average construction loan commitment was $5.9 million. our largest construction loan commitment was $49.8 million, and our largest construction loan amount outstanding was $42.2 million.
also shown in figure 17, at december 31, 2014, 70% of our cre loans were for nonowner-occupied properties, compared to 67% at december 31, 2013. approximately 15% and 16% of these loans were construction loans at december 31, 2014, and 2013, respectively. typically, these properties are not fully leased at the origination of the loan. the borrower relies upon additional leasing through the life of the construction loan to provide the cash flow necessary to support debt service payments. a significant decline in economic growth, and in turn, in rental rates and occupancy, would adversely affect our portfolio of construction loans.

since december 31, 2013, our nonowner-occupied cre portfolio has increased by approximately $567 million, or 9.7%, as many of our clients have taken advantage of opportunities to permanently refinance their loans at historically low interest rates.
if the economic recovery stalls, it may weaken the cre market fundamentals (i.e., vacancy rates, the stability of rental income and asset values), leading to reduced cash flow to support debt service payments. reduced client cash flow would adversely affect our ability to collect such payments. accordingly, the value of cre loan portfolio could be adversely affected.
commercial lease financing.    we conduct commercial lease financing arrangements through our kef line of business and have both the scale and array of products to compete in the equipment lease financing business. commercial lease financing receivables represented 10% of commercial loans at december 31, 2014, and 12% at december 31, 2013.
commercial loan modification and restructuring we modify and extend certain commercial loans in the normal course of business for our clients. loan modifications vary and are handled on a case by case basis with strategies responsive to the specific circumstances of each loan and borrower. in many cases, borrowers have other resources and can reinforce the credit with additional capital, collateral, guarantees, or income sources.
modifications are negotiated to achieve mutually agreeable terms that maximize loan credit quality while at the same time meeting our clients financing needs. modifications made to loans of creditworthy borrowers not

experiencing financial difficulties and under circumstances where ultimate collection of all principal and interest is not in doubt are not classified as tdrs. in accordance with applicable accounting guidance, a loan is classified as a tdr only when the borrower is experiencing financial difficulties and a creditor concession has been granted.
our concession types are primarily interest rate reductions, forgiveness of principal, and other modifications. loan extensions are sometimes coupled with these primary concession types. because economic conditions have improved modestly and we have restructured loans to provide the optimal opportunity for successful repayment by the borrower, certain of our restructured loans have returned to accrual status and consistently performed under the restructured loan terms over the past year.
if loan terms are extended at less than normal market rates for similar lending arrangements, our asset recovery group is consulted to help determine if any concession granted would result in designation as a tdr. transfer to our asset recovery group is considered for any commercial loan determined to be a tdr. during 2014, there were $22 million of new restructured commercial loans compared to $69 million of new restructured commercial loans in 2013.
for more information on concession types for our commercial accruing and nonaccruing tdrs, see note 5 (asset quality).

we often use an a-b note structure for our tdrs, breaking the existing loan into two tranches. first, we create an a note. since the objective of this tdr note structure is to achieve a fully performing and well-rated a note, we focus on sizing that note to a level that is supported by cash flow available to service debt at current market terms and consistent with our customary underwriting standards. this note structure typically will include a debt coverage ratio of 1.2 or better of cash flow to monthly payments of market interest, and principal amortization of generally not more than 25 years. (these metrics are adjusted from time to time based upon changes in long-term markets and take-out underwriting standards of our various lines of business.) appropriately sized a notes are more likely to return to accrual status, allowing us to resume recognizing interest income. as the borrowers payment performance improves, these restructured notes typically also allow for an upgraded internal quality risk rating classification. moreover, the borrower retains ownership and control of the underlying collateral (typically, cre), the borrowers capital structure is strengthened (often to the point that fresh capital is attracted to the transaction), and local markets are spared distressed/fire sales.
the b note typically is an interest-only note with no required amortization until the property stabilizes and generates excess cash flow. this excess cash flow customarily is applied directly to the principal of the a note. we evaluate the b note when we consider returning the a note to accrual status. in many cases, the b note is charged off at the same time the a note is returned to accrual status. alternatively, both a and b notes may be simultaneously returned to accrual if credit metrics are supportive.
restructured nonaccrual loans may be returned to accrual status based on a current, well-documented evaluation of the credit, which would include analysis of the borrowers financial condition, prospects for repayment under
60
the modified terms, and alternate sources of repayment such as the value of loan collateral. we wait a reasonable period (generally a minimum of six months) to establish the borrowers ability to sustain historical repayment performance before returning the loan to accrual status. sustained historical repayment performance prior to the restructuring also may be taken into account. the primary consideration for returning a restructured loan to accrual status is the reasonable assurance that the full contractual principal balance of the loan and the ongoing contractually required interest payments will be fully repaid. although our policy is a guideline, considerable judgment is required to review each borrowers circumstances.
all loans processed as tdrs, including a notes and any non-charged-off b notes, are reported as tdrs during the calendar year in which the restructure took place.
additional information regarding tdrs is provided in note 5 (asset quality).
extensions.    project loans typically are refinanced into the permanent commercial loan market at maturity, but sometimes they are modified and extended. extension terms take into account the specific circumstances of the client relationship, the status of the project, and near-term prospects for both the client and the collateral. in all cases, pricing and loan structure are reviewed and, where necessary, modified to ensure the loan has been priced to achieve a market rate of return and loan terms that are appropriate for the risk. typical enhancements include one or more of the following: principal pay down, increased amortization, additional collateral, increased guarantees, and a cash flow sweep. some maturing construction loans have automatic extension options built in; in those cases, pricing and loan terms cannot be altered.
loan pricing is determined based on the strength of the borrowing entity and the strength of the guarantor, if any. therefore, pricing for an extended loan may remain the same because the loan is already priced at or above current market.
we do not consider loan extensions in the normal course of business (under existing loan terms or at market rates) as tdrs, particularly when ultimate collection of all principal and interest is not in doubt and no concession has been made. in the case of loan extensions where either collection of all principal and interest is uncertain or a concession has been made, we would analyze such credit under the applicable accounting guidance to determine whether it qualifies as a tdr. extensions that qualify as tdrs are measured for impairment under the applicable accounting guidance.
guarantors.    we conduct a detailed guarantor analysis (1) for all new extensions of credit, (2) at the time of any material modification/extension, and (3) typically annually, as part of our on-going portfolio and loan monitoring procedures. this analysis requires the guarantor entity to submit all appropriate financial statements, including balance sheets, income statements, tax returns, and real estate schedules.
while the specific steps of each guarantor analysis may vary, the high-level objectives include determining the overall financial conditions of the guarantor entities, including size, quality, and nature of asset base; net worth (adjusted to reflect our opinion of market value); leverage; standing liquidity; recurring cash flow; contingent and direct debt obligations; and near-term debt maturities.
borrower and guarantor financial statements are required at least annually within 90-120 days of the calendar/fiscal year end. income statements and rent rolls for project collateral are required quarterly. we may require certain information, such as liquidity, certifications, status of asset sales or debt resolutions, and real estate schedules, to be provided more frequently.
we routinely seek performance from guarantors of impaired debt if the guarantor is solvent. we may not seek to enforce the guaranty if we are precluded by bankruptcy or we determine the cost to pursue a guarantor exceeds the value to be returned given the guarantors verified financial condition. we often are successful in obtaining either monetary payment or the cooperation of our solvent guarantors to help mitigate loss, cost, and the expense of collections.

as of december 31, 2014, we had $3.4 million of mortgage and construction loans that had a loan-to-value ratio greater than 1.0, and were accounted for as performing loans. these loans were not considered impaired due to one or more of the following factors: (i) underlying cash flow adequate to service the debt at a market rate of return with adequate amortization; (ii) a satisfactory borrower payment history; and (iii) acceptable guarantor support.
consumer loan portfolio consumer loans outstanding decreased by $130 million, or .8%, from one year ago. the home equity portfolio is the largest segment of our consumer loan portfolio. approximately 97% of this portfolio at december 31, 2014, originated from key community bank within our 12-state footprint. the remainder of the portfolio, which has been in an exit mode since the fourth quarter of 2007, was originated from the consumer finance line of business and is now included in other segments. home equity loans in key community bank increased by $26 million, or .3%, over the past 12 months as a result of stabilized home values, improved employment, and favorable borrowing conditions.
as shown in figure 13, we hold the first lien position for approximately 60% of the key community bank home equity portfolio at december 31, 2014, and 58% at december 31, 2013. for consumer loans with real estate collateral, we track borrower performance monthly. regardless of the lien position, credit metrics are refreshed quarterly, including recent fair isaac corporation scores as well as original and updated loan-to-value ratio. this information is used in establishing the alll. our methodology is described in note 1 (summary of significant accounting policies) under the heading allowance for loan and lease losses.
regulatory guidance issued in january 2012 addressed specific risks and required actions within home equity portfolios associated with second lien loans. this regulatory guidance related to the classification of second lien home equity loans was implemented prospectively, and therefore prior periods were not adjusted. at december 31, 2014, 40% of our home equity portfolio is secured by second lien mortgages. on at least a quarterly basis, we continue to monitor the risk characteristics of these loans when determining whether our loss estimation methods are appropriate.

loans held for sale as shown in note 4 (loans and loans held for sale), our loans held for sale were $734 million at december 31, 2014, compared to $611 million at december 31, 2013. during 2014, we recorded net gains (losses) from loan sales of $97 million. there were no loans held for sale related to the discontinued operations of the education lending business at december 31, 2014, and 2013.
at december 31, 2014, loans held for sale included $638 million of commercial mortgages, which increased by $331 million from december 31, 2013, $63 million of commercial, financial and agricultural loans, which decreased by $215 million from december 31, 2013, $18 million of residential mortgage loans, which increased by $1 million from december 31, 2013, and $15 million of commercial lease financing, which increased $6 million from december 31, 2013. valuations are conducted using internal models that rely on market data from sales or nonbinding bids on similar assets, including credit spreads, treasury rates, interest rate curves and risk profiles, as well as our own assumptions about the exit market for the loans and details about individual loans within the respective portfolios. we review our assumptions quarterly. for additional information related to the valuation of loans held for sale, see note 6 (fair value measurements).
loan sales as shown in figure 20, during 2014, we sold $4.4 billion of cre loans, $407 million of residential real estate loans, and $376 million of commercial loans. most of these sales came from the held-for-sale portfolio.
among the factors that we consider in determining which loans to sell are:
¿   our business strategy for particular lending areas;

¿   whether particular lending businesses meet established performance standards or fit with our relationship banking strategy;

¿   our a/lm needs;

¿   the cost of alternative funding sources;

¿   the level of credit risk;

¿   capital requirements; and

¿   market conditions and pricing.

(a)                                      during the third quarter of 2014, we sold the residual interests in all of our outstanding education loan securitization trusts to a third party. at september 30,
2014, we deconsolidated the securitization trusts and removed the trust assets from our balance sheet. we retained the servicing for the loans associated with these securitization trusts. see note 13 (acquisitions and discontinued operations) for more information about this transaction.

in the event of default by a borrower, we are subject to recourse with respect to approximately $1.4 billion of the $194 billion of loans administered or serviced at december 31, 2014. additional information about this recourse arrangement is included in note 20 (commitments, contingent liabilities and guarantees) under the heading recourse agreement with fnma.
we derive income from several sources when retaining the right to administer or service loans that are sold. we earn noninterest income (recorded as other income) from fees for servicing or administering loans. this fee income is reduced by the amortization of related servicing assets. in addition, we earn interest income from investing funds generated by escrow deposits collected in connection with the servicing of cre loans. additional information about our mortgage servicing assets is included in note 9 (mortgage servicing assets).

securities our securities portfolio totaled $18.4 billion at december 31, 2014, compared to $17.1 billion at december 31, 2013. available-for-sale securities were $13.4 billion at december 31, 2014, compared to $12.3 billion at december 31, 2013. held-to-maturity securities were $5 billion at december 31, 2014, compared to $4.8 billion at december 31, 2013.
as shown in figure 23, all of our mortgage-backed securities, which include both securities available for sale and held-to-maturity securities, are issued by government-sponsored enterprises or gnma, and are traded in liquid secondary markets. these securities are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value for the available-for-sale portfolio and at cost for the held-to-maturity portfolio. for more information about these securities, see note 6 (fair value measurements) under the heading qualitative disclosures of valuation techniques, and note 7 (securities).

securities available for sale the majority of our securities available-for-sale portfolio consists of federal agency cmos and mortgage-backed securities. cmos are debt securities secured by a pool of mortgages or mortgage-backed securities. these mortgage securities generate interest income, serve as collateral to support certain pledging agreements, and provide liquidity value under upcoming regulatory requirements. at december 31, 2014, we had $13.3 billion invested in cmos and other mortgage-backed securities in the available-for-sale portfolio, compared to $12.3 billion at december 31, 2013.
we periodically evaluate our securities available-for-sale portfolio in light of established a/lm objectives, changing market conditions that could affect the profitability of the portfolio, the regulatory environment, and the level of interest rate risk to which we are exposed. these evaluations may cause us to take steps to adjust our overall balance sheet positioning.
in addition, the size and composition of our securities available-for-sale portfolio could vary with our needs for liquidity and the extent to which we are required (or elect) to hold these assets as collateral to secure public funds and trust deposits. although we generally use debt securities for this purpose, other assets, such as securities purchased under resale agreements or letters of credit, are used occasionally when they provide a lower cost of collateral or more favorable risk profiles.
throughout 2013 and 2014, our investing activities continued to complement other balance sheet developments and provide for our ongoing liquidity management needs. our actions to not reinvest the monthly security cash flows at various times during this time period served to provide the liquidity necessary to address our funding requirements. these funding requirements included ongoing loan growth and occasional debt maturities. at other times, we may make additional investments that go beyond the replacement of maturities or mortgage security cash flows as our liquidity position and/or interest rate risk management strategies may require. lastly, our focus on investing in gnma-related securities is also related to liquidity management strategies as we continue to make progress in preparing for future regulatory requirements.

other investments principal investments  investments in equity and debt instruments made by our principal investing unit  represented 53% of other investments at december 31, 2014. they include direct investments (investments made in a particular company) as well as indirect investments (investments made through funds that include other investors). principal investments are predominantly made in privately held companies and are carried at fair value. the fair value of the direct investments was $104 million at december 31, 2014, and $141 million at december 31, 2013, while the fair value of the indirect investments was $302 million at december 31, 2014, and $413 million at december 31, 2013. under the requirements of the volcker rule, we will be required to dispose of some or all of our indirect principal investments. on december 18, 2014, the federal reserve extended the conformance period to july 21, 2016, for all banking entities with respect to covered funds. the federal reserve also indicated its intent to exercise the authority granted by section 13 of the bank holding company act to grant the final one-year extension until july 21, 2017. if this authority is not exercised by the federal reserve, key is permitted to file for a one-year extension, and an additional extension of up to five years for illiquid funds, to retain the indirect investments for a longer period of time. we plan to apply for the extension, if not granted automatically, and hold the investments. as of december 31, 2014, we have not committed to a plan to sell these investments. for more information about the volcker rule, see the discussion under the heading other regulatory developments under the dodd-frank act  volcker rule in the section entitled supervision and regulation in item 1 of this report.
in addition to principal investments, other investments include other equity and mezzanine instruments, such as certain real-estate-related investments that are carried at fair value, as well as other types of investments that generally are carried at cost. there are indirect real-estate-related investments valued at $10 million at december 31, 2014 and $23 million at december 31, 2013, that may be subject to the disposal requirements under the volcker rule, as described in the previous paragraph.
most of our other investments are not traded on an active market. we determine the fair value at which these investments should be recorded based on the nature of the specific investment and all available relevant information. this review may encompass such factors as the issuers past financial performance and future potential, the values of public companies in comparable businesses, the risks associated with the particular business or investment type, current market conditions, the nature and duration of resale restrictions, the issuers payment history, our knowledge of the industry, third-party data, and other relevant factors. as of december 31, 2014, net gains from our principal investing activities (including results attributable to noncontrolling interests) totaled $78 million, which includes $13 million of net unrealized losses. these net gains are recorded as net gains (losses) from principal investing on the income statement. additional information regarding these investments is provided in note 6 (fair value measurements).
deposits and other sources of funds domestic deposits are our primary source of funding. during 2014, average domestic deposits were $67.3 billion and represented 86% of the funds we used to support loans and other earning assets, compared to $65.3 billion and 87% during 2013. the composition of our average deposits is shown in figure 5 in the section entitled net interest income.
the increase in average domestic deposits from 2013 to 2014 was due to increases in demand deposits of $1.4 billion and now and money market deposit accounts of $1.4 billion. these increases were mostly due to growth related to commercial client inflows as well as increases related to the commercial mortgage servicing business. this growth was partially offset by run-off in certificates of deposit.
wholesale funds, consisting of deposits in our foreign office and short-term borrowings, averaged $2.4 billion during 2014, compared to $2.8 billion during 2013. the change from 2013 was caused by a $620 million decrease in federal funds purchased and securities sold under agreements to repurchase partially offset by a $48 million increase in foreign office deposits and a $203 million increase in bank notes and other short-term borrowings.

capital at december 31, 2014, our shareholders equity was $10.5 billion, up $227 million from december 31, 2013. the following sections discuss certain factors that contributed to this change. for other factors that contributed to the change, see the consolidated statements of changes in equity.
ccar and capital actions as part of its ongoing supervisory process, the federal reserve requires bhcs like keycorp to submit an annual comprehensive capital plan and to update that plan to reflect material changes in the bhcs risk profile, business strategies, or corporate structure, including but not limited to changes in planned capital actions. in january 2014, we submitted to the federal reserve and provided to the occ our 2014 capital plan under the annual ccar process. on march 26, 2014, the federal reserve announced that it did not object to our 2014 capital plan. the 2014 capital plan includes a common share repurchase program of up to $542 million. share repurchases under the capital plan began in the second quarter of 2014 and include repurchases to offset issuances of common shares under our employee compensation plans. common share repurchases under the 2014 capital plan are expected to be executed through the first quarter of 2015.
through the fourth quarter of 2014, we repurchased $355 million of common shares under our 2014 capital plan authorization. during the first quarter of 2014, we completed $141 million of common shares under our 2013 capital plan authorization.
dividends as previously reported, our 2014 capital plan also proposed an increase in our quarterly common share dividend from $.055 to $.065 per share, which was approved by our board of directors in may 2014. other changes to future dividends may be evaluated by the board based upon our earnings, financial condition, and other factors, including regulatory review. further information regarding the capital planning process and ccar is included in the supervision and regulation section of item 1 of this report under the heading regulatory capital and liquidity.
consistent with the 2014 capital plan, we made a dividend payment of $.065 per share on our common shares during each of the second, third, and fourth quarters of 2014, totaling $169 million, and a dividend payment of $.055 per share, or $49 million, during the first quarter of 2014.
we also made four quarterly dividend payments of $1.9375 per share totaling $22 million on our series a preferred stock during 2014.

as discussed in further detail in the supervision and regulation section in item 1 of this report under the heading capital planning and stress testing, we are required to annually submit a capital plan to the federal reserve setting forth planned capital actions, including any share repurchases our board of directors and management intend to make during the year (subject to the federal reserves notice of non-objection). pursuant to that requirement, we have submitted to the federal reserve for review our 2015 capital plan.
capital adequacy capital adequacy is an important indicator of financial stability and performance. all of our capital ratios remained in excess of regulatory requirements at december 31, 2014. our capital and liquidity levels are intended to position us to weather an adverse credit cycle while continuing to serve our clients needs, as well as to meet the regulatory capital rules described in the supervision and regulation section of item 1 of this report. our shareholders equity to assets ratio was 11.22% at december 31, 2014, compared to 11.09% at december 31, 2013. our tangible common equity to tangible assets ratio was 9.88% at december 31, 2014, compared to 9.80% at december 31, 2013.
federal banking regulators have promulgated minimum risk-based capital and leverage ratio requirements for bhcs like keycorp and their banking subsidiaries like keybank. prior to january 1, 2015, key and keybank (consolidated) were each required to maintain a minimum tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 4.00% and a total risk-based capital ratio of 8.00%, while key was required to maintain a minimum tier 1 leverage ratio of 3.00% and keybank (consolidated) was required to maintain a minimum tier 1 leverage ratio of 4.00%. at december 31, 2014, our tier 1 risk-based capital ratio, total risk-based capital ratio, and tier 1 leverage ratio were 11.90%, 13.89%, and 11.26%, respectively, compared to 11.96%, 14.33%, and 11.11%, respectively, at december 31, 2013.
the adoption of the regulatory capital rules changes the regulatory capital standards that apply to bhcs by phasing out the treatment of capital securities and cumulative preferred securities as eligible tier 1 capital. the phase-out period, which began january 1, 2015, for standardized approach banking organizations such as keycorp, will result in our trust preferred securities issued by the keycorp capital trusts being treated only as tier 2 capital by 2016. the trust preferred securities issued by the keycorp capital trusts contribute $339 million, or 40, 38, and 39 basis points, to our tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 11.90%, tier 1 leverage ratio of 11.26%, and total risk-based capital ratio of 13.89%, respectively, at december 31, 2014. the new minimum capital and leverage ratios under the regulatory capital rules together with the estimated ratios of key at december 31, 2014, calculated on a fully phased-in basis, are set forth under the heading new minimum capital and leverage ratio requirements in the supervision and regulation section in item 1 of this report.
as previously indicated in the supervision and regulation section of item 1 of this report under the heading revised prompt corrective action capital category ratios, the prompt corrective action capital category regulations do not apply to bhcs. if, however, these regulations did apply to bhcs, we believe keycorp would qualify for the well capitalized capital category at december 31, 2014. moreover, after accounting for the phase-out of our trust preferred securities as tier 1 eligible (and therefore as tier 2 instead) as of december 31, 2014, we estimate keycorp would still qualify for the well capitalized capital category under the regulatory capital regulations in effect before january 1, 2015, with an estimated tier 1 risk-based capital ratio, estimated tier 1 leverage ratio, and estimated total risk-based capital ratio of 11.50%, 10.88%, and 13.89%, respectively. the new threshold ratios for a well capitalized and an adequately capitalized institution under the regulatory capital rules are described in the supervision and regulation section of item 1 of this report under the heading revised prompt corrective action capital category ratios. since the regulatory capital categories under these regulations serve a limited supervisory function, investors should not use them as a representation of the overall financial condition or prospects of keycorp. a discussion of the regulatory capital standards and other related capital adequacy regulatory standards is included in the section regulatory capital and liquidity in supervision and regulation under item 1 of this report.

traditionally, the banking regulators have assessed bank and bhc capital adequacy based on both the amount and composition of capital, the calculation of which is prescribed in federal banking regulations. the federal reserves assessment of capital adequacy focuses on a component of tier 1 risk-based capital, known as tier 1 common equity, and its review of the consolidated capitalization of systemically important financial companies, including keycorp. the capital modifications mandated by the regulatory capital rules are consistent with the renewed focus on tier 1 common equity and the consolidated capitalization of banks, and bhcs. tier 1 common equity is neither formally defined by gaap nor prescribed in amount prior to january 1, 2015, by federal banking regulations; this measure is considered to be a non-gaap financial measure. figure 4 in the highlights of our 2014 performance section reconciles key shareholders equity, the gaap performance measure, to tier 1 common equity, the corresponding non-gaap measure. our tier 1 common equity ratio was 11.17% at december 31, 2014, compared to 11.22% at december 31, 2013.
generally, for risk-based capital purposes, deferred tax assets that are dependent upon future taxable income are limited to the lesser of: (i) the amount of deferred tax assets that a financial institution expects to realize within one year of the calendar quarter-end date, based on its projected future taxable income for the year, or (ii) 10% of the amount of an institutions tier 1 capital. at december 31, 2014, and december 31, 2013, we had no net deferred tax assets deducted from tier 1 capital and risk-weighted assets. at december 31, 2014, for keys consolidated operations, we had a federal net deferred tax asset of $195 million and a state deferred tax asset of $22 million, compared to a federal net deferred tax asset of $184 million and a state deferred tax asset of $7 million at december 31, 2013. we have recorded a valuation allowance of less than $1 million against the gross deferred tax assets associated with certain state net operating loss carryforwards and state credit carryforwards at december 31, 2014, compared to $1 million at december 31, 2013.

off-balance sheet arrangements and aggregate contractual obligations off-balance sheet arrangements we are party to various types of off-balance sheet arrangements, which could lead to contingent liabilities or risks of loss that are not reflected on the balance sheet.
variable interest entities a vie is a partnership, limited liability company, trust or other legal entity that meets any one of the following criteria:
¿   the entity does not have sufficient equity to conduct its activities without additional subordinated financial support from another party.

¿   the entitys investors lack the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the entitys economic performance.

¿   the entitys equity at risk holders do not have the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive residual returns.

¿   the voting rights of some investors are not proportional to their economic interests in the entity, and substantially all of the entitys activities involve, or are conducted on behalf of, investors with disproportionately few voting rights.

in accordance with the applicable accounting guidance for consolidations, we consolidate a vie if we have: (i) a variable interest in the entity; (ii) the power to direct activities of the vie that most significantly impact the entitys economic performance; and (iii) the obligation to absorb losses of the entity or the right to receive benefits from the entity that could potentially be significant to the vie (i.e., we are considered to be the primary beneficiary). additional information regarding the nature of vies and our involvement with them is included in note 1 (summary of significant accounting policies) under the heading basis of presentation, and in note 11 (variable interest entities).
we use the equity method to account for unconsolidated investments in voting rights entities or vies if we have significant influence over the entitys operating and financing decisions (usually defined as a voting or economic interest of 20% to 50%, but not controlling). unconsolidated investments in voting rights entities or vies in which we have a voting or economic interest of less than 20% generally are carried at cost. investments held by our registered broker-dealer and investment company subsidiaries (primarily principal investments) are carried at fair value.
commitments to extend credit or funding loan commitments provide for financing on predetermined terms as long as the client continues to meet specified criteria. these commitments generally carry variable rates of interest and have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses. we typically charge a fee for our loan commitments. since a commitment may expire without resulting in a loan or being fully utilized, the total amount of an outstanding commitment may significantly exceed any related cash outlay. further information about our loan commitments at december 31, 2014, is presented in note 20 (commitments, contingent liabilities and guarantees) under the heading commitments to extend credit or funding. figure 30 shows the remaining contractual amount of each class of commitment to extend credit or funding. for loan commitments and commercial letters of credit, this amount represents our maximum possible accounting loss if the borrower were to draw upon the full amount of the commitment and then default on payment for the total amount of the then outstanding loan.
73
other off-balance sheet arrangements other off-balance sheet arrangements include financial instruments that do not meet the definition of a guarantee in accordance with the applicable accounting guidance, and other relationships, such as liquidity support provided to asset-backed commercial paper conduits, indemnification agreements and intercompany guarantees. information about such arrangements is provided in note 20 under the heading other off-balance sheet risk.

guarantees we are a guarantor in various agreements with third parties. as guarantor, we may be contingently liable to make payments to the guaranteed party based on changes in a specified interest rate, foreign exchange rate or other
74
variable (including the occurrence or nonoccurrence of a specified event). these variables, known as underlyings, may be related to an asset or liability, or another entitys failure to perform under a contract. additional information regarding these types of arrangements is presented in note 20 under the heading guarantees.
risk management overview like all financial services companies, we engage in business activities and assume the related risks. the most significant risks we face are credit, compliance, operational, capital and liquidity, market, reputation, strategic, and model risks. our risk management activities are focused on ensuring we properly identify, measure, and manage such risks across the entire enterprise to maintain safety and soundness and maximize profitability. certain of these risks are defined and discussed in greater detail in the remainder of this section.
the keycorp board of directors (the board) serves in an oversight capacity ensuring that keys risks are managed in a manner that is effective and balanced and adds value for the shareholders. the board understands keys risk philosophy, approves the risk appetite, inquires about risk practices, reviews the portfolio of risks, compares the actual risks to the risk appetite, and is apprised of significant risks, both actual and emerging, and determines whether management is responding appropriately. the board challenges management and ensures accountability.
the boards audit committee assists the board in oversight of financial statement integrity, regulatory and legal requirements, independent auditors qualifications and independence, and the performance of the internal audit function and independent auditors. the audit committee meets with management and approves significant policies relating to the risk areas overseen by the audit committee. the audit committee has responsibility over all risk review functions, including internal audit, financial reporting, legal matters, and fraud risk. the audit committee also receives reports on enterprise risk. in addition to regularly scheduled bi-monthly meetings, the audit committee convenes to discuss the content of our financial disclosures and quarterly earnings releases.
the boards risk committee assists the board in oversight of strategies, policies, procedures, and practices relating to the assessment and management of enterprise-wide risk, including credit, market, liquidity, model, operational, compliance, reputation, and strategic risks. the risk committee also assists the board in overseeing risks related to capital adequacy, capital planning, and capital actions. the risk committee reviews and provides oversight of managements activities related to the enterprise-wide risk management framework, which includes review of the enterprise risk management (erm) policy, including the risk appetite statement, and management and erm reports, and approval of any material changes to the charter of the erm committee and significant policies relating to risk management.
the audit and risk committees meet jointly, as appropriate, to discuss matters that relate to each committees responsibilities. committee chairpersons routinely meet with management during interim months to plan agendas for upcoming meetings and to discuss emerging trends and events that have transpired since the preceding meeting. all members of the board receive formal reports designed to keep them abreast of significant developments during the interim months.
our erm committee, chaired by the chief executive officer and comprising other senior level executives, is responsible for managing risk and ensuring that the corporate risk profile is managed in a manner consistent with our risk appetite. the erm program encompasses our risk philosophy, policy, framework, and governance structure for the management of risks across the entire company. the erm committee reports to the boards risk committee. annually, the board reviews and approves the erm policy, as well as the risk appetite, including corporate risk tolerances for major risk categories. we use a risk-adjusted capital framework to manage risks. this framework is approved and managed by the erm committee.
75
tier 2 risk governance committees support the erm committee by identifying early warning events and trends, escalating emerging risks, and discussing forward-looking assessments. risk governance committees include attendees from each of the three lines of defense. the first line of defense is the line of business primarily responsible to accept, own, proactively identify, monitor, and manage risk. the second line of defense comprises risk management representatives who provide independent, centralized oversight over all risk categories by aggregating, analyzing, and reporting risk information. risk review provides the third line of defense in their role to provide independent assessment and testing of the effectiveness, appropriateness, and adherence to keycorps risk management policies, practices, and controls.
the chief risk officer ensures that relevant risk information is properly integrated into strategic and business decisions, ensures appropriate ownership of risks, provides input into performance and compensation decisions, assesses aggregate enterprise risk, monitors capabilities to manage critical risks, and executes appropriate board and stakeholder reporting.
federal banking regulators continue to emphasize with financial institutions the importance of relating capital management strategy to the level of risk at each institution. we believe our internal risk management processes help us achieve and maintain capital levels that are commensurate with our business activities and risks, and conform to regulatory expectations.
market risk management market risk is the risk that movements in market risk factors, including interest rates, foreign exchange rates, equity prices, commodity prices, credit spreads, and volatilities will reduce keys income and the value of its portfolios. these factors influence prospective yields, values, or prices associated with the instrument. for example, the value of a fixed-rate bond will decline when market interest rates increase, while the cash flows associated with a variable rate loan will increase when interest rates increase. the holder of a financial instrument is exposed to market risk when either the cash flows or the value of the instrument is tied to such external factors.
we are exposed to market risk both in our trading and nontrading activities, which include asset and liability management activities. our trading positions are carried at fair value with changes recorded in the income statement. these positions are subject to various market-based risk factors that impact the fair value of the financial instruments in the trading category. our traditional banking loan and deposit products as well as long-term debt and certain short-term borrowings are nontrading positions. these positions are generally carried at the principal amount outstanding for assets and the amount owed for liabilities. the nontrading positions are subject to changes in economic value due to varying market conditions, primarily changes in interest rates.
trading market risk key incurs market risk as a result of trading, investing, and client facilitation activities, principally within our investment banking and capital markets business. key has exposures to a wide range of interest rates, equity prices, foreign exchange rates, credit spreads, and commodity prices, as well as the associated implied volatilities and spreads. our primary market risk exposures are a result of trading activities in the derivative and fixed income markets and maintaining positions in these instruments. we maintain modest trading inventories to facilitate customer flow, make markets in securities, and hedge certain risks. the majority of our positions are traded in active markets.
management of trading market risks. market risk management is an integral part of keys risk culture. oversight of trading market risks is governed by the risk committee of our board, the erm committee, and the market risk committee. these committees regularly review and discuss market risk reports prepared by our market risk management group (mrm) that contain our market risk exposures and results of monitoring
76
activities. market risk policies and procedures have been defined and approved by the market risk committee, a tier 2 risk governance committee, and take into account our tolerance for risk and consideration for the business environment.
mrm is an independent risk management function that partners with the lines of business to identify, measure, and monitor market risks throughout our company. mrm is responsible for ensuring transparency of significant market risks, monitoring compliance with established limits, and escalating limit exceptions to appropriate senior management. the various business units and trading desks are responsible for ensuring that market risk exposures are well-managed and prudent. market risk is monitored through various measures, such as var, and through routine stress testing, sensitivity, and scenario analyses. mrm conducts stress tests for each covered position using historical worst case and standard shock scenarios. var, stressed var, and other analyses are prepared daily and distributed to appropriate management.
covered positions. we monitor the market risk of our covered positions, which includes all of our trading positions as well as all foreign exchange and commodity positions, regardless of whether the position is in a trading account. all positions in the trading account are recorded at fair value, and changes in fair value are reflected in our consolidated statements of income. information regarding our fair value policies, procedures and methodologies is provided in note 1 (summary of significant accounting policies) under the heading fair value measurements and note 6 (fair value measurements) in this report. instruments that are used to hedge nontrading activities, such as bank-issued debt and loan portfolios, equity positions that are not actively traded, and securities financing activities, do not meet the definition of a covered position. mrm is responsible for identifying our portfolios as either covered or non-covered. the covered position working group develops the final list of covered positions, and a summary is provided to the market risk committee.
our significant portfolios of covered positions are detailed below. we analyze market risk by portfolios of covered positions, and do not separately measure and monitor our portfolios by risk type. the descriptions below incorporate the respective risk types associated with each of these portfolios.
¿                                           fixed income includes those instruments associated with our capital markets business and the trading of securities as a dealer. these instruments may include positions in municipal bonds, bonds backed by the u.s. government, agency and corporate bonds, certain mortgage-backed securities, securities issued by the u.s. treasury, money markets, and certain cmos. the activities and instruments within the fixed income portfolio create exposures to interest rate and credit spread risks.

¿                interest rate derivatives include interest rate swaps, caps and floors, which are transacted primarily to accommodate the needs of commercial loan clients. in addition, we enter into interest rate derivatives to offset or mitigate the interest rate risk related to the client positions. the activities within this portfolio create exposures to interest rate risk.

¿                            credit derivatives include credit default swaps, which are used to mitigate loan portfolio credit risk, and credit default swap indexes, which are used to manage the credit risk exposure associated with anticipated sales of certain commercial real estate loans. the transactions within the credit derivatives portfolio result in exposure to counterparty credit risk and market risk.

var and stressed var. var is the estimate of the maximum amount of loss on an instrument or portfolio due to adverse market conditions during a given time interval within a stated confidence level. stressed var is used to assess the extreme conditions on market risk within our trading portfolios. mrm calculates var and stressed var on a daily basis, and the results are distributed to appropriate management. var and stressed var results are also provided to our regulators and utilized in regulatory capital calculations.
we use a historical var model to measure the potential adverse effect of changes in interest rates, foreign exchange rates, equity prices, and credit spreads on the fair value of our covered positions. historical scenarios are customized for specific covered positions, and numerous risk factors are incorporated in the calculation.
77
additional consideration is given to the risk factors to estimate the exposures that contain optionality features, such as options and cancelable provisions. var is calculated using daily observations over a one-year time horizon, and approximates a 95% confidence level. statistically, this means that we would expect to incur losses greater than var, on average, five out of 100 trading days, or three to four times each quarter. we also calculate var and stressed var at a 99% confidence level.
the var model is an effective tool in estimating ranges of possible gains and losses on our covered positions. however, there are limitations inherent in the var model since it uses historical results over a given time interval to estimate future performance. historical results may not be indicative of future results, and changes in the market or composition of our portfolios could have a significant impact on the accuracy of the var model. we regularly review and enhance the modeling techniques, inputs and assumptions used. our market risk policy includes the independent validation of our var model by keys risk management group on an annual basis. the model risk management committee oversees the model validation program, and results of validations are discussed with the erm committee.
mrm backtests our var model on a daily basis to evaluate its predictive power. the test compares var model results at the 99% confidence level to observed daily profit and loss. results of backtesting are provided to the market risk committee. backtesting exceptions occur when trading losses exceed var. actual losses did not exceed daily trading var on any day during the quarters ended december 31, 2014, and december 31, 2013.
we do not engage in correlation trading, or utilize the internal model approach for measuring default and credit migration risk. our net var approach incorporates diversification, but our var calculation does not include the impact of counterparty risk and our own credit spreads on derivatives.
the aggregate var at the 99% confidence level for all covered positions was $.9 million at december 31, 2014, and $1.0 million at december 31, 2013. the decrease in aggregate var was primarily due to reduced exposures in credit and interest rate derivatives. figure 31 summarizes our var at the 99% confidence level for significant portfolios of covered positions for the three months ended december 31, 2014, and december 31, 2013.

stressed var is calculated using our general var results at the 99% confidence level and applying certain assumptions. the aggregate stressed var for all covered positions was $2.6 million at december 31, 2014, and $2.9 million at december 31, 2013. figure 32 summarizes our stressed var for significant portfolios of covered positions for the three months ended december 31, 2014, and december 31, 2013, as used for market risk capital charge calculation purposes.

internal capital adequacy assessment. market risk is a component of our internal capital adequacy assessment. our risk-weighted assets include a market risk-equivalent asset position, which consists of a var component, stressed var component, a de minimis exposure amount, and a specific risk add-on, which are added together to arrive at total market risk equivalent assets. specific risk is the price risk of individual financial instruments, which is not accounted for by changes in broad market risk factors and is measured through a standardized approach. specific risk calculations are run quarterly by mrm, and approved by the chief market risk officer.
nontrading market risk most of our nontrading market risk is derived from interest rate fluctuations and its impacts on our traditional loan and deposit products, as well as investments, hedging relationships, long-term debt, and certain short-term borrowings. interest rate risk, which is inherent in the banking industry, is measured by the potential for fluctuations in net interest income and the eve. such fluctuations may result from changes in interest rates and differences in the repricing and maturity characteristics of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities. we manage the exposure to changes in net interest income and the eve in accordance with our risk appetite and within board approved policy limits.
interest rate risk positions are influenced by a number of factors including the balance sheet positioning that arises out of consumer preferences for loan and deposit products, economic conditions, the competitive environment within our markets, and changes in market interest rates that affect client activity and our hedging, investing, funding and capital positions. the primary components of interest rate risk exposure consist of gap risk, basis risk, yield curve risk and option risk.
the management of nontrading market risk is centralized within corporate treasury. oversight and governance is provided by the risk committee of our board, the erm committee and the alco. these committees review reports on the components of interest rate risk described above as well as sensitivity analyses of these exposures. these committees have various responsibilities related to managing nontrading market risk, including recommending, approving, and monitoring strategies that maintain risk positions within approved tolerance ranges. the asset liability management policy provides the framework for the oversight and management of interest rate risk and is administered by the alco. internal and external emerging issues are monitored on a daily basis. the market risk management group, as the second line of defense, provides additional oversight.
¿   gap risk is the exposure to changes in interest rates and occurs when the volume of interest-bearing liabilities and the volume of interest-earning assets they fund (for example, deposits used to fund loans) do not mature or reprice at the same time.

¿   basis risk is the exposure to asymmetrical changes in interest rate indexes and occurs when floating-rate assets and floating-rate liabilities reprice at the same time, but in response to different market factors or indexes.

¿   yield curve risk is the exposure to non-parallel changes in the slope of the yield curve (where the yield curve depicts the relationship between the yield on a particular type of security and its term to maturity) and

79
occurs when interest-bearing liabilities and the interest-earning assets that they fund do not price or reprice to the same term point on the yield curve.

¿                                                 option risk is the exposure to a customer or counterpartys ability to take advantage of the interest rate environment and terminate or reprice one of our assets, liabilities or off-balance sheet instruments prior to contractual maturity without a penalty. option risk occurs when exposures to customer and counterparty early withdrawals or early prepayments are not mitigated with an offsetting position or appropriate compensation.

net interest income simulation analysis. the primary tool we use to measure our interest rate risk is simulation analysis. for purposes of this analysis, we estimate our net interest income based on the current and projected composition of our on- and off-balance sheet positions, accounting for recent and anticipated trends in customer activity. the analysis also incorporates assumptions for the current and projected interest rate environments, including a most likely macro-economic scenario. simulation modeling assumes that residual risk exposures will be managed to within the risk appetite.
we measure the amount of net interest income at risk by simulating the change in net interest income that would occur if the federal funds target rate were to gradually increase or decrease over the next 12 months, and term rates were to move in a similar fashion. our standard rate scenarios encompass a gradual increase or decrease of 200 basis points, but due to the low interest rate environment, we have modified the standard to a gradual decrease of 25 basis points over two months with no change over the following ten months. after calculating the amount of net interest income at risk to interest rate changes, we compare that amount with the base case of an unchanged interest rate environment. we also perform regular stress tests and sensitivities on the model inputs that could materially change the resulting risk assessments. one set of stress tests and sensitivities assesses the effect of interest rate inputs on simulated exposures. assessments are performed using different shapes of the yield curve, including a sustained flat yield curve, an inverted slope yield curve, changes in credit spreads, an immediate parallel change in market interest rates, and changes in the relationship of money market interest rates. another set of stress tests and sensitivities assesses the effect of loan and deposit assumptions and assumed discretionary strategies on simulated exposures. assessments are performed on changes to the following assumptions: the pricing of deposits without contractual maturities; changes in lending spreads; prepayments on loans and securities; other loan and deposit balance shifts; investment, funding and hedging activities; and liquidity and capital management strategies.
simulation analysis produces only a sophisticated estimate of interest rate exposure based on judgments related to assumption inputs into the simulation model. we tailor assumptions to the specific interest rate environment and yield curve shape being modeled, and validate those assumptions on a regular basis. our simulations are performed with the assumption that interest rate risk positions will be actively managed through the use of on- and off-balance sheet financial instruments to achieve the desired residual risk profile. however, actual results may differ from those derived in simulation analysis due to unanticipated changes to the balance sheet composition, customer behavior, product pricing, market interest rates, investment, funding and hedging activities, and repercussions from unanticipated or unknown events.
figure 33 presents the results of the simulation analysis at december 31, 2014, and december 31, 2013. at december 31, 2014, our simulated exposure to changes in interest rates was moderately asset sensitive, and net interest income would benefit over time from either an increase in short-term or intermediate-term interest rates. tolerance levels for risk management require the development of remediation plans to maintain residual risk within tolerance if simulation modeling demonstrates that a gradual increase or decrease in short-term interest rates over the next 12 months would adversely affect net interest income over the same period by more than 4%. as shown in figure 33, we are operating within these levels as of december 31, 2014.

the results of additional sensitivity analysis of alternate interest rate paths and loan and deposit behavior assumptions indicates that net interest income could increase or decrease from the base simulation results presented in figure 33. net interest income is highly dependent on the timing, magnitude, frequency, and path of interest rate increases and the associated assumptions for deposit repricing relationships, lending spreads, and the balance behavior of transaction accounts. the unprecedented low level of interest rates increases the uncertainty of assumptions for deposit balance behavior and deposit repricing relationships to market interest rates. our historical deposit repricing betas in the last rising rate cycle ranged between 50% and 60% for interest-bearing deposits, and we continue to make similar assumptions in our modeling. the sensitivity testing of these assumptions supports our confidence that actual results are likely to be within a 75 basis point range of modeled results.
key will continue to monitor balance sheet flows and expects the benefit from rising rates to increase modestly prior to any increase in the federal funds rate. our current interest rate risk position could fluctuate to higher or lower levels of risk depending on the competitive environment and client behavior that may affect the actual volume, mix, maturity, and repricing characteristics of loan and deposit flows. as changes occur to both the configuration of the balance sheet and the outlook for the economy, management proactively evaluates hedging opportunities that may change our interest rate risk profile.
we also conduct simulations that measure the effect of changes in market interest rates in the second and third years of a three-year horizon. these simulations are conducted in a manner similar to those based on a 12-month horizon. to capture longer-term exposures, we calculate exposures to changes to the eve as discussed in the following section.
economic value of equity modeling. eve complements net interest income simulation analysis as it estimates risk exposure beyond 12-, 24-, and 36-month horizons. eve modeling measures the extent to which the economic values of assets, liabilities and off-balance sheet instruments may change in response to fluctuations in interest rates. eve is calculated by subjecting the balance sheet to an immediate 200 basis point increase or decrease in interest rates, measuring the resulting change in the values of assets, liabilities and off-balance sheet instruments, and comparing those amounts with the base case of an unchanged interest rate environment. because the calculation of eve under an immediate 200 basis point decrease in interest rates in the current low rate environment results in certain interest rates declining to zero and a less than 200 basis point decrease in certain yield curve term points, we have modified the standard declining rate scenario to an immediate 100 basis point decrease. this analysis is highly dependent upon assumptions applied to assets and liabilities with non-contractual maturities. those assumptions are based on historical behaviors, as well as our expectations. we develop remediation plans that would maintain residual risk within tolerance if this analysis indicates that our eve will decrease by more than 15% in response to an immediate increase or decrease in interest rates. we are operating within these guidelines as of december 31, 2014.
management of interest rate exposure. we use the results of our various interest rate risk analyses to formulate a/lm strategies to achieve the desired risk profile while managing to our objectives for capital adequacy and
81
liquidity risk exposures. specifically, we manage interest rate risk positions by purchasing securities, issuing term debt with floating or fixed interest rates, and using derivatives  predominantly in the form of interest rate swaps, which modify the interest rate characteristics of certain assets and liabilities.
figure 34 shows all swap positions that we hold for a/lm purposes. these positions are used to convert the contractual interest rate index of agreed-upon amounts of assets and liabilities (i.e., notional amounts) to another interest rate index. for example, fixed-rate debt is converted to a floating rate through a receive fixed/pay variable interest rate swap. the volume, maturity and mix of portfolio swaps change frequently as we adjust our broader a/lm objectives and the balance sheet positions to be hedged. for more information about how we use interest rate swaps to manage our risk profile, see note 8 (derivatives and hedging activities).

liquidity risk management liquidity risk, which is inherent in the banking industry, is measured by our ability to accommodate liability maturities and deposit withdrawals, meet contractual obligations, and fund new business opportunities at a reasonable cost, in a timely manner and without adverse consequences. liquidity management involves maintaining sufficient and diverse sources of funding to accommodate planned, as well as unanticipated, changes in assets and liabilities under both normal and adverse conditions.
governance structure we manage liquidity for all of our affiliates on an integrated basis. this approach considers the unique funding sources available to each entity, as well as each entitys capacity to manage through adverse conditions. the approach also recognizes that adverse market conditions or other events that could negatively affect the availability or cost of liquidity will affect the access of all affiliates to sufficient wholesale funding.
the management of consolidated liquidity risk is centralized within corporate treasury. oversight and governance is provided by the board of directors, the erm committee, the alco, and the chief risk officer. the asset liability management policy provides the framework for the oversight and management of liquidity risk and is administered by the alco. the market risk management group, as the second line of defense, provides additional oversight. our current liquidity risk management practices are in compliance with the federal reserve boards enhanced prudential standards.
these committees regularly review liquidity and funding summaries, liquidity trends, peer comparisons, variance analyses, liquidity projections, hypothetical funding erosion stress tests and goal tracking reports. the reviews generate a discussion of positions, trends and directives on liquidity risk and shape a number of our decisions. when liquidity pressure is elevated, positions are monitored more closely and reporting is more intensive. to ensure that emerging issues are identified, we also communicate with individuals inside and outside of the company on a daily basis.
82
factors affecting liquidity our liquidity could be adversely affected by both direct and indirect events. an example of a direct event would be a downgrade in our public credit ratings by a rating agency. examples of indirect events (events unrelated to us) that could impair our access to liquidity would be an act of terrorism or war, natural disasters, political events, or the default or bankruptcy of a major corporation, mutual fund or hedge fund. similarly, market speculation, or rumors about us or the banking industry in general, may adversely affect the cost and availability of normal funding sources.
our credit ratings at december 31, 2014, are shown in figure 35. we believe these credit ratings, under normal conditions in the capital markets, will enable the parent company or keybank to issue fixed income securities to investors.

we regularly monitor our liquidity position and funding sources and measure our capacity to obtain funds in a variety of hypothetical scenarios in an effort to maintain an appropriate mix of available and affordable funding. in the normal course of business, we perform a monthly hypothetical funding erosion stress test for both keycorp and keybank. in a heightened monitoring mode, we may conduct the hypothetical funding erosion stress tests more frequently, and use assumptions to reflect the changed market environment. our testing incorporates estimates for loan and deposit lives based on our historical studies. erosion stress tests analyze potential liquidity scenarios under various funding constraints and time periods. ultimately, they determine the periodic effects that major direct and indirect events would have on our access to funding markets and our ability to fund our normal operations. to compensate for the effect of these assumed liquidity pressures, we consider alternative sources of liquidity and maturities over different time periods to project how funding needs would be managed.
we maintain a contingency funding plan that outlines the process for addressing a liquidity crisis. the plan provides for an evaluation of funding sources under various market conditions. it also assigns specific roles and responsibilities for managing liquidity through a problem period. as part of the plan, we maintain a liquidity reserve through balances in our liquid asset portfolio. during a problem period, that reserve could be used as a source of funding to provide time to develop and execute a longer-term strategy. the liquid asset portfolio at
83
december 31, 2014, totaled $15 billion, consisting of $10.4 billion of unpledged securities, $799 million of securities available for secured funding at the federal home loan bank of cincinnati (fhlb), and $3.8 billion of net balances of federal funds sold and balances in our federal reserve account. the liquid asset portfolio can fluctuate due to excess liquidity, heightened risk, or prefunding of expected outflows, such as debt maturities. additionally, as of december 31, 2014, our unused borrowing capacity secured by loan collateral was $18.7 billion at the federal reserve bank of cleveland and $2.8 billion at the fhlb. in 2014, keys outstanding fhlb advances decreased by $24 million due to repayments.
final u.s. liquidity coverage ratio under the liquidity coverage rules, we will be required to calculate the modified lcr. implementation for modified lcr banking organizations, like key, will begin on january 1, 2016, with a minimum requirement of 90% coverage, reaching 100% coverage by january 1, 2017. throughout december 2014, our estimated modified lcr was approximately in the mid-80% range. to reach the minimum of 90% by january 1, 2016, and to operate with a cushion above the minimum required level, we may change the composition of our investment portfolio, increase the size of the overall investment portfolio, and modify product offerings.
additional information about the liquidity coverage ratio is included in the supervision and regulation section under the heading u.s. implementation of the basel iii liquidity framework in item 1 of this report.
long-term liquidity strategy our long-term liquidity strategy is to be predominantly funded by core deposits. however, we may use wholesale funds to sustain an adequate liquid asset portfolio, meet daily cash demands, and allow management flexibility to execute business initiatives. keys client-based relationship strategy provides for a strong core deposit base which, in conjunction with intermediate and long-term wholesale funds managed to a diversified maturity structure and investor base, supports our liquidity risk management strategy. we use the loan-to-deposit ratio as a metric to monitor these strategies. our target loan-to-deposit ratio is 90-100% (at december 31, 2014, our loan-to-deposit ratio was 85%), which we calculate as total loans, loans held for sale, and nonsecuritized discontinued loans divided by domestic deposits.
sources of liquidity our primary sources of liquidity include customer deposits, wholesale funding and liquid assets. if the cash flows needed to support operating and investing activities are not satisfied by deposit balances, we rely on wholesale funding or liquid assets. conversely, excess cash generated by operating, investing and deposit-gathering activities may be used to repay outstanding debt or invest in liquid assets.
liquidity programs we have several liquidity programs, which are described in note 18 (long-term debt), that are designed to enable the parent company and keybank to raise funds in the public and private debt markets. the proceeds from most of these programs can be used for general corporate purposes, including acquisitions. these liquidity programs are reviewed from time to time by the board of directors and are renewed and replaced as necessary. there are no restrictive financial covenants in any of these programs. during the second quarter of 2014, the keycorp shelf registration statement on file with the sec, including the medium-term note program, was updated. in connection with the updated medium-term note program, the board of directors authorized keycorp to issue up to $4 billion of debt, and revoked all prior issuance authority under previous keycorp shelf registration statements including through previous medium-term note programs.
in 2014, keys aggregate outstanding note balance, net of unamortized discounts and adjustments related to hedging with derivative financial instruments was unchanged. on july 1, 2014, $750 million of subordinated bank debt matured. on november 24, 2014, $750 million of 2.50% senior notes due 2019 were issued.

liquidity for keycorp the primary source of liquidity for keycorp is from subsidiary dividends, primarily from keybank. keycorp has sufficient liquidity when it can service its debt; support customary corporate operations and activities (including acquisitions); support occasional guarantees of subsidiaries obligations in transactions with third parties at a reasonable cost, in a timely manner, and without adverse consequences; and pay dividends to shareholders.
we use a parent cash coverage months metric as the primary measure to assess parent company liquidity. the parent cash coverage months metric measures the months into the future where projected obligations can be met with the current amount of liquidity to meet all projected obligations. we generally issue term debt to supplement dividends from keybank to manage our liquidity position at or above our targeted levels. the parent company generally maintains cash and short-term investments in an amount sufficient to meet projected debt maturities over at least the next 24 months. at december 31, 2014, keycorp held $2.2 billion in short-term investments, which we projected to be sufficient to meet our projected obligations, including the repayment of our maturing debt obligations for the periods prescribed by our risk tolerance.
typically, keycorp meets its liquidity requirements through regular dividends from keybank, supplemented with term debt. federal banking law limits the amount of capital distributions that a bank can make to its holding company without prior regulatory approval. a national banks dividend-paying capacity is affected by several factors, including net profits (as defined by statute) for the two previous calendar years and for the current year, up to the date of dividend declaration. during 2014, keybank paid keycorp $300 million in dividends; nonbank subsidiaries did not pay any cash dividends or noncash dividends to keycorp. keycorp did not make any capital infusions to keybank during 2014. as of december 31, 2014, keybank had $935 million of capacity to pay dividends to keycorp.
our liquidity position and recent activity over the past 12 months our liquid asset portfolio, which includes overnight and short-term investments, as well as unencumbered, high quality liquid securities held as protection against a range of potential liquidity stress scenarios, has increased as a result of net customer loan and deposit flows and an increase in unpledged securities. the liquid asset portfolio continues to exceed the amount that we estimate would be necessary to manage through an adverse liquidity event by providing sufficient time to develop and execute a longer-term solution.
from time to time, keycorp or keybank may seek to retire, repurchase or exchange outstanding debt, capital securities, preferred shares or common shares through cash purchase, privately negotiated transactions or other means. additional information on repurchases of common shares by keycorp is included in part ii, item 5. market for the registrants common equity, related stockholder matters and issuer purchases of equity securities of this report. such transactions depend on prevailing market conditions, our liquidity and capital requirements, contractual restrictions, regulatory requirements and other factors. the amounts involved may be material, individually or collectively.
we generate cash flows from operations and from investing and financing activities. we have approximately $195 million of cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments in international tax jurisdictions as of december 31, 2014. as we consider alternative long-term strategic and liquidity plans, opportunities to repatriate these amounts would result in approximately $7 million in taxes to be paid. if we were to cease operations in all international tax jurisdictions, the total amount of taxes to be paid would increase to approximately $11 million. accordingly, we have included the total amount as a deferred tax liability at december 31, 2014.
the consolidated statements of cash flows summarize our sources and uses of cash by type of activity for the years ended december 31, 2014, and december 31, 2013.
85
credit risk management credit risk is the risk of loss to us arising from an obligors inability or failure to meet contractual payment or performance terms. like other financial services institutions, we make loans, extend credit, purchase securities, and enter into financial derivative contracts, all of which have related credit risk.
credit policy, approval, and evaluation we manage credit risk exposure through a multifaceted program. the credit risk committee approves both retail and commercial credit policies. these policies are communicated throughout the organization to foster a consistent approach to granting credit.
our credit risk management team is responsible for credit approval, is independent of our lines of business, and consists of senior officers who have extensive experience in structuring and approving loans. only credit risk management members are authorized to grant significant exceptions to credit policies. it is not unusual to make exceptions to established policies when mitigating circumstances dictate, but most major lending units have been assigned specific thresholds to keep exceptions at an acceptable level based upon portfolio and economic considerations.
loan grades are assigned at the time of origination, verified by the credit risk management team and periodically reevaluated thereafter. most extensions of credit are subject to loan grading or scoring. this risk rating methodology blends our judgment with quantitative modeling. commercial loans generally are assigned two internal risk ratings. the first rating reflects the probability that the borrower will default on an obligation; the second rating reflects expected recovery rates on the credit facility. default probability is determined based on, among other factors, the financial strength of the borrower, an assessment of the borrowers management, the borrowers competitive position within its industry sector, and our view of industry risk within the context of the general economic outlook. types of exposure, transaction structure and collateral, including credit risk mitigants, affect the expected recovery assessment.
our credit risk management team uses risk models to evaluate consumer loans. these models, known as scorecards, forecast the probability of serious delinquency and default for an applicant. the scorecards are embedded in the application processing system, which allows for real-time scoring and automated decisions for many of our products. we periodically validate the loan grading and scoring processes.
we maintain an active concentration management program to encourage diversification in our credit portfolios. for individual obligors, we employ a sliding scale of exposure, known as hold limits, which is dictated by the strength of the borrower. our legal lending limit is approximately $1.6 billion for any individual borrower. however, internal hold limits generally restrict the largest exposures to less than 20% of that amount. as of december 31, 2014, we had five client relationships with loan commitments net of credit default swaps of more than $200 million. the average amount outstanding on these five individual net obligor commitments was $43 million at december 31, 2014. in general, our philosophy is to maintain a diverse portfolio with regard to credit exposures.
we actively manage the overall loan portfolio in a manner consistent with asset quality objectives and concentration risk tolerances to mitigate credit risk. we utilize credit default swaps on a limited basis to transfer a portion of the credit risk associated with a particular extension of credit to a third party. at december 31, 2014, we used credit default swaps with a notional amount of $309 million to manage the credit risk associated with specific commercial lending obligations. we may also sell credit derivatives  primarily single name credit default swaps  to offset our purchased credit default swap position prior to maturity. at december 31, 2014, we had sold credit default swaps outstanding with a total notional amount of $5 million.
credit default swaps are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value. related gains or losses, as well as the premium paid or received for credit protection, are included in the corporate services income and other income components of noninterest income.
86
we may also manage the loan portfolio using portfolio swaps and bulk purchases and sales. our overarching goal is to manage the loan portfolio within a specified range of asset quality.
allowance for loan and lease losses at december 31, 2014, the alll was $794 million, or 1.38% of period-end loans, compared to $848 million, or 1.56%, at december 31, 2013. the allowance includes $40 million that was specifically allocated for impaired loans of $302 million at december 31, 2014, compared to $42 million that was allocated for impaired loans of $358 million one year ago. for more information about impaired loans, see note 5 (asset quality). at december 31, 2014, the alll was 190.0% of nonperforming loans, compared to 166.9% at december 31, 2013.

we estimate the appropriate level of the alll on at least a quarterly basis. the methodology used is described in note 1 (summary of significant accounting policies) under the heading allowance for loan and lease losses. briefly, our general allowance applies expected loss rates to existing loans with similar risk characteristics. we exercise judgment to assess any adjustment to the expected loss rates for the impact of factors such as changes in economic conditions, lending policies including underwriting standards, and the level of credit risk associated with specific industries and markets.
for all commercial and consumer loan tdrs, regardless of size, as well as impaired commercial loans with an outstanding balance of $2.5 million and greater, we conduct further analysis to determine the probable loss content and assign a specific allowance to the loan if deemed appropriate. we estimate the extent of the individual impairment for commercial loans and tdrs by comparing the recorded investment of the loan with the estimated present value of its future cash flows, the fair value of its underlying collateral, or the loans observable market price. secured consumer loan tdrs that are discharged through chapter 7 bankruptcy and not formally re-affirmed are adjusted to reflect the fair value of the underlying collateral, less costs to sell. other consumer loan tdrs are combined in homogenous pools and assigned a specific allocation based on the estimated present value of future cash flows using the effective interest rate. a specific allowance also may be assigned  even when sources of repayment appear sufficient  if we remain uncertain about whether the loan will be repaid in full. on at least a quarterly basis, we evaluate the appropriateness of our loss estimation methods to reduce differences between estimated incurred losses and actual losses. the alll at december 31, 2014, represents our best estimate of the probable credit losses inherent in the loan portfolio at that date.

as shown in figure 37, our alll decreased by $54 million, or 6.4%, during the past 12 months. this contraction is directly associated with the improvement in credit quality of the loan portfolio. the quality of new loan originations and decreasing levels of criticized, classified, and nonperforming loans and net loan charge-offs has resulted in a reduction in our general allowance. our delinquency trends have declined during the past 12 months due to a modest level of loan growth, relatively stable economic conditions, and continued run-off in our exit loan portfolio reflecting our effort to maintain a moderate enterprise risk tolerance. our liability for credit losses on lending-related commitments was $36 million at december 31, 2014. when combined with our alll, our total allowance for credit losses represented 1.45% of period-end loans at december 31, 2014, compared to 1.63% at december 31, 2013.

our provision (credit) for loan and lease losses was $59 million for 2014, compared to $130 million for 2013. our net loan charge-offs were $113 million for 2014, compared to $168 million for 2013. the decrease in our provision is due to continued improvement in credit quality experienced in most of our loan portfolios. additionally, we continue to reduce our exposure in our higher-risk businesses, including the residential properties portion of our construction loan portfolio, marine/rv financing, and other selected leasing portfolios through the sale of certain loans, payments from borrowers, or net loan charge-offs.
credit quality on our oil and gas loan portfolio, which represents 2% of total loans at december 31, 2014, remains solid, with net loan charge-offs lower than those on our overall portfolio. our alll reflects the estimated impact of current oil prices at december 31, 2014.
net loan charge-offs net loan charge-offs for 2014 totaled $113 million, or .20% of average loans, compared to net loan charge-offs of $168 million, or .32%, for the same period last year. figure 38 shows the trend in our net loan charge-offs by loan type, while the composition of loan charge-offs and recoveries by type of loan is presented in figure 39.
over the past 12 months, net loan charge-offs decreased $55 million. this decrease is attributable to continued improvement in asset quality as reflected in the asset quality statistics shown in figure 40. as shown in figure 41, our exit loan portfolio contributed a total of $13 million in net loan charge-offs for 2014. net loan charge-offs for 2013 in our exit loan portfolio were $17 million. the decrease in net loan charge-offs in our exit loan portfolio was primarily driven by lower levels of net loan charge offs in the consumer exit loan portfolios during 2014.

(d)                                        restructured loans (i.e., tdrs) are those for which key, for reasons related to a borrowers financial difficulties, grants a concession to the borrower that it would not otherwise consider. these concessions are made to improve the collectability of the loan and generally take the form of a reduction of the interest rate, extension of the maturity date or reduction in the principal balance.

as shown in figure 40, nonperforming assets decreased during 2014, having declined for the past five years. most of the reduction came from nonperforming loans in our consumer and commercial loan portfolios. as

operational risk also encompasses compliance risk, which is the risk of loss from violations of, or noncompliance with, laws, rules and regulations, prescribed practices, and ethical standards. under the dodd-frank act, large financial companies like key are subject to heightened prudential standards and regulation due to their systemic importance. this heightened level of regulation has increased our operational risk. we have created work teams to respond to and analyze the regulatory requirements that have been or will be promulgated as a result of the enactment of the dodd-frank act. resulting operational risk losses and/or additional regulatory compliance costs could take the form of explicit charges, increased operational costs, harm to our reputation, or foregone opportunities.
we seek to mitigate operational risk through identification and measurement of risk, alignment of business strategies with risk appetite and tolerance, and a system of internal controls and reporting. we continuously strive to strengthen our system of internal controls to improve the oversight of our operational risk and to ensure compliance with laws, rules, and regulations. for example, an operational event database tracks the amounts and sources of operational risk and losses. this tracking mechanism helps to identify weaknesses and to highlight the need to take corrective action. we also rely upon software programs designed to assist in assessing operational risk and monitoring our control processes. this technology has enhanced the reporting of the effectiveness of our controls to senior management and the board.
the operational risk management program provides the framework for the structure, governance, roles, and responsibilities, as well as the content, to manage operational risk for key. primary responsibility for managing

and monitoring internal control mechanisms lies with the managers of our various lines of business. the operational risk committee, a senior management committee, oversees our level of operational risk and directs and supports our operational infrastructure and related activities. this committee and the operational risk management function are an integral part of our erm program. our risk review function periodically assesses the overall effectiveness of our operational risk management program and our system of internal controls. risk review reports the results of reviews on internal controls and systems to senior management and the audit committee and independently supports the audit committees oversight of these controls.
cybersecurity we devote significant time and resources to maintaining and regularly updating our technology systems and processes to protect the security of our computer systems, software, networks, and other technology assets against attempts by third parties to obtain unauthorized access to confidential information, destroy data, disrupt or degrade service, sabotage systems, or cause other damage. we and many other u.s. financial institutions have experienced distributed denial-of-service attacks from technologically sophisticated third parties. these attacks are intended to disrupt or disable consumer online banking services and prevent banking transactions. we also periodically experience other attempts to breach the security of our systems and data. these cyberattacks have not, to date, resulted in any material disruption of our operations, material harm to our customers, and have not had a material adverse effect on our results of operations.
cyberattack risks may also occur with our third-party technology service providers, and may interfere with their ability to fulfill their contractual obligations to us, with attendant potential for financial loss or liability that could adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations. recent high-profile cyberattacks have targeted retailers and other businesses for the purpose of acquiring the confidential information (including personal, financial, and credit card information) of customers, some of whom are customers of ours. we may incur expenses related to the investigation of such attacks or related to the protection of our customers from identity theft as a result of such attacks. risks and exposures related to cyberattacks are expected to remain high for the foreseeable future due to the rapidly evolving nature and sophistication of these threats, as well as due to the expanding use of internet banking, mobile banking, and other technology-based products and services by us and our clients.
fourth quarter results figure 45 shows our financial performance for each of the past eight quarters. highlights of our results for the fourth quarter of 2014 are summarized below.
earnings our fourth quarter net income from continuing operations attributable to key common shareholders was $246 million, or $.28 per common share, compared to $229 million, or $.26 per common share, for the fourth quarter of 2013.
on an annualized basis, our return on average total assets from continuing operations for the fourth quarter of 2014 was 1.12%, compared to 1.08% for the fourth quarter of 2013. the annualized return on average common equity from continuing operations was 9.50% for the fourth quarter of 2014, compared to 9.10% for the year-ago quarter.
net interest income our taxable-equivalent net interest income was $588 million for the fourth quarter of 2014, and the net interest margin was 2.94%. these results compare to taxable-equivalent net interest income of $589 million and a net interest margin of 3.01% for the fourth quarter of 2013. the decrease in net interest margin was largely attributable to lower earning asset yields and higher levels of excess liquidity driven by commercial deposit growth.
94
noninterest income our noninterest income was $490 million for the fourth quarter of 2014, compared to $453 million for the year-ago quarter. the fourth quarter reflects a record high quarter for investment banking and debt placement fees, which increased $42 million, benefiting from our business model. trust and investment services income increased $14 million, mostly due to a full-quarter impact of the recently-acquired pacific crest securities. corporate services income also increased $13 million, driven by higher derivatives income and non-yield loan fees. these increases were partially offset by declines in other income of $12 million, mortgage servicing fees of $11 million, and operating lease income and other leasing gains of $11 million.
noninterest expense our noninterest expense was $704 million for the fourth quarter of 2014, compared to $712 million for the same period last year. this decline reflects lower efficiency- and pension-related charges and other expense. these decreases were slightly offset by higher incentive compensation expense related to the performance of our business and a full-quarter impact of the recently-acquired pacific crest securities.
provision for loan and lease losses our provision for loan and lease losses was $22 million for the fourth quarter of 2014, compared to $19 million for the year-ago quarter. our alll was $794 million, or 1.38% of total period-end loans, at december 31, 2014, compared to $848 million, or 1.56%, at december 31, 2013.
net loan charge-offs for the fourth quarter of 2014 totaled $32 million, or .22% of average loans, compared to $37 million, or .27%, for the same period last year.
income taxes for the fourth quarter of 2014, we recorded a tax provision from continuing operations of $94 million, compared to a tax provision of $70 million for the fourth quarter of 2013. the effective tax rate for the fourth quarter of 2014 was 27.2%, compared to 23% for the same quarter one year ago, due to an increase in pre-tax income.

(a)                                                     in april 2009, we decided to wind down the operations of austin, a subsidiary that specialized in managing hedge fund investments for institutional customers. in september 2009, we decided to discontinue the education lending business conducted through key education resources, the education payment and financing unit of keybank. in february 2013, we decided to sell victory to a private equity fund.

as a result of these decisions, we have accounted for these businesses as discontinued operations. for further discussion regarding the income (loss) from discontinued operations, see note 13
(acquisitions and discontinued operations).

(b)   eps may not foot due to rounding.

(c)   assumes conversion of common share options and other stock awards and/or convertible preferred stock, as applicable.

tangible common equity, tier 1 common equity, and cash efficiency. the table reconciles the gaap performance measures to the corresponding non-gaap measures, which provides a basis for period-to-period comparisons.

(e)   represents period-end consolidated total loans and loans held for sale (excluding education loans in securitizations trusts for periods prior to september 30,

critical accounting policies and estimates our business is dynamic and complex. consequently, we must exercise judgment in choosing and applying accounting policies and methodologies. these choices are critical; not only are they necessary to comply with gaap, they also reflect our view of the appropriate way to record and report our overall financial performance. all accounting policies are important, and all policies described in note 1 (summary of significant accounting policies) should be reviewed for a greater understanding of how we record and report our financial performance.
in our opinion, some accounting policies are more likely than others to have a critical effect on our financial results and to expose those results to potentially greater volatility. these policies apply to areas of relatively greater business importance, or require us to exercise judgment and to make assumptions and estimates that affect amounts reported in the financial statements. because these assumptions and estimates are based on current circumstances, they may prove to be inaccurate, or we may find it necessary to change them.
as described below, we rely heavily on the use of judgment, assumptions and estimates to make a number of core decisions. we have reviewed these critical accounting estimates and related disclosures with the audit committee.
allowance for loan and lease losses the loan portfolio is the largest category of assets on our balance sheet. we consider a variety of data to determine probable losses incurred in the loan portfolio and to establish an allowance that is sufficient to absorb those losses. for example, we apply expected loss rates to existing loans with similar risk characteristics and exercise judgment to assess the impact of factors such as changes in economic conditions, underwriting standards, and concentrations of credit. other considerations include expected cash flows and estimated collateral values.
for all commercial and consumer tdrs, regardless of size, as well as all other impaired commercial loans with an outstanding balances of $2.5 million or greater, we conduct further analysis to determine the probable loss and assign a specific allowance to the loan if deemed appropriate. for example, a specific allowance may be assigned  even when sources of repayment appear sufficient  if we remain uncertain that an impaired loan will be repaid in full.
we continually assess the risk profile of the loan portfolio and adjust the alll when appropriate. the economic and business climate in any given industry or market is difficult to gauge and can change rapidly, and the effects of those changes can vary by borrower. however, since our total loan portfolio is well diversified in many respects, and the risk profile of certain segments of the loan portfolio may be improving while the risk profile of others is deteriorating, we may decide to change the level of the allowance for one segment of the portfolio without changing it for any other segment.
in addition to adjusting the alll to reflect market conditions, we also may adjust the allowance because of unique events that are likely to cause actual losses to vary abruptly and significantly from expected losses. for example, class action lawsuits brought against an industry segment (e.g., one that used asbestos in its product) can cause a precipitous deterioration in the risk profile of borrowers doing business in that segment. conversely, the dismissal of such lawsuits can improve the risk profile. in either case, historical loss rates for that industry segment would not have provided a precise basis for determining the appropriate level of allowance.
99
even minor changes in the level of estimated losses can significantly affect managements determination of the appropriate allowance because those changes must be applied across a large portfolio. to illustrate, an increase in estimated losses equal to one-tenth of one percent of our consumer loan portfolio as of december 31, 2014, would indicate the need for a $16 million increase in the allowance. the same increase in estimated losses for the commercial loan portfolio would result in a $41 million increase in the allowance. such adjustments to the alll can materially affect financial results. following the above examples, a $16 million increase in the consumer loan portfolio allowance would have reduced our earnings on an after-tax basis by approximately $10 million, or $.01 per common share; a $41 million increase in the commercial loan portfolio allowance would have reduced earnings on an after-tax basis by approximately $26 million, or $.03 per common share.
as we make decisions regarding the allowance, we benefit from a lengthy organizational history and experience with credit evaluations and related outcomes. nonetheless, if our underlying assumptions later prove to be inaccurate, the alll would likely need to be adjusted, possibly having an adverse effect on our results of operations.
our accounting policy related to the allowance is disclosed in note 1 under the heading allowance for loan and lease losses.
valuation methodologies we follow the applicable accounting guidance for fair value measurements and disclosures, which defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value, and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. in the absence of quoted market prices, we determine the fair value of our assets and liabilities using internally developed models, which are based on third-party data as well as our judgment, assumptions and estimates regarding credit quality, liquidity, interest rates and other relevant market available inputs. we describe our application of this accounting guidance, the process used to determine fair values, and the fair value hierarchy in note 1 under the heading fair value measurements, and in note 6 (fair value measurements).
valuation methodologies often involve significant judgment, particularly when there are no observable active markets for the items being valued. to determine the values of assets and liabilities, as well as the extent to which related assets may be impaired, we make assumptions and estimates related to discount rates, asset returns, prepayment rates and other factors. the use of different discount rates or other valuation assumptions could produce significantly different results. the outcomes of valuations that we perform have a direct bearing on the recorded amounts of assets and liabilities, including loans held for sale, principal investments, goodwill, and pension and other postretirement benefit obligations.
at december 31, 2014, $15.1 billion, or 16%, of our total assets were measured at fair value on a recurring basis. substantially all of these assets were classified as level 1 or level 2 within the fair value hierarchy. at december 31, 2014, $1.2 billion, or 1%, of our total liabilities were measured at fair value on a recurring basis. substantially all of these liabilities were classified as level 1 or level 2.
at december 31, 2014, $18 million, or less than 1%, of our total assets were measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis. all of these assets were classified as level 3. at december 31, 2014, there were no liabilities measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis.
a discussion of the valuation methodology applied to our loans held for sale is included in note 1 under the heading loans held for sale.
our principal investments include direct and indirect investments, predominantly in privately-held companies. the fair values of these investments are determined by considering a number of factors, including the target companys financial condition and results of operations, values of public companies in comparable businesses, market liquidity, and the nature and duration of resale restrictions. the fair value of principal investments was
100
$406 million at december 31, 2014. a 10% positive or negative variance in that fair value would have increased or decreased our 2014 earnings by approximately $41 million ($25 million after tax, or $.03 per common share).
the valuation and testing methodologies used in our analysis of goodwill impairment are summarized in note 1 under the heading goodwill and other intangible assets. accounting guidance that was effective for us on january 1, 2012, permits an entity to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether additional goodwill impairment testing is required. we did not choose to utilize this qualitative assessment in our annual goodwill impairment testing in the fourth quarter of 2014. therefore, the first step in testing for impairment is to determine the fair value of each reporting unit. our reporting units for purposes of this testing are our two major business segments: key community bank and key corporate bank. fair values are estimated using comparable external market data (market approach) and discounted cash flow modeling that incorporates an appropriate risk premium and earnings forecast information (income approach). we believe the estimates and assumptions used in the goodwill impairment analysis for our reporting units are reasonable. however, if actual results and market conditions differ from the assumptions or estimates used, the fair value of each reporting unit could change in the future.
the second step of impairment testing is necessary only if the carrying amount of either reporting unit exceeds its fair value, suggesting goodwill impairment. in such a case, we would estimate a hypothetical purchase price for the reporting unit (representing the units fair value) and then compare that hypothetical purchase price with the fair value of the units net assets (excluding goodwill). any excess of the estimated purchase price over the fair value of the reporting units net assets represents the implied fair value of goodwill. an impairment loss would be recognized as a charge to earnings if the carrying amount of the reporting units goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of goodwill. we continue to monitor the impairment indicators for goodwill and other intangible assets, and to evaluate the carrying amount of these assets quarterly. the acquisition of pacific crest securities during the third quarter of 2014 resulted in a $78 million increase in the goodwill at the key corporate bank unit. at december 31, 2014, the key community bank reporting unit had $979 million in goodwill and the key corporate bank reporting unit had $78 million in goodwill. additional information is provided in note 10 (goodwill and other intangible assets).
the primary assumptions used in determining our pension and other postretirement benefit obligations and related expenses, including sensitivity analysis of these assumptions, are presented in note 16 (employee benefits).
when potential asset impairment is identified, we must exercise judgment to determine the nature of the potential impairment (i.e., temporary or other-than-temporary) to apply the appropriate accounting treatment. for example, unrealized losses on securities available for sale that are deemed temporary are recorded in shareholders equity; those deemed other-than-temporary are recorded in either earnings or shareholders equity based on certain factors. additional information regarding temporary and other-than-temporary impairment on securities available for sale at december 31, 2014, is provided in note 7 (securities).
derivatives and hedging we use primarily interest rate swaps to hedge interest rate risk for asset and liability management purposes. these derivative instruments modify the interest rate characteristics of specified on-balance sheet assets and liabilities. our accounting policies related to derivatives reflect the current accounting guidance, which provides that all derivatives should be recognized as either assets or liabilities on the balance sheet at fair value, after taking into account the effects of master netting agreements. accounting for changes in the fair value (i.e., gains or losses) of a particular derivative depends on whether the derivative has been designated and qualifies as part of a hedging relationship, and further, on the type of hedging relationship.
the application of hedge accounting requires significant judgment to interpret the relevant accounting guidance, as well as to assess hedge effectiveness, identify similar hedged item groupings, and measure changes in the fair value of the hedged items. we believe our methods of addressing these judgments and applying the accounting
101
guidance are consistent with both the guidance and industry practices. however, interpretations of the applicable accounting guidance continue to change and evolve. in the future, these evolving interpretations could result in material changes to our accounting for derivative financial instruments and related hedging activities. although such changes may not have a material effect on our financial condition, a change could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations in the period in which it occurs. additional information relating to our use of derivatives is included in note 1 under the heading derivatives, and note 8 (derivatives and hedging activities).
contingent liabilities, guarantees and income taxes note 20 (commitments, contingent liabilities and guarantees) summarizes contingent liabilities arising from litigation and contingent liabilities arising from guarantees in various agreements with third parties under which we are a guarantor, and the potential effects of these items on the results of our operations. we record a liability for the fair value of the obligation to stand ready to perform over the term of a guarantee, but there is a risk that our actual future payments in the event of a default by the guaranteed party could exceed the recorded amount. see note 20 for a comparison of the liability recorded and the maximum potential undiscounted future payments for the various types of guarantees that we had outstanding at december 31, 2014.
it is not always clear how the internal revenue code and various state tax laws apply to transactions that we undertake. in the normal course of business, we may record tax benefits and then have those benefits contested by the irs or state tax authorities. we have provided tax reserves that we believe are adequate to absorb potential adjustments that such challenges may necessitate. however, if our judgment later proves to be inaccurate, the tax reserves may need to be adjusted, which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and capital.
additionally, we conduct quarterly assessments that determine the amount of deferred tax assets that are more-likely-than-not to be realized, and therefore recorded. the available evidence used in connection with these assessments includes taxable income in prior periods, projected future taxable income, potential tax-planning strategies, and projected future reversals of deferred tax items. these assessments are subjective and may change. based on these criteria, and in particular our projections for future taxable income, we currently believe it is more-likely-than-not that we will realize our net deferred tax asset in future periods. however, if our assessments prove incorrect, they could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations in the period in which they occur. for further information on our accounting for income taxes, see note 12 (income taxes).
during 2014, we did not significantly alter the manner in which we applied our critical accounting policies or developed related assumptions and estimates.

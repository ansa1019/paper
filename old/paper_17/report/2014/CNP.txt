item 1a.   risk factors we are a holding company that conducts all of our business operations through subsidiaries, primarily centerpoint houston and cerc. we also own interests in enable, a publicly traded midstream master limited partnership jointly controlled by cerc corp. and oge. the following, along with any additional legal proceedings identified or incorporated by reference in item 3 of this report, summarizes the principal risk factors associated with the businesses conducted by our subsidiaries and our interests in enable:
risk factors associated with our consolidated financial condition as a holding company with no operations of our own, we will depend on distributions from our subsidiaries and from enable to meet our payment obligations, and provisions of applicable law or contractual restrictions could limit the amount of those distributions.
we derive all of our operating income from, and hold all of our assets through, our subsidiaries, including our interests in enable. as a result, we depend on distributions from our subsidiaries, including enable, in order to meet our payment obligations. in general, our subsidiaries are separate and distinct legal entities and have no obligation to provide us with funds for our payment obligations, whether by dividends, distributions, loans or otherwise. in addition, provisions of applicable law, such as those limiting the legal sources of dividends, limit our subsidiaries' ability to make payments or other distributions to us, and our subsidiaries could agree to contractual restrictions on their ability to make distributions. for a discussion of risks that may impact the amount
18
of cash distributions we receive with respect to our interests in enable, please read "- additional risk factors affecting our interests in enable midstream partners, lp - our cash flows will be adversely impacted if we receive less cash distributions from enable than we currently expect."
our right to receive any assets of any subsidiary, and therefore the right of our creditors to participate in those assets, will be effectively subordinated to the claims of that subsidiary's creditors, including trade creditors. in addition, even if we were a creditor of any subsidiary, our rights as a creditor would be subordinated to any security interest in the assets of that subsidiary and any indebtedness of the subsidiary senior to that held by us.
if we are unable to arrange future financings on acceptable terms, our ability to refinance existing indebtedness could be limited.
as of december 31, 2014, we had $8.9 billion of outstanding indebtedness on a consolidated basis, which includes $3.0 billion of non-recourse transition and system restoration bonds. as of december 31, 2014, approximately $1.1 billion principal amount of this debt is required to be paid through 2017. this amount excludes principal repayments of approximately $1.2 billion on transition and system restoration bonds, for which dedicated revenue streams exist. our future financing activities may be significantly affected by, among other things:
•   general economic and capital market conditions;
•   credit availability from financial institutions and other lenders;
•   investor confidence in us and the markets in which we operate;
•   maintenance of acceptable credit ratings;
•   market expectations regarding our future earnings and cash flows;
•   market perceptions of our ability to access capital markets on reasonable terms;
•   our exposure to genon energy, inc. (genon) (formerly known as rri energy, inc., reliant energy, inc. and reliant resources, inc. (rri)), a wholly owned subsidiary of nrg, in connection with certain indemnification obligations;
•   incremental collateral that may be required due to regulation of derivatives; and
•   provisions of relevant tax and securities laws.
as of december 31, 2014, centerpoint houston had approximately $2.4 billion aggregate principal amount of general mortgage bonds outstanding under the general mortgage, including (a) $290 million held in trust to secure pollution control bonds that are not reflected in our consolidated financial statements because we are both the obligor on the bonds and the current owner of the bonds, (b) approximately $56 million held in trust to secure pollution control bonds that are not reflected on our financial statements because centerpoint houston is both the obligor on the bonds and the current owner of the bonds, and (c) approximately $118 million held in trust to secure pollution control bonds for which we are obligated. additionally, as of december 31, 2014, centerpoint houston had approximately $102 million aggregate principal amount of first mortgage bonds outstanding under the mortgage. centerpoint houston may issue additional general mortgage bonds on the basis of retired bonds, 70% of property additions or cash deposited with the trustee. approximately $3.9 billion of additional first mortgage bonds and general mortgage bonds in the aggregate could be issued on the basis of retired bonds and 70% of property additions as of december 31, 2014. however, centerpoint houston has contractually agreed that it will not issue additional first mortgage bonds, subject to certain exceptions.
our current credit ratings are discussed in "management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations - liquidity and capital resources - other matters - impact on liquidity of a downgrade in credit ratings" in item 7 of part ii of this report. these credit ratings may not remain in effect for any given period of time and one or more of these ratings may be lowered or withdrawn entirely by a rating agency. we note that these credit ratings are not recommendations to buy, sell or hold our securities. each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating. any future reduction or withdrawal of one or more of our credit ratings could have a material adverse impact on our ability to access capital on acceptable terms.
19
poor investment performance of the pension plan and factors adversely affecting the calculation of pension liabilities could unfavorably impact our liquidity and results of operations.
we maintain a qualified defined benefit pension plan covering all employees. our costs of providing this plan are dependent upon a number of factors including the investment returns on plan assets, the level of interest rates used to calculate the funded status of the plan, our contributions to the plan and government regulations with respect to funding requirements and the calculation of plan liabilities. funding requirements may increase as a result of a decline in the market value of plan assets, a decline in the interest rates used to calculate the present value of future plan obligations or government regulations that increase minimum funding requirements or the pension liability. in addition to affecting our funding requirements, each of these factors could adversely affect our results of operations and financial position.
the use of derivative contracts in the normal course of business by us, our subsidiaries or enable could result in financial losses that could negatively impact our results of operations and those of our subsidiaries or enable.
we and our subsidiaries use derivative instruments, such as swaps, options, futures and forwards, to manage our commodity, weather and financial market risks. enable may also use such instruments from time to time to manage its commodity and financial market risk. we, our subsidiaries or enable could recognize financial losses as a result of volatility in the market values of these contracts or should a counterparty fail to perform. in the absence of actively quoted market prices and pricing information from external sources, the valuation of these financial instruments can involve management's judgment or use of estimates. as a result, changes in the underlying assumptions or use of alternative valuation methods could affect the reported fair value of these contracts.
an impairment of goodwill, long-lived assets, including intangible assets, and equity-method investments could reduce our earnings.
goodwill is recorded when the purchase price of a business exceeds the fair market value of the tangible and separately measurable intangible net assets. accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america require us to test goodwill for impairment on an annual basis or when events or circumstances occur indicating that goodwill might be impaired. long-lived assets, including intangible assets with finite useful lives, are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable.
for investments we account for under the equity method, the impairment test considers whether the fair value of the equity investment as a whole, not the underlying net assets, has declined and whether that decline is other than temporary. for example, if enable's unit price, distributions or earnings decline for reasons including, but not limited to, continued declines in commodity prices and producer activity, and that decline is deemed to be other than temporary, we could determine that we are unable to recover the carrying value of our equity investment in enable. the carrying value of centerpoint energy's investment in enable is $19.33 per unit. as of december 31, 2014, enable's common unit price closed at $19.39 (approximately $14 million above carrying value). the lowest close price for enable's common units in january 2015 was $17.34 (approximately $465 million below carrying value). if we determine that an impairment is indicated, we would be required to take an immediate noncash charge to earnings with a correlative effect on equity and balance sheet leverage as measured by debt to total capitalization.
risk factors affecting our electric transmission & distribution business rate regulation of centerpoint houston's business may delay or deny centerpoint houston's ability to earn a reasonable return and fully recover its costs.
centerpoint houston's rates are regulated by certain municipalities and the texas utility commission based on an analysis of its invested capital and its expenses in a test year. thus, the rates that centerpoint houston is allowed to charge may not match its expenses at any given time. the regulatory process by which rates are determined may not always result in rates that will produce full recovery of centerpoint houston's costs and enable centerpoint houston to earn a reasonable return on its invested capital.
centerpoint houston's revenues and results of operations are seasonal.
a significant portion of centerpoint houston's revenues is derived from rates that it collects from each rep based on the amount of electricity it delivers on behalf of such rep. thus, centerpoint houston's revenues and results of operations are subject to seasonality, weather conditions and other changes in electricity usage, with revenues generally being higher during the warmer months. unusually mild weather in the warmer months could diminish our results of operations and harm our financial condition. conversely, extreme warm weather conditions could increase our results of operations in a manner that would not likely be annually recurring.
20
disruptions at power generation facilities owned by third parties could interrupt centerpoint houston's sales of transmission and distribution services.
centerpoint houston transmits and distributes to customers of reps electric power that the reps obtain from power generation facilities owned by third parties. centerpoint houston does not own or operate any power generation facilities. if power generation is disrupted or if power generation capacity is inadequate, centerpoint houston's sales of transmission and distribution services may be diminished or interrupted, and its results of operations, financial condition and cash flows could be adversely affected.
a substantial portion of centerpoint houston's receivables is concentrated in a small number of reps, and any delay or default in payment could adversely affect centerpoint houston's cash flows, financial condition and results of operations.
centerpoint houston's receivables from the distribution of electricity are collected from reps that supply the electricity centerpoint houston distributes to their customers. as of december 31, 2014, centerpoint houston did business with approximately 70 reps. adverse economic conditions, structural problems in the market served by ercot or financial difficulties of one or more reps could impair the ability of these reps to pay for centerpoint houston's services or could cause them to delay such payments. centerpoint houston depends on these reps to remit payments on a timely basis. applicable regulatory provisions require that customers be shifted to another rep or a provider of last resort if a rep cannot make timely payments. applicable texas utility commission regulations significantly limit the extent to which centerpoint houston can apply normal commercial terms or otherwise seek credit protection from firms desiring to provide retail electric service in its service territory, and centerpoint houston thus remains at risk for payments related to services provided prior to the shift to another rep or the provider of last resort. the texas utility commission revised its regulations in 2009 to (i) increase the financial qualifications required of reps that began selling power after january 1, 2009, and (ii) authorize utilities to defer bad debts resulting from defaults by reps for recovery in a future rate case. a significant portion of centerpoint houston's billed receivables from reps are from affiliates of nrg and energy future holdings corp. (energy future holdings). centerpoint houston's aggregate billed receivables balance from reps as of december 31, 2014 was $195 million. approximately 36% and 10% of this amount was owed by affiliates of nrg and energy future holdings, respectively. in april 2014, energy future holdings publicly disclosed that it and the substantial majority of its direct and indirect subsidiaries, excluding oncor electric delivery company llc and its subsidiaries, filed voluntary petitions for relief under chapter 11 of the united states bankruptcy code in the united states bankruptcy court for the district of delaware. any delay or default in payment by reps could adversely affect centerpoint houston's cash flows, financial condition and results of operations. if a rep were unable to meet its obligations, it could consider, among various options, restructuring under the bankruptcy laws, in which event such rep might seek to avoid honoring its obligations, and claims might be made by creditors involving payments centerpoint houston had received from such rep.
centerpoint houston could be subject to higher costs and fines or other sanctions as a result of mandatory reliability standards.
the ferc has jurisdiction with respect to ensuring the reliability of electric transmission service, including transmission facilities owned by centerpoint houston and other utilities within ercot. the ferc has designated the nerc as the ero to promulgate standards, under ferc oversight, for all owners, operators and users of the bulk power system. the ferc has approved the delegation by the nerc of authority for reliability in ercot to the tre, a functionally independent division of ercot. compliance with the mandatory reliability standards may subject centerpoint houston to higher operating costs and may result in increased capital expenditures. in addition, if centerpoint houston were to be found to be in noncompliance with applicable mandatory reliability standards, it could be subject to sanctions, including substantial monetary penalties.
the ams deployed throughout centerpoint houston's service territory may experience unexpected problems with respect to the timely receipt of accurate metering data.
centerpoint houston has deployed an ams throughout its service territory. the deployment consisted, among other elements, of replacing existing meters with new electronic meters that record metering data at 15-minute intervals and wirelessly communicate that information to centerpoint houston over a bi-directional communications system installed for that purpose. the ams integrates equipment and computer software from various vendors in order to eliminate the need for physical meter readings to be taken at consumers' premises, such as monthly readings for billing purposes and special readings associated with a customer's change in reps or the connection or disconnection of electric service. unanticipated difficulties could be encountered during the operation of the ams, including failures or inadequacy of equipment or software, difficulties in integrating the various components of the ams, changes in technology, cyber-security issues and factors outside the control of centerpoint houston, which could result in delayed or inaccurate metering data that might lead to delays or inaccuracies in the calculation and imposition of delivery or other charges, which could have a material adverse effect on centerpoint houston's results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.
21
risk factors affecting our natural gas distribution and energy services businesses rate regulation of cerc's business may delay or deny cerc's ability to earn a reasonable return and fully recover its costs.
cerc's rates for ngd are regulated by certain municipalities and state commissions based on an analysis of its invested capital and its expenses in a test year. thus, the rates that cerc is allowed to charge may not match its expenses at any given time. the regulatory process in which rates are determined may not always result in rates that will produce full recovery of cerc's costs and enable cerc to earn a reasonable return on its invested capital.
cerc's natural gas distribution and energy services businesses are subject to fluctuations in notional natural gas prices as well as geographic and seasonal natural gas price differentials, which could affect the ability of cerc's suppliers and customers to meet their obligations or otherwise adversely affect cerc's liquidity and results of operations and financial condition.
cerc is subject to risk associated with changes in the notional price of natural gas as well as geographic and seasonal natural gas price differentials. increases in natural gas prices might affect cerc's ability to collect balances due from its customers and, for ngd, could create the potential for uncollectible accounts expense to exceed the recoverable levels built into cerc's tariff rates. in addition, a sustained period of high natural gas prices could (i) decrease demand for natural gas in the areas in which cerc operates, thereby resulting in decreased sales and revenues and (ii) increase the risk that cerc's suppliers or customers fail or are unable to meet their obligations. an increase in natural gas prices would also increase cerc's working capital requirements by increasing the investment that must be made in order to maintain natural gas inventory levels. additionally, a decrease in natural gas prices could increase the amount of collateral that cerc must provide under its hedging arrangements.
cerc's businesses must compete with alternate energy sources, which could result in cerc marketing less natural gas, which could have an adverse impact on cerc's results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.
cerc competes primarily with alternate energy sources such as electricity and other fuel sources. in some areas, intrastate pipelines, other natural gas distributors and marketers also compete directly with cerc for natural gas sales to end-users. in addition, as a result of federal regulatory changes affecting interstate pipelines, natural gas marketers operating on these pipelines may be able to bypass cerc's facilities and market, sell and/or transport natural gas directly to commercial and industrial customers. any reduction in the amount of natural gas marketed, sold or transported by cerc as a result of competition may have an adverse impact on cerc's results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.
a decline in cerc's credit rating could result in cerc's having to provide collateral under its shipping or hedging arrangements or in order to purchase natural gas.
if cerc's credit rating were to decline, it might be required to post cash collateral under its shipping or hedging arrangements or in order to purchase natural gas. if a credit rating downgrade and the resultant cash collateral requirement were to occur at a time when cerc was experiencing significant working capital requirements or otherwise lacked liquidity, cerc's results of operations, financial condition and cash flows could be adversely affected.
cerc's revenues and results of operations are seasonal.
a substantial portion of cerc's revenues is derived from natural gas sales. thus, cerc's revenues and results of operations are subject to seasonality, weather conditions and other changes in natural gas usage, with revenues being higher during the winter months. unusually mild weather in the winter months could diminish our results of operations and harm our financial condition. conversely, extreme cold weather conditions could increase our results of operations in a manner that would not likely be annually recurring.
the states in which cerc provides regulated local gas distribution may, either through legislation or rules, adopt restrictions regarding organization, financing and affiliate transactions that could have significant adverse impacts on cerc's ability to operate.
proposals have been put forth in some of the states in which cerc does business to give state regulatory authorities increased jurisdiction and scrutiny over organization, capital structure, intracompany relationships and lines of business that could be pursued by registered holding companies and their affiliates that operate in those states. some of these frameworks attempt to regulate financing activities, acquisitions and divestitures, and arrangements between the utilities and their affiliates, and to restrict the level of non-utility business that can be conducted within the holding company structure. additionally, they may impose record-
22
keeping, record access, employee training and reporting requirements related to affiliate transactions and reporting in the event of certain downgrading of the utility's credit rating.
these regulatory frameworks could have adverse effects on cerc's ability to conduct its utility operations, to finance its business and to provide cost-effective utility service. in addition, if more than one state adopts restrictions on similar activities, it may be difficult for cerc and us to comply with competing regulatory requirements.
risk factors affecting our interests in enable midstream partners, lp we hold a substantial limited partnership interest in enable (55.4% of enable's outstanding limited partnership interests as of december 31, 2014), as well as 50% of the management rights in enable's general partner and a 40% interest in the incentive distribution rights held by enable's general partner. accordingly, our future earnings, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition will be affected by the performance of enable, the amount of cash distributions we receive from enable and the value of our interests in enable. factors that may have a material impact on enable's performance and cash distributions, and, hence, the value of our interests in enable, include the risk factors outlined below, as well as the risks described elsewhere under "risk factors" that are applicable to enable.
our cash flows will be adversely impacted if we receive less cash distributions from enable than we currently expect.
both cerc corp. and oge hold their limited partnership interests in enable in the form of both common units and subordinated units. enable is expected to pay a minimum quarterly distribution of $0.2875 per unit, or $1.15 per unit on an annualized basis, on its outstanding units to the extent it has sufficient cash from operations after establishment of cash reserves and payment of fees and expenses, including payments to its general partner and its affiliates (referred to as "available cash"). the principal difference between enable's common units and subordinated units is that in any quarter during the applicable subordination period, holders of the subordinated units are not entitled to receive any distribution of available cash until the common units have received the minimum quarterly distribution plus any arrearages in the payment of the minimum quarterly distribution on common units from prior quarters. if enable does not pay distributions on its subordinated units, its subordinated units will not accrue arrearages for those unpaid distributions. accordingly, if enable is unable to pay its minimum quarterly distribution, the amount of cash distributions we receive from enable may be adversely affected. enable may not have sufficient available cash each quarter to enable it to pay the minimum quarterly distribution. the amount of cash enable can distribute on its units will principally depend upon the amount of cash it generates from its operations, which will fluctuate from quarter to quarter based on, among other things:
•   the fees and gross margins it realizes with respect to the volume of natural gas and crude oil that it handles;
•   the prices of, levels of production of, and demand for natural gas and crude oil;
•   the volume of natural gas and crude oil it gathers, compresses, treats, dehydrates, processes, fractionates, transports and stores;
•   the relationship among prices for natural gas, ngls and crude oil;
•   cash calls and settlements of hedging positions;
•   margin requirements on open price risk management assets and liabilities;
•   the level of competition from other midstream energy companies;
•   adverse effects of governmental and environmental regulation;
•   the level of its operation and maintenance expenses and general and administrative costs; and
•   prevailing economic conditions.
in addition, the actual amount of cash enable will have available for distribution will depend on other factors, including:
•   the level and timing of its capital expenditures;
•   the cost of acquisitions;
23
•   its debt service requirements and other liabilities;
•   fluctuations in its working capital needs;
•   its ability to borrow funds and access capital markets;
•   restrictions contained in its debt agreements;
•   the amount of cash reserves established by its general partner; and
•   other business risks affecting its cash levels.
the amount of cash enable has available for distribution to us depends primarily on its cash flow rather than on its profitability, which may prevent enable from making distributions, even during periods in which enable records net income.
the amount of cash enable has available for distribution depends primarily upon its cash flows and not solely on profitability, which will be affected by non-cash items. as a result, enable may make cash distributions during periods when it records losses for financial accounting purposes and may not make cash distributions during periods when it records net earnings for financial accounting purposes.
we are not able to exercise control over enable, which entails certain risks.
enable is controlled jointly by cerc corp. and oge, who each own 50% of the management rights in the general partner of enable. the board of directors of enable's general partner is composed of an equal number of directors appointed by oge and by us, the president and chief executive officer of enable's general partner and three directors who are independent as defined under the independence standards established by the new york stock exchange. accordingly, we are not able to exercise control over enable.
although we jointly control enable with oge, we may have conflicts of interest with enable that could subject us to claims that we have breached our fiduciary duty to enable and its unitholders.
cerc corp. and oge each own 50% of the management rights in enable's general partner, as well as limited partnership interests in enable, and interests in the incentive distribution rights held by enable's general partner. conflicts of interest may arise between us and enable and its unitholders. our joint control of the general partner of enable may increase the possibility of claims of breach of fiduciary duties including claims of conflicts of interest related to enable. in resolving these conflicts, we may favor our own interests and the interests of our affiliates over the interests of enable and its unitholders as long as the resolution does not conflict with enable's partnership agreement. these circumstances could subject us to claims that, in favoring our own interests and those of our affiliates, we breached a fiduciary duty to enable or its unitholders.
enable's contracts are subject to renewal risks.
enable generates a substantial portion of its gross margins under long-term, fee-based agreements. for the year ended december 31, 2014, approximately 72% of enable's gross margin was generated from contracts that are fee-based and approximately 50% of its gross margin was attributable to fees associated with firm contracts or contracts with minimum volume commitment features. as these and other contracts expire, enable may have to negotiate extensions or renewals with existing suppliers and customers or enter into new contracts with other suppliers and customers. enable may be unable to obtain new contracts on favorable commercial terms, if at all. it also may be unable to maintain the economic structure of a particular contract with an existing customer or the overall mix of its contract portfolio. for example, depending on prevailing market conditions at the time of a contract renewal, gathering and processing customers with fixed-fee or fixed-margin contracts may desire to enter into contracts under different fee arrangements. to the extent enable is unable to renew its existing contracts on terms that are favorable to it, if at all, or successfully manage its overall contract mix over time, its revenue, results of operations and distributable cash flow could be adversely affected.
24
enable depends on a small number of customers for a significant portion of its firm transportation and storage services revenues. the loss of, or reduction in volumes from, these customers could result in a decline in sales of its transportation and storage services and its consolidated financial position, results of operations and its ability to make cash distributions.
enable provides firm transportation and storage services to certain key customers on its system. its major transportation customers are affiliates of centerpoint energy, laclede group (laclede), oge, american electric power company, inc. (aep) and xto energy inc., an affiliate of exxon mobil corporation.
the loss of all or even a portion of the interstate or intrastate transportation and storage services for any of these customers, the failure to extend or replace these contracts or the extension or replacement of these contracts on less favorable terms, as a result of competition or otherwise, could adversely affect enable's combined and consolidated financial position, results of operations and its ability to make cash distributions.
enable's businesses are dependent, in part, on the drilling and production decisions of others.
enable's businesses are dependent on the continued availability of natural gas and crude oil production. enable has no control over the level of drilling activity in its areas of operation, the amount of reserves associated with wells connected to its systems or the rate at which production from a well declines. in addition, enable's cash flows associated with wells currently connected to its systems will decline over time. to maintain or increase throughput levels on its gathering and transportation systems and the asset utilization rates at its natural gas processing plants, enable's customers must continually obtain new natural gas and crude oil supplies. the primary factors affecting enable's ability to obtain new supplies of natural gas and crude oil and attract new customers to its assets are the level of successful drilling activity near these systems, its ability to compete for volumes from successful new wells and its ability to expand capacity as needed. if enable is not able to obtain new supplies of natural gas and crude oil to replace the natural decline in volumes from existing wells, throughput on its gathering, processing, transportation and storage facilities will decline, which could have a material adverse effect on its results of operations and distributable cash flow. enable has no control over producers or their drilling and production decisions, which are affected by, among other things:
•   the availability and cost of capital;
•   prevailing and projected commodity prices, including the prices of natural gas, ngls and crude oil;
•   demand for natural gas, ngls and crude oil;
•   levels of reserves;
•   geological considerations;
•   environmental or other governmental regulations, including the availability of drilling permits and the regulation of hydraulic fracturing; and
•   the availability of drilling rigs and other costs of production and equipment.
fluctuations in energy prices can also greatly affect the development of new natural gas and crude oil reserves. drilling and production activity generally decreases as commodity prices decrease. in general terms, the prices of natural gas, crude oil and other hydrocarbon products fluctuate in response to changes in supply and demand, market uncertainty and a variety of additional factors that are beyond enable's control. because of these factors, even if new natural gas or crude oil reserves are known to exist in areas served by enable's assets, producers may choose not to develop those reserves. declines in natural gas or crude oil prices can have a negative impact on exploration, development and production activity and, if sustained, could lead to decreases in such activity. a sustained decline could also lead producers to shut in production from their existing wells. sustained reductions in exploration or production activity in enable's areas of operation could lead to further reductions in the utilization of its systems, which could have a material adverse effect on its business, financial condition, results of operations and ability to make cash distributions.
in addition, it may be more difficult to maintain or increase the current volumes on enable's gathering systems, as several of the formations in the unconventional resource plays in which it operates generally have higher initial production rates and steeper production decline curves than wells in more conventional basins. should enable determine that the economics of its gathering assets do not justify the capital expenditures needed to grow or maintain volumes associated therewith, enable may reduce such capital expenditures, which could cause revenues associated with these assets to decline over time. in addition to capital expenditures
25
to support growth, the steeper production decline curves associated with unconventional resource plays may require enable to incur higher maintenance capital expenditures relative to throughput over time, which will reduce its distributable cash flow.
because of these and other factors, even if new reserves are known to exist in areas served by enable's assets, producers may choose not to develop those reserves. reductions in drilling activity would result in enable's inability to maintain the current levels of throughput on its systems and could have a material adverse effect on its results of operations and distributable cash flow.
enable's industry is highly competitive, and increased competitive pressure could adversely affect its results of operations and distributable cash flow.
enable competes with similar enterprises in its respective areas of operation. the principal elements of competition are rates, terms of service and flexibility and reliability of service. enable's competitors include large crude oil, natural gas and petrochemical companies that have greater financial resources and access to supplies of natural gas, ngls and crude oil than enable. some of these competitors may expand or construct gathering, processing, transportation and storage systems that would create additional competition for the services enable provides to its customers. excess pipeline capacity in the regions served by enable's interstate pipelines could also increase competition and adversely impact enable's ability to renew or enter into new contracts with respect to its available capacity when existing contracts expire. in addition, enable's customers that are significant producers of natural gas may develop their own gathering, processing, transportation and storage systems in lieu of using enable's systems. enable's ability to renew or replace existing contracts with its customers at rates sufficient to maintain current revenues and cash flows could be adversely affected by the activities of its competitors and customers. further, natural gas utilized as a fuel competes with other forms of energy available to end-users, including electricity, coal and liquid fuels. increased demand for such forms of energy at the expense of natural gas could lead to a reduction in demand for natural gas gathering, processing, transportation and transportation services. all of these competitive pressures could adversely affect enable's results of operations and distributable cash flow.
enable may not be able to recover the costs of its substantial planned investment in capital improvements and additions, and the actual cost of such improvements and additions may be significantly higher than it anticipates.
enable's business plan calls for extensive investment in capital improvements and additions. in enable's form 10-k for the year ended december 31, 2014, enable stated that it expects that its expansion capital expenditures could range from approximately $600 million to $800 million for the year ending december 31, 2015, not including opportunities currently under evaluation which could add up to an additional $300 million of expansion capital expenditures. for example, enable is currently constructing two cryogenic processing facilities that it plans to connect to its super-header system in grady county, oklahoma, which enable expects will add 400 mmcf/d of natural gas processing capacity. enable expects that the first of the two new plants (the bradley plant) will be completed in the first quarter of 2015. enable expects that the second plant (the grady county plant), a 200 mmcf/d plant, will be completed in the first quarter of 2016. enable also plans to construct significant natural gas gathering and compression infrastructure to support producer activity in its growth areas, and enable anticipates that in 2015 it will complete the construction of two crude gathering systems in north dakota's bakken shale formation with a combined capacity of 49,500 bbl/d.
the construction of additions or modifications to enable's existing systems, and the construction of new midstream assets, involves numerous regulatory, environmental, political and legal uncertainties, many of which are beyond enable's control and may require the expenditure of significant amounts of capital, which may exceed its estimates. these projects may not be completed at the planned cost, on schedule or at all. the construction of new pipeline, gathering, treating, processing, compression or other facilities is subject to construction cost overruns due to labor costs, costs of equipment and materials such as steel, labor shortages or weather or other delays, inflation or other factors, which could be material. in addition, the construction of these facilities is typically subject to the receipt of approvals and permits from various regulatory agencies. those agencies may not approve the projects in a timely manner, if at all, or may impose restrictions or conditions on the projects that could potentially prevent a project from proceeding, lengthen its expected completion schedule and/or increase its anticipated cost. moreover, enable's revenues and cash flows may not increase immediately upon the expenditure of funds on a particular project. for instance, if enable expands an existing pipeline or constructs a new pipeline, the construction may occur over an extended period of time, and enable may not receive any material increases in revenues or cash flows until the project is completed. in addition, enable may construct facilities to capture anticipated future growth in production in a region in which such growth does not materialize. as a result, the new facilities may not be able to achieve enable's expected investment return, which could adversely affect its results of operations and its ability to make cash distributions.
in connection with enable's capital investments, enable may engage a third party to estimate potential reserves in areas to be developed prior to constructing facilities in those areas. to the extent enable relies on estimates of future production in deciding to construct additions to its systems, those estimates may prove to be inaccurate due to numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating future production. as a result, new facilities may not be able to attract sufficient throughput to achieve expected investment return,
26
which could adversely affect enable's results of operations and its ability to make cash distributions. in addition, the construction of additions to existing gathering and transportation assets may require new rights-of-way prior to construction. those rights-of-way to connect new natural gas supplies to existing gathering lines may be unavailable and enable may not be able to capitalize on attractive expansion opportunities. additionally, it may become more expensive to obtain new rights-of-way or to renew existing rights-of-way. if the cost of renewing or obtaining new rights-of-way increases, enable's results of operations and its ability to make cash distributions could be adversely affected.
natural gas, ngl and crude oil prices are volatile, and changes in these prices could adversely affect enable's results of operations and its ability to make cash distributions.
enable's results of operations and its ability to make cash distributions could be negatively affected by adverse movements in the prices of natural gas, ngls and crude oil depending on factors that are beyond its control. these factors include demand for these commodities, which fluctuates with changes in market and economic conditions and other factors, including the impact of seasonality and weather, general economic conditions, the level of domestic and offshore natural gas production and consumption, the availability of imported natural gas, lng, ngls and crude oil, actions taken by foreign natural gas and oil producing nations, the availability of local, intrastate and interstate transportation systems, the availability and marketing of competitive fuels, the impact of energy conservation efforts, technological advances affecting energy consumption and the extent of governmental regulation and taxation.
enable's keep-whole natural gas processing arrangements, which accounted for 7% of its natural gas processed volumes in 2014, expose it to fluctuations in the pricing spreads between ngl prices and natural gas prices. under these arrangements, the processor processes raw natural gas to extract ngls and pays to the producer the natural gas equivalent btu value of raw natural gas received from the producer in the form of either processed natural gas or its cash equivalent. the processor is generally entitled to retain the processed ngls and to sell them for its own account. accordingly, the processor's margin is a function of the difference between the value of the ngls produced and the cost of the processed natural gas used to replace the natural gas equivalent btu value of those ngls. therefore, if natural gas prices increase and ngl prices do not increase by a corresponding amount, the processor has to replace the btu of natural gas at higher prices and processing margins are negatively affected.
enable's percent-of-proceeds and percent-of-liquids natural gas processing agreements accounted for 44% of its natural gas processed volumes in 2014. under these arrangements, the processor generally gathers raw natural gas from producers at the wellhead, transports the natural gas through its gathering system, processes the natural gas and sells the processed natural gas and/or ngls at prices based on published index prices. the price paid to producers is based on an agreed percentage of the actual proceeds of the sale of processed natural gas, ngls or both, or the expected proceeds based on an index price. enable refers to contracts in which the processor shares in specified percentages of the proceeds from the sale of natural gas and ngls as "percent-of-proceeds" arrangements, and contracts in which the processor receives proceeds from the sale of a percentage of the ngls or the ngls themselves as compensation for processing services as "percent-of-liquids" arrangements. these arrangements expose enable to risks associated with the price of natural gas and ngls.
at any given time, enable's overall portfolio of processing contracts may reflect a net short position in natural gas (meaning that it is a net buyer of natural gas) and a net long position in ngls (meaning that it is a net seller of ngls). as a result, enable's gross margin could be adversely impacted to the extent the price of ngls decreases in relation to the price of natural gas.
enable has limited experience in the crude oil gathering business.
in november 2013, enable commenced operations on its initial crude oil gathering pipeline system, located in dunn and mckenzie counties in north dakota within the bakken shale formation. additionally in february 2014, enable executed a crude oil gathering agreement to gather crude oil production through a new system in williams and mountrail counties in north dakota that is expected to commence operations in the first quarter of 2015. these facilities, with a combined capacity of 49,500 barrels per day, are the first crude oil gathering systems that enable has built and operated. other operators of gathering systems in the bakken shale formation may have more experience in the construction, operation and maintenance of crude oil gathering systems than enable. this relative lack of experience may hinder enable's ability to fully implement its business plan in a timely and cost efficient manner, which, in turn, may adversely affect its results of operations and its ability to make cash distributions to unitholders.
27
enable provides certain transportation and storage services under long-term, fixed-price "negotiated rate" contracts that are not subject to adjustment, even if its cost to perform such services exceeds the revenues received from such contracts, and, as a result, enable's costs could exceed its revenues received under such contracts.
enable has been authorized by the ferc to provide transportation and storage services at its facilities at negotiated rates. generally, negotiated rates are in excess of the maximum recourse rates allowed by the ferc, but it is possible that costs to perform services under "negotiated rate" contracts will exceed the revenues obtained under these agreements. if this occurs, it could decrease the cash flow realized by enable's systems and, therefore, decrease the cash it has available for distribution.
as of december 31, 2014, approximately 56% of enable's contracted transportation firm capacity and 44% of its contracted storage firm capacity was subscribed under such "negotiated rate" contracts. these contracts generally do not include provisions allowing for adjustment for increased costs due to inflation, pipeline safety activities or other factors that are not tied to an applicable tracking mechanism authorized by the ferc. successful recovery of any shortfall of revenue, representing the difference between "recourse rates" (if higher) and negotiated rates, is not assured under current ferc policies.
if third-party pipelines and other facilities interconnected to enable's gathering, processing or transportation facilities become partially or fully unavailable for any reason, enable's results of operations and its ability to make cash distributions could be adversely affected.
enable depends upon third-party natural gas pipelines to deliver natural gas to, and take natural gas from, its transportation systems. enable also depends on third-party facilities to transport and fractionate ngls that are delivered to the third party at the tailgates of the processing plants. fractionation is the separation of the heterogeneous mixture of extracted ngls into individual components for end-use sale. for example, an outage or disruption on certain pipelines or fractionators operated by a third party could result in the shutdown of certain of enable's processing plants, and a prolonged outage or disruption could ultimately result in a reduction in the volume of ngls enable is able to produce. additionally, enable depends on third parties to provide electricity for compression at many of its facilities. since enable does not own or operate any of these third-party pipelines or other facilities, their continuing operation is not within its control. if any of these third-party pipelines or other facilities become partially or fully unavailable for any reason, enable's results of operations and its ability to make cash distributions to unitholders could be adversely affected.
enable does not own all of the land on which its pipelines and facilities are located, which could disrupt its operations.
enable does not own all of the land on which its pipelines and facilities have been constructed, and it is therefore subject to the possibility of more onerous terms and/or increased costs to retain necessary land use if it does not have valid rights-of-way or if such rights-of-way lapse or terminate. enable may obtain the rights to construct and operate its pipelines on land owned by third parties and governmental agencies for a specific period of time. a loss of these rights, through enable's inability to renew right-of-way contracts or otherwise, could cause it to cease operations temporarily or permanently on the affected land, increase costs related to the construction and continuing operations elsewhere and adversely affect its results of operations and ability to make cash distributions.
enable conducts a portion of its operations through joint ventures, which subject it to additional risks that could have a material adverse effect on the success of these operations and enable's financial position and results of operations.
enable conducts a portion of its operations through joint ventures with third parties, including affiliates of spectra energy corp, dcp midstream partners, lp, trans louisiana gas pipeline, inc. and pablo gathering llc. enable may also enter into other joint venture arrangements in the future. these third parties may have obligations that are important to the success of the joint venture, such as the obligation to pay their share of capital and other costs of the joint venture. the performance of these third-party obligations, including the ability of the third parties to satisfy their obligations under these arrangements, is outside enable's control. if these parties do not satisfy their obligations under these arrangements, enable's business may be adversely affected.
enable's joint venture arrangements may involve risks not otherwise present when operating assets directly, including, for example:
•   enable's joint venture partners may share certain approval rights over major decisions;
•   enable's joint venture partners may not pay their share of the joint venture's obligations, leaving enable liable for their shares of joint venture liabilities;
28
•   enable may be unable to control the amount of cash we will receive from the joint venture;
•   enable may incur liabilities as a result of an action taken by its joint venture partners;
•   enable may be required to devote significant management time to the requirements of and matters relating to the joint ventures;
•   enable's insurance policies may not fully cover loss or damage incurred by both enable and its joint venture partners in certain circumstances;
•   enable's joint venture partners may be in a position to take actions contrary to its instructions or requests or contrary to its policies or objectives; and
•   disputes between enable and its joint venture partners may result in delays, litigation or operational impasses.
the risks described above or the failure to continue enable's joint ventures or to resolve disagreements with its joint venture partners could adversely affect its ability to transact the business that is the subject of such joint venture, which would in turn negatively affect enable's financial condition and results of operations. the agreements under which enable formed certain joint ventures may subject it to various risks, limit the actions it may take with respect to the assets subject to the joint venture and require enable to grant rights to its joint venture partners that could limit its ability to benefit fully from future positive developments. some joint ventures require enable to make significant capital expenditures. if enable does not timely meet its financial commitments or otherwise does not comply with its joint venture agreements, its rights to participate, exercise operator rights or otherwise influence or benefit from the joint venture may be adversely affected. certain of enable's joint venture partners may have substantially greater financial resources than enable has and enable may not be able to secure the funding necessary to participate in operations its joint venture partners propose, thereby reducing its ability to benefit from the joint venture.
enable's ability to grow is dependent on its ability to access external financing sources.
enable expects that it will distribute all of its "available cash" to its unitholders. as a result, enable is expected to rely primarily upon external financing sources, including commercial bank borrowings and the issuance of debt and equity securities, to fund acquisitions and expansion capital expenditures. as a result, to the extent enable is unable to finance growth externally, enable's cash distribution policy will significantly impair its ability to grow. in addition, because enable is expected to distribute all of its available cash, its growth may not be as fast as businesses that reinvest their available cash to expand ongoing operations.
to the extent enable issues additional units in connection with any acquisitions or expansion capital expenditures, the payment of distributions on those additional units may increase the risk that enable will be unable to maintain or increase its per unit distribution level, which in turn may impact the available cash that it has to distribute on each unit. there are no limitations in enable's partnership agreement on its ability to issue additional units, including units ranking senior to the common units. the incurrence of additional commercial borrowings or other debt by enable to finance its growth strategy would result in increased interest expense, which in turn may negatively impact the available cash that enable has to distribute to its unitholders.
if enable does not make acquisitions or is unable to make acquisitions on economically acceptable terms, its future growth will be adversely affected.
enable's growth strategy includes, in part, the ability to make acquisitions that result in an increase in its cash generated from operations. if enable is unable to make these accretive acquisitions either because: (i) it is unable to identify attractive acquisition targets or it is unable to negotiate purchase contracts on acceptable terms, (ii) it is unable to obtain acquisition financing on economically acceptable terms, or (iii) it is outbid by competitors, then our future growth and ability to increase distributions will be adversely affected.
enable's debt levels may limit its flexibility in obtaining additional financing and in pursuing other business opportunities.
as of december 31, 2014, enable had approximately $1.9 billion of long-term debt outstanding, excluding the premiums on their senior notes. enable has $363 million of long-term notes payable-affiliated companies due to cerc corp. enable has a $1.4 billion revolving credit facility for working capital, capital expenditures and other partnership purposes, including acquisitions, of which $1.1 billion was available as of december 31, 2014. as of january 31, 2015, enable had the ability to issue up to $1.2 billion in commercial paper, subject to available borrowing capacity under its revolving credit facility and market conditions, to manage the timing of cash flows and fund short-term working capital deficits. as of january 31, 2015, $224 million was outstanding
29
under enable's commercial paper program. enable will continue to have the ability to incur additional debt, subject to limitations in its credit facilities. the levels of enable's debt could have important consequences, including the following:
•   the ability to obtain additional financing, if necessary, for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions or other purposes may be impaired or the financing may not be available on favorable terms, if at all;
•   a portion of cash flows will be required to make interest payments on the debt, reducing the funds that would otherwise be available for operations, future business opportunities and distributions;
•   enable's debt level will make it more vulnerable to competitive pressures or a downturn in its business or the economy generally; and
•   enable's debt level may limit its flexibility in responding to changing business and economic conditions.
enable's ability to service its debt will depend upon, among other things, its future financial and operating performance, which will be affected by prevailing economic conditions and financial, business, regulatory and other factors, some of which are beyond enable's control. if operating results are not sufficient to service current or future indebtedness, enable may be forced to take actions such as reducing distributions, reducing or delaying business activities, acquisitions, investments or capital expenditures, selling assets, restructuring or refinancing debt, or seeking additional equity capital. these actions may not be effected on satisfactory terms, or at all.
enable's credit facilities contain operating and financial restrictions, including covenants and restrictions that may be affected by events beyond enable's control, which could adversely affect its business, financial condition, results of operations and ability to make quarterly distributions.
enable's credit facilities contain customary covenants that, among other things, limit its ability to:
•   permit its subsidiaries to incur or guarantee additional debt;
•   incur or permit to exist certain liens on assets;
•   dispose of assets;
•   merge or consolidate with another company or engage in a change of control;
•   enter into transactions with affiliates on non-arm's length terms; and
•   change the nature of its business.
enable's credit facilities also require it to maintain certain financial ratios. enable's ability to meet those financial ratios can be affected by events beyond its control, and we cannot assure you that it will meet those ratios. in addition, enable's credit facilities contain events of default customary for agreements of this nature.
enable's ability to comply with the covenants and restrictions contained in its credit facilities may be affected by events beyond its control, including prevailing economic, financial and industry conditions. if market or other economic conditions deteriorate, enable's ability to comply with these covenants may be impaired. if enable violates any of the restrictions, covenants, ratios or tests in its credit facilities, a significant portion of its indebtedness may become immediately due and payable. in addition, enable's lenders' commitments to make further loans to it under the revolving credit facility may be suspended or terminated. enable might not have, or be able to obtain, sufficient funds to make these accelerated payments.
costs of compliance with existing environmental laws and regulations are significant, and the cost of compliance with future environmental laws and regulations may adversely affect enable's results of operations and its ability to make cash distributions.
enable is subject to extensive federal, state and local environmental statutes, rules and regulations relating to air quality, water quality, waste management, wildlife conservation, natural resources and health and safety that could, among other things, delay or increase its costs of construction, restrict or limit the output of certain facilities and/or require additional pollution control equipment and otherwise increase costs. there are significant capital, operating and other costs associated with compliance with these environmental statutes, rules and regulations and those costs may be even more significant in the future.
30
there is inherent risk of the incurrence of environmental costs and liabilities in enable's operations due to its handling of natural gas, ngls and crude oil, air emissions related to its operations and historical industry operations and waste disposal practices. these activities are subject to stringent and complex federal, state and local laws and regulations governing environmental protection, including the discharge of materials into the environment and the protection of plants, wildlife, and natural and cultural resources. these laws and regulations can restrict or impact enable's business activities in many ways, such as restricting the way it can handle or dispose of wastes or requiring remedial action to mitigate pollution conditions that may be caused by its operations or that are attributable to former operators. joint and several strict liability may be incurred, without regard to fault, under certain of these environmental laws and regulations in connection with discharges or releases of wastes on, under or from enable's properties and facilities, many of which have been used for midstream activities for a number of years, oftentimes by third parties not under its control. private parties, including the owners of the properties through which enable's gathering systems pass and facilities where its wastes are taken for reclamation or disposal, may also have the right to pursue legal actions to enforce compliance, as well as to seek damages for non-compliance, with environmental laws and regulations or for personal injury or property damage. for example, an accidental release from one of enable's pipelines could subject it to substantial liabilities arising from environmental cleanup and restoration costs, claims made by neighboring landowners and other third parties for personal injury and property damage and fines or penalties for related violations of environmental laws or regulations. enable may be unable to recover these costs from insurance. moreover, the possibility exists that stricter laws, regulations or enforcement policies could significantly increase compliance costs and the cost of any remediation that may become necessary. further, stricter requirements could negatively impact enable's customers' production and operations, resulting in less demand for its services.
increased regulation of hydraulic fracturing could result in reductions or delays in natural gas production by enable's customers, which could adversely affect its results of operations and ability to make cash distributions.
hydraulic fracturing is an important and common practice that is used to stimulate production of natural gas and/or oil from dense subsurface rock formations. the hydraulic fracturing process involves the injection of water, sand, and chemicals under pressure into targeted subsurface formations to fracture the surrounding rock and stimulate production. many of enable's customers commonly use hydraulic fracturing techniques in their drilling and completion programs. hydraulic fracturing typically is regulated by state oil and natural gas commissions. in addition, certain federal agencies have proposed additional laws and regulations to more closely regulate the hydraulic fracturing process. for example, in january 2015, the epa indicated its intention to propose more stringent rules regulating methane and voc emissions from hydraulic fracturing and other well completion activity. congress from time to time has considered the adoption of legislation to provide for federal regulation of hydraulic fracturing under the safe drinking water act (sdwa) and to require disclosure of the chemicals used in the hydraulic fracturing process. some states have adopted, and other states are considering adopting, legal requirements that could impose more stringent permitting, public disclosure or well construction requirements on hydraulic fracturing activities. local government also may seek to adopt ordinances within their jurisdictions regulating the time, place and manner of drilling activities in general or hydraulic fracturing activities in particular, in some cases banning hydraulic fracturing entirely. other governmental agencies, including the u.s. department of energy and the epa, have evaluated or are evaluating various other aspects of hydraulic fracturing such as the potential environmental effects of hydraulic fracturing on drinking water and groundwater.
if new or more stringent federal, state or local legal restrictions relating to the hydraulic fracturing process are adopted in areas where enable's oil and natural gas exploration and production customers operate, they could incur potentially significant added costs to comply with such requirements, experience delays or curtailment in the pursuit of exploration, development, or production activities, and perhaps even be precluded from drilling wells, some or all of which activities could adversely affect demand for enable's services to those customers.
enable's operations are subject to extensive regulation by federal, state and local regulatory authorities. changes or additional regulatory measures adopted by such authorities could have a material adverse effect on enable's results of operations and ability to make cash distributions.
the rates charged by several of enable's pipeline systems, including for interstate gas transportation service provided by its intrastate pipelines, are regulated by the ferc. enable's pipeline operations that are not regulated by the ferc may be subject to state and local regulation applicable to intrastate natural and transportation services. the relevant states in which enable operates include north dakota, oklahoma, arkansas, louisiana, texas, missouri, kansas, mississippi, tennessee and illinois.
the ferc and state regulatory agencies also regulate other terms and conditions of the services enable may offer. if one of these regulatory agencies, on its own initiative or due to challenges by third parties, were to lower its tariff rates or deny any rate increase or other material changes to the types, or terms and conditions, of service enable might propose or offer, the profitability of enable's pipeline businesses could suffer. if enable were permitted to raise its tariff rates for a particular pipeline, there might be significant delay between the time the tariff rate increase is approved and the time that the rate increase actually goes into effect, which could also limit its profitability. furthermore, competition from other pipeline systems may prevent enable from raising
31
its tariff rates even if regulatory agencies permit it to do so. the regulatory agencies that regulate enable's systems periodically implement new rules, regulations and terms and conditions of services subject to their jurisdiction. new initiatives or orders may adversely affect the rates charged for enable's services or otherwise adversely affect its financial condition, results of operations and cash flows and its ability to make cash distributions.
a change in the jurisdictional characterization of some of enable's assets by federal, state or local regulatory agencies or a change in policy by those agencies may result in increased regulation of its assets, which may cause its revenues to decline and operating expenses to increase.
enable's natural gas gathering and intrastate transportation operations are generally exempt from the jurisdiction of the ferc under the nga, but ferc regulation may indirectly impact these businesses and the markets for products derived from these businesses. the ferc's policies and practices across the range of its oil and natural gas regulatory activities, including, for example, its policies on interstate open access transportation, ratemaking, capacity release, and market center promotion may indirectly affect intrastate markets. in recent years, the ferc has pursued pro-competitive policies in its regulation of interstate oil and natural gas pipelines. however, we cannot assure you that the ferc will continue to pursue this approach as it considers matters such as pipeline rates and rules and policies that may indirectly affect the intrastate natural gas transportation business. although the ferc has not made a formal determination with respect to all of enable's facilities it considers to be gathering facilities, enable believes that its natural gas gathering pipelines meet the traditional tests that the ferc has used to determine that a pipeline is a gathering pipeline and are therefore not subject to ferc jurisdiction. the distinction between ferc-regulated transmission services and federally unregulated gathering services, however, has been the subject of substantial litigation, and the ferc determines whether facilities are gathering facilities on a case-by-case basis, so the classification and regulation of enable's gathering facilities is subject to change based on future determinations by the ferc, the courts or congress. if the ferc were to consider the status of an individual facility and determine that the facility and/or services provided by it are not exempt from ferc regulation under the nga and that the facility provides interstate service, the rates for, and terms and conditions of, services provided by such facility would be subject to regulation by the ferc under the nga or the ngpa. such regulation could decrease revenue, increase operating costs, and, depending upon the facility in question, could adversely affect enable's financial condition, results of operations and cash flows and its ability to make cash distributions. in addition, if any of enable's facilities were found to have provided services or otherwise operated in violation of the nga or ngpa, this could result in the imposition of substantial civil penalties, as well as a requirement to disgorge revenues collected for such services in excess of the maximum rates established by the ferc.
natural gas gathering may receive greater regulatory scrutiny at the state level; therefore, enable's natural gas gathering operations could be adversely affected should they become subject to the application of state regulation of rates and services. enable's gathering operations could also be subject to safety and operational regulations relating to the design, construction, testing, operation, replacement and maintenance of gathering facilities. we cannot predict what effect, if any, such changes might have on enable's operations, but enable could be required to incur additional capital expenditures and increased costs depending on future legislative and regulatory changes.
enable may incur significant costs and liabilities resulting from pipeline integrity and other similar programs and related repairs.
the dot has adopted regulations requiring pipeline operators to develop integrity management programs for transportation pipelines located in "high consequence areas," which are those areas where a leak or rupture could do the most harm. the regulations require operators, including enable, to, among other things:
•   develop a baseline plan to prioritize the assessment of a covered pipeline segment;
•   identify and characterize applicable threats that could impact a high consequence area;
•   improve data collection, integration, and analysis;
•   repair and remediate pipelines as necessary; and
•   implement preventive and mitigating action.
although many of enable's pipelines fall within a class that is currently not subject to these requirements, it may incur significant cost and liabilities associated with repair, remediation, preventive or mitigation measures associated with its non-exempt pipelines. should enable fail to comply with dot or comparable state regulations, it could be subject to penalties and
32
fines. also, the scope of the integrity management program and other related pipeline safety programs could be expanded in the future.
other risk factors affecting our businesses or our interests in enable midstream partners, lp we are subject to operational and financial risks and liabilities arising from environmental laws and regulations.
our operations are subject to stringent and complex laws and regulations pertaining to the environment. as an owner or operator of natural gas pipelines and distribution systems, electric transmission and distribution systems, and the facilities that support these systems, we must comply with these laws and regulations at the federal, state and local levels. these laws and regulations can restrict or impact our business activities in many ways, such as:
•   restricting the way we can handle or dispose of wastes;
•   limiting or prohibiting construction activities in sensitive areas such as wetlands, coastal regions, or areas inhabited by endangered species;
•   requiring remedial action to mitigate environmental conditions caused by our operations, or attributable to former operations;
•   enjoining the operations of facilities with permits issued pursuant to such environmental laws and regulations; and
•   impacting the demand for our services by directly or indirectly affecting the use or price of natural gas.
in order to comply with these requirements, we may need to spend substantial amounts and devote other resources from time to time to:
•   construct or acquire new facilities and equipment;
•   acquire permits for facility operations;
•   modify or replace existing and proposed equipment; and
•   clean or decommission waste disposal areas, fuel storage and management facilities and other locations and facilities.
failure to comply with these laws and regulations may trigger a variety of administrative, civil and criminal enforcement measures, including the assessment of monetary penalties, the imposition of remedial actions, and the issuance of orders enjoining future operations. certain environmental statutes impose strict, joint and several liability for costs required to clean and restore sites where hazardous substances have been stored, disposed or released. moreover, it is not uncommon for neighboring landowners and other third parties to file claims for personal injury and property damage allegedly caused by the release of hazardous substances or other waste products into the environment.
the recent trend in environmental regulation has been to place more restrictions and limitations on activities that may affect the environment, and thus there can be no assurance as to the amount or timing of future expenditures for environmental compliance or remediation, and actual future expenditures may be greater than the amounts we currently anticipate.
our insurance coverage may not be sufficient. insufficient insurance coverage and increased insurance costs could adversely impact our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.
we currently have general liability and property insurance in place to cover certain of our facilities in amounts that we consider appropriate. such policies are subject to certain limits and deductibles and do not include business interruption coverage. insurance coverage may not be available in the future at current costs or on commercially reasonable terms, and the insurance proceeds received for any loss of, or any damage to, any of our facilities may not be sufficient to restore the loss or damage without negative impact on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.
in common with other companies in its line of business that serve coastal regions, centerpoint houston does not have insurance covering its transmission and distribution system, other than substations, because centerpoint houston believes it to be cost prohibitive. in the future, centerpoint houston may not be able to recover the costs incurred in restoring its transmission and distribution properties following hurricanes or other disasters through issuance of storm restoration bonds or a change in its
33
regulated rates or otherwise, or any such recovery may not be timely granted. therefore, centerpoint houston may not be able to restore any loss of, or damage to, any of its transmission and distribution properties without negative impact on its results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.
enable's operations are subject to all of the risks and hazards inherent in the gathering, processing, transportation and storage of natural gas and crude oil, including:
•   damage to pipelines and plants, related equipment and surrounding properties caused by hurricanes, tornadoes, floods, fires and other natural disasters, acts of terrorism and actions by third parties;
•   inadvertent damage from construction, vehicles, farm and utility equipment;
•   leaks of natural gas, crude oil and other hydrocarbons or losses of natural gas and crude oil as a result of the malfunction of equipment or facilities;
•   ruptures, fires and explosions; and
•   other hazards that could also result in personal injury and loss of life, pollution and suspension of operations.
we and oge currently have general liability and property insurance in place to cover certain of enable's facilities in amounts that we consider appropriate. such policies are subject to certain limits and deductibles. these risks could result in substantial losses due to personal injury and/or loss of life, severe damage to and destruction of property, plant and equipment and pollution or other environmental damage. these risks may also result in curtailment or suspension of enable's operations. a natural disaster or other hazard affecting the areas in which enable operates could have a material adverse effect on enable's operations. enable is not fully insured against all risks inherent in its business. enable currently has general liability and property insurance in place to cover certain of its facilities in amounts that enable considers appropriate. such policies are subject to certain limits and deductibles. enable does not have business interruption insurance coverage for all of its operations. insurance coverage may not be available in the future at current costs or on commercially reasonable terms, and the insurance proceeds received for any loss of, or any damage to, any of enable's facilities may not be sufficient to restore the loss or damage without negative impact on its results of operations and its ability to make cash distributions.
we, centerpoint houston and cerc could incur liabilities associated with businesses and assets that we have transferred to others.
under some circumstances, we, centerpoint houston and cerc could incur liabilities associated with assets and businesses we, centerpoint houston and cerc no longer own. these assets and businesses were previously owned by reliant energy, incorporated (reliant energy), a predecessor of centerpoint houston, directly or through subsidiaries and include:
•   merchant energy, energy trading and rep businesses transferred to rri or its subsidiaries in connection with the organization and capitalization of rri prior to its initial public offering in 2001 and now owned by affiliates of nrg; and
•   texas electric generating facilities transferred to a subsidiary of texas genco holdings, inc. (texas genco) in 2002, later sold to a third party and now owned by an affiliate of nrg.
in connection with the organization and capitalization of rri (now genon), that company and its subsidiaries assumed liabilities associated with various assets and businesses reliant energy transferred to them. rri also agreed to indemnify, and cause the applicable transferee subsidiaries to indemnify, us and our subsidiaries, including centerpoint houston and cerc, with respect to liabilities associated with the transferred assets and businesses. these indemnity provisions were intended to place sole financial responsibility on rri and its subsidiaries for all liabilities associated with the current and historical businesses and operations of rri, regardless of the time those liabilities arose. if rri (now genon) were unable to satisfy a liability that has been so assumed in circumstances in which reliant energy and its subsidiaries were not released from the liability in connection with the transfer, we, centerpoint houston or cerc could be responsible for satisfying the liability.
prior to the distribution of our ownership in rri to our shareholders, cerc had guaranteed certain contractual obligations of what became rri's trading subsidiary.  when the companies separated, rri agreed to secure cerc against obligations under the guarantees rri had been unable to extinguish by the time of separation.  pursuant to such agreement, as amended in december 2007, rri (now genon) agreed to provide to cerc cash or letters of credit as security against cerc's obligations under its
34
remaining guarantees for demand charges under certain gas transportation agreements if and to the extent changes in market conditions expose cerc to a risk of loss on those guarantees based on an annual calculation, with any required collateral to be posted each december.  the undiscounted maximum potential payout of the demand charges under these transportation contracts, which will be in effect until 2018, was approximately $42 million as of december 31, 2014.  based on market conditions in the fourth quarter of 2014 at the time the most recent annual calculation was made under the agreement, genon was not obligated to post any security. if genon should fail to perform the contractual obligations, cerc could have to honor its guarantee and, in such event, any collateral then provided as security may be insufficient to satisfy cerc's obligations.
if genon were unable to meet its obligations, it could consider, among various options, restructuring under the bankruptcy laws, in which event genon might not honor its indemnification obligations and claims by genon's creditors might be made against us as its former owner.
reliant energy and rri (genon's predecessor) are named as defendants in a number of lawsuits arising out of sales of natural gas in california and other markets. although these matters relate to the business and operations of genon, claims against reliant energy have been made on grounds that include liability of reliant energy as a controlling shareholder of genon's predecessor. we, centerpoint houston or cerc could incur liability if claims in one or more of these lawsuits were successfully asserted against us, centerpoint houston or cerc and indemnification from genon were determined to be unavailable or if genon were unable to satisfy indemnification obligations owed with respect to those claims.
in connection with the organization and capitalization of texas genco (now an affiliate of nrg), reliant energy and texas genco entered into a separation agreement in which texas genco assumed liabilities associated with the electric generation assets reliant energy transferred to it. texas genco also agreed to indemnify, and cause the applicable transferee subsidiaries to indemnify, us and our subsidiaries, including centerpoint houston, with respect to liabilities associated with the transferred assets and businesses. in many cases the liabilities assumed were obligations of centerpoint houston, and centerpoint houston was not released by third parties from these liabilities. the indemnity provisions were intended generally to place sole financial responsibility on texas genco and its subsidiaries for all liabilities associated with the current and historical businesses and operations of texas genco, regardless of the time those liabilities arose. if texas genco (now an affiliate of nrg) were unable to satisfy a liability that had been so assumed or indemnified against, and provided we or reliant energy had not been released from the liability in connection with the transfer, centerpoint houston could be responsible for satisfying the liability.
in connection with our sale of texas genco, the separation agreement was amended to provide that texas genco would no longer be liable for, and we would assume and agree to indemnify texas genco against, liabilities that texas genco originally assumed in connection with its organization to the extent, and only to the extent, that such liabilities are covered by certain insurance policies held by us.
we or our subsidiaries have been named, along with numerous others, as a defendant in lawsuits filed by a number of individuals who claim injury due to exposure to asbestos. some of the claimants have worked at locations owned by us, but most existing claims relate to facilities previously owned by our subsidiaries. we anticipate that additional claims like those received may be asserted in the future. under the terms of the arrangements regarding separation of the generating business from us and our sale of that business to an affiliate of nrg, ultimate financial responsibility for uninsured losses from claims relating to the generating business has been assumed by the nrg affiliate, but we have agreed to continue to defend such claims to the extent they are covered by insurance maintained by us, subject to reimbursement of the costs of such defense by the nrg affiliate.
cyber-attacks, physical security breaches, acts of terrorism or other disruptions could adversely impact our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows or the results of operations, financial condition and cash flows of enable.
we and enable are subject to cyber- and physical security risks related to breaches in the systems and technology used (i) to manage operations and other business processes and (ii) to protect sensitive information maintained in the normal course of business. the operation of our electric transmission and distribution system is dependent on not only physical interconnection of our facilities, but also on communications among the various components of our system.  as we deploy smart meters and the intelligent grid, reliance on communication between and among those components increases.  similarly, the distribution of natural gas to our customers and the gathering, processing and transportation of natural gas or other commodities from enable's gathering, processing and pipeline facilities, are dependent on communications among enable's facilities and with third-party systems that may be delivering natural gas or other commodities into or receiving natural gas and other products from enable's facilities. disruption of those communications, whether caused by physical disruption such as storms or other natural phenomena, by failure of equipment or technology, or by manmade events, such as cyber-attacks or acts of terrorism, may disrupt our ability or enable's ability to conduct operations and control assets. cyber-attacks could also result in the loss of confidential or proprietary data or security breaches of other information technology systems that could disrupt operations and critical business functions, adversely affect reputation, and subject us or enable to possible legal claims and liability. neither we nor enable is fully insured
35
against all cyber-security risks, any of which could have a material adverse effect on either our, or enable's, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. in addition, electrical distribution and transmission facilities and gas distribution and pipeline systems may be targets of terrorist activities that could disrupt either our or enable's ability to conduct our respective businesses and have a material adverse effect on either our or enable's results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.
failure to maintain the security of personally identifiable information could adversely affect us.
in connection with our business we collect and retain personally identifiable information of our customers, shareholders and employees. our customers, shareholders and employees expect that we will adequately protect their personal information, and the united states regulatory environment surrounding information security and privacy is increasingly demanding. a significant theft, loss or fraudulent use of customer, shareholder, employee or centerpoint energy data by cyber-crime or otherwise could adversely impact our reputation and could result in significant costs, fines and litigation.
our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows may be adversely affected if we are unable to successfully operate our facilities or perform certain corporate functions.
our performance depends on the successful operation of our facilities. operating these facilities involves many risks, including:
•   operator error or failure of equipment or processes;
•   operating limitations that may be imposed by environmental or other regulatory requirements;
•   labor disputes;
•   information technology system failures that impair our information technology infrastructure or disrupt normal business operations;
•   information technology failure that affects our ability to access customer information or causes us to lose confidential or proprietary data that materially and adversely affects our reputation or exposes us to legal claims; and
•   catastrophic events such as fires, earthquakes, explosions, floods, droughts, hurricanes, terrorism, pandemic health events or other similar occurrences.
such events may result in a decrease or elimination of revenue from our facilities, an increase in the cost of operating our facilities or delays in cash collections, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and/or cash flows.
our success depends upon our ability to attract, effectively transition and retain key employees and identify and develop talent to succeed senior management.
we depend on our senior executive officers and other key personnel. our success depends on our ability to attract, effectively transition and retain key personnel. the inability to recruit and retain or effectively transition key personnel or the unexpected loss of key personnel may adversely affect our operations. in addition, because of the reliance on our management team, our future success depends in part on our ability to identify and develop talent to succeed senior management. the retention of key personnel and appropriate senior management succession planning will continue to be critically important to the successful implementation of our strategies.
failure to attract and retain an appropriately qualified workforce could adversely impact our results of operations.
our business is dependent on our ability to recruit, retain, and motivate employees. certain circumstances, such as an aging workforce without appropriate replacements, a mismatch of existing skillsets to future needs, or the unavailability of contract resources may lead to operating challenges such as a lack of resources, loss of knowledge or a lengthy time period associated with skill development. our costs, including costs for contractors to replace employees, productivity costs and safety costs, may rise. failure to hire and adequately train replacement employees, including the transfer of significant internal historical knowledge and expertise to the new employees, or the future availability and cost of contract labor may adversely affect the ability to manage and operate our business. if we are unable to successfully attract and retain an appropriately qualified workforce, our results of operations could be negatively affected.
36
climate change legislation and regulatory initiatives could result in increased operating costs and reduced demand for our services or enable's services.
the united states congress has from time to time considered adopting legislation to reduce emissions of ghgs, and there has been a wide-ranging policy debate, both nationally and internationally, regarding the impact of these gases and possible means for their regulation.  in addition, efforts have been made and continue to be made in the international community toward the adoption of international treaties or protocols that would address global climate change issues, such as the most recent united nations climate change conference in lima, peru, in 2014. following a finding by the epa that certain ghgs represent an endangerment to human health, the epa adopted two sets of rules regulating ghg emissions under the clean air act, one that requires a reduction in emissions of ghgs from motor vehicles and another that regulates emissions of ghgs from certain large stationary sources. in addition, the epa expanded its existing ghg emissions reporting requirements to include upstream petroleum and natural gas systems that emit 25,000 metric tons or more of co2 equivalent per year. these permitting and reporting requirements could lead to further regulation of ghgs by the epa.  as a distributor and transporter of natural gas, or a consumer of natural gas in its pipeline and gathering businesses, cerc's or enable's revenues, operating costs and capital requirements, as applicable, could be adversely affected as a result of any regulatory action that would require installation of new control technologies or a modification of its operations or would have the effect of reducing the consumption of natural gas.  our electric transmission and distribution business, in contrast to some electric utilities, does not generate electricity and thus is not directly exposed to the risk of high capital costs and regulatory uncertainties that face electric utilities that burn fossil fuels to generate electricity.  nevertheless, centerpoint houston's revenues could be adversely affected to the extent any resulting regulatory action has the effect of reducing consumption of electricity by ultimate consumers within its service territory. likewise, incentives to conserve energy or use energy sources other than natural gas could result in a decrease in demand for our services.
climate changes could result in more frequent and more severe weather events which could adversely affect the results of operations of our businesses.
to the extent climate changes occur, our businesses may be adversely impacted, though we believe any such impacts are likely to occur very gradually and hence would be difficult to quantify with specificity.  to the extent global climate change results in warmer temperatures in our service territories, financial results from our natural gas distribution businesses could be adversely affected through lower gas sales, and our gas transmission and field services businesses could experience lower revenues. another possible climate change is more frequent and more severe weather events, such as hurricanes or tornadoes.  since many of our facilities are located along or near the gulf coast, increased or more severe hurricanes or tornadoes could increase our costs to repair damaged facilities and restore service to our customers.  when we cannot deliver electricity or natural gas to customers or our customers cannot receive our services, our financial results can be impacted by lost revenues, and we generally must seek approval from regulators to recover restoration costs.  to the extent we are unable to recover those costs, or if higher rates resulting from our recovery of such costs result in reduced demand for our services, our future financial results may be adversely impacted.
aging infrastructure may lead to increased costs and disruptions in operations that could negatively impact our financial results.
centerpoint energy has risks associated with aging infrastructure assets. the age of certain of our assets may result in a need for replacement, or higher level of maintenance costs as a result of our risk based federal and state compliant integrity management programs.  failure to achieve timely recovery of these expenses could adversely impact revenues and could result in increased capital expenditures or expenses.
the operation of our facilities depends on good labor relations with our employees.
several of our businesses have entered into and have in place collective bargaining agreements with different labor unions. there are seven separate bargaining units in centerpoint energy, each with a unique collective bargaining agreement.  these contracts will be renegotiated over the next two years.  any failure to reach an agreement on new labor contracts or to negotiate these labor contracts might result in strikes, boycotts or other labor disruptions. these potential labor disruptions could have a material adverse effect on our businesses, results of operations and/or cash flows. labor disruptions, strikes or significant negotiated wage and benefit increases, whether due to union activities, employee turnover or otherwise, could have a material adverse effect on our businesses, results of operations and/or cash flows.
37
our businesses will continue to have to adapt to technological change and may not be successful or may have to incur significant expenditures to adapt to technological change.
we operate in businesses that require sophisticated data collection, processing systems, software and other technology. some of the technologies supporting the industries we serve are changing rapidly. we expect that new technologies will emerge or grow that may be superior to, or may not be compatible with, some of our existing technologies, and may require us to make significant expenditures so that we can continue to provide cost-effective and reliable methods of energy delivery.
our future success will depend, in part, on our ability to anticipate and adapt to technological changes in a cost-effective manner and to offer, on a timely basis, reliable services that meet customer demands and evolving industry standards. if we fail to adapt successfully to any technological change or obsolescence, or fail to obtain access to important technologies or incur significant expenditures in adapting to technological change, our businesses, operating results and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected.
our or enable's merger and acquisition activities may not be successful or may result in completed acquisitions that do not perform as anticipated.
from time to time, we and enable have made and may continue to make acquisitions of businesses and assets. however, suitable acquisition candidates may not continue to be available on terms and conditions we or enable, as the case may be, find acceptable. in addition, any completed or future acquisitions involve substantial risks, including the following:
•   acquired businesses or assets may not produce revenues, earnings or cash flow at anticipated levels;
•   acquired businesses or assets could have environmental, permitting or other problems for which contractual protections prove inadequate;
•   we or enable may assume liabilities that were not disclosed to us, that exceed our estimates, or for which our rights to indemnification from the seller are limited;
•   we or enable may be unable to integrate acquired businesses successfully and realize anticipated economic, operational and other benefits in a timely manner, which could result in substantial costs and delays or other operational, technical or financial problems; and
•   acquisitions, or the pursuit of acquisitions, could disrupt ongoing businesses, distract management, divert resources and make it difficult to maintain current business standards, controls and procedures.
we are involved in numerous legal proceedings, the outcome of which are uncertain, and resolutions adverse to us could negatively affect our financial results.
we are subject to numerous legal proceedings, the most significant of which are summarized in footnote 14 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements. litigation is subject to many uncertainties, and we cannot predict the outcome of individual matters with assurance. final resolution of these matters may require additional expenditures over an extended period of time that may be in excess of established reserves and may have a material adverse effect on our financial results.
item 7.   management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis should be read in combination with our consolidated financial statements included in item 8 herein.
overview background we are a public utility holding company. our operating subsidiaries own and operate electric transmission and distribution facilities and natural gas distribution facilities and own interests in enable midstream partners, lp (enable) as described below. our indirect wholly owned subsidiaries include:
•   centerpoint energy houston electric, llc (centerpoint houston), which engages in the electric transmission and distribution business in a 5,000-square mile area of the texas gulf coast that includes the city of houston; and
•   centerpoint energy resources corp. (cerc corp. and, together with its subsidiaries, cerc), which owns and operates natural gas distribution systems. a wholly owned subsidiary of cerc corp. offers variable and fixed-price physical natural gas supplies primarily to commercial and industrial customers and electric and gas utilities. as of december 31, 2014, cerc corp. also owned approximately 55.4% of the limited partner interests in enable, which owns, operates and develops natural gas and crude oil infrastructure assets.
business segments in this management's discussion and analysis, we discuss our results from continuing operations on a consolidated basis and individually for each of our business segments. we also discuss our liquidity, capital resources and certain critical accounting policies. we are first and foremost an energy delivery company and it is our intention to remain focused on these segments of the energy business. the results of our business operations are significantly impacted by weather, customer growth, economic conditions, cost management, competition, rate proceedings before regulatory agencies and other actions of the various regulatory agencies to whose jurisdiction we are subject. our electric transmission and distribution services are subject to rate regulation and are reported in the electric transmission & distribution business segment, as are impacts of generation-related stranded costs and other true-up balances recoverable by the regulated electric utility. our natural gas distribution services are also subject to rate regulation and are reported in the natural gas distribution business segment. the results of our midstream investments segment are dependent upon the results of enable, which are driven primarily by the volume of natural gas that enable gathers, processes and transports across its systems and other factors as discussed below under "- factors influencing our midstream investments segment." a summary of our reportable business segments as of december 31, 2014 is set forth below:
electric transmission & distribution our electric transmission and distribution operations provide electric transmission and distribution services to retail electric providers (reps) serving over two million metered customers in a 5,000-square-mile area of the texas gulf coast that has a population of approximately six million people and includes the city of houston.
on behalf of reps, centerpoint houston delivers electricity from power plants to substations, from one substation to another and to retail electric customers in locations throughout centerpoint houston's certificated service territory. the electric reliability council of texas, inc. (ercot) serves as the regional reliability coordinating council for member electric power systems in texas. ercot membership is open to consumer groups, investor and municipally-owned electric utilities, rural electric cooperatives, independent generators, power marketers, river authorities and reps. the ercot market represents approximately 85% of the demand for power in texas and is one of the nation's largest power markets. transmission and distribution services are provided under tariffs approved by the public utility commission of texas (texas utility commission).
42
natural gas distribution cerc owns and operates our regulated natural gas distribution business (ngd), which engages in intrastate natural gas sales to, and natural gas transportation for, approximately 3.4 million residential, commercial and industrial customers in arkansas, louisiana, minnesota, mississippi, oklahoma and texas.
energy services cerc's operations also include non-rate regulated natural gas sales to, and transportation services for, commercial and industrial customers in 23 states in the central united states.
midstream investments we have a significant equity investment in enable, an unconsolidated subsidiary that owns, operates and develops natural gas and crude oil assets. our midstream investments segment includes equity earnings associated with the operations of enable and a 0.1% interest in southeast supply header, llc (sesh) owned by cerc.
other operations our other operations business segment includes office buildings and other real estate used in our business operations and other corporate operations which support all of our business operations.
executive summary factors influencing our businesses we are an energy delivery company. the majority of our revenues are generated from the sale of natural gas and the transmission and delivery of electricity by our subsidiaries. we do not own or operate electric generating facilities or make retail sales to end-use electric customers. to assess our financial performance, our management primarily monitors operating income and cash flows from our business segments. within these broader financial measures, we monitor margins, operation and maintenance expense, interest expense, capital spending and working capital requirements. in addition to these financial measures we also monitor a number of variables that management considers important to the operation of our business segments, including the number of customers, throughput, use per customer, commodity prices and heating and cooling degree days. we also monitor system reliability, safety factors and customer satisfaction to gauge our performance.
to the extent adverse economic conditions affect our suppliers and customers, results from our energy delivery businesses may suffer.  reduced demand and lower energy prices could lead to financial pressure on some of our customers who operate within the energy industry. also, adverse economic conditions, coupled with concerns for protecting the environment, may cause consumers to use less energy or avoid expansions of their facilities, resulting in less demand for our services.
performance of our electric transmission & distribution and natural gas distribution business segments is significantly influenced by the number of customers and energy usage per customer. weather conditions can have a significant impact on energy usage, and we compare our results on a weather adjusted basis.  in 2012, we generally experienced normal weather in the summer months. however, every state in which we distribute natural gas had the warmest winter on record. in 2013, we experienced a colder than normal spring and very cold weather in november and december in houston and all of the states in which we have gas customers. the cooler weather continued into 2014 and throughout the year, resulting in a colder than normal january and february and milder temperatures for the rest of the year, including the summer months, in the houston area. long term national trends indicate customers have reduced their energy consumption, and reduced consumption can adversely affect our results. however, due to more affordable energy prices and continued economic improvement in the areas we serve, the trend toward lower usage has slowed in some of the areas we serve.  in addition, in many of our service areas, particularly in the houston area and in minnesota, we have benefited from a growth in the number of customers that also tends to mitigate the effects of reduced consumption.  we anticipate that this trend will continue as the regions' economies continue to grow.  the profitability of our businesses is influenced significantly by the regulatory treatment we receive from the various state and local regulators who set our electric and gas distribution rates.
our energy services business segment contracts with customers for transportation, storage and sales of natural gas on an unregulated basis.  its operations serve customers in the central united states.  the segment benefits from favorable price differentials, either on a geographic basis or on a seasonal basis. while this business utilizes financial derivatives to hedge its exposure to price movements, it does not engage in speculative or proprietary trading and maintains a low value at risk level, or
43
var, to avoid significant financial exposures.  in 2014, basis volatility created asset optimization revenues not experienced in many years and the extreme cold weather increased throughput and margin from our weather sensitive customers. lower geographic and seasonal price differentials during 2013 and 2012 adversely affected results for this business segment.
the nature of our businesses requires significant amounts of capital investment, and we rely on internally generated cash, borrowings under our credit facilities, proceeds from commercial paper and issuances of debt and equity in the capital markets to satisfy these capital needs. we strive to maintain investment grade ratings for our securities in order to access the capital markets on terms we consider reasonable. a reduction in our ratings generally would increase our borrowing costs for new issuances of debt, as well as borrowing costs under our existing revolving credit facilities, and may prevent us from accessing the commercial paper markets. disruptions in the financial markets can also affect the availability of new capital on terms we consider attractive. in those circumstances, companies like us may not be able to obtain certain types of external financing or may be required to accept terms less favorable than they would otherwise accept. for that reason, we seek to maintain adequate liquidity for our businesses through existing credit facilities and prudent refinancing of existing debt.
we expect to make contributions to our pension plans aggregating approximately $66 million in 2015 and may need to make larger contributions in subsequent years. consistent with the regulatory treatment of such costs, we can defer the amount of pension expense that differs from the level of pension expense included in our base rates for our electric transmission & distribution business segment and ngd in texas.
factors influencing our midstream investments segment the results of our midstream investments segment are primarily dependent upon the results of enable, which are driven primarily by the volume of natural gas that enable gathers, processes and transports across its systems, which depends significantly on the level of production from natural gas wells connected to its systems across a number of u.s. mid-continent markets. aggregate production volumes are affected by the overall amount of oil and gas drilling and completion activities, as production must be maintained or increased by new drilling or other activity, because the production rate of oil and gas wells declines over time.
oil and gas producers' willingness to engage in new drilling is determined by a number of factors, the most important of which are the prevailing and projected prices of natural gas, ngls and crude oil, the cost to drill and operate a well, the availability and cost of capital and environmental and government regulations. prices of natural gas, crude oil, and ngls have historically experienced periods of significant volatility. enable's results are also impacted by commodity price differentials between receipt and delivery points on its systems across the various markets that it serves. enable has attempted to mitigate the impact of commodity prices on its business by entering into hedges, focusing on contracting fee-based business, and converting existing commodity-based contracts to fee-based contracts. recently, the prices of crude oil, ngls and natural gas have declined significantly. should lower commodity prices persist, enable's future volumes and cash flows may be negatively impacted. the level of drilling is expected to positively correlate with long-term trends in commodity prices. similarly, production levels nationally and regionally generally tend to positively correlate with drilling activity.
over the past several years, there has been a fundamental shift in u.s. natural gas and crude oil production towards tight gas formations and shale plays. the emergence of these plays and advancements in technology have been crucial factors that have allowed producers to efficiently extract significant volumes of natural gas, ngls and crude oil. recently, declining crude oil and natural gas liquids prices have resulted in current and anticipated decreases in crude oil and natural gas drilling activity. should lower prices and producer activity persist for a sustained period, enable's future volumes and cash flows may be negatively impacted. to maintain and increase throughput volumes on its systems, enable must continue to contract its capacity to shippers, including producers and marketers. enable's transportation and storage systems compete for customers based on the type of service a customer needs, operating flexibility, receipt and delivery points and geographic flexibility and available capacity and price. to maintain and increase enable's transportation and storage volumes, it must continue to contract its capacity to shippers, including producers, marketers, ldcs, power generators and industrial end-users.
natural gas continues to be a critical component of energy supply and demand in the united states. over the long term, enable's management believes that the prospects for continued natural gas demand are favorable and will be driven by population and economic growth, as well as the continued displacement of coal-fired electricity generation by natural gas-fired electricity generation due to the low prices of natural gas and stricter government environmental regulations on the mining and burning of coal. according to the u.s. energy information administration (eia), demand for natural gas in the electric power sector is projected to increase from approximately 9.3 tcf in 2012 to approximately 11.2 tcf in 2040, with a portion of the growth attributable to the retirement of 50 gigawatts of coal-fired capacity by 2020. the eia also projects that natural gas consumption in the industrial sector will be higher due to the rejuvenation of the industrial sector as it benefits from low natural gas prices. however, the eia expects growth in natural gas consumption for power generation and in the industrial sector to be partially offset by decreased
44
usage in the residential sector. enable's management believes that increasing consumption of natural gas over the long term will continue to drive demand for enable's natural gas gathering, processing, transportation and storage services.
enable depends on access to the capital markets to fund expansion capital expenditures. historically, unit prices of publicly traded midstream master limited partnerships have experienced periods of volatility. in addition, because enable's common units are yield-based securities, rising market interest rates could impact the relative attractiveness of enable's common units to investors. capital market volatility could limit enable's ability to timely issue units or debt on satisfactory terms, or at all, which may limit its ability to expand its operations or make future acquisitions. our midstream investments segment currently includes a 0.1% interest in sesh owned by cerc that may be contributed by cerc to enable in the future, upon exercise of certain put or call rights under which cerc would contribute to enable cerc's retained interest in sesh.
significant events enable initial public offering. on april 16, 2014, enable midstream partners, lp (enable) completed its initial public offering (ipo) of 28,750,000 common units at a price of $20.00 per unit, which included 3,750,000 common units sold by arclight capital partners, llc (arclight) pursuant to an over-allotment option that was fully exercised by the underwriters. enable received $464 million in net proceeds from the sale of the units, after deducting underwriting fees, structuring fees and other offering costs.
in connection with its ipo, on march 25, 2014, enable effected a 1 for 1.279082616 reverse unit split. immediately following the unit split, centerpoint energy resources corp. (cerc corp.) owned 227,508,825 common units, representing a 58.3% limited partner interest in enable. also in connection with enable's ipo, 139,704,916 of cerc corp.'s common units were converted into subordinated units. the principal difference between enable common units and subordinated units is that in any quarter during the subordination period, holders of the subordinated units are not entitled to receive any distribution of available cash until the common units have received the minimum quarterly distribution plus any arrearages in the payment of the minimum quarterly distribution from prior quarters. if enable does not pay distributions on its subordinated units, the subordinated units will not accrue arrearages for those unpaid distributions. at the end of the subordination period, centerpoint energy's subordinated units in enable will be converted to common units in enable on a one-for-one basis.
subsequent to the ipo, enable continues to be controlled jointly by centerpoint energy and oge; each own 50% of the management rights in the general partner of enable. centerpoint energy and oge also own a 40% and 60% economic interest, respectively, in the incentive distribution rights held by the general partner of enable.
as a result of enable's ipo, centerpoint energy's limited partner interest in enable was reduced from approximately 58.3% to approximately 54.7%. centerpoint energy accounted for the dilution of its investment in enable as a result of enable's ipo as a failed partial sale of in-substance real estate. centerpoint energy did not receive any cash from enable's ipo and, as such, centerpoint energy did not recognize a gain or loss. centerpoint energy's basis difference in enable was reduced for the impact of the enable ipo.
in accordance with the enable formation agreements, centerpoint energy had certain put rights, and enable had certain call rights, exercisable with respect to the 25.05% interest in sesh retained by centerpoint energy on may 1, 2013 (closing date), under which centerpoint energy would contribute its retained interest in sesh, in exchange for a specified number of limited partner units in enable and a cash payment, payable either from centerpoint energy to enable or from enable to centerpoint energy, to the extent of changes in the value of sesh subject to certain restrictions. specifically, the rights were and are exercisable with respect to (1) a 24.95% interest in sesh (24.95% put), which closed on may 30, 2014 as discussed below and (2) a 0.1% interest in sesh, which may be exercised no earlier than june 2015 for 25,341 common units in enable.
on may 30, 2014, centerpoint energy closed its 24.95% put and contributed to enable its 24.95% interest in sesh in exchange for 6,322,457 common units of enable, which increased centerpoint energy's limited partner interest in enable from approximately 54.7% to approximately 55.4%. no cash payment was required to be made pursuant to the enable formation agreements in connection with centerpoint energy's exercise of the 24.95% put. centerpoint energy accounted for the contribution of its 24.95% interest in sesh to enable in exchange for common units of enable as a non-monetary transaction of in-substance real estate equity method investments. as such, centerpoint energy recorded the 6,322,457 common units at the historical cost of the contributed 24.95% interest in sesh of $196 million and recorded no gain or loss in connection with its exercise of the 24.95% put. as a result, centerpoint energy's basis difference in enable was reduced for the impact of its exercise of the 24.95% put.
centerpoint energy incurred natural gas expenses, including transportation and storage costs, of $130 million and $123 million, during the year ended december 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively, for transactions with enable occurring on or after the closing date.
45
as of december 31, 2014, centerpoint energy held an approximate 55.4% limited partner interest in enable consisting of 94,126,366 common units and 139,704,916 subordinated units and a 0.1% interest in sesh. on december 31, 2014, enable's common units closed at $19.39 per unit on the new york stock exchange.
debt matters. approximately $44 million aggregate principal amount of pollution control bonds issued on behalf of centerpoint energy houston electric, llc (centerpoint houston) were redeemed on march 3, 2014 at 101% of their principal amount plus accrued interest. the bonds had an interest rate of 4.25%, were scheduled to mature in 2017 and were collateralized by general mortgage bonds of centerpoint houston.
approximately $56 million aggregate principal amount of pollution control bonds issued on behalf of centerpoint houston were purchased by centerpoint houston on march 3, 2014 at 101% of their principal amount plus accrued interest pursuant to the mandatory tender provisions of the bonds. the bonds had an interest rate of 5.60% prior to centerpoint houston's purchase and have a variable rate thereafter. the bonds mature in 2027 and are collateralized by general mortgage bonds of centerpoint houston. the purchased pollution control bonds may be remarketed.
on march 17, 2014, centerpoint houston issued $600 million principal amount of 4.50% general mortgage bonds due 2044. the proceeds from the sale of the bonds were used for general limited liability company purposes, including the repayment of short-term notes payable to affiliated companies.
approximately $84 million aggregate principal amount of pollution control bonds issued on behalf of centerpoint energy houston electric, llc (centerpoint houston) were redeemed on june 2, 2014 at 100% of their principal amount plus accrued interest. the bonds had an interest rate of 4.25%, were scheduled to mature in 2017 and were collateralized by general mortgage bonds of centerpoint houston.
on september 9, 2014, our revolving credit facility and the revolving credit facilities of centerpoint houston and cerc corp. were amended to, among other things, extend the maturity date of the commitments under the credit facilities from september 9, 2018 to september 9, 2019. the amendments also reduced the swingline and letter of credit sub-facilities under each credit facility, with total commitments under each credit facility remaining unchanged.
certain factors affecting future earnings our past earnings and results of operations are not necessarily indicative of our future earnings and results of operations. the magnitude of our future earnings and results of our operations will depend on or be affected by numerous factors including:
•   state and federal legislative and regulatory actions or developments affecting various aspects of our businesses (including the businesses of enable, including, among others, energy deregulation or re-regulation, pipeline integrity and safety, health care reform, financial reform, tax legislation and actions regarding the rates charged by our regulated businesses;
•   local, state and federal legislative and regulatory actions or developments relating to the environment, including those related to global climate change;

2014 compared to 2013
net income.  we reported net income of $611 million ($1.42 per diluted share) for 2014 compared to $311 million ($0.72 per diluted share) for the same period in 2013. the increase in net income of $300 million was primarily due to a $196 million decrease in income tax expense discussed below, a $120 million increase in equity earnings of unconsolidated affiliates, a $107 million decrease in the loss on our indexed debt securities, a $13 million decrease in interest expense and a $12 million increase in other income, which were partially offset by a $75 million decrease in operating income (discussed below by segment) and a $73 million decrease in the gain on our marketable securities.
income tax expense. we reported an effective tax rate of 31.0% and 60.2% for the years ended december 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively.  the effective tax rate of 31.0% for 2014 is primarily due to a $29 million tax benefit recognized upon completion of a tax basis balance sheet review and a $13 million reversal of previously accrued taxes as a result of final positions taken in the 2013 tax returns.  we determined the impact of the $29 million adjustment was not material to any prior period or the year ended december 31, 2014.  the effective tax rate of 60.2% for 2013 is primarily attributable to a net $196 million charge to deferred tax expense due to the formation of enable. for more information, see note 13 to our consolidated financial statements.
2013 compared to 2012
net income.  we reported net income of $311 million ($0.72 per diluted share) for 2013 compared to $417 million ($0.97 per diluted share) for the same period in 2012. the decrease in net income of $106 million was primarily due to a $136 million non-cash step acquisition gain related to the acquisition of an additional 50% interest in waskom in 2012, a $130 million increase in income tax expense discussed below, a $122 million increase in the loss on our indexed debt securities and a $28 million decrease in operating income (discussed below by segment). operating income in 2012 included a $252 million non-cash goodwill impairment charge. these decreases were partially offset by a $157 million increase in equity earnings of unconsolidated affiliates, a $85 million decrease in interest expense and a $82 million increase in the gain on our marketable securities.
income tax expense. we reported an effective tax rate of 60.2% for 2013 compared to 44.9% for the same period in 2012. our effective tax rate for 2013 increased by 15.3% primarily as a result of the formation of enable with deferred tax expense of $225 million related to the book-to-tax basis difference for contributed non-tax deductible goodwill and a tax benefit of $29 million
48
associated with the remeasurement of state deferred taxes at formation. in addition, we recognized a tax benefit of $8 million based on the settlement with the internal revenue service (irs) of outstanding tax claims for the 2002 and 2003 audit cycles. our effective tax rate for 2013 was approximately 36.2% excluding the tax effects from the adjustments described above.
our effective tax rate for 2012 of 44.9% was primarily impacted by an increase in tax expense of $88 million related to the non-tax deductible impairment of goodwill of $252 million and a reduction in tax expense of $28 million for the release of tax reserves settled with the irs. our effective tax rate for 2012 was approximately 37% excluding the tax effects from the adjustments described above.

2014 compared to 2013.  our electric transmission & distribution business segment reported operating income of $595 million for 2014, consisting of $477 million from our regulated electric transmission and distribution utility operations (tdu) and $118 million related to transition and system restoration bond companies. for 2013, operating income totaled $607 million, consisting of $474 million from the tdu and $133 million related to transition and system restoration bond companies. tdu operating income increased $3 million due to customer growth ($33 million) from the addition of almost 55,000 new customers, higher equity return ($23 million), primarily related to true-up proceeds and higher energy efficiency performance bonus ($15 million), partially offset by increased labor and support services costs ($21 million), increased contracts and services ($19 million), lower right of way revenues ($8 million), increased depreciation ($8 million), an adjustment to our claims liability reserve ($6 million) and decreased usage ($5 million), primarily due to milder weather. increased transmission costs of $168 million were largely offset by increased transmission revenue.
2013 compared to 2012.  our electric transmission & distribution business segment reported operating income of $607 million for 2013, consisting of $474 million from the tdu and $133 million related to transition and system restoration bond companies. for 2012, operating income totaled $639 million, consisting of $492 million from the tdu and $147 million related to transition and system restoration bond companies. tdu operating income decreased $18 million due to decreased usage ($13 million), primarily due to unfavorable weather, increased taxes other than income taxes ($11 million), increased depreciation ($10 million, excluding $8 million from increased investment in ams offset by the related revenues), increased labor and benefits costs ($7 million), increased contracts and services ($4 million), increased support services ($4 million) and increased insurance costs

2014 compared to 2013.  our natural gas distribution business segment reported operating income of $287 million for 2014 compared to $263 million for 2013. operating income increased $24 million primarily due to increased usage as a result of colder weather compared to the prior year, partially mitigated by weather hedges and weather normalization adjustments ($16 million), rate increases ($37 million) and increased economic activity across our footprint including the addition of approximately 36,000 customers ($10 million). these increases were partially offset by increased contractor expense, including pipeline integrity work ($10 million), higher depreciation and amortization ($16 million), an increase in taxes ($7 million), and increased other operating expenses ($6 million). increased expense related to energy efficiency programs ($8 million) and increased expense related to higher gross receipt taxes ($4 million) were offset by a corresponding increase in the related revenues.
2013 compared to 2012.  our natural gas distribution business segment reported operating income of $263 million for 2013 compared to $226 million for 2012. operating income increased $37 million primarily due to increased usage as a result of colder weather compared to the prior year, partially mitigated by weather hedges and weather normalization adjustments ($29 million), rate increases ($29 million), and increased economic activity across our footprint including the addition of approximately 33,000 residential customers ($7 million). these increases were partially offset by increased operating expenses ($6 million), higher bad debt expense ($5 million), higher depreciation and amortization expense ($12 million) and an increase in taxes ($5 million), primarily attributable to property taxes. increased expense related to energy efficiency programs ($17 million) and increased expense related to higher gross receipt taxes ($26 million) were offset by a corresponding increase in the related revenues.

(1)   these numbers do not include approximately 9,700, 8,800 and 12,700 natural gas customers as of december 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively, that are under residential and small commercial choice programs invoiced by their host utility.
2014 compared to 2013. our energy services business segment reported operating income of $52 million compared to $13 million for 2013. the increase in operating income of $39 million was primarily due to a $31 million increase from mark-to-market accounting for derivatives associated with certain natural gas purchases and sales used to lock in economic margins. a $29 million mark-to-market gain was incurred in 2014 compared to a charge of $2 million in 2013. the remaining increase in operating income was primarily due to improved margins resulting from weather-related optimization of existing gas transportation assets, reduced fixed costs and increased throughput and price volatility.
2013 compared to 2012. our energy services business segment reported operating income of $13 million compared to $2 million for 2012, excluding the goodwill impairment charge discussed below. the increase in operating income of $11 million was primarily due to a $14 million increase from mark-to-market accounting for derivatives associated with certain natural gas purchases and sales used to lock in economic margins. a $2 million mark-to-market charge was incurred in 2013 compared to a charge of $16 million for 2012.  energy services grew both volume and customers in 2013 offsetting the impact of the lower unit margin environment.
goodwill impairment a non-cash goodwill impairment charge of $252 million for our energy services business segment was recorded in 2012. the adverse wholesale market conditions facing our energy services business, specifically the prospects for continued low geographic and seasonal price differentials for natural gas, led to a reduction in our estimate of the fair value of goodwill associated with this reporting unit.

cash provided by (used in) financing activities net cash provided by financing activities increased $828 million in 2014 compared to 2013 primarily due to decreased payments of long-term debt ($1,036 million) and increased proceeds from commercial paper ($296 million), which were partially offset by decreased proceeds from long-term debt ($450 million) and increased payments of common stock dividends ($53 million).
net cash used in financing activities increased $920 million in 2013 compared to 2012 primarily due to decreased proceeds from long-term debt ($1,445 million) and increased payments of common stock dividends ($9 million), which were partially offset by increased proceeds from commercial paper ($403 million), decreased cash paid for debt retirement ($62 million), increased short-term borrowings ($29 million), decreased payments of long-term debt ($17 million) and decreased debt issuance costs ($13 million).
future sources and uses of cash our liquidity and capital requirements are affected primarily by our results of operations, capital expenditures, debt service requirements, tax payments, working capital needs and various regulatory actions. our principal anticipated cash requirements for 2015 include the following:
•   capital expenditures of approximately $1.5 billion;
•   scheduled principal payments on transition and system restoration bonds of $372 million;
•   maturing senior notes and pollution control bonds aggregating $269 million;
•   contributions aggregating approximately $66 million to qualified and non-qualified pension plans; and
•   dividend payments on centerpoint energy common stock and interest payments on debt.
we expect that anticipated 2015 cash needs will be met with borrowings under our credit facilities, proceeds from commercial paper, proceeds from the issuance of general mortgage bonds and senior unsecured notes, anticipated cash flows from operations, a tax refund relating to 2014 bonus depreciation and distributions from enable. discretionary financing or refinancing may result in the issuance of equity or debt securities in the capital markets or the arrangement of additional credit facilities. issuances of equity or debt in the capital markets and additional credit facilities may not, however, be available to us on acceptable terms.

off-balance sheet arrangements prior to the distribution of our ownership in reliant resources, inc. (rri) to our shareholders, cerc had guaranteed certain contractual obligations of what became rri's trading subsidiary.  when the companies separated, rri agreed to secure cerc against obligations under the guarantees rri had been unable to extinguish by the time of separation.  pursuant to such agreement, as amended in december 2007, rri (now genon energy, inc. (genon)) agreed to provide to cerc cash or letters of credit as security against cerc's obligations under its remaining guarantees for demand charges under certain gas transportation agreements if and to the extent changes in market conditions expose cerc to a risk of loss on those guarantees based on an annual calculation, with any required collateral to be posted each december.  the undiscounted maximum potential payout of the demand charges under these transportation contracts, which will be in effect until 2018, was approximately $42 million as of december 31, 2014.  based on market conditions in the fourth quarter of 2014 at the time the most recent annual calculation was made under the agreement, genon was not obligated to post any security. if genon should fail to perform the contractual obligations, cerc could have to honor its guarantee and, in such event, any collateral provided as security may be insufficient to satisfy cerc's obligations.
centerpoint energy has provided guarantees (centerpoint midstream guarantees) with respect to the performance of certain obligations of enable under long-term gas gathering and treating agreements with an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of encana corporation and an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of royal dutch shell plc. as of december 31, 2014, centerpoint energy, inc. had guaranteed enable's obligations up to an aggregate amount of $100 million under these agreements. under the terms of the omnibus agreement entered into in connection with the closing of the formation of enable, enable and centerpoint energy have agreed to use commercially reasonable efforts and cooperate with each other to terminate the centerpoint midstream guarantees and to release centerpoint energy from such guarantees by causing enable or one of its subsidiaries to enter into substitute guarantees or to assume the centerpoint midstream guarantees as applicable.

the fair value of these guarantees is not material. other than the guarantees described above and operating leases, we have no off-balance sheet arrangements.
regulatory matters centerpoint houston
2008 energy efficiency cost recovery factor (eecrf) appeal. in october 2009, the public utility commission of texas (texas utility commission) issued an order disallowing recovery of a performance bonus of $2 million on approximately $10 million in 2008 energy efficiency costs expended pursuant to the terms of a settlement agreement in a prior rate case. centerpoint houston appealed the denial of the full 2008 performance bonus. centerpoint houston had also appealed similar orders by the texas utility commission providing for the partial disallowance of performance bonuses totaling approximately $5.5 million relating to centerpoint houston's 2009, 2010 and 2011 (only through august 2011) energy efficiency programs. these subsequent cases were abated pending the final outcome of the 2008 bonus appeal. in august 2013, the court of appeals reversed the texas utility commission's decision disallowing such bonuses and in january 2014, the texas supreme court declined to hear the texas utility commission's appeal. as a result of the texas supreme court's decision, in april 2014, four separate proceedings were initiated, which were later consolidated into one proceeding, at the texas utility commission to determine the amount centerpoint houston is to recover. in may 2014, parties to the proceeding entered into a unanimous stipulation agreeing to the amount to be recovered but not to the customer class recovery allocation. the parties agreed that centerpoint houston is to recover $7.5 million in performance bonus, $0.2 million in rate case expenses associated with appeals of the proceedings and at least $2.5 million in carrying costs, with final determination of carrying costs based on the timing of the decision regarding customer class recovery allocation. in august 2014, the texas utility commission entered a final order approving $10.4 million with no change regarding customer class recovery allocation. the rates became effective october 15, 2014. starting september 2011, centerpoint houston's energy efficiency programs are no longer funded pursuant to the terms of the prior settlement, and performance bonus calculations subsequent to that date are not affected by the court's decision.
2014 eecrf. on may 30, 2014, centerpoint houston filed an application for approval of an adjustment to its eecrf for 2015. centerpoint houston's requested recovery is $51.4 million composed of approximately: (1) $39.1 million in estimated 2015 program costs; (2) a performance bonus for 2013 achievements of $16.2 million; (3) $0.9 million for 2015 evaluation, measurement and verification costs; (4) a credit of $5.1 million for the over-recovery of 2013 program costs; and (5) $0.2 million in rate case expenses from the 2013 eecrf proceeding. in september 2014, the parties signed a partial stipulation
58
agreeing that centerpoint houston shall be allowed to recover the net of (1) $39.1 million in estimated 2015 program costs; (2) a performance bonus for 2013 achievements of between $15.8 million and $16.2 million, depending on the outcome of the one remaining contested issue relating to a bonus calculation; (3) $0.9 million for 2015 evaluation, measurement and verification costs; (4) a credit of $5.1 million for the over-recovery of 2013 program costs; (5) $0.2 million in rate case expenses from the 2013 eecrf proceeding; and (6) an adjustment of $57,000 to exclude certain administrative costs.  in november 2014, the texas utility commission approved the partial settlement and decided the remaining contested issue relating to the bonus calculation in centerpoint energy's favor. the effective date of the rate adjustment will be march 1, 2015.
brazos valley connection project. in july 2013, centerpoint houston and other transmission service providers submitted analyses and transmission proposals to the electric reliability council of texas (ercot) for an additional transmission path into the houston region.  in april 2014, ercot's board of directors voted to endorse a houston region transmission project and deemed it critical for reliability. the project will consist of (i) construction of a new double-circuit 345 kilovolt (kv) line spanning 130 miles, (ii) upgrades to three substations to accommodate new connections and additional capacity, and (iii) improvements to approximately 11 miles of an existing 345 kv th wharton-addicks transmission line to increase its rating.  also in april 2014, ercot staff determined that centerpoint houston would be the designated transmission service provider for the portion of the project between our zenith substation and the gibbons creek substation owned by the texas municipal power agency, consisting of approximately 60 miles of 345 kv transmission line, upgrades to the limestone and zenith substations and upgrades to 11 miles of the 345 kv th wharton-addicks transmission line (this portion of the houston region transmission project is referred to by centerpoint houston as the brazos valley connection).  other transmission service providers were designated by ercot for the portion of the project from gibbons creek substation to the limestone substation as well as the upgrades to the gibbons creek substation.  as the owner of the originating and terminating substations of the entire project, centerpoint houston appealed that determination to the texas utility commission in may 2014 and sought the right to construct, own, and maintain the entire project, except for necessary upgrades to the gibbons creek substation.  on october 17, 2014, the texas utility commission filed an order that denied centerpoint houston's appeal and upheld the april 2014 ercot decision to split the project between centerpoint houston and other transmission service providers.  ercot estimates that the capital cost of the entire houston region transmission project will be approximately $600 million, and centerpoint houston estimates that the capital costs for the brazos valley connection will be approximately $300 million.  centerpoint houston anticipates that the brazos valley connection project will be completed by mid-2018.
in may 2014, several electric generators appealed the ercot board of directors' april 2014 approval of the houston region transmission project and the determination that the project was critical for reliability in the houston region to the texas utility commission.  a hearing on the may 2014 appeal by the electric generators was held in october 2014 and in december 2014, the texas utility commission denied the generators' appeal. a motion for rehearing was filed by the electric generators on january 5, 2015, replies to the motion for rehearing were filed on january 15, 2015, and on january 21, 2015, the texas utility commission voted not to consider the motion for rehearing. centerpoint houston must obtain final approval of the project and the route for the project from the texas utility commission. centerpoint houston anticipates filing its application for approval of the project in the spring of 2015. once filed, the texas utility commission will have 180 days to rule on the application.
transmission cost of service (tcos). on march 26, 2014, centerpoint houston filed an application with the texas utility commission for an interim update of its tcos seeking an increase in annual revenue of $13.6 million based on an increase in total rate base of $184.5 million. centerpoint houston received approval from the texas utility commission during the second quarter of 2014, and rates became effective may 12, 2014. a second tcos filing, as amended, was made on november 21, 2014 seeking an increase in annual revenue of $23.5 million based on an increase in total rate base of $113.2 million.  the case is still pending before the texas utility commission.
agreement with city of houston. on june 13, 2014, centerpoint houston entered into an agreement with the city of houston, texas providing that neither centerpoint houston nor the city will initiate a base rate case for centerpoint houston earlier than december 31, 2016, subject to a $20 million force majeure provision. during that period, centerpoint houston has the right to adjust its rates through (1) the schedules and riders in its tariff approved by the texas utility commission; (2) adjustments to its distribution rates using the distribution cost recovery factor rule adopted by the texas utility commission; and (3) adjustments to its transmission rates under texas utility commission rules. centerpoint houston also has the right to propose rates for new services. this agreement is not binding on any other city within centerpoint houston's service territory or the texas utility commission.

cerc cost of service adjustment (cosa) rate adjustments. in march 2008, ngd filed a request to change its rates with the railroad commission of texas (railroad commission) and the 47 cities in its texas coast service territory, including a request for an annual cost of service adjustment mechanism, or cosa, that adjusts rates annually for changes in invested capital as well as certain operating expenses. in 2008, the railroad commission approved the implementation of rates increasing annual revenues from the texas coast service territory by approximately $3.5 million and a cosa mechanism. the approved rates were contested by a coalition of nine cities and certain state agencies in an appeal to the travis county district court. in 2010, the district court ruled that the railroad commission lacked authority to impose the approved cosa mechanism both in those nine cities and in those areas in which the railroad commission has original jurisdiction, and also found that the commission's order lacked findings to support the inclusion of certain affiliate expenses in rates. the decision by the district court placed at risk certain revenues collected pursuant to cosa mechanisms. the railroad commission and ngd appealed the court's ruling on the cosa mechanism. in october 2011, the court of appeals reversed the district court's ruling on the cosa mechanism. the cities and state agencies appealed that decision to the texas supreme court. in january 2014, the texas supreme court confirmed that the railroad commission had authority to approve the cosa rate adjustments utilized by ngd and remanded the case back to state district court. in april 2014, the district court remanded the case to the railroad commission to correct deficiencies in the commission's 2008 order related to certain affiliate expenses but affirming the commission's order in all other respects. the matter is currently pending at the railroad commission.
minnesota rate proceeding.  on august 2, 2013, ngd filed a general rate case in minnesota to increase base rates by $44.3 million (including the movement of a $15 million energy efficiency rider into base rates), based on a rate base of $700 million and return on equity (roe) of 10.3%.  in compliance with state law, ngd implemented interim rates reflecting $42.9 million dollars of the requested increase for gas used on and after october 1, 2013. this rate filing is intended to recover significant capital expenditures ngd is making in minnesota and included moving $15 million of energy efficiency expenditures to base rates. evidentiary hearings were held before an administrative law judge (alj) in january 2014. on april 9, 2014 the alj issued its findings of fact and recommendations, which support a $31.6 million revenue increase based on a 9.59% roe.  in may 2014, the minnesota public utility commission (mpuc) entered an order approving a rate increase of $33 million based on a 9.59% roe and a 52.6% equity ratio. the mpuc also authorized the implementation of a three-year pilot revenue decoupling mechanism with an effective date of july 1, 2015. ngd implemented final rates in the fourth quarter of 2014. since the adopted revenue increase is less than the interim revenue increase, a refund to customers, which had already been accrued, was completed in december 2014.
houston, south texas and beaumont/east texas gas reliability infrastructure programs (grip). ngd's houston, south texas and beaumont/east texas divisions each submitted annual grip filings on march 31, 2014. for the houston division, cerc has asked that its grip filing to recover costs related to $66.6 million in incremental capital expenditures that were incurred in 2013 be operationally suspended for one year so as to ensure earnings more consistent with those currently approved. for the south texas division, the filing is to recover costs related to $15.9 million in incremental capital expenditures that were incurred in 2013. the increase in revenue requirements for this filing period is $1.8 million annually based on an authorized rate of return of 8.75%. rates were implemented for certain customers in may 2014. in those areas in which the jurisdictional deadline was extended by regulatory action, the rates were implemented in july 2014 after final approval by the railroad commission of texas (railroad commission). for the beaumont/east texas division, the first grip filing is to recover costs related to $31.4 million in incremental capital expenditures that were incurred in 2012 and 2013. the increase in revenue requirements for this filing period is $3.0 million annually based on an authorized rate of return of 8.51%. rates were implemented for certain customers in may 2014. in those areas in which the jurisdictional deadline was extended by regulatory action, the rates were implemented in july 2014 after final approval by the railroad commission.
oklahoma performance based rate change (pbrc). in march 2014, ngd made a pbrc filing for the 2013 calendar year proposing to increase revenues by $1.5 million. on july 3, 2014, the oklahoma corporation commission approved a joint stipulation by ngd and the intervening parties resulting in a rate increase of $0.3 million, which included an adjustment to amortize over five years $1.5 million of expense incurred within the 2013 test year. new rates went into effect on july 3, 2014.
arkansas government mandated expenditure surcharge rider (gmesr).  on may 1, 2014, ngd made a filing with the arkansas public service commission (apsc) requesting to increase revenue under its interim gmesr by an additional $1.8 million.  interim rates were implemented upon filing and are subject to refund pending a final order from the apsc.
mississippi rate regulation adjustment (rra). on may 1, 2014, ngd filed for a $4.1 million rra with an adjusted roe of 9.27%.  on august 5, 2014, the mississippi public service commission approved a joint stipulation for a revenue adjustment
60
of $2.8 million, which included an adjustment to amortize over three years $0.5 million of expense incurred with the 2013 test year. new rates went into effect in september 2014.
louisiana rate stabilization plan (rsp). ngd made its 2014 louisiana rsp filings with the louisiana public service commission on october 1, 2014. the north louisiana rider rsp filing shows a revenue deficiency of $4.0 million, compared to the authorized roe of 10.25%.  the south louisiana rider rsp filing shows a revenue deficiency of $2.3 million, compared to the authorized roe of 10.5%. ngd began billing the revised rates in december 2014 subject to refund. on november 19, 2014, ngd sought permission to amend the prior year's south louisiana rsp filing to use a more representative capital structure and to adjust the filing's equity banding mechanism. on december 2, 2014, ngd sought permission for similar amendments to the prior year's north louisiana rsp filings. the louisiana public service commission has yet to take action on either request.
minneapolis franchise. in 2014, ngd provided natural gas distribution services to approximately 124,000 customers in minneapolis, minnesota under a franchise that was due to expire at the end of the year. in october 2014, the minneapolis city council unanimously approved a ten-year franchise agreement with ngd, effective january 1, 2015. the agreement is renewable for two additional five-year terms upon mutual consent of the parties. also in october 2014, the minneapolis city council unanimously approved a newly formed clean energy partnership (cep) between the city, ngd and xcel energy.  the cep board includes the mayor, two council members, the city's coordinator and two senior officials from each of the utilities.  the board's work plan will include new ideas to support developing renewable energy, increasing residential and business use of energy-efficiency programs and reducing the city's energy use.  the new franchise agreement with ngd can be terminated by the city after five years if the city finds, through a city council vote, that ngd is not acting in good faith to support the city's clean energy goals.

a decline in credit ratings could increase borrowing costs under our $1.2 billion revolving credit facility, centerpoint houston's $300 million revolving credit facility and cerc corp.'s $600 million revolving credit facility. if our credit ratings or those of centerpoint houston or cerc corp. had been downgraded one notch by each of the three principal credit rating agencies from the ratings that existed at december 31, 2014, the impact on the borrowing costs under the three revolving credit facilities would have been immaterial. a decline in credit ratings would also increase the interest rate on long-term debt to be issued in the capital markets and could negatively impact our ability to complete capital market transactions and to access the commercial paper market. additionally, a decline in credit ratings could increase cash collateral requirements and reduce earnings of our natural gas distribution and energy services business segments.
cerc corp. and its subsidiaries purchase natural gas from one of their suppliers under supply agreements that contain an aggregate credit threshold of $140 million based on cerc corp.'s s&p senior unsecured long-term debt rating of a-. under these agreements, cerc may need to provide collateral if the aggregate threshold is exceeded or if the s&p senior unsecured long-term debt rating is downgraded below bbb+.
centerpoint energy services, inc. (ces), a wholly owned subsidiary of cerc corp. operating in our  energy services business segment, provides natural gas sales and services primarily to commercial and industrial customers and electric and gas utilities throughout the central and eastern united states. in order to economically hedge its exposure to natural gas prices, ces uses derivatives with provisions standard for the industry, including those pertaining to credit thresholds. typically, the credit threshold negotiated with each counterparty defines the amount of unsecured credit that such counterparty will extend to ces. to the extent that the credit exposure that a counterparty has to ces at a particular time does not exceed that credit threshold, ces is not obligated to provide collateral. mark-to-market exposure in excess of the credit threshold is routinely collateralized by ces. as of december 31, 2014, the amount posted as collateral aggregated approximately $83 million. should the credit ratings of cerc corp. (as the credit support provider for ces) fall below certain levels, ces would be required to provide additional collateral up to the amount of its previously unsecured credit limit. we estimate that as of december 31, 2014, unsecured credit limits extended to ces by counterparties aggregated $308 million, and $1 million of such amount was utilized.
pipeline tariffs and contracts typically provide that if the credit ratings of a shipper or the shipper's guarantor drop below a threshold level, which is generally investment grade ratings from both moody's and s&p, cash or other collateral may be demanded from the shipper in an amount equal to the sum of three months' charges for pipeline services plus the unrecouped cost of any lateral built for such shipper. if the credit ratings of cerc corp. decline below the applicable threshold levels, cerc corp. might need to provide cash or other collateral of as much as $160 million as of december 31, 2014. the amount of collateral will depend on seasonal variations in transportation levels.
in september 1999, we issued zero-premium exchangeable subordinated notes due 2029 (zens) having an original principal amount of $1.0 billion of which $828 million remains outstanding at december 31, 2014. each zens note was originally exchangeable at the holder's option at any time for an amount of cash equal to 95% of the market value of the reference shares of time warner inc. common stock (tw common) attributable to such note.  the number and identity of the reference shares attributable to each zens note are adjusted for certain corporate events. on june 6, 2014, time warner inc. spun off its ownership of time inc. by distributing one share of time inc. common stock (time common) for every eight shares of tw common held on the may 23, 2014 record date. as of december 31, 2014, the reference shares for each zens note consisted of 0.5 share of tw common, 0.125505 share of time warner cable inc. (twc) common stock (twc common), 0.045455 share of aol inc. common stock (aol common) and 0.0625 share of time common.  on february 13, 2014, twc announced that it had agreed to merge with comcast corporation (comcast). in the merger, each share of twc common would be exchanged for 2.875 shares of comcast common stock (comcast common). upon the closing of the merger (assuming
63
no change in the merger consideration), the reference shares for each zens note would include 0.360827 share of comcast common in place of the current 0.125505 share of twc common. if our creditworthiness were to drop such that zens note holders thought our liquidity was adversely affected or the market for the zens notes were to become illiquid, some zens note holders might decide to exchange their zens notes for cash. funds for the payment of cash upon exchange could be obtained from the sale of the shares of tw common, twc common, aol common and time common that we own or from other sources. we own shares of tw common, twc common, aol common and time common equal to approximately 100% of the reference shares used to calculate our obligation to the holders of the zens notes. zens note exchanges result in a cash outflow because tax deferrals related to the zens notes and tw common, twc common, aol common and time common shares would typically cease when zens notes are exchanged or otherwise retired and tw common, twc common, aol common and time common shares are sold. the ultimate tax liability related to the zens notes continues to increase by the amount of the tax benefit realized each year, and there could be a significant cash outflow when the taxes are paid as a result of the retirement of the zens notes. if all zens notes had been exchanged for cash on december 31, 2014, deferred taxes of approximately $357 million would have been payable in 2014. if all the tw common, twc common, aol common and time common had been sold on december 31, 2014, capital gains taxes of approximately $278 million would have been payable in 2014.
cross defaults under our revolving credit facility, a payment default on, or a non-payment default that permits acceleration of, any indebtedness for borrowed money and certain other specified types of obligations (including guarantees) exceeding $75 million by us or any of our significant subsidiaries will cause a default. in addition, three outstanding series of our senior notes, aggregating $750 million in principal amount as of december 31, 2014, provide that a payment default by us, cerc corp. or centerpoint houston in respect of, or an acceleration of, borrowed money and certain other specified types of obligations (including guarantees), in the aggregate principal amount of $50 million, will cause a default. a default by centerpoint energy would not trigger a default under our subsidiaries' debt instruments or revolving credit facilities.
possible acquisitions, divestitures and joint ventures from time to time, we consider the acquisition or the disposition of assets or businesses or possible joint ventures or other joint ownership arrangements with respect to assets or businesses. any determination to take action in this regard will be based on market conditions and opportunities existing at the time, and accordingly, the timing, size or success of any efforts and the associated potential capital commitments are unpredictable. we may seek to fund all or part of any such efforts with proceeds from debt and/or equity issuances. debt or equity financing may not, however, be available to us at that time due to a variety of events, including, among others, maintenance of our credit ratings, industry conditions, general economic conditions, market conditions and market perceptions.
enable midstream partners certain of the entities contributed to enable by cerc corp. are obligated on approximately $363 million of indebtedness owed to a wholly owned subsidiary of cerc corp. that is scheduled to mature in 2017.
following its ipo in april 2014, enable is expected to pay a minimum quarterly distribution of $0.2875 per unit on its outstanding units to the extent it has sufficient cash from operations after establishment of cash reserves and payment of fees and expenses, including payments to its general partner and its affiliates (referred to as "available cash") within 45 days after the end of each quarter. on january 23, 2015, enable declared a quarterly cash distribution of $0.30875 per unit on all of its outstanding common and subordinated units for the quarter ended december 31, 2014. accordingly, cerc corp. expects to receive a cash distribution of approximately $72 million from enable in the first quarter of 2015 to be made with respect to cerc corp.'s limited partner interest in enable for the fourth quarter of 2014.
dodd-frank swaps regulation we use derivative instruments such as physical forward contracts, swaps and options to mitigate the impact of changes in commodity prices and weather on our operating results and cash flows. following enactment of the dodd-frank wall street reform and consumer protection act (dodd-frank) in july 2010, the commodity futures trading commission (cftc) has promulgated regulations to implement dodd-frank's changes to the commodity exchange act, including the definition of commodity-based swaps subject to those regulations.  the cftc regulations are intended to implement new reporting and record keeping requirements related to their swap transactions and a mandatory clearing and exchange-execution regime for various types, categories or classes of swaps, subject to certain exemptions, including the trade-option and end-user exemptions. although we anticipate that most, if not all, of our swap transactions should qualify for an exemption to the clearing and
64
exchange-execution requirements, we will still be subject to record keeping and reporting requirements. other changes to the commodity exchange act made as a result of dodd-frank and the cftc's implementing regulations could increase the cost of entering into new swaps.
collection of receivables from reps centerpoint houston's receivables from the distribution of electricity are collected from reps that supply the electricity centerpoint houston distributes to their customers. adverse economic conditions, structural problems in the market served by ercot or financial difficulties of one or more reps could impair the ability of these reps to pay for centerpoint houston's services or could cause them to delay such payments. centerpoint houston depends on these reps to remit payments on a timely basis, and any delay or default in payment by reps could adversely affect centerpoint houston's cash flows. in the event of a rep's default, centerpoint houston's tariff provides a number of remedies, including the option for centerpoint houston to request that the texas utility commission suspend or revoke the certification of the rep. applicable regulatory provisions require that customers be shifted to another rep or a provider of last resort if a rep cannot make timely payments. however, centerpoint houston remains at risk for payments related to services provided prior to the shift to the replacement rep or the provider of last resort. if a rep were unable to meet its obligations, it could consider, among various options, restructuring under the bankruptcy laws, in which event such rep might seek to avoid honoring its obligations, and claims might be made against centerpoint houston involving payments it had received from such rep. if a rep were to file for bankruptcy, centerpoint houston may not be successful in recovering accrued receivables owed by such rep that are unpaid as of the date the rep filed for bankruptcy. however, texas utility commission regulations authorize utilities, such as cehe, to defer bad debts resulting from defaults by reps for recovery in future rate cases, subject to a review of reasonableness and necessity.
other factors that could affect cash requirements in addition to the above factors, our liquidity and capital resources could be affected by:
•   cash collateral requirements that could exist in connection with certain contracts, including our weather hedging arrangements, and gas purchases, gas price and gas storage activities of our natural gas distribution and energy services business segments;
•   acceleration of payment dates on certain gas supply contracts, under certain circumstances, as a result of increased gas prices and concentration of natural gas suppliers;
•   increased costs related to the acquisition of natural gas;
•   increases in interest expense in connection with debt refinancings and borrowings under credit facilities;
•   various legislative or regulatory actions;
•   incremental collateral, if any, that may be required due to regulation of derivatives;
•   the ability of genon and its subsidiaries to satisfy their obligations in respect of genon's indemnity obligations to us and our subsidiaries;
•   the ability of reps, including rep affiliates of nrg energy, inc. and energy future holdings corp., to satisfy their obligations to us and our subsidiaries;
•   slower customer payments and increased write-offs of receivables due to higher gas prices or changing economic conditions;
•   the outcome of litigation brought by and against us;
•   contributions to pension and postretirement benefit plans;
•   restoration costs and revenue losses resulting from future natural disasters such as hurricanes and the timing of recovery of such restoration costs; and
•   various other risks identified in "risk factors" in item 1a of part i of this report.
65
certain contractual limits on our ability to issue securities and borrow money centerpoint houston's revolving credit facility limits centerpoint houston's consolidated debt (excluding transition and system restoration bonds) to an amount not to exceed 65% of its consolidated capitalization. cerc corp.'s revolving credit facility limits cerc's consolidated debt to an amount not to exceed 65% of its consolidated capitalization. our revolving credit facility limits our consolidated debt (excluding transition and system restoration bonds) to an amount not to exceed 65% of our consolidated capitalization. the financial covenant limit in our revolving credit facility will temporarily increase from 65% to 70% if centerpoint houston experiences damage from a natural disaster in its service territory that meets certain criteria. additionally, centerpoint houston has contractually agreed that it will not issue additional first mortgage bonds, subject to certain exceptions.
critical accounting policies a critical accounting policy is one that is both important to the presentation of our financial condition and results of operations and requires management to make difficult, subjective or complex accounting estimates. an accounting estimate is an approximation made by management of a financial statement element, item or account in the financial statements. accounting estimates in our historical consolidated financial statements measure the effects of past business transactions or events, or the present status of an asset or liability. the accounting estimates described below require us to make assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the estimate is made. additionally, different estimates that we could have used or changes in an accounting estimate that are reasonably likely to occur could have a material impact on the presentation of our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. the circumstances that make these judgments difficult, subjective and/or complex have to do with the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. estimates and assumptions about future events and their effects cannot be predicted with certainty. we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments. these estimates may change as new events occur, as more experience is acquired, as additional information is obtained and as our operating environment changes. our significant accounting policies are discussed in note 2 to our consolidated financial statements. we believe the following accounting policies involve the application of critical accounting estimates. accordingly, these accounting estimates have been reviewed and discussed with the audit committee of the board of directors.
accounting for rate regulation accounting guidance for regulated operations provides that rate-regulated entities account for and report assets and liabilities consistent with the recovery of those incurred costs in rates if the rates established are designed to recover the costs of providing the regulated service and if the competitive environment makes it probable that such rates can be charged and collected. our electric transmission & distribution business segment and our natural gas distribution business segment apply this accounting guidance. certain expenses and revenues subject to utility regulation or rate determination normally reflected in income are deferred on the balance sheet as regulatory assets or liabilities and are recognized in income as the related amounts are included in service rates and recovered from or refunded to customers.  regulatory assets and liabilities are recorded when it is probable that these items will be recovered or reflected in future rates.  determining probability requires significant judgment on the part of management and includes, but is not limited to, consideration of testimony presented in regulatory hearings, proposed regulatory decisions, final regulatory orders and the strength or status of applications for rehearing or state court appeals.  if events were to occur that would make the recovery of these assets and liabilities no longer probable, we would be required to write off or write down these regulatory assets and liabilities.  at december 31, 2014, we had recorded regulatory assets of $3.5 billion and regulatory liabilities of $1.2 billion.
impairment of long-lived assets, including identifiable intangibles, goodwill and equity method investments we review the carrying value of our long-lived assets, including identifiable intangibles, goodwill and equity method investments whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that such carrying values may not be recoverable, and at least annually for goodwill as required by accounting guidance for goodwill and other intangible assets. a loss in value of an equity method investment is recognized when the decline is deemed to be other than temporary.  unforeseen events and changes in market conditions could have a material effect on the value of long-lived assets, including intangibles, goodwill and equity method investments due to changes in estimates of future cash flows, interest rate and regulatory matters and could result in an impairment charge. we recorded goodwill impairment of $-0- during 2014 and 2013, and $252 million during 2012. we did not record material impairments to long-lived assets, including intangibles, or equity method investments during 2014, 2013, and 2012.
66
we performed our annual goodwill impairment test in the third quarter of 2014 and determined, based on the results of the first step, using the income approach, no impairment charge was required for any reporting unit.  our reporting units approximate our reportable segments.
fair value is the amount at which the asset could be bought or sold in a current transaction between willing parties and may be estimated using a number of techniques, including quoted market prices or valuations by third parties, present value techniques based on estimates of cash flows, or multiples of earnings or revenue performance measures. the fair value of the asset could be different using different estimates and assumptions in these valuation techniques.
the determination of fair value requires significant assumptions by management which are subjective and forward-looking in nature. to assist in making these assumptions, we utilized a third-party valuation specialist in both determining and testing key assumptions used in the valuation of each of our reporting units. we based our assumptions on projected financial information that we believe is reasonable; however, actual results may differ materially from those projections. these projected cash flows factor in planned growth initiatives, and for our natural gas distribution reporting unit, the regulatory environment. the fair value of our natural gas distribution reporting unit significantly exceeded the carrying value. the fair value of our energy services reporting unit exceeded the carrying value by approximately $50 million or approximately 14% excess fair value over the carrying value.
a key assumption in the income approach was the weighted average cost of capital of 5.5% and 5.9% applied in the valuation for natural gas distributions and energy services, respectively. an increase in the discount rate to greater than 6.5%, a decline in long-term growth rate from 3% to 2.3%, or a decrease in the aggregate cash flows of greater than 15% could have individually triggered a step-two goodwill impairment evaluation for our energy services reporting unit in 2014.
although there was not a goodwill asset impairment in our 2014 annual test, an interim impairment test could be triggered by the following: actual earnings results that are materially lower than expected, significant adverse changes in the operating environment, an increase in the discount rate, changes in other key assumptions which require judgment and are forward looking in nature, or if our market capitalization falls below book value for an extended period of time. no impairment triggers were identified subsequent to our 2014 annual test.
unbilled energy revenues revenues related to electricity delivery and natural gas sales and services are generally recognized upon delivery to customers. however, the determination of deliveries to individual customers is based on the reading of their meters, which is performed on a systematic basis throughout the month either electronically through ams meter communications or manual readings. at the end of each month, deliveries to non-ams customers since the date of the last meter reading are estimated and the corresponding unbilled revenue is estimated. information regarding deliveries to ams customers after the last billing is obtained from actual ams meter usage data. unbilled electricity delivery revenue is estimated each month based on actual ams meter data, daily supply volumes and applicable rates. unbilled natural gas sales are estimated based on estimated purchased gas volumes, estimated lost and unaccounted for gas and tariffed rates in effect. as additional information becomes available, or actual amounts are determinable, the recorded estimates are revised. consequently, operating results can be affected by revisions to prior accounting estimates.
pension and other retirement plans we sponsor pension and other retirement plans in various forms covering all employees who meet eligibility requirements. we use several statistical and other factors that attempt to anticipate future events in calculating the expense and liability related to our plans. these factors include assumptions about the discount rate, expected return on plan assets and rate of future compensation increases as estimated by management, within certain guidelines. in addition, our actuarial consultants use subjective factors such as withdrawal and mortality rates. the actuarial assumptions used may differ materially from actual results due to changing market and economic conditions, higher or lower withdrawal rates or longer or shorter life spans of participants. these differences may result in a significant impact to the amount of pension expense recorded. please read "- other significant matters - pension plans" for further discussion.
new accounting pronouncements see note 2(o) to our consolidated financial statements for a discussion of new accounting pronouncements that affect us.
67
other significant matters pension plans.  as discussed in note 6(b) to our consolidated financial statements, we maintain a non-contributory qualified defined benefit pension plan covering substantially all employees. employer contributions for the qualified plan are based on actuarial computations that establish the minimum contribution required under the employee retirement income security act of 1974 (erisa) and the maximum deductible contribution for income tax purposes.
under the terms of our pension plan, we reserve the right to change, modify or terminate the plan. our funding policy is to review amounts annually and contribute an amount at least equal to the minimum contribution required under erisa.
the minimum funding requirements for the qualified pension plan were $87 million, $83 million and $73 million for 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. we made contributions of $87 million, $83 million and $73 million in 2014, 2013 and 2012 for the respective years. we expect to make contributions aggregating approximately $35 million in 2015.
additionally, we maintain an unfunded non-qualified benefit restoration plan that allows participants to receive the benefits to which they would have been entitled under our non-contributory pension plan except for the federally mandated limits on qualified plan benefits or on the level of compensation on which qualified plan benefits may be calculated. employer contributions for the non-qualified benefit restoration plan represent benefit payments made to participants and totaled $10 million, $8 million and $9 million in 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. we expect to make contributions aggregating approximately $31 million in 2015.
changes in pension obligations and assets may not be immediately recognized as pension expense in the income statement, but generally are recognized in future years over the remaining average service period of plan participants. as such, significant portions of pension expense recorded in any period may not reflect the actual level of benefit payments provided to plan participants.
as the sponsor of a plan, we are required to (a) recognize on our balance sheet as an asset a plan's over-funded status or as a liability such plan's under-funded status, (b) measure a plan's assets and obligations as of the end of our fiscal year and (c) recognize changes in the funded status of our plans in the year that changes occur through adjustments to other comprehensive income and regulatory assets.
the projected benefit obligation for all defined benefit pension plans was $2,403 million and $2,153 million as of december 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. the adoption of the new mortality table by the society of actuaries as of december 31, 2014 significantly contributed to the increase in the projected benefit obligation for the year.
as of december 31, 2014, the projected benefit obligation exceeded the market value of plan assets of our pension plans by $478 million. changes in interest rates or the market values of the securities held by the plan during 2015 could materially, positively or negatively, change our funded status and affect the level of pension expense and required contributions.
pension cost was $77 million, $72 million and $82 million for 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively, of which $71 million, $64 million and $67 million impacted pre-tax earnings. included in the 2014 pension cost was $6 million related to the curtailment loss discussed below.
during the fourth quarter of 2014, centerpoint energy received notification from enable of its intent to provide employment offers to substantially all seconded employees. as a result, an additional pension cost of $6 million was recognized for the curtailment loss related to our pension plans. substantially all of the seconded employees became employees of enable effective january 1, 2015.
the calculation of pension expense and related liabilities requires the use of assumptions. changes in these assumptions can result in different expense and liability amounts, and future actual experience can differ from the assumptions. two of the most critical assumptions are the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets and the assumed discount rate.
as of december 31, 2014, our qualified pension plan had an expected long-term rate of return on plan assets of 6.50%, which is a 0.50% decrease from the rate assumed as of december 31, 2013 due to the increase in the allocation to fixed income investments in our targeted asset allocation. the expected rate of return assumption was developed using the targeted asset allocation of our plans and the expected return for each asset class. we regularly review our actual asset allocation and periodically rebalance plan assets to reduce volatility and better match plan assets and liabilities.
as of december 31, 2014, the projected benefit obligation was calculated assuming a discount rate of 4.05%, which is 0.75% lower than the 4.80% discount rate assumed in 2013. the discount rate was determined by reviewing yields on high-quality bonds
68
that receive one of the two highest ratings given by a recognized rating agency and the expected duration of pension obligations specific to the characteristics of our plan.
pension cost for 2015, including the benefit restoration plan, is estimated to be $80 million, of which we expect $55 million to impact pre-tax earnings, based on an expected return on plan assets of 6.50% and a discount rate of 4.05% as of december 31, 2014. if the expected return assumption were lowered by 0.50% from 6.50% to 6.00%, 2015 pension cost would increase by approximately $9 million.
as of december 31, 2014, the pension plan projected benefit obligation, including the unfunded benefit restoration plan, exceeded plan assets by $478 million.  if the discount rate were lowered by 0.50% from 4.05% to 3.55%, the assumption change would increase our projected benefit obligation by approximately $130 million and decrease our pension expense by approximately $3 million. the expected reduction in pension expense due to the decrease in discount rate is a result of the expected correlation between the reduced interest rate and appreciation of fixed income assets in pension plans with significantly more fixed income instruments than equity instruments. in addition, the assumption change would impact our consolidated balance sheet by increasing the regulatory asset recorded as of december 31, 2014 by $113 million and would result in a charge to comprehensive income in 2014 of $11 million, net of tax.
future changes in plan asset returns, assumed discount rates and various other factors related to the pension plan will impact our future pension expense and liabilities. we cannot predict with certainty what these factors will be.

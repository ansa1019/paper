item 1a.   risk factors in addition to the other information set forth in this annual report on form 10-k, you should carefully consider the following factors which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or stock price. the risks below are not the only risks we face. additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial may also adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations or stock price.
we face strong competition. our failure to successfully develop and market new products could adversely affect our business.
the medical device industry is highly competitive. we compete with many domestic and foreign medical device companies ranging from small start-up enterprises that might sell only a single or limited number of competitive products or compete only in a specific market segment, to companies that are larger and more established than us, have a broad range of competitive products, participate in numerous markets and have access to significantly greater financial and marketing resources than we do.
in addition, the medical device industry is characterized by extensive product research and development and rapid technological advances. the future success of our business will depend, in part, on our ability to design and manufacture new competitive products and enhance existing products. our product development efforts may require us to make substantial investments. there can be no assurance that unforeseen problems will not occur with respect to the development, performance or market acceptance of new technologies or products, such as our inability to:
•   identify viable new products;
•   obtain adequate intellectual property protection;
•   gain market acceptance of new products; or
•   successfully obtain regulatory approvals.
in addition, our competitors currently may be developing, or may develop in the future, products that provide better features, clinical outcomes or economic value than those that we currently offer or subsequently develop. our failure to successfully develop and market new products or enhance existing products could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
16
our customers depend on third party coverage and reimbursements and the failure of healthcare programs to provide coverage and reimbursement, or the reduction in reimbursement levels, for our medical products could adversely affect us.
the ability of our customers to obtain coverage and reimbursement for our products is important to our business. demand for many of our existing and new medical products is, and will continue to be, affected by the extent to which government healthcare programs and private health insurers reimburse our customers for patients' medical expenses in the countries where we do business. even when we develop or acquire a promising new product, demand for the product may be limited unless reimbursement approval is obtained from private and governmental third party payors. internationally, healthcare reimbursement systems vary significantly. in some countries, medical centers are constrained by fixed budgets, regardless of the extent of their patient treatment. other countries require application for, and approval of, government or third party reimbursement. without both favorable coverage determinations by, and the financial support of, government and third party insurers, the market for many of our medical products would be adversely affected. we cannot be sure that third party payors will maintain the current level of coverage and reimbursement to our customers for use of our existing products. adverse coverage determinations or any reduction in the amount of reimbursement could harm our business by reducing customers' selection of our products and the prices they are willing to pay.
in addition, as a result of their purchasing power, third party payors are implementing cost cutting measures such as seeking discounts, price reductions or other incentives from medical products suppliers and imposing limitations on coverage and reimbursement for medical technologies and procedures. these trends could compel us to reduce prices for our products and could cause a decrease in the size of the market or a potential increase in competition that could negatively affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
we may not be successful in achieving expected operating efficiencies and sustaining or improving operating expense reductions, and may experience business disruptions associated with restructuring, facility consolidations, realignment, cost reduction and other strategic initiatives.
over the past several years we have implemented a number of restructuring, realignment and cost reduction initiatives, including the realignment of our north american organizational structure, facility consolidations and reductions in our workforce. while we have realized some efficiencies from these actions, we may not realize the benefits of these initiatives to the extent we anticipated. further, such benefits may be realized later than expected, and the ongoing difficulties in implementing these measures may be greater than anticipated, which could cause us to incur additional costs or result in business disruptions. in addition, if these measures are not successful or sustainable, we may be compelled to undertake additional realignment and cost reduction efforts, which could result in significant additional charges. moreover, if our restructuring and realignment efforts prove ineffective, our ability to achieve our other strategic and business plan goals may be adversely affected.
in addition, as part of our efforts to increase operating efficiencies, we have implemented a number of initiatives over the past several years to consolidate our enterprise resource planning, or erp, systems. for example, between 2012 and 2013, we migrated our arrow business onto our principal erp system. to date, we have not experienced any significant disruptions to our business or operations in connection with these initiatives. however, as we continue our efforts to further consolidate our erp systems, we could experience business disruptions, which could adversely affect customer relationships and divert the attention of management away from daily operations. in addition, any delays in the implementation of these initiatives could cause us to incur additional unexpected costs. should we experience such difficulties, our business, cash flows and results of operations could be adversely affected.
we are subject to extensive government regulation, which may require us to incur significant expenses to ensure compliance. our failure to comply with those regulations could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.
our products are classified as medical devices and are subject to extensive regulation in the united states by the fda and by comparable government agencies in other countries. the regulations govern, among other things, the development, design, approval, manufacturing, labeling, importing and exporting and sale and marketing of many of our products. moreover, these regulations are subject to future change.
17
in the united states, before we can market a new medical device, or a new use of, or claim for, or significant modification to, an existing product, we generally must first receive either 510(k) or de novo clearance or approval of a premarket approval application, or pma, from the fda. similarly, most major markets for medical devices outside the united states also require clearance, approval or compliance with certain standards before a product can be commercially marketed. the process of obtaining regulatory clearances and approvals to market a medical device, particularly from the fda and certain foreign governmental authorities, can be costly and time consuming, and clearances and approvals might not be granted for new products on a timely basis, if at all. in addition, once a device has been cleared or approved, a new clearance or approval may be required before the device may be modified or its labeling changed. furthermore, the fda or a foreign governmental authority may make its review and clearance or approval process more rigorous, which could require us to generate additional clinical or other data, and expend more time and effort, in obtaining future product clearances or approvals. the regulatory clearance and approval process may result in, among other things, delayed realization of product revenues, substantial additional costs or limitations on indicated uses of products, any one of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. even after a product has received marketing approval or clearance, such product approval or clearance can be withdrawn or limited due to unforeseen problems with the device or issues relating to its application.
failure to comply with applicable regulations could lead to adverse effects on our business, which could include:
•   partial suspension or total shutdown of manufacturing;
•   product shortages;
•   delays in product manufacturing;
•   warning or untitled letters;
•   fines or civil penalties;
•   delays in obtaining new regulatory clearances or approvals;
•   withdrawal or suspension of required clearances, approvals or licenses;
•   product seizures or recalls;
•   injunctions;
•   criminal prosecution;
•   advisories or other field actions;
•   operating restrictions; and
•   prohibitions against exporting of products to, or importing products from, countries outside the united states.
we could be required to expend significant financial and human resources to remediate failures to comply with applicable regulations and quality assurance guidelines. in addition, civil and criminal penalties, including exclusion under medicaid or medicare, could result from regulatory violations. any one or more of these events could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
medical devices are cleared or approved for one or more specific intended uses. promoting a device for an off-label use could result in government enforcement action.
furthermore, our facilities are subject to periodic inspection by the fda and other federal, state and foreign government authorities, which require manufacturers of medical devices to adhere to certain regulations, including the fda's quality system regulation, which requires periodic audits, design controls, quality control testing and documentation procedures, as well as complaint evaluations and investigation. for example, in march 2014, we received a warning letter from the fda with respect to our arlington heights, illinois manufacturing facility. for information regarding the warning letter, see "business - government regulation" in item 1 of this report. in addition, any facilities assembling convenience kits that include drug components and are registered as drug repackaging establishments are subject to current good manufacturing practices requirements. the fda also requires the reporting of certain adverse events and may require the reporting of recalls or other field safety corrective actions. issues identified through such inspections and reports may result in fda enforcement action through any of the actions discussed above. moreover, issues identified through such inspections and reports may require significant resources to resolve.
18
we are subject to healthcare fraud and abuse laws, regulation and enforcement; our failure to comply with those laws could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.
we are subject to healthcare fraud and abuse regulation and enforcement by the federal government and the governments of those states and foreign countries in which we conduct our business. the laws that may affect our ability to operate include:
•   the federal healthcare anti-kickback statute, which, among other things, prohibits persons from knowingly and willfully offering or paying remuneration to induce either the referral of an individual for, or the purchase, order or recommendation of, any good or service for which payment may be made under federal healthcare programs such as medicare and medicaid, or soliciting payment for such referrals, purchases, orders and recommendations;
•   federal false claims laws which, among other things, prohibit individuals or entities from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, false or fraudulent claims for payment from the federal government, including medicare, medicaid or other third-party payors;
•   the federal health insurance portability and accountability act of 1996 ("hipaa"), which prohibit schemes to defraud any healthcare benefit program and false statements relating to healthcare matters; and
•   state law equivalents of each of the above federal laws, such as anti-kickback and false claims laws which may apply to items or services reimbursed by any third-party payor, including commercial insurers.
if our operations are found to be in violation of any of these laws or any other government regulations, we may be subject to penalties, including civil and criminal penalties, damages, fines, the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, the exclusion from participation in federal and state healthcare programs and imprisonment of personnel, any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our financial results. the risk of our being found to have violated these laws is increased by the fact that many of them have not been fully interpreted by the regulatory authorities or the courts, and their provisions are open to a variety of interpretations.
further, the patient protection and affordable care act, as amended by the health care and education affordability reconciliation act (collectively, the "affordable care act"), imposed new reporting and disclosure requirements on device manufacturers for any "transfer of value" made or distributed to prescribers and other healthcare providers. our first report was submitted in 2014, and the reported information was made publicly available in a searchable format in september 2014. in addition, device manufacturers are required to report and disclose any investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members during the preceding calendar year. failure to submit required information may result in civil monetary penalties for each payment, transfer of value or ownership or investment interests not reported in an annual submission, up to an aggregate of $150,000 per year (and up to an aggregate of $1 million per year for "knowing failures").
in addition, there has been a recent trend of increased federal and state regulation of payments made to healthcare providers. some states, such as california, connecticut, nevada and massachusetts, mandate implementation of compliance programs that include the tracking and reporting of gifts, compensation for consulting and other services, and other remuneration to healthcare providers. the shifting commercial compliance environment and the need to build and maintain robust and expandable systems to comply with the different compliance and/or reporting requirements among a number of jurisdictions increases the possibility that we may inadvertently violate one or more of the requirements, resulting in increased compliance costs that could adversely impact our results of operations.
19
we may incur material losses and costs as a result of product liability and warranty claims, as well as product recalls, any of which may adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. furthermore, as a medical device company, our reputation may be damaged if one or more of our products are, or are alleged to be, defective.
our businesses expose us to potential product liability risks that are inherent in the design, manufacture and marketing of our products. in particular, our medical device products are often used in surgical and intensive care settings with seriously ill patients. in addition, many of our products are designed to be implanted in the human body for varying periods of time. product defects or inadequate disclosure of product-related risks with respect to products we manufacture or sell could result in patient injury or death. in addition, in connection with the divestitures of our former non-medical businesses, we agreed to retain certain liabilities related to those businesses, which include, among other things, liability for products manufactured prior to the date on which we completed the sale of the business. product liability and warranty claims often involve very large or indeterminate amounts, including punitive damages. the magnitude of potential losses from product liability lawsuits may remain unknown for substantial periods of time, and the related legal defense costs may be significant. we could experience material warranty or product liability losses in the future and incur significant costs to defend these claims.
in addition, if any of our products are, or are alleged to be, defective, we may voluntarily participate, or be required by regulatory authorities to participate, in a recall of that product. in the event of a recall, we may lose sales and be exposed to individual or class-action litigation claims. moreover, negative publicity regarding a quality or safety issue, whether accurate or inaccurate, could harm our reputation, decrease demand for our products, lead to product withdrawals or impair our ability to successfully launch and market our products in the future. product liability, warranty and recall costs may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations the ongoing volatility in the domestic and global financial markets, combined with a continuation of constrained global credit markets could adversely impact our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.
we are subject to risks arising from adverse changes in general domestic and global economic conditions. the economic slowdown and disruption of credit markets that occurred in recent years, led to recessionary conditions and depressed levels of consumer and commercial spending, resulting in reductions, delays or canceled purchases of our products and services. while recent economic indicators suggest improvement in the global economy, we cannot predict the duration or extent of any economic recovery or the extent to which our customers will return to more typical spending behaviors. if the improvement in economic conditions does not continue, our customers may terminate existing purchase orders or reduce the volume of products or services they purchase from us.
additionally, our customers, particularly in the european region, have extended or delayed payments for products and services already provided, which has increased our focus on collectability with respect to our accounts receivable from these customers. to date, we have not experienced an inordinate amount of payment defaults by our customers, and we have sufficient lending commitments in place to enable us to fund our foreseeable additional operating needs. however, in light of the ongoing volatility in the european financial markets, combined with a continuation of constrained european credit markets there is a risk that our european customers and suppliers may be unable to access liquidity. as of december 31, 2014 and 2013, our net current and long term accounts receivable in italy, spain, portugal and greece were $76.2 million and $97.9 million, respectively. in 2014, 2013 and 2012, net revenues from these countries were approximately 8%, 8% and 9% of total net revenues, respectively, and average days that accounts receivable from these countries were outstanding were 223, 260 and 288 days, respectively. although we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts to cover the estimated losses which may occur when customers cannot make their required payments, we cannot be assured that we will continue to experience the same loss rate in the future given the volatility in the worldwide economy. if our allowance for doubtful accounts is insufficient to address receivables we ultimately determine are uncollectible, we would be required to incur additional charges, which could materially adversely affect our results of operations. moreover, our inability to collect outstanding receivables could adversely affect our financial condition and cash flow from operations.
in addition, adverse economic and financial market conditions may result in future impairment charges with respect to our goodwill and other intangible assets, which would not directly affect our liquidity but could have a material adverse effect on our reported financial results.
20
our strategic initiatives, including acquisitions, may not produce the intended growth in revenue and operating income.
our strategic initiatives include making significant investments designed to achieve revenue growth and margin improvement targets. if we do not achieve the expected benefits from these investments or otherwise fail to execute on our strategic initiatives, we may not achieve the growth improvement we are targeting and our results of operations may be adversely affected.
in addition, as part of our strategy for growth, we have made, and may continue to make, acquisitions and divestitures and enter into strategic alliances such as joint ventures and joint development agreements. however, we may not be able to identify suitable acquisition candidates, complete acquisitions or integrate acquisitions successfully, and our strategic alliances may not prove to be successful. in this regard, acquisitions involve numerous risks, including difficulties in the integration of acquired operations, technologies, services and products and the diversion of management's attention from other business concerns. even if we are successful in making an acquisition, the products and technologies that we acquire may not be successful or may require significantly greater resources and investments than we originally anticipated. we could also experience negative effects on our results of operations and financial condition from acquisition-related charges, amortization of intangible assets and asset impairment charges, and other issues that could arise in connection with the acquisition of a company or business, including issues related to internal control over financial reporting, regulatory compliance and short-term effects of increased costs on results of operations.  although our management will endeavor to evaluate the risks inherent in any particular transaction, there can be no assurance that we will identify all such risks or the magnitude of the risks. in addition, prior acquisitions have resulted, and future acquisitions could result, in the incurrence of substantial additional indebtedness and other expenses. future acquisitions may also result in potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities. there can be no assurance that difficulties encountered with acquisitions will not have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
health care reform may have a material adverse effect on our industry and our business.
political, economic and regulatory developments have effected fundamental changes in the healthcare industry. the affordable care act substantially changed the way health care is financed by both government and private insurers. it also encourages improvements in the quality of health care products and services and significantly impacts the united states pharmaceutical and medical device industries. among other things, the affordable care act:
•   established a 2.3% excise tax on sales of medical devices with respect to any entity that manufactures or imports specified medical devices offered for sale in the united states;
•   established a new patient-centered outcomes research institute to oversee, identify priorities in and conduct comparative clinical effectiveness research;
•   implemented payment system reforms, including a national pilot program to encourage hospitals, physicians and other providers to improve the coordination, quality and efficiency of certain health care services through bundled payment models; and
•   created an independent payment advisory board that will submit recommendations to reduce medicare spending if projected medicare spending exceeds a specified growth rate.
in 2014 and 2013, we paid $12.7 million and $11.5 million, respectively, with respect to the medical device excise tax. however, we cannot predict at this time the full impact of the affordable care act or other healthcare reform measures that may be adopted in the future on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flow.
we are subject to risks associated with our non-united states operations.
we have significant manufacturing and distribution facilities, research and development facilities, sales personnel and customer support operations in a number of countries outside the united states, including canada, belgium, the czech republic, france, germany, ireland, malaysia, mexico, and singapore. as of december 31, 2014, 73% of our full-time and temporary employees were employed in countries outside of the united states. as of december 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, approximately 45%, 37% and 39%, respectively, of our net property, plant and equipment was located outside the united states. in addition, for the years ended december 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012 approximately 50%, 50% and 49%, respectively, of our net revenues (based on the teleflex facility generating the sale) were derived from operations outside the united states.
21
our international operations are subject to risks inherent in doing business outside the united states, including:
•   exchange controls, currency restrictions and fluctuations in currency values;
•   trade protection measures;
•   potentially costly and burdensome import or export requirements;
•   laws and business practices that favor local companies;
•   changes in foreign medical reimbursement policies and procedures;
•   subsidies or increased access to capital for firms that currently are or may emerge as competitors in countries in which we have operations;
•   substantial foreign tax liabilities, including potentially negative consequences from changes in tax laws;
•   restrictions and taxes related to the repatriation of foreign earnings;
•   differing labor regulations;
•   additional united states and foreign government controls or regulations;
•   difficulties in the protection of intellectual property; and
•   unsettled political and economic conditions and possible terrorist attacks against american interests.
in addition, the united states foreign corrupt practices act (the "fcpa") and similar worldwide anti-bribery laws in non-united states jurisdictions generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to non-united states officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. the fcpa also imposes accounting standards and requirements on publicly traded united states corporations and their foreign affiliates, which, among other things, are intended to prevent the diversion of corporate funds to the payment of bribes and other improper payments, and to prevent the establishment of "off the books" slush funds from which such improper payments can be made. because of the predominance of government-sponsored health care systems around the world, many of our customer relationships outside of the united states are with government entities and are therefore subject to such anti-bribery laws. our policies mandate compliance with these anti-bribery laws. however, we operate in many parts of the world that have experienced government corruption to some degree.  despite meaningful measures that we undertake to facilitate lawful conduct, which include training and compliance programs and internal control policies and procedures, we may not always prevent reckless or criminal acts by our employees, distributors or other agents. in addition, we may be exposed to liability due to pre-acquisition conduct of employees, distributors or other agents of businesses or operations we may acquire. violations of anti-bribery laws, or allegations of such violations, could disrupt our operations, involve significant management distraction and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. we also could be subject to severe penalties, including criminal and civil penalties, disgorgement, further changes or enhancements to our procedures, policies and controls, personnel changes and other remedial actions.
furthermore, we are subject to the export controls and economic embargo rules and regulations of the united states, including the export administration regulations and trade sanctions against embargoed countries, which are administered by the office of foreign assets control within the department of the treasury, as well as other laws and regulations administered by the department of commerce. these regulations limit our ability to market, sell, distribute or otherwise transfer our products or technology to prohibited countries or persons. while we train our employees and contractually obligate our distributors to comply with these regulations, we cannot assure that a violation will not occur, whether knowingly or inadvertently. failure to comply with these rules and regulations may result in substantial civil and criminal penalties, including fines and the disgorgement of profits, the imposition of a court-appointed monitor, the denial of export privileges and debarment from participation in united states government contracts.
the risks relating to our foreign operations may have a material adverse effect on our international operations or on our business, results of operations and financial condition generally.
22
foreign currency exchange rate, commodity price and interest rate fluctuations may adversely affect our results.
we are exposed to a variety of market risks, including the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, commodity prices and interest rates. products manufactured in, and sold into, foreign markets represent a significant portion of our operations. our consolidated financial statements reflect translation of financial statements denominated in non-united states currencies to united states dollars, our reporting currency, as well as the foreign currency exchange gains and losses resulting from transactions denominated in non-functional currencies. when the united states dollar strengthens or weakens in relation to the foreign currencies of the countries in which we sell or manufacture our products, such as the euro, our united states dollar-reported revenue and income will fluctuate. although we have entered into forward contracts with several major financial institutions to hedge a portion of projected cash flows denominated in non-functional currencies in order to reduce the effects of currency rate fluctuations, changes in the relative values of currencies may, in some instances, have a significant effect on our results of operations.
many of our products have significant plastic resin content. we also use quantities of other commodities, such as aluminum and steel. increases in the prices of these commodities could increase the costs of our products and services. we may not be able to pass on these costs to our customers, particularly with respect to those products we sell under group purchase agreements, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows.
increases in interest rates may adversely affect the financial health of our customers and suppliers and thus adversely affect their ability to buy our products and supply the components or raw materials we need. in addition, our borrowing costs could be adversely affected if interest rates increase. any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows.
fluctuations in our effective tax rate and changes to tax laws may adversely affect our results.
as a global company, we are subject to taxation in numerous countries, states and other jurisdictions. our effective tax rate is derived from a combination of applicable tax rates in the various countries, states and other jurisdictions in which we operate. in preparing our financial statements, we estimate the amount of tax that will become payable in each of these jurisdictions. our effective tax rate may, however, differ from the estimated amount due to numerous factors, including a change in the mix of our profitability from country to country and changes in tax laws. any of these factors could cause us to experience an effective tax rate significantly different from previous periods or our current expectations, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations and cash flows.
an interruption in our manufacturing or distribution operations or our supply of raw materials may adversely affect our business.
many of our key products are manufactured at or distributed from single locations, and the availability of alternate facilities is limited. if operations at one or more of our facilities is suspended due to natural disasters or other events, we may not be able to timely manufacture or distribute one or more of our products at previous levels or at all. furthermore, our ability to establish replacement facilities or to substitute suppliers may be delayed due to regulations and requirements of the fda and other regulatory authorities regarding the manufacture of our products. in addition, in the event of delays or cancellations in shipments of raw materials by our suppliers, we may not be able to timely manufacture or supply the affected products at previous levels or at all. the manufacture of our products is highly exacting and complex, due in part to strict regulatory requirements. problems in the manufacturing process, including equipment malfunction, failure to follow specific protocols and procedures, defective raw materials and environmental factors, could lead to launch delays, product shortages, unanticipated costs, lost revenues and damage to our reputation. a failure to identify and address manufacturing problems prior to the release of products to our customers may also result in quality or safety issues.  a reduction or interruption in manufacturing or distribution, or our inability to secure suitable alternative sources of raw materials or components, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.
our ability to attract, train, develop and retain key employees is important to our success.
our success depends, in part, on our ability to continue to retain our key personnel, including our executive officers and other members of our senior management team. our success also depends, in part, on our ability to attract, train, develop and retain other key employees, including research and development, sales, marketing and operations personnel. we may experience difficulties in retaining executives and other employees due to many factors, including:
23
•   the intense competition for skilled personnel in our industry;
•   fluctuations in global economic and industry conditions;
•   changes in our organizational structure;
•   our restructuring initiatives;
•   competitors' hiring practices; and
•   the effectiveness of our compensation programs.
our inability to attract, train, develop and retain such personnel could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.
we depend upon relationships with physicians and other health care professionals.
research and development for some of our products is dependent on our maintaining strong working relationships with physicians and other healthcare professionals. we rely on these professionals to provide us with considerable knowledge and experience regarding the development and use of our products. physicians assist us as researchers, product consultants, inventors and public speakers. if we fail to maintain our working relationships with physicians and receive the benefits of their knowledge and advice, our products may not be developed in a manner that is responsive to the needs and expectations of the professionals who use and support our products, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
our technology is important to our success, and our failure to protect our intellectual property rights could put us at a competitive disadvantage.
we rely on the patent, trademark, copyright and trade secret laws of the united states and other countries to protect our proprietary rights. although we own numerous united states and foreign patents and have submitted numerous patent applications, we cannot be assured that any pending patent applications will issue, or that any patents, issued or pending, will provide us with any competitive advantage or will not be challenged, invalidated or circumvented by third parties. in addition, we rely on confidentiality and non-disclosure agreements with employees and take other measures to protect our know-how and trade secrets. the steps we have taken may not prevent unauthorized use of our technology by competitors or other persons who may copy or otherwise obtain and use these products or technology, particularly in foreign countries where the laws may not protect our proprietary rights to the same extent as in the united states. there is no guarantee that current and former employees, contractors and other parties will not breach their confidentiality agreements with us, misappropriate proprietary information, copy or otherwise obtain and use our information and proprietary technology without authorization or otherwise infringe on our intellectual property rights. our inability to protect our proprietary technology could adversely affect our business. moreover, there can be no assurance that others will not independently develop the know-how and trade secrets or develop better technology than our own, which could reduce or eliminate any competitive advantage we have developed.
our products or processes may infringe the intellectual property rights of others, which may cause us to pay unexpected litigation costs or damages or prevent us from selling our products.
we cannot be certain that our products do not and will not infringe issued patents or other intellectual property rights of third parties. we may be subject to legal proceedings and claims in the ordinary course of our business, including claims of alleged infringement of the intellectual property rights of third parties. any such claims, whether or not meritorious, could result in litigation and divert the efforts of our personnel. if we are found liable for infringement, we may be required to enter into licensing agreements (which may not be available on acceptable terms or at all) or to pay damages or cease making or selling certain products. we may need to redesign some of our products or processes to avoid future infringement liability. any of the foregoing events could be detrimental to our business.
24
other pending and future litigation may involve significant costs and adversely affect our business.
we are party to various lawsuits and claims arising in the normal course of business involving, among other things, contracts, intellectual property, import and export regulations, employment and environmental matters. the defense of these lawsuits may divert our management's attention, and we may incur significant expenses in defending these lawsuits. in addition, we may be required to pay damage awards or settlements, or become subject to injunctions or other equitable remedies, that could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. while we do not believe that any litigation in which we are currently engaged would have such an adverse effect, the outcome of litigation, including regulatory matters, is often difficult to predict, and we cannot assure that the outcome of pending or future litigation will not have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.
our substantial indebtedness could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.
as of december 31, 2014, we had total consolidated indebtedness of $1,068 million.
our substantial level of indebtedness increases the risk that we may be unable to generate cash sufficient to satisfy our debt obligations. it could also have significant effects on our business. for example, it could:
•   increase our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions;
•   require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to payments on our indebtedness, thereby reducing the availability of our cash flow to fund working capital, capital expenditures, research and development efforts and other general corporate purposes;
•   limit our ability to borrow additional funds for such general corporate purposes;
•   limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industry in which we operate;
•   restrict us from exploiting business opportunities; and
•   place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less indebtedness.
if we do not generate sufficient cash flow from operations or if future borrowings are not available to us in an amount sufficient to pay our indebtedness or to fund our other liquidity needs, we may be forced to:
•   refinance all or a portion of our indebtedness on or before it matures;
•   sell assets;
•   reduce or delay capital expenditures; or
•   seek to raise additional capital.
we may not be able to affect any of these actions on commercially reasonable terms or at all. our ability to refinance our indebtedness will depend on our financial condition at the time, the restrictions in the instruments governing our outstanding indebtedness and other factors, including market conditions.
our inability to generate sufficient cash flow to satisfy our debt service obligations, or to refinance or restructure our obligations on commercially reasonable terms or at all, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
our debt agreements impose restrictions on our business, which could prevent us from capitalizing on business opportunities and taking some corporate actions and may adversely affect our ability to respond to changes in our business and manage our operations.
our revolving credit agreement and the indentures governing our 5.25% senior notes due 2024 (the "2024 notes") and our 6.875% senior subordinated notes due 2019 (the "2019 notes") contain covenants that, among other things, impose significant restrictions on our business. the restrictions that these covenants place on us and our restricted subsidiaries include limitations on our and their ability to, among other things:
•   incur additional indebtedness or issue disqualified stock or preferred stock;
•   create liens;
25
•   pay dividends, make investments or make other restricted payments;
•   sell assets;
•   use the proceeds of permitted sales of our assets;
•   merge, consolidate, sell or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of our assets;
•   enter into transactions with our affiliates;
•   permit layering of debt (with regard to the 2019 notes); and
•   designate subsidiaries as unrestricted.
in addition, our revolving credit agreement also contains financial covenants, including covenants requiring maintenance of a consolidated leverage ratio and a consolidated interest coverage ratio, calculated in accordance with the terms of the revolving credit agreement. a breach of any covenants under any one or more of these debt agreements could result in a default, which if not cured or waived, could result in the acceleration of all our debts. in addition, any debt agreements we enter into in the future may further limit our ability to enter into certain types of transactions.
the contingent conversion features of our convertible notes, if triggered, may adversely affect our financial condition.
in august 2010, we issued $400 million in aggregate principal amount of 3.875% convertible senior subordinated notes due 2017 (the "convertible notes"). the convertible notes are convertible under certain circumstances, including the attainment of a last reported sale price per share of our common stock equal to 130% of the conversion price (approximately $79.72) for at least 20 trading days during a period of 30 consecutive trading days ending on the last trading day of the immediately preceding fiscal quarter.  because our closing stock price has exceeded the 130% threshold in the fourth quarter of 2014, the convertible notes are currently convertible into shares of our common stock.  as a result, the convertible notes are classified as a current liability, which, in turn, has resulted in a material reduction of our net working capital. at this time, we have elected the net settlement method to satisfy the conversion obligation, under which we will settle the principal amount of the convertible notes converted in cash and settle the excess conversion value in shares, plus cash in lieu of fractional shares. while we believe we have sufficient liquidity to repay the principal amount due through a combination of our existing cash on hand, amounts available under our credit facility and, if necessary, amounts provided through the capital markets, our use of these funds could adversely affect our results of operations and liquidity. see note 8 to the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10-k for a further discussion regarding the conversion terms of the convertible notes.
the convertible note hedge transactions and warrant transactions entered into in connection with the issuance of our convertible notes may adversely affect the value of our common stock.
in connection with our issuance of the convertible notes, we entered into privately negotiated hedge transactions with two counterparties, which we refer to as the "hedge counterparties." the hedge transactions cover, subject to customary anti-dilution adjustments, the number of shares of our common stock that underlie the convertible notes and are expected to reduce the dilution with respect to our common stock and/or cash payments that we may be required to make upon conversion of the convertible notes. separately, we also entered into privately negotiated warrant transactions relating to the same number of shares of our common stock with the hedge counterparties with a strike price of $74.648, subject to customary anti-dilution adjustments, pursuant to which we may be obligated to issue shares of our common stock. the warrant transactions could have a dilutive effect with respect to our common stock or, if we so elect, obligate us to make cash payments to the extent that the market price per share of our common stock exceeds the strike price of the warrants on any expiration date of the warrants. in addition, under applicable accounting guidance, changes in the share price of our common stock can have a significant impact on the number of shares that we must include in the fully diluted earnings per share calculation with respect to the convertible notes and warrants, which, in turn, could impact our reported financial results. based on the average market price of our common stock during 2014, 1.9 million shares issuable upon exercise of the warrants were included in the total diluted shares outstanding for the year ended december 31, 2014. for additional information, see "financing arrangements" under item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations included in this annual report on form 10-k.
26
in connection with establishing their positions under the convertible note hedge transactions and the warrant transactions, the hedge counterparties (and/or their affiliates) entered into various cash-settled over-the-counter derivative transactions with respect to our common stock concurrently with, or shortly following, the pricing of the convertible notes. the hedge counterparties (and/or their affiliates) may, in their sole discretion, with or without notice, modify their hedge positions from time to time (and are likely to do so during any conversion period related to the conversion of the convertible notes) by entering into or unwinding various over-the-counter derivative transactions with respect to shares of our common stock, and/or by purchasing or selling shares of our common stock or convertible notes in privately negotiated transactions and/or open market transactions. the effect, if any, of these transactions and activities on the market price of our common stock will depend in part on market conditions and cannot be ascertained at this time, but any of these activities could adversely affect the value of our common stock.
we are subject to counterparty risk with respect to the convertible note hedge transactions.
each hedge counterparty is a financial institution or the affiliate of a financial institution, and we will be subject to the risk that one or more hedge counterparties may default under the convertible note hedge transactions. our exposure to the credit risk of each hedge counterparty is not secured by any collateral. if a hedge counterparty becomes subject to insolvency proceedings, we will become an unsecured creditor in those proceedings with a claim equal to our exposure at that time under the convertible note hedge transaction with that hedge counterparty. our exposure will depend on many factors but, generally, the increase in our exposure will be correlated to the increase in the market price of our common stock and in the volatility of our common stock. in addition, upon a default by a hedge counterparty, we may suffer adverse tax consequences and dilution with respect to our common stock. we can provide no assurances as to the financial stability or viability of the hedge counterparties.
we may issue additional shares of our common stock or instruments convertible into our common stock, including in connection with conversions of our convertible notes, which could lower the price of our common stock.
we are not restricted from issuing additional shares of our common stock or other instruments convertible into our common stock. as of december 31, 2014, we had outstanding approximately 41.4 million shares of our common stock, options to purchase approximately 1.2 million shares of our common stock (of which approximately 0.6 million were vested as of that date), approximately 0.3 million of restricted stock awards (which are expected to vest over the next three years) and approximately 20,000 shares of our common stock to be distributed from our deferred compensation plan. in addition, as of december 31, 2014, 20.4 million shares of our common stock are reserved for issuance upon the exercise of stock options, upon conversion of the convertible notes and upon the exercise of the warrants issued in connection with the convertible notes. we cannot predict the size of future issuances or the effect, if any, that they may have on the market price for our common stock.
if we issue additional shares of our common stock or instruments convertible into our common stock, such issuances may materially and adversely affect the price of our common stock. furthermore, the exercise of some or all of the outstanding stock options and warrants, and the conversion of some or all of the convertible notes may dilute the ownership interests of existing stockholders, and any sales in the public market of such shares of our common stock issuable upon any exercise of stock options or warrants, or conversion of the convertible notes could adversely affect prevailing market prices of our common stock. in addition, the issuance and sale, including through exercise of stock options and warrants, of substantial amounts of common stock or conversion of the convertible notes into shares of our common stock could depress the price of our common stock.
27
disruption of critical information systems or material breaches in the security of our systems may adversely affect our business and customer relationships.
we rely on information technology systems to process, transmit, and store electronic information in our day-to-day operations. we also rely on our technology infrastructure, among other functions, to interact with customers and suppliers, fulfill orders and bill, collect and make payments, ship products, provide support to customers, fulfill contractual obligations and otherwise conduct business. our internal information technology systems, as well as those systems maintained by third-party providers, may be subjected to computer viruses or other malicious codes, unauthorized access attempts, and cyber-attacks, any of which could result in data leaks or otherwise compromise our confidential or proprietary information and disrupt our operations. cyber-attacks are becoming more sophisticated and frequent, and there can be no assurance that our protective measures will prevent security breaches that could have a significant impact on our business, reputation and financial results. if we fail to monitor, maintain or protect our information technology systems and data integrity effectively or fail to anticipate, plan for or manage significant disruptions to these systems, we could, among other things, lose customers, have difficulty preventing fraud, have disputes with customers, physicians and other health care professionals, be subject to regulatory sanctions or penalties, incur expenses or lose revenues or suffer other adverse consequences.  any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition.
new regulations related to conflict minerals may increase our costs and adversely affect our business.
the sec has promulgated rules under the dodd-frank wall street reform and consumer protection act regarding disclosure of the use of tin, tantalum, tungsten and gold, known as "conflict minerals," included in components of products either manufactured by public companies or for which public companies have contracted to manufacture. these rules require that we undertake due diligence efforts to determine whether such minerals originated from the democratic republic of congo (the "drc") or an adjoining country and whether such minerals helped finance armed conflict in the drc. we filed our first conflict minerals report in june 2014. as discussed in the report, we have determined that certain of our products contain the specified minerals, and we are in the process of attempting to identify where such minerals originated.  we have incurred, and expect to continue to incur, costs associated with complying with these disclosure requirements, including costs related to determining the sources of the specified minerals used in our products. in addition, these rules could adversely affect the sourcing, supply and pricing of materials used in our products. our customers may require our products be free of conflict minerals, and our revenues and margins may be adversely affected if we are unable to provide assurances to our customers that our products are "drc conflict free" (generally, the product does not contain conflict minerals originating in the drc or an adjoining country that directly or indirectly finance or benefit specified armed groups) due to, among other things, our inability to procure conflict free minerals at a reasonable price, or at all, or if we are unable to pass through any increased costs associated with meeting these demands.  we also may face reputational challenges if our due diligence efforts do not enable us to verify the origins of all conflict minerals or to determine that any conflict minerals used in products we manufacture or in products manufactured by others for us are drc conflict-free.
our operations expose us to the risk of material environmental liabilities.
we are subject to numerous foreign, federal, state and local environmental protection and health and safety laws governing, among other things:
•   the generation, storage, use and transportation of hazardous materials;
•   emissions or discharges of substances into the environment; and
•   the health and safety of our employees.
these laws and regulations are complex, change frequently and have tended to become more stringent over time. in 2014, our costs related to compliance with, or liabilities under these laws totaled $1.3 million. we cannot provide assurance that our costs of complying with current or future environmental protection and health and safety laws, or our liabilities arising from past or future releases of, or exposures to, hazardous substances, which may include claims for personal injury or cleanup, will not exceed our estimates or will not adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.
28
our workforce covered by collective bargaining and similar agreements could cause interruptions in our provision of products and services.
as of december 31, 2014, approximately 8% of our employees in the united states and in other countries were covered by union contracts or collective-bargaining arrangements. in addition, for the fiscal year ended december 31, 2014, approximately 7% of our net revenues were generated by operations for which a significant part of our workforce is covered by collective bargaining agreements and similar agreements. it is likely that a portion of our workforce will remain covered by collective bargaining and similar agreements for the foreseeable future. strikes or work stoppages could occur that would adversely impact our relationships with our customers and our ability to conduct our business.
we may not pay dividends on our common stock in the future.
holders of our common stock are entitled to receive dividends only as our board of directors may declare out of funds legally available for such payments. the declaration and payment of future dividends to holders of our common stock will be at the discretion of our board of directors and will depend upon many factors, including our financial condition, earnings, compliance with debt instruments, legal requirements and other factors as our board of directors deems relevant. we cannot assure you that our cash dividend will not be reduced, or eliminated, in the future.
certain provisions of our corporate governing documents, delaware law and our convertible notes could discourage, delay, or prevent a merger or acquisition.
provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws could impede a merger, takeover or other business combination involving us or discourage a potential acquirer from making a tender offer for our common stock. for example, our certificate of incorporation authorizes our board of directors to determine the number of shares in a series, the consideration, dividend rights, liquidation preferences, terms of redemption, conversion or exchange rights and voting rights, if any, of unissued series of preferred stock, without any vote or action by our stockholders. thus, our board of directors can authorize and issue shares of preferred stock with voting or conversion rights that could adversely affect the voting or other rights of holders of our common stock. we are also subject to section 203 of the delaware general corporation law, which imposes restrictions on mergers and other business combinations between us and any holder of 15% or more of our common stock. these provisions could have the effect of delaying or deterring a third party from acquiring us even if an acquisition might be in the best interest of our stockholders, and accordingly could reduce the market price of our common stock.
certain provisions in the convertible notes and the indentures governing the convertible notes, the 2024 notes and the 2019 notes could make it more difficult or more expensive for a third party to acquire us. for example, if an acquisition event constitutes a "fundamental change," as defined in the indenture governing the convertible notes, holders of the convertible notes will have the right to require us to purchase their notes in cash. similarly, if an acquisition event constitutes a "change of control" as defined in the indenture governing the 2024 notes and the 2019 notes, holders of such notes will have the right to require us to purchase their notes in cash. in addition, if an acquisition event constitutes a "make-whole fundamental change," as defined in the indenture governing the convertible notes, we may be required, under certain circumstances, to increase the conversion rate for holders who convert their notes in connection with such acquisition event. in either case, and in other cases, our obligations under the convertible notes, the 2024 notes and the 2019 notes could increase the cost of acquiring us or otherwise discourage a third party from acquiring us or removing incumbent management, and accordingly could reduce the market price of our common stock.
item 7.   management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we are a global provider of medical technology products that enhance clinical benefits, improve patient and provider safety and reduce total procedural costs. we primarily design, develop, manufacture and supply single-use medical devices used by hospitals and healthcare providers for common diagnostic and therapeutic procedures in critical care and surgical applications. we market and sell our products to hospitals and healthcare providers worldwide through a combination of our direct sales force and distributors. because our products are used in numerous markets and for a variety of procedures, we are not dependent upon any one end-market or procedure.
effective january 1, 2014, we realigned our operating segments due to changes in our internal financial reporting structure. the north american vascular, anesthesia/respiratory and surgical businesses, which previously comprised much of the americas operating segment, are now separate reportable segments. as a result, we now conduct our operations through six reportable segments: vascular north america, anesthesia/respiratory north america, surgical north america, emea, asia and oem. certain operating segments are not material and are therefore included in the "all other" line item in tabular presentations of segment information. additionally, we made changes to the allocation methodology for certain costs, including manufacturing variances and research and development costs, among the businesses to improve accountability, which resulted in changes to the previously reported segment profitability. all prior comparative periods have been restated to reflect these changes.
since we became exclusively a medical device company in 2011, we have continued to expand our presence in the medical technology industry through strategic acquisitions. the following is a listing of the more significant acquisitions we completed in 2014 and 2013.
during 2014, we acquired:
l   mayo healthcare pty limited, ("mayo healthcare"), a distributor of medical devices and supplies primarily for the australian market; and l   the assets of mini-lap technologies, inc. ("mini-lap"), a developer of micro-laparoscopic instrumentation, which complements our surgical product portfolio.
during 2013, we acquired:
l   vidacare corporation ("vidacare"), a provider of intraosseous, or inside the bone, access devices, which complements the vascular access and specialty product portfolios;
l   the assets of ultimate medical pty. ltd. and its affiliates ("ultimate"), a supplier of airway management devices with a variety of laryngeal mask airways and other related products, which complement our anesthesia product portfolio; and l   eon surgical, ltd., a developer of a minimally invasive microlaparoscopy surgical platform technology designed to enhance a surgeon's ability to perform scarless surgery while producing better patient outcomes, which complements our surgical product portfolio.
we may be required to pay contingent consideration in connection with some of the acquisitions listed above. the amount of contingent consideration we ultimately will pay will be based upon the achievement of specified objectives, including regulatory approvals, sales targets and the passage of time. for additional information on these acquisitions and the related contingent consideration arrangements, see note 3 to the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10-k.
35
health care reform on march 23, 2010 the patient protection and affordable care act (as amended, the "affordable care act") was signed into law. this legislation significantly impacts our business. for medical device companies such as teleflex, the expansion of medical insurance coverage should lead to greater utilization of the products we manufacture, but this legislation also contains provisions designed to contain the cost of healthcare, which could negatively affect pricing of our products. the overall impact of the affordable care act on our business is yet to be determined, mainly due to uncertainties around future customer behaviors, which we believe will be affected by reimbursement factors such as insurance coverage statistics, patient outcomes and patient satisfaction.
in addition, the affordable care act imposed a 2.3% excise tax on sales of medical devices, beginning in 2013. for the years ended december 31, 2014 and 2013, we paid medical device excise taxes of $12.7 million and $11.5 million, respectively, which is included in selling, general and administrative expenses.
global economic conditions global economic conditions in recent years have had adverse impacts on market activities including, among other things, failure of financial institutions, falling asset values, diminished liquidity, reduced demand for products and services and significant fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. in response, we adjusted production levels and engaged in new restructuring activities. we continue to review and evaluate our manufacturing, warehousing and distribution processes to maximize efficiencies through the elimination of redundancies in our operations and the consolidation of facilities. although, on a consolidated basis, the economic conditions did not have a significant adverse impact on our financial position, results of operations or liquidity, healthcare policies and practice trends vary by country, and the impact of the global economic downturn was felt to varying degrees in each of our regional markets over the last several years. the continuation of the present broad economic trends of weak economic growth, constricted credit, public sector austerity measures in response to public budget deficits and foreign currency volatility, particularly the euro, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and our liquidity.
hospitals in some regions of the united states experienced a decline in admissions, a weaker payor mix, and a reduction in elective procedures.  consequently, hospitals took actions to reduce their costs, including limiting their capital spending. more recently, the economic environment has improved somewhat, but has not returned to pre-recession levels, and challenges persist, particularly in some european countries, as discussed below. approximately 94% of our net revenues come from single-use products primarily used in critical care and surgical applications, and our sales volume could be negatively impacted if hospital admission rates or payor mix change as a result of continuing higher than normal unemployment rates (and subsequent loss of insurance coverage by consumers). conversely, our sales volume could be positively impacted due to increases in the number of insured individuals as a result of the affordable care act, which has had the effect of facilitating medical insurance coverage for many persons who previously were not covered.
europe continues to contend with considerable government debt and annual deficits, high levels of unemployment and the risk of deflation. these factors have resulted in austerity programs that have affected the healthcare sector in european countries. these austerity programs have resulted in delays in elective surgeries in a number of countries and reductions in health budgets. it is likely that funding for publicly funded healthcare institutions will continue to be affected if governments make further spending adjustments and enact healthcare reform measures to lower overall healthcare costs. the public healthcare systems in certain countries in western europe, most notably greece, spain, portugal and italy, have experienced significantly reduced liquidity due to recessionary conditions, which has resulted in a slowdown in payments to us. the slowdown has continued to affect the timing of collections from these customers.
in asia, recovery from the global recession has varied by country. china announced plans for major healthcare investment directed to second tier cities (newer cities resulting from china's urbanization of the north and west regions of the country) and hospitals, which may provide future growth opportunities for us. despite these growth opportunities, distributor sales to third parties slowed in 2014, particularly in china, which could have an impact on this future growth. additionally, slow economic growth and continued pursuit of reimbursement cuts by the public hospital sector in japan is expected to limit growth in that market.
in latin america, some highly regulated economies such as argentina and venezuela have experienced unusually high inflation rates and weakening currencies. this has impacted the budgets of the public healthcare systems resulting in delays in the importation of medical devices. although not a significant portion of our business, our operations in this region may be impacted by these factors.
36
results of operations the following comparisons exclude the impact of discontinued operations (see note 18 to the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10-k for discussion of discontinued operations). certain financial information is presented on a rounded basis, which may cause minor differences.
revenues
2014                             2013                  2012
(dollars in millions)
net revenues      $1,839.8              $1,696.3              $1,551.0
comparison of 2014 and 2013
net revenues for the twelve months ended december 31, 2014 increased 8.5% to $1,839.8 million from $1,696.3 million in the twelve months ended december 31, 2013. the $143.5 million increase in net revenues is largely due to the businesses acquired during 2013 and 2014, which generated net revenues of $98.6 million, including $79.9 million, $16.6 million and $2.2 million generated by vidacare, mayo healthcare and ultimate, respectively. net revenues further benefited from price increases of $23.9 million, primarily in the asia, emea and surgical north america segments, new product sales of $14.8 million, primarily in the emea, anesthesia/respiratory north america, vascular north america and asia segments and higher sales volume of $12.3 million, primarily in the oem and emea segments. these increases were partially offset by the unfavorable impact of foreign currency exchange rates of $6.2 million, lower sales volumes in anesthesia/respiratory north america and asia segments and price reductions in the oem segment.
comparison of 2013 and 2012
net revenues for the twelve months ended december 31, 2013 increased 9.4% to $1,696.3 million from $1,551.0 million in the twelve months ended december 31, 2012. the $145.3 million increase in net revenues is largely due to the businesses acquired during 2012 and 2013, which generated net revenues of approximately $121.1 million in 2013, including approximately $110.3 million generated by the assets we acquired in 2012 from lma international, n.v. (referred to below as "lma" or the "lma business"). net revenues further benefited from new products of $19.2 million, primarily in the vascular north america, anesthesia/respiratory north america, emea and oem segments, price increases of $15.2 million in the surgical north america, vascular north america, emea and asia segments, higher sales volume of $9.3 million and $1.3 million in asia and emea, respectively, and the $5.7 million favorable impact of foreign currency exchange rates. these increases were partly offset by aggregate lower sales volume of $14.7 million primarily in anesthesia/respiratory north america, surgical north america and vascular north america and lower oem sales volumes of $11.8 million, primarily due to lower sales of catheters and performance fibers.
gross profit
2014                                                  2013                2012
(dollars in millions)
gross profit                $942.4              $838.9              $748.2
percentage of revenues        51.2   %            49.5   %            48.2   %
comparison of 2014 and 2013
for the twelve months ended december 31, 2014, gross profit as a percentage of revenues increased 170 basis points compared to the corresponding prior year period. the increase is primarily due to increased sales from higher margin vidacare products, margin increases in asia resulting from sales of mayo healthcare products, price increases in asia, emea and surgical north america, and increased sales of higher margin new products, primarily in the emea, vascular north america and anesthesia/respiratory north america segments. these improvements in gross profit were partially offset by higher raw materials and manufacturing costs and the unfavorable impact of foreign currency exchange rates.
37
comparison of 2013 and 2012
for the twelve months ended december 31, 2013, gross profit as a percentage of revenues increased 130 basis points compared to the corresponding prior year period. the increase is principally due to the inclusion of higher margin sales from the lma and vidacare businesses, price increases in surgical north america, vascular north america, emea and asia, new products in vascular north america, anesthesia/respiratory north america, surgical north america, emea and oem, manufacturing efficiencies in emea and oem and the favorable impact of foreign currency exchange rates. these benefits were partly offset by higher warehousing and freight costs in vascular north america, emea and asia and lower sales volumes in anesthesia/respiratory north america, surgical north america, vascular north america and oem. in addition, gross profit in the 2012 period was adversely affected by inventory write-offs for excess, slow moving and damaged product in asia.
selling, general and administrative
2014                                                               2013                2012
(dollars in millions)
selling, general and administrative      $578.7              $502.2              $454.5
percentage of revenues                     31.5   %            29.6   %            29.3   %
comparison of 2014 and 2013
selling, general and administrative expenses increased $76.5 million during the twelve months ended december 31, 2014 compared to the twelve months ended december 31, 2013. the increase is primarily due to $35.4 million of expenses associated with acquired businesses, primarily vidacare, mayo healthcare and ultimate, $13.8 million of higher sales expense, primarily related to an increase in sales commissions, higher amortization expense of $10.5 million, the majority of which relates to the amortization of vidacare intangibles, $5.4 million of higher general and administrative costs primarily due to increases in employee related expenses, higher depreciation expense of $2.2 million, resulting from a reduction in the estimated useful life of an administrative building and certain related assets, $1.7 million of higher it related costs primarily associated with the ongoing maintenance of enterprise resource planning software systems, partially offset by the $3.2 million favorable impact of foreign currency exchange rates which caused a reduction of expenses.  in addition, the benefit from contingent consideration reserve reductions for the twelve months ended december 31, 2014 was $4.9 million lower than the benefit realized in the twelve months ended december 31, 2013.
comparison of 2013 and 2012
selling, general and administrative expenses increased $47.7 million during the twelve months ended december 31, 2013 compared to the twelve months ended december 31, 2012. the increase is largely due to $36.4 million of expenses associated with acquired businesses, including $29.6 million in expenses associated with the lma business, $11.5 million in excise taxes on the sale of medical devices imposed by the affordable care act, higher employee related expenses, $4.2 million in increased costs associated with the conversion of several of our locations to a new erp system, acquisition costs of $3.2 million primarily related to the acquisition of vidacare, $5.8 million of higher legal costs due to the accrual for loss contingencies to reflect litigation developments, including a verdict against us with respect to a non-operating joint venture, and professional fees and a $1.1 million unfavorable impact of foreign currency exchange rates. the increases were partly offset by an aggregate of $12.3 million in reversals of contingent consideration related to the acquisitions of hotspur technologies inc. ("hotspur") ($8.5 million), semprus biosciences corp. ("semprus") ($2.4 million) and the assets of axiom technology partners llp ("axiom") ($1.4 million) after determining that conditions for the payment of certain contingent consideration would not be satisfied. selling, general and administrative expenses in 2012 also reflected the loss of $7.6 million from foreign currency forward exchange contracts entered into in connection with the acquisition of the lma business.

research and development
2014                                                2013              2012
(dollars in millions)
research and development     $61.0             $65.0             $56.3
percentage of revenues         3.3   %           3.8   %           3.6   %
comparison of 2014 and 2013
for the twelve months ended december 31, 2014, research and development expenses decreased 6.2% compared to the corresponding prior year period. the decrease is primarily due to higher research and development expenses for the year ended december 31, 2013 resulting from new activity with respect to businesses acquired in 2012 as well as efficiencies obtained through integrating certain projects into our existing structure.
comparison of 2013 and 2012
the increase in research and development expenses for the twelve months ended december 31, 2013 as compared to the corresponding prior year period is primarily due to the new activity with respect to businesses acquired in 2012.
goodwill impairment in the first quarter of 2012, we changed our former north america reporting unit structure from a single reporting unit to five reporting units comprised of vascular, anesthesia/respiratory, cardiac, surgical and specialty. we allocated the assets and liabilities of our former north america segment among the new reporting units based on their respective operating activities, and then allocated goodwill among the reporting units using a relative fair value approach, as required by fasb accounting standards codification ("asc") topic 350.
following this allocation, we performed goodwill impairment tests on these new reporting units. as a result of these tests, we determined that three of the reporting units in our former north america segment were impaired, and, in the first quarter of 2012, we recorded aggregate goodwill impairment charges of $332 million, consisting of $220 million in our vascular reporting unit, $107 million in our anesthesia/respiratory reporting unit and $5 million in our cardiac reporting unit in the first quarter of 2012.
we did not record any goodwill impairment charges for the years ended december 31, 2014 and 2013.

2014 manufacturing footprint realignment plan in april 2014, our board of directors approved a restructuring plan (the "2014 manufacturing footprint realignment plan") that involves the consolidation of operations and a related reduction in workforce at certain facilities, and the relocation of manufacturing operations from certain higher-cost locations to existing lower-cost locations. these actions commenced in the second quarter 2014 and are expected to be substantially completed by the end of 2017. we estimate that we will incur aggregate pre-tax charges in connection with the 2014 manufacturing footprint realignment plan of approximately $37 million to $44 million, of which we expect $26 million to $31 million will result in cash outlays. additionally, we expect to incur aggregate capital expenditures of approximately $24 million to $30 million under the restructuring plan. our prior estimate with respect to the amount of charges we expected to incur was $42 million to $53 million and our prior estimate of cash outlays we expect to make was $32 million to $40 million. the reduction in expected costs and cash outlays was based on our incurrence of lower than anticipated costs in connection with the initial phases of the program and the refinement, based on experrience to date, of our estimates with respect to future costs to be incurred in connection with the transfer of operations under the program.
for the twelve months ended december 31, 2014, we recorded expenses of $14.2 million related to the 2014 manufacturing footprint realignment plan. of this amount, $9.3 million related to termination benefits and was recorded as restructuring expense and $4.9 million related to accelerated depreciation and certain other costs resulting from the plan and was recorded as cost of sales. as of december 31, 2014, we have a reserve of $9.1 million in connection with this program.  additionally, we incurred $6.4 million of capital expenditures and expended $3.1 million in cash outlays for the twelve months ended december 31, 2014 related to this plan.
we currently expect that we will begin to realize savings related to this plan beginning in 2015, and expect that we will achieve annualized savings of $28 million to $35 million once the restructuring plan is fully implemented.
2014 european restructuring plan in february 2014, we committed to a restructuring plan (the "2014 european restructuring plan"), which impacts certain administrative functions in europe and involves the consolidation of operations and a related reduction in workforce at certain of our european facilities. we recorded charges of $7.8 million for the twelve months ended december 31, 2014 related to this program, primarily pertaining to termination benefits. we expect future restructuring expenses associated with the 2014 european restructuring plan, if any, to be nominal. as of december 31, 2014, we have a reserve of $0.4 million in connection with this program.  we expect to realize annual pre-tax savings in the range of $8 million to $9 million by the end of 2015 when these restructuring actions are complete.
other 2014 restructuring programs in june 2014, we initiated programs to consolidate locations in australia and terminate certain european distributor agreements in an effort to reduce costs. as a result of these programs, we estimate that we will incur an aggregate of approximately $4 million in restructuring charges over the term of these restructuring programs, of which $3.6 million was incurred through december 31, 2014. these programs include employee termination benefits, contract termination costs and other exit costs. we expect to realize annual pre-tax savings in the range of $4 to $5 million by the end of 2015 when these restructuring actions are complete. as of december 31, 2014, we have a reserve of $0.9 million in connection with these programs.
2013 restructuring charges in 2013, we initiated restructuring programs to consolidate administrative and manufacturing facilities in north america and warehouse facilities in europe and terminate certain european distributor agreements in an effort to reduce costs. we estimate that we will incur between $11 million and $12 million in aggregate restructuring charges over the term of these programs, of which $11 million was incurred through december 31, 2014. of this amount, $5.3 million relates to employee termination costs, $3.5 million relates to termination of certain distributor agreements and $2.1 million relates to facility closure and other exit costs. as of december 31, 2014, we had a reserve of $0.9 million in connection with these projects. we expect to realize annual pre-tax savings in the range of $11 million to $13 million by the end of 2015, when we anticipate that these programs will have been completed.

lma restructuring program in connection with the acquisition of all of the assets of lma international n.v. (the "lma business") in 2012, we formulated a plan related to the future integration of lma with our businesses. the integration plan, which commenced in 2012, focused on the closure of the lma business' corporate functions and the consolidation of manufacturing, sales, marketing, and distribution functions in north america, europe and asia. $11.4 million has been charged to restructuring and other impairment charges over the term of this program. of this amount, $5.5 million related to employee termination costs, $5.0 million related to termination of certain distributor agreements and $0.9 million related to facility closure and other costs. during the twelve months ended december 31, 2014, we recorded a net credit of $3.3 million primarily resulting from the reversal of contract termination costs due to the favorable settlement of a terminated distributor agreement. during the twelve months ended december 31, 2013, we incurred restructuring charges of $12.2 million under this program primarily related to employee termination benefits and contract termination costs. as of december 31, 2014, we had a reserve of $0.2 million in connection with this program.  we expect future restructuring expenses associated with the lma restructuring program, if any, to be nominal. we anticipate realizing annual pre-tax savings of approximately $20 million by the end of 2015, when we expect this program to be completed.
2012 restructuring charges in 2012, we initiated a program to improve the effectiveness of our supply chain by consolidating our three north american warehouses into one centralized warehouse, and to lower costs and improve operating efficiencies through the termination of certain distributor agreements in europe, the closure of certain north american facilities and workforce reductions. we have incurred an aggregate of approximately $6.3 million over the term of this program. we expect future restructuring expenses associated with this restructuring program, if any, to be nominal. as of december 31, 2014, we had a reserve of $0.6 million in connection with these projects. we expect to complete this program in 2015.
2011 restructuring program in 2011, we initiated a restructuring program at three facilities to consolidate operations and reduce costs. over the term of this program, which was completed in 2013, we recorded restructuring costs of $3.8 million related to contract termination costs, employee termination benefits, and facility closure costs.
2007 arrow integration program in connection with the acquisition of arrow international, inc. ("arrow") in 2007, we formulated a plan to integrate arrow's business with our other businesses. costs related to actions that affected legacy teleflex employees and facilities were charged to earnings and included in restructuring and other impairment charges within the consolidated statement of operations. in 2012 we reversed approximately $2.0 million of contract termination costs primarily as a result of a settlement of a dispute involving the termination of a european distributor agreement that was established in connection with our acquisition of arrow. the integration program was completed during 2013.
impairment charges in-process research and development impairments in the fourth quarter of 2013, we recorded a $2.9 million in-process research and development ("ipr&d") charge after we made the decision to abandon a research and development project associated with our vascular business.
in the first quarter of 2013, we recorded a $4.5 million ipr&d charge pertaining to a research and development project associated with our acquisition of substantially all of the assets of axiom technology partners llc because technological feasibility had not yet been achieved and we determined that the subject technology had no future alternative use.
long-lived asset impairment in the third quarter of 2013, we recorded $3.5 million in impairment charges related to assets held for sale that had a carrying value in excess of their appraised fair value.

emea emea net revenues for the twelve months ended december 31, 2013 increased $47.1 million compared to the corresponding period in 2012, an increase of 9.2%. the increase was primarily due to businesses acquired in 2012 and 2013, which added net revenues of $25.6 million, including $24.2 million generated by the lma business; the favorable impact of foreign currency exchange rates of $11.6 million, price increases of $5.7 million, including increases resulting from distributor-to-direct conversions, new product sales of $2.9 million and higher sales volume of existing products of $1.3 million.
emea segment operating profit for the twelve months ended december 31, 2013 increased $22.1 million compared to the corresponding period in 2012, an increase of 33.5%. the increase in operating profit reflects lower manufacturing costs due to improved absorption and lower overhead costs as a result of process improvements, margin improvements driven by price increases resulting from distributor-to-direct conversions, as well as other price increases, the operating profit generated by the businesses acquired, primarily the lma business, partially offset by higher research and development costs related to the semprus acquisition, the favorable impact of foreign currency exchange rates and lower material costs. these increases in operating profit were partly offset by higher warehousing and freight costs, including costs to consolidate a distribution facility in france. in 2012, emea segment operating profit was adversely impacted by a loss from foreign currency forward exchange contracts entered into in anticipation of the acquisition of the lma business.
asia asia net revenues for the twelve months ended december 31, 2013 increased $33.5 million compared to the corresponding period in 2012, an increase of 19.3%. the increase was primarily due to $28.3 million of net revenues generated by the businesses acquired in 2012 and 2013, including $25.6 million generated by the lma business, volume increases of $9.3 million (volume increases in china and southeast asia were largely offset by lower volumes in japan), price increases of $1.1 million and new product sales of $0.3 million. these increases were partly offset by the $5.5 million unfavorable impact of foreign currency exchange rates.

liquidity and capital resources we assess our liquidity in terms of our ability to generate cash to fund our operating, investing and financing activities. our principal source of liquidity is operating cash flows. in addition to operating cash flows, other significant factors that affect our overall management of liquidity include: capital expenditures, acquisitions, pension funding, dividends, taxes, scheduled principal and interest payments with respect to outstanding indebtedness, adequacy of available bank lines of credit and access to capital markets.
we believe our cash flow from operations, available cash and cash equivalents, borrowings under our revolving credit facility and sales of accounts receivable under our securitization program will enable us to fund our operating requirements, capital expenditures and debt obligations for the next twelve months and the foreseeable future.
to date, we have not experienced significant payment defaults by our customers and we have sufficient lending commitments in place to enable us to fund our anticipated additional operating needs. however, as discussed above in global economic conditions, although there have been recent improvements in certain countries, global financial markets remain volatile and the global credit markets are constrained, which creates risk that our customers and suppliers may be unable to access liquidity. consequently, we continue to monitor our credit risk, particularly related to customers in europe. as of december 31, 2014, our net receivables from publicly funded hospitals in italy, spain, portugal and greece were $46.9 million compared to $63.1 million as of december 31, 2013. for the twelve months ended december 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, net revenues from customers in these countries was approximately 8%, 8% and 9%, respectively, of total net revenues, and average days that current and long-term accounts receivable were outstanding were 223, 260 and 288 days, respectively. as of december 31, 2014 and 2013, net current and long-term accounts receivables from these countries were approximately 27% and 31%, respectively, of our consolidated net current and long-term accounts receivables. if economic conditions in these countries deteriorate, we may experience significant credit losses related to the public hospital systems in these countries. moreover, if global economic conditions generally deteriorate, we may experience further delays in customer payments, reductions in our customers' purchases and higher credit losses, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows in 2015 and future years. see "critical accounting estimates" below for additional information regarding the critical accounting estimates related to our accounts receivable.
during 2014, we acquired mayo healthcare pty limited, a distributor of medical devices and supplies primarily in the australian market which provides distribution for our asia segment. additionally, the acquisition of the assets of mini-lap technologies, inc., a developer of micro-laparoscopic instrumentation, provides new products for our surgical north america segment. the aggregate total fair value of consideration for these acquisitions is estimated at $66.3 million. see note 3 to the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10-k for additional information regarding our acquisitions.
during 2013, we completed the acquisitions of vidacare corporation and ultimate medical pty. ltd., whose products complement our vascular, anesthesia and specialty product portfolios, and eon surgical, ltd, whose technology complements the surgical product portfolio.  the aggregate consideration paid for these acquisitions was $307.0 million. we funded these acquisitions through borrowings under our senior credit facility. see note 3 to the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10-k for additional information regarding our acquisitions.
47
during 2014, we issued $250 million of 5.25% senior notes due 2024 (the "2024 notes"), and used the $245.0 million net proceeds of the sale of the 2024 notes to repay borrowings under our senior credit facility. we pay interest on the 2024 notes semi-annually on june 15 and december 15, at a rate of 5.25% per year. we incurred transaction fees of approximately $4.5 million, including underwriters' discounts and commissions, in connection with the offering of the 2024 notes. see note 8 to the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10-k for additional information regarding the notes.
during 2013, we refinanced our senior credit facility, replacing our $375.0 million term loan and $400.0 million revolving credit facility with an $850.0 million dollar revolving credit facility. we used borrowings under the new revolving credit facility to pay down the $375 million principal on the term loan and to fund the related refinancing costs of $6.4 million. the new $850 million senior credit facility bears interest at an applicable rate elected by us equal to either the "base rate" (the greater of either the federal funds effective rate plus 0.5%, the prime rate or one month libor plus 1.0%) plus an applicable margin of 0.25% to 1.00%, or a "libor rate" for the period corresponding to the applicable interest period of the borrowings plus an applicable margin of 1.25% to 2.00%. as of december 31, 2014, the interest rate on the $850 million senior credit facility was 1.92% (comprised of the libor rate of 0.17% plus a spread of 1.75%).
approximately $118.6 million of our $290.2 million of net cash provided by operating activities in 2014 was generated in the united states, and approximately $94.1 million of our $231.3 million of net cash provided by operating activities in 2013 was generated in the united states. of our $303.2 million of cash and cash equivalents at december 31, 2014, $274.6 million was held at foreign subsidiaries. we manage our worldwide cash requirements by monitoring the funds available among our subsidiaries and determining the extent to which we can access those funds on a cost effective basis. we are not aware of any restrictions on repatriation of these funds and, subject to cash payment of additional united states income taxes or foreign withholding taxes, these funds could be repatriated, if necessary. any additional taxes could be offset, at least in part, by foreign tax credits. the amount of any taxes required to be paid, which could be significant, and the application of tax credits would be determined based on income tax laws in effect at the time of such repatriation. we do not expect any such repatriation to result in additional tax expense as taxes have been provided for on unremitted foreign earnings that we do not consider permanently reinvested.
we repatriated approximately $237.1 million and $67.0 million in 2014 and 2013, respectively, of cash from our foreign subsidiaries to help fund debt service and other cash requirements.
we have no scheduled principal payments under our senior credit facility until 2018. we anticipate our aggregate domestic interest payments under our senior credit facility, our 2024 notes, our 6.875% senior subordinates notes due 2019 (the "2019 notes") and our accounts receivable securitization facility for 2015 will be approximately $51.8 million. we plan to utilize cash from operations, generated from both in and outside of the united states, and our revolving credit facility to meet quarterly debt service or other requirements.
our 3.875% convertible senior subordinated notes due 2017 (the "convertible notes") are classified as a current liability because a contingent conversion feature related to our stock price was triggered. refer to the "financing arrangements" section below for additional details.
see "financing arrangements" below for further information relating to our debt obligations, including the convertible notes.

comparison of 2014 and 2013
cash flow from operating activities net cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations was $290.2 million during 2014 compared to $231.3 million during 2013. the $58.9 million increase is primarily due to improved operating results and favorable net changes in working capital items, principally reflecting changes in accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued expenses and prepaid expenses and other current assets, as well as an $8.0 million decrease in contributions to domestic pension plans. accounts receivable decreased $9.4 million during 2014 as compared to a $1.3 million increase during 2013, primarily due to increased collections from the spanish and portuguese government and spanish regional health authorities in 2014 and increased collections in italy and greece due to government financing. additionally, there was an overall improvement in days receivables outstanding in 2014. accounts payable and accrued expenses increased $9.8 million in 2014 compared to an increase of $2.0 million in 2013 primarily due to timing of vendor and employee related benefit payments and increased compensation accruals in 2014. prepaid expenses and other current assets decreased $1.4 million in 2014 compared to an increase of $5.9 million in 2013 due to timing of payments of and reductions in insurance premiums as well as fewer insurance deposits and maintenance contract payments in 2014.
these favorable impacts to net cash flow from operating activities were partially offset by increased inventories of $15.5 million during 2014 as compared to an increase of $8.9 million in 2013, primarily due to increased inventory purchases to support sales growth internationally and our distributor-to-direct sales conversions in several countries, and an $8.9 million increase in tax payments, net of refunds, in 2014 as compared to 2013 primarily due to timing of tax payments and improved operating results.
cash flow from investing activities net cash used in investing activities from continuing operations was $108.1 million during 2014, reflecting net payments for businesses acquired of $45.8 million and capital expenditures of $67.6 million. the net payments for businesses acquired includes the acquisition of mayo healthcare and the assets of mini-lap technologies inc. these payments were partly offset by $5.3 million in proceeds related to the sale of certain assets that were held for sale.
49
cash flow from financing activities net cash used in financing activities from continuing operations was $287.7 million during 2014, which included repayments of $480.1 million of indebtedness principally under our revolving credit facility, partially offset by proceeds from additional borrowings of $250.0 million from the sale of our 2024 notes. net cash used in financing activities also included dividend payments of $56.3 million and underwriters' discount and commission fees of $4.5 million, which were paid in connection with the sale of the 2024 notes. net cash used in financing activities were reduced by cash inflows of $7.1 million associated with proceeds from the exercise of share-based awards issued under our stock compensation plans and $5.8 million of excess tax benefits related to the exercise or vesting of those awards, which were partially offset by tax withholdings of $8.7 million remitted by the company on behalf of employees who elect to have shares withheld by the company to satisfy their minimum tax withholding obligations arising from the exercise and vesting of their share-based awards. see note 1 to the condensed consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10-k for a discussion of the reclassification of tax withholding payments related to share-based awards from a cash outflow from operating activities to a cash outflow from financing activities.
comparison of 2013 and 2012
cash flow from operating activities net cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations was $231.3 million during 2013 compared to $194.6 million during 2012. the $36.7 million increase is primarily due to improved operating results, partially offset by net unfavorable year-over-year changes in working capital items, primarily reflecting changes in inventories and prepaid expenses and other current assets. inventories increased $8.9 million during 2013, as compared to a $2.0 million increase during 2012, due to sales volume growth, primarily in asia. prepaid expenses and other current assets increased $5.9 million during 2013, as compared to a $9.6 million decrease during 2012, primarily due to the collection of outstanding vat claims in 2012.
cash flow from investing activities net cash used in investing activities from continuing operations was $372.6 million during 2013, reflecting net payments for businesses acquired of $309.0 million and capital expenditures of $63.6 million. the net payments for businesses acquired included an aggregate of approximately $307.0 million paid for the acquisitions of vidacare, eon surgical, ltd. and ultimate; and $3.5 million paid for in-process research and development related to the eon surgical technology, partly offset by a $1.5 million working capital adjustment with respect to the consideration paid in connection with the lma acquisition.
cash flow from financing activities net cash provided by financing activities from continuing operations was $231.2 million during 2013. during 2013, we refinanced our senior credit facility, which was comprised of a $375.0 million term loan and $400.0 million revolving credit facility, and replaced it with a new $850.0 million senior credit facility consisting solely of a revolving credit facility. we used borrowings under the new facility to repay the outstanding $375.0 million term loan and to pay costs of $6.4 million associated with the refinancing. during 2013, we borrowed an additional $298.0 million under the revolving credit facility to finance the acquisition of vidacare. in addition, net cash used in financing activities included dividend payments of $55.9 million, contingent consideration payments of $17.0 million related to our acquisitions of vasonova inc. ("vasonova"), axiom, lma, hotspur and the guided imaging business of mepy benelux bvba and payments to noncontrolling interest shareholders of $0.7 million. these outflows were partially offset by $6.2 million net inflows resulting from share based compensation activity, which included proceeds from the exercise and vesting of share-based awards issued under our stock compensation plans and the related excess tax benefits partially offset by tax withholdings remitted by the company on behalf of employees who elect to have shares withheld by the company to satisfy their minimum tax withholding obligations arising from the exercise and vesting of their share-based awards.

fixed rate borrowings comprised 81% and 49% of total borrowings at december 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. the increase in fixed rate borrowings as of december 31, 2014 compared to december 31, 2013 is primarily due to the issuance of the 2024 notes in 2014 and the $245.0 million repayment of variable rate borrowings under our senior credit facility.
our senior credit agreement contains covenants that, among other things, limit or restrict our ability, and the ability of our subsidiaries, to incur debt, create liens, consolidate, merge or dispose of certain assets, make certain investments, engage in acquisitions, pay dividends on, repurchase or make distributions in respect of capital stock and enter into swap agreements. our senior credit agreement also requires us to maintain a consolidated leverage ratio (generally, the ratio of consolidated total indebtedness to consolidated ebitda, each as defined in the senior credit agreement) of not more than 4.0:1 and a consolidated interest coverage ratio (generally, consolidated ebitda to consolidated interest expense, each as defined in the senior credit agreement) of not less than 3.50:1 as of the last day of any period of four consecutive fiscal quarters calculated in accordance with the definitions and methodology set forth in the senior credit agreement and, during the six month period prior to the maturity of our convertible notes, a minimum liquidity of $400.0 million. at december 31, 2014, our consolidated leverage ratio was 2.71:1 and our interest coverage ratio was 8.31:1, both of which are in compliance with the limits described in the preceding sentence. the obligations under the senior credit agreement are guaranteed (subject to certain exceptions) by substantially all of the material domestic subsidiaries of the company and (subject to certain exceptions and limitations) secured by a pledge on substantially all of the equity interests owned by the company and each guarantor.
at december 31, 2014, we had $200.0 million in borrowings outstanding and approximately $6.0 million in outstanding standby letters of credit under our $850.0 million revolving credit facility. this facility is used principally for working capital needs and, at certain times, to help fund acquisitions. the availability of loans under our revolving credit facility is dependent upon our ability to maintain our financial condition and our continued compliance with the covenants contained in our senior credit agreement. moreover, additional borrowings would be prohibited if a material adverse effect (as defined in the senior credit agreement) were to occur. notwithstanding these restrictions, we believe our revolving credit facility provides us with significant flexibility to meet our foreseeable working capital needs.  at our current level of ebitda (as defined in the senior credit agreement) for the year ended december 31, 2014, we would have been permitted $533.1 million of additional debt beyond the levels outstanding at december 31, 2014. moreover, additional capacity would be available if borrowed funds were used to acquire a business or businesses through the purchase of assets or controlling equity interests so long as the aforementioned leverage and interest coverage ratios are met after calculating ebitda on a proforma basis to give effect to the acquisition.
51
as of december 31, 2014, the aggregate outstanding principal amount of the 2019 notes and 2024 notes was $500.0 million. the indentures governing the 2019 notes and 2024 notes contain negative covenants that, among other things, limit or restrict our ability, and the ability of our subsidiaries, to incur debt, create liens, consolidate, merge or dispose of certain assets, make certain investments, engage in acquisitions, and pay dividends on, repurchase or make distributions in respect of capital stock, subject to specified conditions. the obligations under the 2019 notes and 2024 notes are fully and unconditionally guaranteed, jointly and severally, by each of our existing and future 100% owned domestic subsidiaries that is a guarantor or other obligor under our senior credit agreement and by certain of our other 100% owned domestic subsidiaries.
as of december 31, 2014, we were in compliance with all of the terms of our senior credit agreement and our 2019 notes and 2024 notes.
in addition, we have an accounts receivable securitization facility under which we sell a security interest in domestic accounts receivable for consideration of up to $50.0 million to a commercial paper conduit. as of december 31, 2014, the maximum amount available for borrowing under this facility was $45.3 million. this facility is utilized from time to time to provide increased flexibility in funding short term working capital requirements. the agreement governing the accounts receivable securitization facility contains certain covenants and termination events. an occurrence of an event of default or a termination event under this facility may give rise to the right of our counterparty to terminate this facility. as of december 31, 2014 and 2013, we had $4.7 million of outstanding borrowings under our accounts receivable securitization facility.
our convertible notes are included in the dilutive earnings per share calculation using the treasury stock method. under the treasury stock method, we must calculate the number of shares of common stock issuable under the terms of the convertible notes based on the average market price of our common stock during the applicable reporting period, and include that number in the total diluted shares figure for the period. at the time we issued the convertible notes, we entered into convertible note hedge and warrant agreements that together are intended to have the economic effect of reducing the net number of shares that will be issued upon conversion of the convertible notes by, in effect, increasing the conversion price of the convertible notes, from our economic standpoint, to $74.65. however, under accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america ("gaap"), since the impact of the convertible note hedge agreements is anti-dilutive, we exclude from the calculation of fully diluted shares the number of shares of our common stock that we would receive from the counterparties to these agreements upon settlement.
under the treasury stock method, changes in the price per share of our common stock can have a significant impact on the number of shares that we must include in the fully diluted earnings per share calculation. the following table illustrates how changes in our stock price would affect (i) the number of shares issuable issuable upon conversion of the convertible notes, (ii) the number of additional shares deemed outstanding with respect to the convertible notes, after applying the treasury stock method, for purposes of calculating diluted earnings per share ("total treasury stock method incremental shares") and (iii) the number of shares issuable upon concurrent settlement of the convertible notes, the warrant and the convertible note hedge ("incremental shares issued by teleflex upon conversion"):

our convertible notes are convertible under certain circumstances, including in any fiscal quarter following an immediately preceding fiscal quarter in which the last reported sales price of our common stock for at least 20 days during a period of 30 consecutive trading days ending on the last day of such fiscal quarter exceeds 130% of the conversion price of the convertible notes (approximately $79.72). since the fourth quarter of 2013 and in all subsequent periods through december 31, 2014, the last reported sale price of our common stock exceeded the 130% threshold described above and, accordingly, the convertible notes are classified as a current liability as of december 31, 2014 and 2013. the determination of whether or not the convertible notes are convertible under such circumstances is made each quarter until their maturity, conversion or repurchase.  consequently, the convertible notes may not be convertible in one or more future quarters if the common stock price-based conversion contingency is not satisfied in such quarters, in which case the convertible notes would again be classified as long-term debt unless another conversion contingency set forth in the convertible notes has been satisfied. we have elected a net settlement method to satisfy our conversion obligation, under which we will settle the principal amount of the convertible notes in cash and settle the excess conversion value in shares, plus cash in lieu of fractional shares. while we believe we have sufficient liquidity to repay the principal amounts due through a combination of cash on hand and amounts available under our credit facility, our use of these funds could adversely affect our results of operations and liquidity.  the classification of the convertible notes as a current liability had no impact on our financial covenants.
for additional information regarding our indebtedness, please see note 8 to the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10-k.
stock repurchase programs in 2007, our board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to $300 million of outstanding our common stock. repurchases of our stock under the board authorization may be made from time to time in the open market and may include privately-negotiated transactions as market conditions warrant and subject to regulatory considerations. the stock repurchase program has no expiration date and our ability to execute on the program will depend on, among other factors, cash requirements for acquisitions, cash generation from operations, debt repayment obligations, market conditions and regulatory requirements. in addition, under our senior credit agreements, we are subject to certain restrictions relating to its ability to repurchase shares in the event our consolidated leverage ratio (generally, the ratio of consolidated total indebtedness to consolidated ebitda, as defined in the senior credit agreement) exceeds certain levels, which may limit our ability to repurchase shares under this board authorization. through december 31, 2014, no shares have been purchased under this board authorization.

we recorded a noncurrent liability for uncertain tax positions of $50.9 million and $55.2 million as of december 31, 2014 and december 31, 2013, respectively. due to uncertainties regarding the ultimate resolution of ongoing or future tax examinations, we are not able to reasonably estimate the amount of any income tax payments to settle uncertain income tax positions or the periods in which any such payments will be made.
in 2014, cash contributions to all defined benefit pension plans were $9.5 million, and we estimate the amount of required cash contributions in 2015 will be approximately $2.9 million. due to the potential impact of future plan investment performance, changes in interest rates, changes in other economic and demographic assumptions and changes in legislation in the united states and other foreign jurisdictions, we are not able to reasonably estimate the timing and amount of contributions that may be required to fund our defined benefit plans for periods beyond 2015 and as a result, these contributions have been excluded from contractual obligations shown above.

critical accounting estimates the preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. actual results could differ from those estimates and assumptions.
we have identified the following as critical accounting estimates, which are defined as those that are reflective of significant judgments and uncertainties, are the most pervasive and important to the presentation of our financial condition and results of operations and could potentially result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions.
accounting for allowance for doubtful accounts in the ordinary course of business, we grant non-interest bearing trade credit to our customers on normal credit terms.  in an effort to reduce our credit risk, we (i) establish credit limits for all of our customer relationships, (ii) perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers' financial condition, (iii) monitor the payment history and aging of our customers' receivables, and (iv) monitor open orders against an individual customer's outstanding receivable balance.
an allowance for doubtful accounts is maintained for accounts receivable based on our historical collection experience and expected collectability of the accounts receivable, considering the period an account is outstanding, the financial position of the customer and information provided by credit rating services. the adequacy of this allowance is reviewed each reporting period and adjusted as necessary.
in light of the volatility in global economic markets during the past several years, we instituted enhanced measures to facilitate customer-by-customer risk assessment when estimating the allowance for doubtful accounts.  such measures included, monthly credit control committee meetings, at which customer credit risks are identified after review of, among other things, accounts that exceed specified credit limits, payment delinquencies and other customer issues.  in addition, with respect to certain of our non-government customers, we instituted measures designed to reduce our risk exposures, including issuing dunning letters, reducing credit limits, requiring that payments accompany orders and instituting legal action with respect to delinquent accounts.  with respect to government customers, we evaluate receivables for potential collection risks associated with any limitations on the availability of government funding and reimbursement practices.
54
some of our customers, particularly in europe, have extended or delayed payments for products and services already provided resulting in potential collectability concerns regarding our accounts receivable from these customers, for the most part in greece, italy, spain and portugal. at december 31, 2014, these countries accounted for 27.3% of our total net current and long-term accounts receivable. net long-term receivables of $11.3 million and $17.6 million are included in other assets on the balance sheet at december 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively.  if the financial condition of these customers or the healthcare systems in these countries deteriorate to the extent that the ability of an increasing number of customers to make payments is uncertain, additional allowances may be required in future periods. our allowance for doubtful accounts was $8.8 million and $10.7 million at december 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively, which was 2.9% and 3.3% of gross accounts receivable at december 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively.
although we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts to cover the estimated losses which may occur when customers cannot make their required payments, we cannot be assured that we will continue to experience the same loss rate in the future given the volatility in the worldwide economy.  if our allowance for doubtful accounts is insufficient to address receivables we ultimately determine are uncollectible, we would be required to incur additional charges, which could materially adversely affect our results of operations.  moreover, our inability to collect outstanding receivables could adversely affect our financial condition and cash flow from operations.
distributor rebates we offer rebates to certain distributors and reserve an estimate for the rebate as a reduction of revenues at the time of sale. in estimating rebates, we consider the lag time between the point of sale and the payment of the distributor's rebate claim, distributor-specific trend analyses, contractual commitments, including stated rebate rates, historical experience and other relevant information. we adjust reserves to reflect differences between estimated and actual experience, and record the adjustment as a reduction of sales in the period of adjustment. historical adjustments to recorded reserves have not been significant and we do not expect significant revisions of these estimates in the future. the reserve for estimated rebates was $10.4 million and $7.8 million at december 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. we expect the reserve as of december 31, 2014 to be paid within 90 days subsequent to year-end.
inventory utilization inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market. we maintain a reserve for excess and obsolete inventory that reduces the carrying value of our inventories to reflect the diminution of value resulting from product obsolescence, damage or other issues affecting marketability by an amount equal to the difference between the cost of the inventory and its estimated market value.  factors utilized in the determination of estimated market value include (i) current sales data and historical return rates, (ii) estimates of future demand, (iii) competitive pricing pressures, (iv) new product introductions, (v) product expiration dates, and (vi) component and packaging obsolescence.
the adequacy of this reserve is reviewed each reporting period and adjusted as necessary.  we regularly compare inventory quantities on hand against historical usage or forecasts related to specific items in order to evaluate obsolescence and excessive quantities. in assessing historical usage, we also qualitatively assess business trends to evaluate the reasonableness of using historical information as an estimate of future usage.
our inventory reserve was $33.9 million and $32.4 million at december 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively, which equaled 9.2% and 8.9% of gross inventories at those respective dates.
accounting for long-lived assets we assess the remaining useful life and recoverability of long-lived assets whenever events or circumstances indicate the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable (a triggering event). triggering events include the likely (i.e. more likely than not) disposal of a portion of such assets or the occurrence of an adverse change in the market involving the business employing the related assets. significant judgments in this area involve determining whether a triggering event has occurred. the recoverability evaluation is based on various analyses, including undiscounted cash flow projections, which involves significant management judgment. any impairment loss, if indicated, equals the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the estimated fair value of the asset.
55
accounting for goodwill and other intangible assets intangible assets include indefinite-lived assets (such as goodwill and certain trade names or brands), as well as finite-lived intangibles (such as trade names or brands that do not have indefinite lives, customer relationships, patents and other technologies). the costs of finite-lived intangibles are amortized to expense over their estimated life. determining the useful life of an intangible asset requires considerable judgment as different types of intangible assets will have different useful lives. goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets, primarily certain trade names and trademarks, are not amortized but are tested annually for impairment during the fourth quarter, using the first day of the quarter as the measurement date, or earlier upon the occurrence of certain events or substantive changes in circumstances that indicate an impairment may have occurred. such conditions may include an economic downturn in a geographic market or a change in the assessment of future operations. our impairment testing for goodwill is performed separately from our impairment testing of indefinite-lived intangibles.
considerable management judgment is necessary in making the assumptions used in the impairment analysis including evaluating the impact of operating and macroeconomic changes and estimating future cash flows, which are key elements in determining fair value. assumptions used in our impairment evaluations, such as forecasted growth rates and cost of capital, are consistent with internal projections and operating plans. we believe such assumptions and estimates are also comparable to those that would be used by other marketplace participants.
goodwill goodwill impairment assessments are performed at a reporting unit level. for purposes of this assessment, a reporting unit is an operating segment, or a business one level below that operating segment. we have a total of ten reporting units, eight of whose assets include goodwill. in applying the goodwill impairment test, we may assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value. qualitative factors may include, but are not limited to, macroeconomic conditions, industry conditions, the competitive environment, changes in the market for our products and services, regulatory and political developments, and entity specific factors such as strategies and financial performance. if, after completing the qualitative assessment, it is determined more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value, we proceed to a two-step quantitative impairment test, described below. alternatively, we may proceed directly to testing goodwill for impairment through the two-step impairment test without conducting the qualitative analysis. in the fourth quarter 2014, we performed a qualitative assessment on five of our reporting units whose assets include goodwill and determined, based on our assessment, that the fair value of each reporting unit was more likely than not higher than its carrying value and, therefore, that their goodwill is not impaired. for the three remaining reporting units whose assets include goodwill, we elected to forgo the qualitative assessment and test each of those reporting units through the two-step quantitative impairment test.
the first step of the two-step impairment test is to quantitatively compare the fair value of a reporting unit, including goodwill, with its carrying value. in performing the first step, we calculate the fair value of the reporting unit using equal weighting of two methods; one which estimates the discounted cash flows (dcf) of the reporting unit based on projected earnings in the future (the income approach) and one which is based on sales of similar businesses to those of the reporting unit in actual transactions (the market approach).  if the fair value exceeds the carrying value, there is no impairment. if the reporting unit carrying value exceeds the fair value, we recognize an impairment loss based on the amount by which the carrying value of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value, which we determine in the second step of the two-step test. the implied fair value of goodwill is determined by deducting the fair value of a reporting unit's identifiable assets and liabilities from the fair value of the reporting unit as a whole, as if that reporting unit had just been acquired and the fair value of the individual assets acquired and liabilities assumed were being determined initially.
56
determining fair value requires the exercise of significant judgment. the more significant judgments and assumptions used in the income approach include (1) the amount and timing of expected future cash flows which are based primarily on our estimates of future sales, operating income, industry trends and the regulatory environment of the individual reporting units, (2) the expected long-term growth rates for each of our reporting units, which approximate the expected long-term growth rate of the global economy and of the medical device industry, and (3) discount rates that are used to discount future cash flows to their present values, which are based on an assessment of the risk inherent in the future cash flows of the respective reporting units along with various market based inputs.  the more significant judgments and assumptions used in the market approach include (1) determination of appropriate revenue and ebitda multiples used to estimate a reporting unit's fair value and (2) the selection of appropriate comparable companies to be used for purposes of determining those multiples. there were no changes to the underlying methods used in 2014 as compared to the prior year valuations of our reporting units. the dcf analysis utilized in the fourth quarter of 2014 impairment test was performed over a ten year time horizon for each reporting unit. the discount rate was 10.0% for all reporting units. a perpetual growth rate of 2.5% was assumed for all reporting units.
we determined that no impairment in the carrying value of any of our reporting units had occurred, based on our assessment of their respective fair values in the fourth quarter 2014, using the methodology described above.
our expected future growth rates estimated for purposes of the goodwill impairment test are based on our estimates of future sales, operating income and cash flow and are consistent with our internal budgets and business plans, which reflect a modest amount of core revenue growth coupled with the successful launch of new products each year; the effect of these growth indicators more than offset volume losses from products that are expected to reach the end of their life cycle. under the income approach, changes in assumptions could cause a reporting unit's carrying value to exceed its fair value. for example, an increase of over 2.0% in the discount rate or a decrease of over 25% percent in the compound annual growth rate of operating income would indicate impairment for the reporting units. while we believe the assumed growth rates of sales and cash flows are reasonable, the possibility remains that the revenue growth of a reporting unit may not be as high as expected, and, as a result, the estimated fair value may decline. if our strategy and new products are not successful and we do not achieve anticipated core revenue growth in the future with respect to a reporting unit, the goodwill in the reporting unit may become impaired and, in such case, we may incur material impairment charges.
other intangible assets intangible assets are assets acquired that lack physical substance and that meet the specified criteria for recognition apart from goodwill. intangible assets we obtained through acquisitions are comprised mainly of technology, customer relationships, and trade names. management tests indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment annually, and more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that an impairment may have occurred. similar to the goodwill impairment test process, we may assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of an indefinite-lived intangible asset is less than its carrying value. if, after completing the qualitative assessment, we determine it is more likely than not that the fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible asset is greater than its carrying amount, the asset is not impaired. if we conclude it is more likely than not that the fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible assets is less than the carrying value, we then proceed to a quantitative impairment test, which consists of a comparison of the fair value of the intangible assets to their carrying amounts. alternatively, we may elect to forgo the qualitative analysis and proceed directly to testing the indefinite-lived intangible asset for impairment through the quantitative impairment test. in the fourth quarter 2014, we performed a qualitative assessment on all of our indefinite lived assets, except for two trade names, and determined based on the assessment, that their fair values were more likely than not higher than their carrying values. for the remaining two trade names, we elected to test impairment through the quantitative method.
in connection with the quantitative impairment test, since quoted market prices are seldom available for intangible assets, we utilize present value techniques to estimate fair value. the fair value of trade names is estimated by the use of a relief from royalty method, which values an intangible asset by estimating the royalties saved through the ownership of an asset. under this method, an owner of an intangible asset determines the arm's length royalty that likely would have been charged if the owner had to license the asset from a third party. the royalty, which is based on the estimated rate applied against forecasted sales, is tax-effected and discounted to present value using a discount rate commensurate with the relative risk of achieving the cash flow attributable to the asset. management must estimate the hypothetical royalty rate, discount rate, and terminal growth rate to estimate the forecasted cash flows associated with the asset.
57
discount rates and perpetual growth rates utilized in the impairment test of the trade names during the fourth quarter of 2014 are comparable to the rates utilized in the impairment test of goodwill. the compound annual growth rate in revenues projected to be generated from the trade names ranged from 2% to 5% and a royalty rate of 4% was assumed. discount rate assumptions are based on an assessment of the risk inherent in the future cash flows generated from the respective intangible assets. assumptions about royalty rates are based on the rates at which similar trade names are being licensed in the marketplace.
we determined that no impairment in the carrying value of our indefinite-lived intangible assets had occurred, based on our assessment of their respective fair values as determined under the methodology described above.
we are not required to perform an annual impairment test for finite-lived intangible assets (e.g. customer relationships).   for further details on the assessment of recoverability of finite-lived intangible assets see "accounting for long-lived assets."
in may 2012, we acquired semprus biosciences, a biomedical research and development company that developed a polymer surface treatment technology intended to reduce thrombus related complications. as previously disclosed, we experienced difficulties with respect to the development of the semprus technology and were devoting further research and testing towards attempting to resolve the issue. as a result of these efforts, we believe we have resolved the issue and are focused on seeking regulatory approval and engaging in additional research and development efforts to achieve commercialization of this technology. despite this progress, significant challenges to commercialization of the semprus technology remain, and we ultimately may find it necessary to recognize future impairment charges with respect to the related assets, which could be material. as of december 31, 2014, we have recorded ipr&d intangible assets of approximately $41.0 million related to semprus.
accounting for pensions and other postretirement benefits we provide a range of benefits to eligible employees and retired employees, including pensions and postretirement healthcare benefits. several statistical and other factors which are designed to project future events are used in calculating the expense and liability related to these plans. these factors include actuarial assumptions about discount rates, expected rates of return on plan assets, compensation increases, turnover rates and healthcare cost trend rates. we review the actuarial assumptions on an annual basis and make modifications to the assumptions based on current rates and trends when appropriate.
significant differences in our actual experience or significant changes in our assumptions may materially affect our pension and other postretirement obligations and our future expense. the following table shows the sensitivity of plan expenses and benefit obligations to changes in the weighted average assumptions:
assumed discount rate                                                   expected return on plan assets                          assumed healthcare trend rate

share-based compensation we estimate the fair value of share-based awards on the date of grant using an option pricing model. the value of the portion of the award that is ultimately expected to vest is recognized as expense over the requisite service periods. share-based compensation expense related to stock options is measured using a black-scholes option pricing model that takes into account highly subjective and complex assumptions with respect to expected life of options, volatility, risk-free interest rate and expected dividend yield. the expected life of options granted represents the period of time that options granted are expected to be outstanding, which is derived from the vesting period of the award, as well as historical exercise behavior. expected volatility is based on a blend of historical volatility and implied volatility derived from publicly traded options to purchase our common stock, which we believe is more reflective of the market conditions and a better indicator of expected volatility than solely using historical volatility. the risk-free interest rate is the implied yield currently available on united states treasury zero-coupon issues with a remaining term equal to the expected life of the option. share based compensation expense for 2014, 2013 and 2012 was $12.2 million, $11.9 million and $8.6 million, respectively.
accounting for contingent consideration liabilities in connection with an acquisition, we may be required to pay future consideration that is contingent upon the achievement of specified objectives, such as receipt of regulatory approval, commercialization of a product, achievement of sales targets, or the passage of time. as of the acquisition date, we record a contingent liability representing the estimated fair value of the contingent consideration we expect to pay. the fair value of the contingent consideration is calculated based on a probability-weighted discounted cash flow analysis. we remeasure this liability each reporting period and record the change in the liability's fair value in our consolidated statement of income (loss). an increase or decrease in the fair value can result from changes in the discount rate, timing, estimated probability of achievement of the specified objectives and revenue estimates, among other factors. as of december 31, 2014, the range of undiscounted amounts the company could be required to pay under contingent consideration arrangements is between $15.0 million and $83.0 million. as of december 31, 2014 and 2013, we accrued $33.4 million and $20.3 million of contingent consideration, respectively. for the twelve months ended december 31, 2014 and 2013, we recorded reductions to contingent consideration of $8.2 million and $12.3 million, respectively. these reductions were the result of changes in estimated probabilities associated with certain regulatory sales milestones.
accounting for income taxes our annual provision for income taxes and determination of the deferred tax assets and liabilities require management to assess uncertainties, make judgments regarding outcomes and utilize estimates. we conduct a broad range of operations around the world, subjecting us to complex tax regulations in numerous international jurisdictions, resulting at times in tax audits, disputes with tax authorities and potential litigation, the outcome of which is uncertain. management must make judgments about such uncertainties and determine estimates of our tax assets and liabilities. deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured and recorded using currently enacted tax rates, which we expect will apply to taxable income in the years in which differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their tax bases are recovered or settled. the likelihood of a material change in our expected realization of these assets is dependent on future taxable income, our ability to use foreign tax credit carryforwards and carrybacks, final united states and foreign tax settlements, and the effectiveness of our tax planning strategies in the various relevant jurisdictions. while management believes that its judgments and interpretations regarding income taxes are appropriate, significant differences in actual experience may require future adjustments to our tax assets and liabilities, which could be material.
we are also required to assess the realizability of our deferred tax assets.  we evaluate all positive and negative evidence and use judgments regarding past and future events, including results of operations and available tax planning strategies that could be implemented to realize the deferred tax assets. based on this assessment, we determine when it is more likely than not that all or some portion of our deferred tax assets may not be realized, in which case we apply a valuation allowance to offset the amount of such deferred tax assets.  to the extent facts and circumstances change in the future, adjustments to the valuation allowances may be required.
the valuation allowance for deferred tax assets of $99.1 million and $86.5 million at december 31, 2014 and december 31, 2013, respectively, relates principally to the uncertainty of the utilization of tax loss and credit carryforwards in various jurisdictions.

significant judgment is required in determining income tax provisions and in evaluating tax positions. we establish additional provisions for income taxes when, despite the belief that tax positions are supportable, there remain certain positions that do not meet the minimum probability threshold, which is a tax position that is more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by the applicable taxing authority. in the normal course of business, we are examined by various federal, state and foreign tax authorities. we regularly assess the potential outcomes of these examinations and any future examinations for the current or prior years in determining the adequacy of our provision for income taxes. we adjust the income tax provision, the current tax liability and deferred taxes in any period in which facts that necessitate an adjustment become known. specifically, we are currently in the midst of examinations by the austrian, canadian, german, and the united states taxing authorities with respect to our income tax returns for those countries for various tax years. the ultimate outcomes of the examinations of these returns could result in increases or decreases to our recorded tax liabilities, which would affect our financial results.

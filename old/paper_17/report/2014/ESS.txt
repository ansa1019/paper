item 1a: risk factors for purposes of this section, the term "stockholders" means the holders of shares of essex property trust, inc.'s common stock and preferred stock. set forth below are the risks that we believe are material to essex property trust, inc.'s stockholders and essex portfolio, l.p.'s unit holders. you should carefully consider the following factors in evaluating our company, our properties and our business.
our business, operating results, cash flows and financial condition are subject to various risks and uncertainties, including, without limitation, those set forth below, any one of which could cause our actual operating results to vary materially from recent results or from our anticipated future results.
risks related to real investments and our operations general real estate investment risks may adversely affect property income and values. real estate investments are subject to a variety of risks. if the communities do not generate sufficient income to meet operating expenses, including debt service and capital expenditures, cash flow and the ability to make distributions to stockholders will be adversely affected. income from the communities may be further adversely affected by, among other things, the following factors:
•   the general economic climate;
•   local economic conditions in which the communities are located, such as oversupply of housing or a reduction in demand for rental housing;
•   the attractiveness of the communities to tenants;
•   competition from other available housing;
•   rent control or stabilization laws or other laws regulating housing; and
•   the company's ability to provide for adequate maintenance and insurance.
as leases at the communities expire, tenants may enter into new leases on terms that are less favorable to the company. income and real estate values also may be adversely affected by such factors as applicable laws (e.g., the americans with disabilities act of 1990 and tax laws). real estate investments are relatively illiquid and, therefore, the company's ability to vary its portfolio promptly in response to changes in economic or other conditions may be quite limited.
short-term leases expose us to the effects of declining market rents.  substantially all of our apartment leases are for a term of one year or less. because these leases generally permit the residents to leave at the end of the lease term without penalty, our rental revenues are impacted by declines in market rents more quickly than if our leases were for longer terms.
the company may not realize the expected benefits of its merger with bre because of transition difficulties and other challenges. as a result of its merger with bre properties, inc., the company will face various additional risks, including, among others, the following:
•   the company has incurred substantial expenses related to the merger;
•   the company may be unable to integrate bre successfully and realize the anticipated synergies and other benefits of the merger or do so within the anticipated timeframe;
•   properties acquired pursuant to the merger are subject to property value reassessments by taxing authorities, which may in turn lead to property tax increases that are higher than anticipated;
•   the company's future results will suffer if the company does not effectively manage its expanded operations resulting from the merger; and
•   joint ventures entered into in connection with the merger could be adversely affected by the company's lack of sole decision-making authority, its reliance on its joint venture partner's financial condition and disputes between the company and its joint venture partner.
any of these risks could adversely affect the company's business and financial results.
we may pursue acquisitions, dispositions, investments and joint ventures, which could adversely affect our results of operations. we may make acquisitions of and investments in businesses that offer complementary properties and communities to augment our market coverage, or enhance our property offerings, such as our recent acquisition of bre. we may also enter into strategic alliances or joint ventures to achieve these goals. we cannot assure you that we will be able to identify suitable acquisition, investment, alliance, or joint venture opportunities, that we will be able to consummate any such transactions or relationships on terms and conditions acceptable to us, or that such transactions or relationships will be successful. in addition,
7
our original estimates and assumptions used in assessing any acquisition may be inaccurate, and we may not realize the expected financial or strategic benefits of any such acquisition. from time to time, we may also divest portions of our business that are no longer strategically important or exit minority investments, which could materially affect our ffo, cash flows and results of operations.
these transactions or any other acquisitions or dispositions involve risks and uncertainties. for example, the integration of acquired businesses may not be successful and could result in disruption to other parts of our business. to integrate acquired businesses, we must implement our management information systems, operating systems and internal controls, and assimilate and manage the personnel of the acquired operations. there can be no assurance that all pre-acquisition property due diligence will have identified all material issues that might arise with respect to such acquired business and its properties.
any acquisition may also cause us to assume liabilities and ongoing lawsuits, acquire goodwill and other non-amortizable intangible assets that will be subject to impairment testing and potential impairment charges, incur amortization expense related to certain intangible assets, increase our expenses and working capital requirements, and subject us to litigation, which would reduce our return on invested capital. in addition, if the businesses or properties that we acquire have a different pricing or cost structure than we do, such acquisitions may adversely affect our profitability and reduce our overall margin. failure to manage and successfully integrate the acquisitions we make or to improve margins of the acquired businesses and products could materially harm our business, operating results and margins. any dispositions we may make may also result in ongoing obligations to us following any such divestiture, for example as a result of any transition services or indemnities we agree to provide to the purchaser in any such transaction, which may result in additional expenses and may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operation.
any future acquisitions we make may also require significant additional debt or equity financing, which, in the case of debt financing, would increase our leverage and potentially affect our credit ratings and, in the case of equity or equity-linked financing, would be dilutive to our existing stockholders. we also assumed a significant amount of debt in connection with our acquisition of bre, which is secured by the substantial majority of the properties acquired. any downgrades in our credit ratings associated with an acquisition could adversely affect our ability to borrow by resulting in more restrictive borrowing terms. as a result of the foregoing, we also may not be able to complete acquisitions or other strategic transactions in the future to the same extent as in the past, or at all. these and other factors could harm our ability to achieve anticipated levels of profitability at acquired operations or realize other anticipated benefits of an acquisition, and could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. all of the above factors apply to our acquisition of bre.
national and regional economic environments can negatively impact the company's operating results. during the recent past, a confluence of factors has resulted in job losses, turmoil and volatility in the capital markets, and caused a national and global recession. the company's forecast for the national economy assumes growth of the gross domestic product of the national economy and the economies of the west coast states. in the event of another recession, the company could incur reductions in rental rates, occupancy levels, property valuations and increases in operating costs such as advertising and turnover expenses.
inflation/deflation may affect rental rates and operating expenses. substantial inflationary or deflationary pressures could have a negative effect on rental rates and property operating expenses.
acquisitions of communities may fail to meet expectations. the company intends to continue to acquire apartment communities. however, there are risks that acquisitions will fail to meet the company's expectations. the company's estimates of future income, expenses and the costs of improvements or redevelopment that are necessary to allow the company to market an acquired apartment community as originally intended may prove to be inaccurate. the company expects to finance future acquisitions, in whole or in part, under various forms of secured or unsecured financing or through the issuance of partnership units by the operating partnership or related partnerships or additional equity by the company. the use of equity financing, rather than debt, for future developments or acquisitions could dilute the interest of the company's existing stockholders. if the company finances new acquisitions under existing lines of credit, there is a risk that, unless the company obtains substitute financing, the company may not be able to secure further lines of credit for new development or such lines of credit may be not available on advantageous terms.
development and redevelopment activities may be delayed, not completed, and/or not achieve expected results. the company pursues development and redevelopment projects and these projects generally require various governmental and other approvals, which have no assurance of being received. the company's development and redevelopment activities generally entail certain risks, including the following:
•   funds may be expended and management's time devoted to projects that may not be completed;
8
•   construction costs of a project may exceed original estimates possibly making the project economically unfeasible;
•   projects may be delayed due to, without limitation, adverse weather conditions, labor or material shortage;
•   occupancy rates and rents at a completed project may be less than anticipated; and
•   expenses at completed development projects may be higher than anticipated.
these risks may reduce the funds available for distribution to the company's stockholders. further, the development and redevelopment of communities is also subject to the general risks associated with real estate investments. for further information regarding these risks, please see the risk factor titled "general real estate investment risks may adversely affect property income and values."
the geographic concentration of the company's communities and fluctuations in local markets may adversely impact the company's financial condition and operating results. the company generated significant amounts of rental revenues for the year ended december 31, 2014, from the company's communities concentrated in southern california (los angeles, orange, santa barbara, san diego, and ventura counties), northern california (the san francisco bay area), and the seattle metropolitan area. for the year ended december 31, 2014, 80% of the company's rental revenues were generated from communities located in california. this geographic concentration could present risks if local property market performance falls below expectations. the economic condition of these markets could adversely affect underlying asset values and the occupancy, property revenues, and expenses of the company's communities. the financial results of major local employers also may impact the cash flow and value of certain of the communities. this could have a negative impact on the company's financial condition and operating results, which could affect the company's ability to pay expected dividends to its stockholders and the operating partnership's ability to pay expected distributions to unit holders.
our property taxes could increase due to reassessment or property tax rate changes. real property taxes on our properties may increase as our properties are reassessed by taxing authorities or as property tax rates change. thus, our real estate taxes in the state of washington could increase as a result of property value reassessments or increased property tax rates in that state. a current california law commonly referred to as proposition 13 generally limits annual real estate tax increases on california properties to 2% of assessed value. however, under proposition 13, property tax reassessment generally occurs as a result of a "change in ownership" of a property, as specially defined for purposes of those rules. because the property taxing authorities may not determine whether there has been a "change in ownership" or the actual reassessed value of a property for a period of time after a transaction has occurred, we may not know the impact of a potential reassessment for a considerable amount of time following a particular transaction. therefore, the amount of property taxes we are required to pay could increase substantially from the property taxes we currently pay or have paid in the past, including on a retroactive basis. in addition, from time to time voters and lawmakers have announced initiatives to repeal or amend proposition 13 to eliminate its application to commercial and industrial property and/or introduce split tax roll legislation. such initiatives, if successful, would increase the assessed value and/or tax rates applicable to commercial property in california, including our apartment communities. an increase in the assessed value of our properties or our property tax rates could adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations.
competition in the apartment community market may adversely affect operations and the rental demand for the company's communities. there are numerous housing alternatives that compete with the company's communities in attracting residents. these include other apartment communities and single-family homes that are available for rent in the markets in which the communities are located. if the demand for the company's communities is reduced or if competitors develop and/or acquire competing apartment communities, rental rates may drop, which may have a material adverse effect on the company's financial condition and results of operations. the company also faces competition from other real estate investment trusts, businesses and other entities in the acquisition, development and operation of apartment communities. this competition may result in an increase in costs and prices of apartment communities that the company acquires and/or develops.
bond compliance requirements may limit income from certain communities. at december 31, 2014, the company had approximately $179.2 million of variable rate tax-exempt financing. this tax-exempt financing provides for certain deed restrictions and restrictive covenants. the company expects to engage in tax-exempt financings in the future. the code and rules and regulations thereunder impose various restrictions, conditions and requirements in order to allow the note holder to exclude interest on qualified bond obligations from gross income for federal income tax purposes. the code also requires that at least 20% of apartment units be made available to residents with gross incomes that do not exceed a specified percentage, generally 50%, of the median income for the applicable family size as determined by the housing and urban development department of the federal government. certain state and local authorities may impose additional rental restrictions. these restrictions may limit income from the tax-exempt financed communities if the company is required to lower rental rates to attract residents who satisfy the median income test. if the company does not reserve the required number of apartment homes for residents satisfying these income requirements, the tax-exempt status of the bonds may be terminated, the obligations under the bond documents may be accelerated and the company may be subject to additional contractual liability.
9
investments in mortgages and other real estate securities could affect the company's ability to make distributions to stockholders. the company may invest in securities related to real estate, which could adversely affect the company's ability to make distributions to stockholders. the company may purchase securities issued by entities which own real estate and invest in mortgages or unsecured debt obligations. these mortgages may be first, second or third mortgages that may or may not be insured or otherwise guaranteed. in general, investments in mortgages include the following risks:
•   that the value of mortgaged property may be less than the amounts owed, causing realized or unrealized losses;
•   the borrower may not pay indebtedness under the mortgage when due, requiring the company to foreclose, and the amount recovered in connection with the foreclosure may be less than the amount owed;
•   that interest rates payable on the mortgages may be lower than the company's cost of funds; and
•   in the case of junior mortgages, that foreclosure of a senior mortgage could eliminate the junior mortgage.
if any of the above were to occur, it could adversely affect cash flows from operations and the company's ability to make expected dividends to stockholders and the operating partnership's ability to make expected distributions to unit holders.
compliance with laws benefiting disabled persons may require the company to make significant unanticipated expenditures or impact the company's investment strategy. a number of federal, state and local laws (including the americans with disabilities act) and regulations exist that may require modifications to existing buildings or restrict certain renovations by requiring improved access to such buildings by disabled persons and may require other structural features which add to the cost of buildings under construction. legislation or regulations adopted in the future may impose further burdens or restrictions on the company with respect to improved access by disabled persons. the costs of compliance with these laws and regulations may be substantial.
the company's portfolio may have environmental liabilities. under various federal, state and local environmental and public health laws, regulations and ordinances we have been from time to time, and may be required in the future, regardless of knowledge or responsibility, to investigate and remediate the effects of hazardous or toxic substances or petroleum product releases at our properties (including in some cases naturally occurring substances such as methane and radon gas) and may be held liable under these laws or common law to a governmental entity or to third parties for response costs, property damage, personal injury or natural resources damages and for investigation and remediation costs incurred as a result of the contamination resulting from such releases. while the company is unaware of any such response action required or damage claims associated with its existing properties which individually or in aggregate would have a materially adverse effect on our business, assets, financial condition or results of operations, potential future costs and damage claims may be substantial and could exceed any insurance coverage we may or may not have for such events. further, the presence of such substances, or the failure to properly remediate the contamination, may adversely affect our ability to borrow against, develop, sell or rent the affected property. in addition, some environmental laws create or allow a government agency to impose a lien on the contaminated site in favor of the government for damages and costs it incurs as a result of the contamination.
certain environmental laws impose liability for release of asbestos-containing materials ("acms") into the air, and third parties may seek recovery from owners or operators of apartment communities for personal injury associated with acms. in connection with the ownership (direct or indirect), operation, management and development of our communities, the company could be considered an owner or operator of such properties or as having arranged for the disposal or treatment of hazardous or toxic substances and, therefore, may be potentially liable for removal or remediation costs, as well as certain other costs, including governmental fines and costs related to injuries of persons and property.
investments in real property create a potential for environmental liabilities on the part of the owner of such real property. the company carries certain limited insurance coverage for this type of environmental risk as to its properties; however, such coverage is not fully available for all properties and, as to those properties for which limited coverage is fully available it may not apply to certain claims arising from known conditions present on those properties. in general, in connection with the ownership, operation, financing, management and development of its communities, the company may be potentially liable for removal or clean-up costs, as well as certain other costs and environmental liabilities. the company may also be subject to governmental fines and costs related to injuries to third persons and damage to their property.
properties which we intend to acquire undergo a pre-acquisition phase i environmental site assessment before acquisition intended to afford the company protection against so-called "owner liability" under the primary federal environmental law, as well as further environmental assessment, which generally does not involve invasive techniques such as soil or ground water sampling except where conditions warranting such further assessment are identified and seller's consent is obtained. while such assessments are conducted in accordance with applicable "appropriate inquiry" standards, no assurance can be given that all environmental conditions present will be discovered or that the full nature and extent of those conditions which are discovered will be adequately ascertained and quantified.
10
in connection with our ownership, operation and development of communities, from time to time we undertake remedial action in response to the presence of subsurface or other contaminants, including contaminants in soil, groundwater and soil vapor beneath or affecting our buildings. the company does so under appropriate environmental regulatory requirements with the objective of obtaining regulatory closure or a no further action determination that will allow for future use, development and sale of any impacted community.
mold growth may occur when excessive moisture accumulates in buildings or on building materials, particularly if the moisture problem remains undiscovered or is not addressed over a period of time. although the occurrence of mold at multifamily and other structures, and the need to remediate such mold, is not a new phenomenon, there has been increased awareness in recent years that certain molds may in some instances lead to adverse health effects, including allergic or other reactions. the company has adopted policies for promptly addressing and resolving reports of mold when it is detected, and to minimize any impact mold might have on residents of the property. the company believes its mold policies and proactive response to address any known existence reduces its risk of loss from these cases; however, no assurance can be provided that the company has identified and responded to all mold occurrences.
california has enacted legislation commonly referred to as "proposition 65" requiring that "clear and reasonable" warnings be given to consumers who are exposed to chemicals known to the state of california to cause cancer or reproductive toxicity, including tobacco smoke. although the company has sought to comply with proposition 65 requirements, the company cannot assure you that the company will not be adversely affected by litigation relating to proposition 65.
methane gas is a naturally-occurring gas that is commonly found below the surface in several areas, particularly in the southern california coastal areas. methane is a non-toxic gas, but can be flammable and can be explosive at sufficient concentrations when in confined spaces and exposed to an ignition source. naturally-occurring, methane gas is regulated at the state and federal level as a greenhouse gas but is not otherwise regulated as a hazardous substance, however some local governments, such as the county of los angeles, have imposed requirements that new buildings install detection and/or venting systems in areas where naturally occurring methane gas is known to be located and can accumulate. methane gas is also associated with certain industrial activities, such as former municipal waste landfills. radon is also a naturally-occurring gas that is found below the surface. the company cannot assure you that it will not be adversely affected by costs related to its compliance with methane or radon gas related requirements or litigation costs related to methane or radon gas.
we cannot assure you that costs or liabilities incurred as a result of environmental matters will not affect our ability to make distributions to stockholders, or that such costs or liabilities will not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations; provided, however, the company is unaware of any pending or threatened alleged claim resulting from such matters which would have a material adverse effect on the company's financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.
adverse changes in laws may affect the company's liability relating to its properties and its operations. increases in real estate taxes and income, service and transfer taxes cannot always be passed through to residents or users in the form of higher rents, and may adversely affect the company's cash available for distribution and its ability to make distributions to its stockholders and pay amounts due on its debt. similarly, changes in laws increasing the potential liability for environmental conditions existing on properties or increasing the restrictions on discharges or other conditions, as well as changes in laws affecting development, construction and safety requirements, may result in significant unanticipated expenditures, which could have a material adverse effect on the company and its ability to make distributions to its stockholders and pay amounts due on our debt. for example, the california statute known as "sb375" provides that, in order to reduce greenhouse emissions, there should be regional planning to coordinate housing needs with regional transportation. such planning could lead to restrictions on property development that adversely affect the company. in addition, future enactment of rent control or rent stabilization laws or other laws regulating multifamily housing, as well as any lawsuits against the company arising from such rent control or other laws, may reduce rental revenues or increase operating costs.
risks related to our indebtedness and financings capital and credit market conditions may affect the company's access to sources of capital and/or the cost of capital, which could negatively affect the company's business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. in periods when the capital and credit markets experience significant volatility, the amounts, sources and cost of capital available to the company may be adversely affected. the company's current balance sheet, the debt capacity available on the unsecured line of credit with a diversified bank group, access to the public and private placement debt markets and secured debt financing providers such as fannie mae and freddie mac provides some insulation from volatile capital markets.
11
historically, the company has utilized borrowing from fannie mae and freddie mac. there are no assurances that these entities will lend to the company in the future.  beginning in 2011, the company has primarily utilized unsecured debt and has repaid secured debt at or near their respective maturity and has placed less reliance on agency mortgage debt financing. the administration and lawmakers have proposed potential options for the future of agency mortgage finance in the u.s. that could involve the phase out of fannie mae and freddie mac. while we believe fannie mae and freddie mac will continue to provide liquidity to our sector, should they discontinue doing so, have their mandates changed or reduced or be disbanded or reorganized by the government, it would reduce our access to debt capital and could adversely affect our ability to finance or refinance existing indebtedness at competitive rates and it may adversely affect our ability to sell assets. in general, to the extent that the company's access to capital and credit is at a higher cost than the company has experienced in recent years (reflected in higher interest rates for debt financing or a lower stock price for equity financing without corresponding change to investment cap rates) the company's ability to make acquisitions, develop communities, obtain new financing, and refinance existing borrowing at competitive rates could adversely impact the company's financial standing and related credit rating.
debt financing has inherent risks. at december 31, 2014, the company had approximately $5.1 billion of indebtedness (including $660.6 million of variable rate indebtedness, of which $225.0 million is subject to interest rate swaps effectively fixing the interest rate and $153.2 million is subject to interest rate cap protection). the company is subject to the risks normally associated with debt financing, including the following:
•   cash flow may not be sufficient to meet required payments of principal and interest;
•   inability to refinance maturing indebtedness on encumbered apartment communities;
•   inability to comply with debt covenants could cause an acceleration of the maturity date; and
•   paying debt before the scheduled maturity date could result in prepayment penalties.
the company may not be able to refinance its indebtedness. this indebtedness includes secured mortgages, and the communities subject to these mortgages could be foreclosed upon or otherwise transferred to the lender. this could cause the company to lose income and asset value. the company may be required to refinance the debt at higher interest rates or on terms that may not be as favorable as the terms of existing indebtedness.
debt financing of communities may result in insufficient cash flow to service debt. where appropriate, the company intends to continue to use leverage to increase the rate of return on the company's investments and to provide for additional investments that the company could not otherwise make. there is a risk that the cash flow from the communities will be insufficient to meet both debt payment obligations and the distribution requirements of the real estate investment trust provisions of the internal revenue code of 1986, as amended (the "code"). the company may obtain additional debt financing in the future through mortgages on some or all of the communities. these mortgages may be recourse, non-recourse, or cross-collateralized.
our ability to make payments on and to refinance our indebtedness and to fund our operations, working capital and capital expenditures, depends on our ability to generate cash in the future. to a certain extent, our cash flow is subject to general economic, industry, regional, financial, competitive, operating, legislative, regulatory, taxation and other factors, many of which are beyond our control.
as of december 31, 2014, the company had 68 consolidated communities encumbered by debt. with respect to the 68 communities encumbered by debt, all of them are secured by deeds of trust relating solely to those communities. the holders of this indebtedness will have rights with respect to these communities and lenders may seek foreclosure of communities which would reduce the company's income and net asset value, and its ability to service other debt.
rising interest rates may affect the company's costs of capital and financing activities and results of operation. interest rates could increase, which could result in higher interest expense on the company's variable rate indebtedness or increase interest rates when refinancing maturing fixed rate debt. prolonged interest rate increases could negatively impact the company's ability to make acquisitions and develop apartment communities with positive economic returns on investment and the company's ability to refinance existing borrowings.
interest rate hedging arrangements may result in losses. periodically, the company has entered into agreements to reduce the risks associated with increases in interest rates, and may continue to do so. although these agreements may partially protect against rising interest rates, they also may reduce the benefits to the company if interest rates decline. if a hedging arrangement is not indexed to the same rate as the indebtedness that is hedged, the company may be exposed to losses to the extent that the rate governing the indebtedness and the rate governing the hedging arrangement change independently of each other. finally, nonperformance by the other party to the hedging arrangement may subject the company to increased credit risks. in order to
12
minimize counterparty credit risk, the company enters into hedging arrangements only with financial institutions that have a current rating of a or higher.
a downgrade in the company's investment grade credit rating could materially and adversely affect its business and financial condition. the company plans to manage its operations to maintain its investment grade credit rating with a capital structure consistent with its current profile, but there can be no assurance that it will be able to maintain its current credit ratings. any downgrades in terms of ratings or outlook by any of the rating agencies could have a material adverse impact on the company's cost and availability of capital, which could in turn have a material adverse impact on its financial condition, results of operations and liquidity.
changes in the company's financing policy may lead to higher levels of indebtedness. the company's organizational documents do not limit the amount or percentage of indebtedness that may be incurred. the company has adopted a policy of maintaining a limit on debt financing consistent with the existing covenants required to maintain the company's unsecured line of credit bank facility, unsecured debt and senior unsecured bonds. if the company changed this policy, the company could incur more debt, which could result in a default under the company's existing indebtedness, thereby causing such indebtedness to become due and payable, and an increase in debt service requirements that could adversely affect the company's financial condition and results of operations. such increased debt could exceed the underlying value of the communities.
risks related to our organization and ownership of essex's stock the company depends on its key personnel.  the company's success depends on its ability to attract and retain executive officers, senior officers and company managers. there is substantial competition for qualified personnel in the real estate industry and the loss of any of the company's key personnel could have an adverse effect on the company.
the price per share of the company's stock may fluctuate significantly. the market price per share of the company's common stock may fluctuate significantly in response to many factors, including without limitation:
•   regional, national and global economic conditions;
•   actual or anticipated variations in the company's quarterly operating results or dividends;
•   changes in the company's funds from operations or earnings estimates;
•   issuances of common stock, preferred stock or convertible debt securities;
•   publication of research reports about the company or the real estate industry;
•   the general reputation of real estate investment trusts and the attractiveness of their equity securities in comparison to other equity securities (including securities issued by other real estate based companies);
•   general stock and bond market conditions, including changes in interest rates on fixed income securities, that may lead prospective purchasers of the company's stock to demand a higher annual yield from dividends;
•   availability to capital markets and cost of capital;
•   a change in analyst ratings or the company's credit ratings;
•   terrorist activity may adversely affect the markets in which the company's securities trade, possibly increasing market volatility and causing erosion of business and consumer confidence and spending; and
•   natural disasters such as earthquakes.
many of the factors listed above are beyond the company's control. these factors may cause the market price of shares of the company's common stock to decline, regardless of the company's financial condition, results of operations, or business prospects.
the company's future issuances of common stock, preferred stock or convertible debt securities could adversely affect the market price of the company's common stock. in order to finance the company's acquisition and development activities, the company has issued and sold common stock, preferred stock and convertible debt securities. for example, during the years ended december 31, 2014 and 2013, the company issued 3.0 million (excluding shares issued in connection with the bre merger) and 0.9 million shares of common stock for $534.0 million and $138.4 million, net of fees and commissions, respectively. the company may in the future sell further shares of common stock, including pursuant to its equity distribution programs with cantor fitzgerald & co., barclays capital inc., bmo capital markets corp., bnp paribas securities corp., citigroup global markets inc., jefferies llc ("jefferies"), j.p. morgan securities llc ("jp morgan"), liquidnet, inc., mitsubishi ufj securities (usa), inc., and ubs securities llc ("ubs").
in 2014, the company filed a new shelf registration statement with the sec, allowing the company to sell an undetermined number of equity and debt securities as defined in the prospectus. future sales of common stock, preferred stock or convertible
13
debt securities may dilute stockholder ownership in the company and could adversely affect the market price of the common stock.
the company's joint ventures and joint ownership of communities and partial interests in corporations and limited partnerships could limit the company's ability to control such communities and partial interests. instead of purchasing and developing apartment communities directly, the company has invested and may continue to invest in joint ventures. joint venture partners often have shared control over the development and operation of the joint venture assets. therefore, it is possible that a joint venture partner in an investment might become bankrupt, or have economic or business interests or goals that are inconsistent with the company's business interests or goals, or be in a position to take action contrary to the company's instructions or requests, or its policies or objectives. consequently, a joint venture partners' actions might subject property owned by the joint venture to additional risk. although the company seeks to maintain sufficient influence over any joint venture to achieve its objectives, the company may be unable to take action without its joint venture partners' approval, or joint venture partners could take actions binding on the joint venture without its consent. a joint venture partner might fail to approve decisions that are in the company's best interest. should a joint venture partner become bankrupt, the company could become liable for such partner's share of joint venture liabilities. in some instances, the company and the joint venture partner may each have the right to trigger a buy-sell arrangement, which could cause the company to sell its interest, or acquire a partner's interest, at a time when the company otherwise would have not have initiated such a transaction.
from time to time, the company, through the operating partnership, invests in corporations, limited partnerships, limited liability companies or other entities that have been formed for the purpose of acquiring, developing, financing, or managing real property. in certain circumstances, the operating partnership's interest in a particular entity may be less than a majority of the outstanding voting interests of that entity. therefore, the operating partnership's ability to control the daily operations of such an entity may be limited. furthermore, the operating partnership may not have the power to remove a majority of the board of directors (in the case of a corporation) or the general partner or partners (in the case of a limited partnership) of such an entity in the event that its operations conflict with the operating partnership's objectives. the operating partnership may not be able to dispose of its interests in such an entity. in the event that such an entity becomes insolvent, the operating partnership may lose up to its entire investment in and any advances to the entity. the company may also incur losses if any guarantees or indemnifications were made by the company. the company also owns properties indirectly under "downreit" structures. the company has, and in the future may, enter into transactions that could require the company to pay the tax liabilities of partners, which contribute assets into downreits, joint ventures or the operating partnership, in the event that certain taxable events, which are within the company's control, occur. although the company plans to hold the contributed assets or defer recognition of gain on sale pursuant to the like-kind exchange rules under section 1031 of the code, the company can provide no assurance that the company will be able to do so and if such tax liabilities were incurred they could have a material impact on its financial position.
the company's chairman is involved in other real estate activities and investments, which may lead to conflicts of interest. the company's chairman, george m. marcus is not an employee of the company, and is involved in other real estate activities and investments, which may lead to conflicts of interest. mr. marcus owns interests in various other real estate-related businesses and investments. he is the chairman of the marcus & millichap company ("mmc"), which is a parent company of a diversified group of real estate service, investment and development firms.  mr. marcus is also the co-chairman of marcus & millichap, inc. ("mmi"), and mr. marcus owns a controlling interest in mmi.  mmi is a national brokerage firm listed on the nyse that underwent its initial public offering in 2013.
mr. marcus has agreed not to divulge any confidential or proprietary information that may be received by him in his capacity as chairman of the company to any of his affiliated companies and that he will absent himself from any and all resolutions by the company's board of directors regarding any proposed acquisition and/or development of an apartment community where it appears that there may be a conflict of interest with any of his affiliated companies. notwithstanding this agreement, mr. marcus and his affiliated entities may potentially compete with the company in acquiring and/or developing apartment communities, which competition may be detrimental to the company. in addition, due to such potential competition for real estate investments, mr. marcus and his affiliated entities may have a conflict of interest with the company, which may be detrimental to the interests of the company's stockholders.
the influence of executive officers, directors and significant stockholders may be detrimental to holders of common stock. as of december 31, 2014, george m. marcus, the chairman of the company's board of directors, wholly or partially owned 1.6 million shares of common stock (including shares issuable upon exchange of limited partnership interests in the operating partnership and certain other partnerships, indirectly held common shares and assuming exercise of all vested options), respectively.  mr. marcus currently does not have majority control over the company. however, he currently has, and likely will continue to have, significant influence with respect to the election of directors and approval or disapproval of significant
14
corporate actions. consequently, his influence could result in decisions that do not reflect the interests of all the company's stockholders.
under the partnership agreement of the operating partnership, the consent of the holders of limited partnership interests is generally required for certain amendments of the agreement and for certain extraordinary actions. through their ownership of limited partnership interests and their positions with the company, the company's directors and executive officers, including mr. marcus, have substantial influence on the company. consequently, their influence could result in decisions that do not reflect the interests of all stockholders.
the voting rights of preferred stock may allow holders of preferred stock to impede actions that otherwise benefit holders of common stock. essex currently has outstanding shares of 7.125% series h cumulative redeemable preferred stock ("series h preferred stock"). in general, the holders of the company's outstanding shares of series h preferred stock do not have any voting rights. however, if full distributions are not made on outstanding series h preferred stock for six quarterly distributions periods, the holders of series h preferred stock, together with holders of other series of preferred stock upon which like voting rights have been conferred, will have the right to elect two additional directors to serve on essex's board of directors.
these voting rights continue until all distributions in arrears and distributions for the current quarterly period on the series h preferred stock have been paid in full. at that time, the holders of the series h preferred stock are divested of these voting rights, and the term of office of the directors so elected immediately terminates. while any shares of the company's series h preferred stock are outstanding, the company may not, without the consent of the holders of two-thirds of the outstanding shares of series h preferred stock:
•   authorize or create any class or series of stock that ranks senior to the series h preferred stock with respect to the payment of dividends, rights upon liquidation, dissolution or winding-up of the company's business; or
•   amend, alter or repeal the provisions of the company's charter, including by merger or consolidation, that would materially and adversely affect the rights of the series h preferred stock; provided that in the case of a merger or consolidation, so long as the series h preferred stock remains outstanding with the terms thereof materially unchanged or the holders of shares of series h preferred stock receive shares of stock or other equity securities with rights, preferences, privileges and voting powers substantially similar to that of the series h preferred stock, the occurrence of such merger or consolidation shall not be deemed to materially and adversely affect the rights of the holders of the series h preferred stock.
these voting rights of the holders of the series h preferred stock and of other preferred stock may allow such holders to impede or veto actions that would otherwise benefit the holders of the company's common stock.
the indentures governing our notes contain restrictive covenants that limit our operating flexibility. the indentures that govern our publicly registered notes contain financial and operating covenants that, among other things, restrict our ability to take specific actions, even if we believe them to be in our best interest, including restrictions on our ability to:
•   consummate a merger, consolidation or sale of all or substantially all of our assets; and
•   incur additional secured and unsecured indebtedness.
the instruments governing our other unsecured indebtedness require us to meet specified financial covenants, including covenants relating to net worth, fixed charge coverage, debt service coverage, the amounts of total indebtedness and secured indebtedness, leverage and certain investment limitations. these covenants may restrict our ability to expand or fully pursue our business strategies. our ability to comply with these provisions and those contained in the indentures governing the notes, may be affected by changes in our operating and financial performance, changes in general business and economic conditions, adverse regulatory developments or other events adversely impacting us. the breach of any of these covenants, including those contained in our indentures, could result in a default under our indebtedness, which could cause those and other obligations to become due and payable. if any of our indebtedness is accelerated, we may not be able to repay it.
the maryland business combination law may not allow certain transactions between the company and its affiliates to proceed without compliance with such law. under maryland law, "business combinations" between a maryland corporation and an interested stockholder or an affiliate of an interested stockholder are prohibited for five years after the most recent date on which the interested stockholder becomes an interested stockholder. these business combinations include a merger, consolidation, share exchange, or, in circumstances specified in the statute, an asset transfer or issuance or reclassification of equity securities. an interested stockholder is defined as any person (and certain affiliates of such person) who beneficially owns ten percent or more of the voting power of the then-outstanding voting stock. the law also requires a supermajority stockholder vote for such transactions. this means that the transaction must be approved by at least:
15
•   80% of the votes entitled to be cast by holders of outstanding voting shares; and
•   two-thirds of the votes entitled to be cast by holders of outstanding voting shares other than shares held by the interested stockholder with whom the business combination is to be effected.
the statute permits various exemptions from its provisions, including business combinations that are exempted by the board of directors prior to the time that the interested stockholder becomes an interested stockholder. these voting provisions do not apply if the stockholders receive a minimum price, as defined under maryland law. as permitted by the statute, the board of directors of the company irrevocably has elected to exempt any business combination by the company, george m. marcus, who is the chairman of the company, and mmc or any entity owned or controlled by mr. marcus and mmc. consequently, the five-year prohibition and supermajority vote requirement described above will not apply to any business combination between the company, mr. marcus, or mmc. as a result, the company may in the future enter into business combinations with mr. marcus and mmc, without compliance with the supermajority vote requirements and other provisions of the maryland business combination act.
anti-takeover provisions contained in the operating partnership agreement, charter, bylaws, and certain provisions of maryland law could delay, defer or prevent a change in control. while the company is the sole general partner of the operating partnership, and generally has full and exclusive responsibility and discretion in the management and control of the operating partnership, certain provisions of the operating partnership agreement place limitations on the company's ability to act with respect to the operating partnership. such limitations could delay, defer or prevent a transaction or a change in control that might involve a premium price for the company's stock or otherwise be in the best interest of the stockholders or that could otherwise adversely affect the interest of the company's stockholders. the partnership agreement provides that if the limited partners own at least 5% of the outstanding units of partnership interest in the operating partnership, the company cannot, without first obtaining the consent of a majority-in-interest of the limited partners in the operating partnership, transfer all or any portion of the company's general partner interest in the operating partnership to another entity. such limitations on the company's ability to act may result in the company's being precluded from taking action that the board of directors believes is in the best interests of the company's stockholders.
the company's charter authorizes the issuance of additional shares of common stock or preferred stock and the setting of the preferences, rights and other terms of such preferred stock without the approval of the holders of the common stock. the company may establish one or more series of preferred stock that could delay, defer or prevent a transaction or a change in control. such a transaction might involve a premium price for the company's stock or otherwise be in the best interests of the holders of common stock. also, such a class of preferred stock could have dividend, voting or other rights that could adversely affect the interest of holders of common stock.
the company's charter contains other provisions that may delay, defer or prevent a transaction or a change in control that might be in the best interest of the company's stockholders. the charter contains ownership provisions limiting the transferability and ownership of shares of capital stock, which may have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing a transaction or a change in control. for example, subject to receiving an exemption from the board of directors, potential acquirers may not purchase more than 6% in value of the stock (other than qualified pension trusts which can acquire 9.9%). this may discourage tender offers that may be attractive to the holders of common stock and limit the opportunity for stockholders to receive a premium for their shares of common stock.
the maryland general corporation law restricts the voting rights of shares deemed to be "control shares." under the maryland general corporation law, "control shares" are those which, when aggregated with any other shares held by the acquirer, entitle the acquirer to exercise voting power within specified ranges. although the bylaws exempt the company from the control share provisions of the maryland general corporation law, the board of directors may amend or eliminate the provisions of the bylaws at any time in the future. moreover, any such amendment or elimination of such provision of the bylaws may result in the application of the control share provisions of the maryland general corporation law not only to control shares which may be acquired in the future, but also to control shares previously acquired. if the provisions of the bylaws are amended or eliminated, the control share provisions of the maryland general corporation law could delay, defer or prevent a transaction or change in control that might involve a premium price for the stock or otherwise be in the best interests of the company's stockholders.
the company's charter and bylaws also contain other provisions that may impede various actions by stockholders without approval of the company's board of directors, which in turn may delay, defer or prevent a transaction, including a change in control. those provisions include:
•   directors may be removed, without cause, only upon a two-thirds vote of stockholders, and with cause, only upon a majority vote of stockholders;
16
•   the company's board can fix the number of directors and fill vacant directorships upon the vote of a majority of the directors;
•   stockholders must give advance notice to nominate directors or propose business for consideration at a stockholders' meeting; and
•   for stockholders to call a special meeting, the meeting must be requested by not less than a majority of all the votes entitled to be cast at the meeting.
a breach of the company's privacy or information security systems could materially adversely affect the company's business and financial condition. the protection of customer, employee, and company data is critically important to the company. our business requires us, including some of our vendors, to use and store personally identifiable and other sensitive information of its customers and employees. the collection and use of personally identifiable information is governed by federal and state laws and regulations. privacy and information security laws continue to evolve and may be inconsistent from one jurisdiction to another. compliance with all such laws and regulations may increase the company's operating costs and adversely impact the company's ability to market the company's properties and services.
the security measures put in place by the company, and such vendors, cannot provide absolute security, and the company and our vendors' information technology infrastructure may be vulnerable to criminal cyber-attacks or data security incidents due to employee error, malfeasance, or other vulnerabilities.  any such incident could compromise the company's or such vendors' networks, and the information stored by the company or such vendors could be accessed, misused, publicly disclosed, corrupted, lost, or stolen, resulting in fraud, including wire fraud related to company assets, or other harm.  moreover, if a data security incident or breach affects the company's systems or such vendors' systems or results in the unauthorized release of personally identifiable information, the company's reputation and brand could be materially damaged and the company may be exposed to a risk of loss or litigation and possible liability, which could result in a material adverse effect on the company's business, results of operations, and financial condition.
in the third quarter of 2014, the company discovered and reported that certain of its computer networks containing personal and proprietary information were compromised by a cyber-intrusion. based on information from our forensic investigation, the company has confirmed that evidence exists of exfiltration of data on company systems. the precise nature of the data has not yet been identified, and the company does not presently have any evidence that data belonging to the company has been misused.
after detecting unusual activity, the company took immediate steps to assess and contain the intrusion and secure its systems. the company retained independent forensic computer experts to analyze the impacted data systems and is consulting with law enforcement. the investigation into this cyber-intrusion is ongoing, and the company is working as quickly as possible to identify whether any employee or resident data may be at risk.  as a precaution, the company has purchased identity protection services for all current residents and employees.
as described in note 16, "commitments and contingencies", of our notes to consolidated financial statements included in part iv, item 15 of this annual report on form 10-k, on december 19, 2014, a punitive class action was filed against the company in the u.s. district court for the northern district of california, entitled foster v. essex property trust, inc. alleging that the company failed to properly secure the personally-identifying information of its residents. at this point, the company is unable to predict the developments in, outcome of, and/or economic and/or other consequences of such pending litigation or future litigation or predict the developments in, outcome of, and/or other consequences arising as a result of any potential government inquiries related to this matter.
the company has recorded $1.6 million and $2.8 million in cyber-intrusion expenses in the fourth quarter and year ended december 31, 2014, respectively, including legal fees, investigative fees, costs of communications with the company's residents and employees, and identity protection services.  the company expects to incur additional costs as investigation and remediation efforts continue.  such costs are not currently estimable but could be material to the company's future operating results.
privacy and information security risks have generally increased in recent years because of the proliferation of new technologies and the increased sophistication and activities of perpetrators of cyber-attacks. in light of this recent network intrusion, we have dedicated additional company resources to strengthening the security of the company's computer systems.  in the future, the company may be required to expend additional resources to continue to enhance the company's information security measures and/or to investigate and remediate any information security vulnerabilities.  despite these steps, there can be no assurance that the company will not suffer a similar data security incident in the future, that unauthorized parties will not gain access to sensitive data stored on the company's systems, or that any such incident will be discovered in a timely manner.  further, the
17
techniques used by criminals to obtain unauthorized access to sensitive data are often novel or change frequently; accordingly, the company may be unable to anticipate these techniques or implement adequate preventative measures.
employee theft or fraud could result in loss. certain of our employees have access to, or signature authority with respect to, bank accounts or other company assets, which exposes us to the risk of fraud or theft. in addition, certain employees have access to key information technology (it) infrastructure and to tenant and other information that is commercially valuable. should any employee compromise our it systems, or misappropriate tenant or other information, we could incur losses, including significant financial or reputational harm, from which full recovery cannot be assured. we also may not have insurance that covers any losses in full or that covers losses from particular criminal acts. as of december 31, 2014, potential liabilities for theft or fraud are not quantifiable and an estimate of possible loss cannot be made.
the company may incur general uninsured losses. the company purchases general liability and all risk property, including loss of rent, insurance coverage for each of its communities. the company also purchases limited earthquake, terrorism, environmental and flood insurance. there are certain types of losses which may not be covered or could exceed coverage limits. the insurance programs are subject to deductibles and self-insured retentions in varying amounts. the company utilizes a wholly owned insurance subsidiary, pacific western insurance llc ("pwi") to self-insure certain earthquake and all risk losses. as of december 31, 2014, pwi has cash and marketable securities of approximately $57.6 million, and is consolidated in the company's financial statements.
all the communities are located in areas that are subject to earthquake activity. the company evaluates its financial loss exposure to seismic events by using actuarial loss models developed by the insurance industry and property vulnerability based on structural evaluations of seismic consultants. the company manages this exposure, where considered appropriate, desirable, and cost-effective, by upgrading properties to increase their resistance to forces caused by seismic events, by considering available funds and coverages provided by pwi and/or by purchasing seismic insurance. since 2013, the company accessed the commercial marketplace to purchase earthquake insurance for certain high-density properties.
in addition, the company carries other types of insurance coverage related to a variety of risks and exposures, including cyber-attack.
based on market conditions, the company may change or potentially eliminate insurance coverages, or increase levels of self-insurance. further, we cannot assure you that the company will not incur losses, which could be material, due to uninsured risks, deductibles and self-insured retentions, and/or losses in excess of coverage limits.
although the company may carry insurance for potential losses associated with its communities, employees, residents, and compliance with applicable laws, it may still incur losses due to uninsured risks, deductibles, copayments or losses in excess of applicable insurance coverage and those losses may be material. in the event of a substantial loss, insurance coverage may not be able to cover the full replacement cost of the company's lost investment, or the insurance carrier may become insolvent and not be able to cover the full amount of the insured losses. changes in building codes and ordinances, environmental considerations and other factors might also affect the company's ability to replace or renovate an apartment community after it has been damaged or destroyed.
risk of accidental death due to fire, natural disasters or other hazards. the accidental death of persons living in our communities due to fire, natural disasters or other hazards could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. our insurance coverage may not cover all losses associated with such events, and we may experience difficulty marketing communities where such any such events have occurred, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.
any material weaknesses identified in the company's internal control over financial reporting could have an adverse effect on the company's stock price. section 404 of the sarbanes-oxley act of 2002 requires the company to evaluate and report on its internal control over financial reporting. if the company identifies one or more material weaknesses in its internal control over financial reporting, the company could lose investor confidence in the accuracy and completeness of its financial reports, which in turn could have an adverse effect on the company's stock price.
changes in the system for establishing u.s. accounting standards may materially and adversely affect our reported results of operations. accounting for public companies in the united states has historically been conducted in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles as in effect in the united states ("gaap"). gaap is established by the financial accounting standards board (the "fasb"), an independent body whose standards are recognized by the sec as authoritative for publicly held companies. the international accounting standards board (the "iasb") is a london-based independent board
18
established in 2001 and charged with the development of international financial reporting standards ("ifrs"). ifrs generally reflects accounting practices that prevail in europe and in developed nations around the world.
we are monitoring the sec's activity with respect to the proposed adoption of ifrs by united states public companies. it is unclear at this time how the sec will propose that gaap and ifrs be harmonized if the proposed change is adopted. in addition, switching to a new method of accounting and adopting ifrs would be a complex undertaking. we would potentially need to develop new systems and controls based on the principles of ifrs. since these are new endeavors, and the precise requirements of the pronouncements ultimately to be adopted are not now known, the magnitude of costs associated with this conversion are uncertain.
we are currently evaluating the impact of the adoption of ifrs on our financial position and results of operations. such evaluation cannot be completed, however, without more clarity regarding the specific ifrs standards that would potentially be adopted. until there is more certainty with respect to the ifrs standards that could be adopted, prospective investors should consider that our conversion to ifrs could have a material adverse impact on our reported results of operations.
tax risks there are various u.s. tax risks in connection with an investment in the company and in essex portfolio, l.p. the company has elected to be taxed as a reit under the code. the company's qualification as a reit (i) requires it to satisfy numerous annual and quarterly requirements, including income tests and asset tests, established under highly technical and complex code provisions for which there are only limited judicial or administrative interpretations, and (ii) involves the determination of various factual matters and circumstances not entirely within the company's control. although the company intends that its current organization and method of operation enable it to qualify as a reit, it cannot assure you that it so qualifies or that it will be able to remain so qualified in the future. future legislation, new regulations, administrative interpretations or court decisions (any of which could have retroactive effect) could adversely affect the company's ability to qualify as a reit or adversely affect the company's stockholders. if the company fails to qualify as a reit in any taxable year, the company would be subject to u.s. federal income tax (including any applicable alternative minimum tax) on the company's taxable income at corporate rates, and the company would not be allowed to deduct dividends paid to its stockholders in computing its taxable income. the company would also be disqualified from treatment as a reit for the four taxable years following the year in which the company failed to qualify. the additional tax liability would reduce its net earnings available for investment or distribution to stockholders, and the company would no longer be required to make distributions to its stockholders.
the company has established several taxable reit subsidiaries ("trss"). the trss must pay u.s. federal income tax on their taxable income. while the company will attempt to ensure that its dealings with its trss do not adversely affect its reit qualification, it cannot provide assurances that it will successfully achieve that result. furthermore, the company may be subject to a 100% penalty tax, or its trss may be denied deductions, to the extent dealings between the company and its trss are not deemed to be arm's length in nature. the company intends that its dealings with its trss will be on an arm's length basis. no assurances can be given, however, that the internal revenue service will not challenge such dealings.
from time to time, the company may transfer or otherwise dispose of some of its properties.  under the code, any gain resulting from transfers of properties that the company holds as inventory or primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of business would be treated as income from a prohibited transaction subject to a 100% penalty tax. since the company acquires properties for investment purposes, it does not believe that its occasional transfers or disposals of property should be treated as prohibited transactions. however, whether property is held for investment purposes depends on all the facts and circumstances surrounding the particular transaction. the internal revenue service may contend that certain transfers or disposals of properties by the company are prohibited transactions. if the internal revenue service were to argue successfully that a transfer or disposition of property constituted a prohibited transaction, then the company would be required to pay a 100% penalty tax on any gain allocable to it from the prohibited transaction, and the company's ability to retain proceeds from real property sales may be jeopardized. income from a prohibited transaction might adversely affect the company's ability to satisfy the income tests for qualification as a reit for u.s. federal income tax purposes. therefore, no assurances can be given that the company will be able to satisfy the income tests for qualification as a reit if the company transferred or disposed of property in a transaction treated as a prohibited transaction.
dividends paid by reits to u.s. stockholders that are individuals, trusts or estates are generally not eligible for the reduced tax rate applicable to qualified dividends received from non-reit corporations (the maximum rate on qualified dividends is currently 23.8%). u.s. individual, trust or estate stockholders who receive dividends from a reit that are not designated as
19
capital gain dividends will be taxed on such dividends at ordinary income rates (at a current maximum rate of 43.4%). this may cause investors to view reit investments to be less attractive than investments in non-reit corporations, which in turn may adversely affect the value of stock in reits, including the company's stock.
non-u.s. investors that invest in the company should be aware of the following u.s. federal income tax considerations in connection with such investment. first, distributions by the company from its current and accumulated earnings and profits are subject to a 30% u.s. withholding tax in the hands of non-u.s. investors, unless the 30% may be reduced by an applicable income tax treaty. such distributions may also be subject to a 30% withholding tax under the "foreign account tax compliance act" ("fatca") unless a non-u.s. investor complies with certain requirements prescribed by fatca. second, distributions by the company that are attributable to gains from dispositions of u.s. real property ("capital gain dividends") will be treated as income that is effectively connected with a u.s. trade or business in the hands of a non-u.s. investor, such that a non-u.s. investor will have u.s. federal income tax payment and filing obligations with respect to capital gain dividends. furthermore, capital gain dividends are subject to an additional 30% "branch profits tax" (which may be reduced by an applicable income tax treaty) in the hands of a non-u.s. investor that is a corporation. third, any gain derived by a non-u.s. investor on a disposition of such investor's stock in the company will subject such investor to u.s. federal income tax payment and filing requirements if the company were not treated as a domestically-controlled reit. a reit is "domestically controlled" if less than 50% of the reit's capital stock, by value, has been owned directly or indirectly by persons who are not qualifying u.s. persons during a continuous five-year period ending on the date of disposition or, if shorter, during the entire period of the reit's existence. the company believes that it is a domestically-controlled reit, but no assurances can be given in this regard. even if the company were not a domestically-controlled reit, however, under a special exception non-u.s. investors should not have u.s. federal income tax payment and filing obligations on a disposition of their stock in the company if (i) they did not own more than 5% of such stock at any time during the one-year period ending on the date of the disposition, and (ii) the company's stock continues to be regularly traded on an established securities market located in the united states. non-u.s. investors should consult with their independent advisors as to the above u.s. tax considerations and other u.s. tax consequences of an investment in the company's stock, in light of their particular circumstances.
the company believes that its operating partnership, essex portfolio, l.p., will continue to qualify to be treated as a partnership for u.s. federal income tax purposes. as a partnership, essex portfolio, l.p. is not subject to u.s. federal income tax on its income. instead, each of its partners will be required to pay tax on such partner's allocable share of the income of essex portfolio, l.p. no assurances can be given, however, that the internal revenue service will not challenge essex portfolio, l.p.'s status as a partnership for u.s. federal income tax purposes, or that a court would not sustain such a challenge. if the internal revenue service were successful in treating essex portfolio, l.p. as a corporation for u.s. federal income tax purposes, the company could fail to meet the income tests and/or the asset tests applicable to reits and, accordingly, cease to qualify as a reit. also, the failure of essex portfolio, l.p. to qualify as a partnership would cause it to become subject to federal and state corporate income tax, which would reduce significantly the amount of cash available for distribution to its partners.
item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the accompanying consolidated financial statements and notes thereto.  these consolidated financial statements include all adjustments which are, in the opinion of management, necessary to reflect a fair statement of the results and all such adjustments are of a normal recurring nature.
on april 1, 2014, we completed the merger with bre properties, inc. ("bre"). for further details regarding the merger, see the discussion set forth under the caption "current business activities - merger with bre properties, inc." in part i, item 1 of this annual report on form 10-k, which is incorporated herein by reference.  the net assets and results of operations of bre are included in our consolidated financial statements as of april 1, 2014.  certain statements below discuss the company's estimates of its 2015 regional same-property revenues; these estimates are for essex on a standalone basis, excluding the impact of the merger with bre.
overview ess is a self-administered and self-managed reit that acquires, develops, redevelops and manages apartment communities in selected residential areas located primarily in the west coast of the united states.  ess owns all of its interests in its real estate investments, directly or indirectly, through the operating partnership.  ess is the sole general partner of the operating partnership and, as of december 31, 2014, had an approximately 96.7% general partner interest in the operating partnership.
the company's investment strategy has two components: constant monitoring of existing markets, and evaluation of new markets to identify areas with the characteristics that underlie rental growth.  the company's strong financial condition supports its investment strategy by enhancing its ability to quickly shift acquisition, development, and disposition activities to markets that will optimize the performance of the portfolio.
as of december 31, 2014, the company had ownership interests in 239 communities, comprising 57,455 apartment units.
the company's apartment communities are predominately located in the following major regions:
southern california (los angeles, orange, riverside, san diego, santa barbara, and ventura counties)
northern california (the san francisco bay area)
seattle metro (seattle metropolitan area)
as of december 31, 2014, the company's development pipeline was comprised of two consolidated projects under development, ten unconsolidated joint venture projects under development and various consolidated predevelopment projects aggregating 2,920 units, with total incurred costs of $1.1 billion, and estimated remaining project costs of approximately $0.4 billion for total estimated project costs of $1.5 billion.
36
as of december 31, 2014, the company also had ownership interests in four commercial buildings (with approximately 325,200 square feet).
by region, the company's operating results for 2014 and 2013 and projections for 2015 new housing supply, job growth, and rental income are as follows:
southern california region:  as of december 31, 2014, this region represented 47% of the company's consolidated apartment units.  during the year ended december 31, 2014, revenues for "2014/2013 same-properties" (as defined below), or "same-property revenues," increased 5.5% in 2014 as compared to 2013.  in 2015, the company expects new residential supply of 17,950 multifamily and 14,300 single family homes, which represents a total new multifamily supply of 0.8% and 0.6% of total housing stock, respectively.  the company assumes an increase of 150,000 jobs or 2.1%, and an increase in same-property revenues between 4.50% to 5.50% in 2015.
northern california region:  as of december 31, 2014, this region represented 31% of the company's consolidated apartment units.  same-property revenues increased 9.6% in 2014 as compared to 2013.  in 2015, the company expects new residential supply of 11,400 multifamily and 7,000 single family homes, which represents a total new multifamily supply of 1.3% and 0.8%, respectively, of total housing stock.  the company assumes an increase of 90,200 jobs or 2.9%, and an increase in same-property revenues between 8.25% to 9.25% in 2015.
seattle metro region: as of december 31, 2014, this region represented 21% of the company's consolidated apartment units.  same-property revenues increased 7.5% in 2014 as compared to 2013.  in 2015, the company expects new residential supply of 9,000 multifamily and 7,500 single family homes, which represents a total new multifamily supply of 1.9% and 1.4%, respectively, of total housing stock.  the company assumes an increase of 43,300 jobs or 2.8%, and an increase in same-property revenues between 5.75% to 6.75% in 2015.
the company expects 2015 same-property revenues to increase compared to 2014 results, as renewal and new leases are signed at higher rents in 2015 than 2014.  same-property operating expenses are expected to increase in 2015 by 3% to 4%.
the company's consolidated communities are as follows:
as of   as of december 31, 2014   december 31, 2013

results of operations comparison of year ended december 31, 2014 to the year ended december 31, 2013
the company's average financial occupancies for the company's stabilized apartment communities or "2014/2013 same-properties" (stabilized properties consolidated by the company for the years ended december 31, 2014 and 2013) increased 10 basis points to 96.2% in 2014 from 96.1% in 2013.  financial occupancy is defined as the percentage resulting from dividing actual rental revenue by total possible rental revenue.  actual rental revenue represents contractual rental revenue pursuant to leases without considering delinquency and concessions.  total possible rental revenue represents the value of all apartment units, with occupied units valued at contractual rental rates pursuant to leases and vacant units valued at estimated market rents.
37
we believe that financial occupancy is a meaningful measure of occupancy because it considers the value of each vacant unit at its estimated market rate.
market rates are determined using the recently signed effective rates on new leases at the property and are used as the starting point in the determination of the market rates of vacant units. the company may increase or decrease these rates based on the supply and demand in the apartment community's market. the company will check the reasonableness of these rents based on its position within the market and compare the rents against the asking rents by comparable properties in the market. financial occupancy may not completely reflect short-term trends in physical occupancy and financial occupancy rates, as disclosed by other reits, may not be comparable to the company's calculation of financial occupancy.
the company does not take into account delinquency and concessions to calculate actual rent for occupied units and market rents for vacant units.  the calculation of financial occupancy compares contractual rates for occupied units to estimated market rents for unoccupied units, thus the calculation compares the gross value of all apartment units excluding delinquency and concessions. for apartment communities that are development properties in lease-up without stabilized occupancy figures, the company believes the physical occupancy rate is the appropriate performance metric.  while an apartment community is in the lease-up phase, the company's primary motivation is to stabilize the property which may entail the use of rent concessions and other incentives, and thus financial occupancy which is based on contractual revenue is not considered the best metric to quantify occupancy.

2014/2013 same-property revenues increased by $41.1 million or 7.3% to $599.9 million for 2014 compared to $558.8 million in 2013.  the increase was primarily attributable to an increase in scheduled rents of $39.1 million as reflected in an increase of 7.1% in average rental rates from $1,619 per unit for 2013 to $1,734 per unit for 2014.  scheduled rents increased in all regions by 5.2%, 9.5%, and 7.4% in southern california, northern california, and seattle metro, respectively.  income from utility billings and other income increased by $2.2 million and $1.1 million, respectively in 2014 compared to 2013.  financial occupancy increased 10 basis points in 2014 to 96.2% compared to 96.1% in 2013.
38
2014/2013 non-same property revenues increased by $36.8 million or 85.2% to $80.0 million in 2014 compared to $43.2 million to 2013.  the increase was primarily due to revenue generated from twelve communities acquired or consolidated since january 1, 2013.
management and other fees from affiliates increased $2.0 million or 28.7% to $9.3 million in 2014 compared to $7.3 million in 2013.  the increase is primarily due to the asset and property management fees earned from the wesco iii, wesco iv, and bexaew co-investments formed during 2014. the increase in management fees was offset by a reduction of $1.2 million in asset and property management fees from the sale of two fund ii communities in 2014.
property operating expenses, excluding real estate taxes increased $64.3 million or 46.3% in 2014 compared to 2013, primarily due to properties acquired in connection with the bre merger and six other communities in 2014.  2014/2013 same-property operating expenses excluding real estate taxes, increased by $3.8 million or 3.0% in 2014 compared to 2013, due mainly to a $1.6 million increase in repairs and maintenance and a $1.3 million increase in utilities expense.
real estate taxes increased $50.6 million or 88.3% in 2014 compared to 2013, due primarily to properties acquired in connection with the bre merger and six other communities in 2014.  2014/2013 same-property real estate taxes increased by $2.3 million or 4.5% for 2014 compared to 2013 due to a $1.6 million or 15.6% increase in property taxes for seattle metro due to higher assessed values for 2014.
depreciation and amortization expense increased by $168.2 million or 87.4% in 2014 compared to 2013, due to the acquisition of bre and six other communities.  the increase is due to the capitalization of approximately $313.1 million in additions to rental properties through 2014, including $152.8 million spent on acquisition of and additions to real estate under development, $81.4 million spent on redevelopment, and $78.9 million spent on capital expenditures on rental properties.  approximately $122.0 million in additions to rental properties were capitalized for 2013, including $17.8 million spent on acquisition of and additions to real estate under development, $47.3 million spent on redevelopment, and $56.9 million spent on capital expenditures on rental properties.
general and administrative expense increased $14.2 million or 53.2% in 2014 compared to 2013 primarily due to additional corporate employees from the bre merger and $2.8 million in expenses related to the cyber-intrusion.
merger and integration expenses include, but are not limited to, advisor fees, legal fees, and accounting fees related to the bre merger. the company completed the merger with bre on april 1, 2014. merger and integration expenses were $53.5 million for 2014 and $4.3 million for 2013.
interest expense increased $48.0 million or 41.2% in 2014, primarily due to additional debt assumed as part of the bre merger, offset by an increase in capitalized interest from development and redevelopment projects.
equity income from co-investments decreased by $16.0 million to $39.9 million in 2014 compared to $55.9 million in 2013.  the decrease was primarily due to the company's share of the gain on the sale of two fund ii communities of $6.6 million, promote income of $10.6 million, and income from early redemption of preferred equity investments of $5.3 million in 2014, compared to the company's share of gain on the sale of five fund ii communities of $38.8 million, net of internal dispositions costs in 2013.

2013/2012 non-same property revenues increased by $44.9 million or 102% to $89.1 million in 2013 compared to $44.2 million to 2012.  the increase was primarily due to revenue generated from fifteen communities acquired or consolidated since january 1, 2012 (annaliese, ascent, bennett lofts, domain, domaine, essex skyline at macarthur place, fox plaza, montebello, park catalina, park west, reed square, slater 116, the huntington, vox and willow lake).
management and other fees from affiliates decreased $1.2 million or 14.1% to $7.3 million in 2013 compared to $8.5 million in 2012.  the decrease is primarily due to a reduction of $2.3 million in asset and property management fees from the sale of eight fund ii communities since the fourth quarter of 2012. an additional four communities owned by fund ii were sold in 2013.
property operating expenses, excluding real estate taxes increased $14.9 million or 12.1% in 2013 compared to 2012, primarily due to the acquisition of fifteen communities.  2013/2012 same-property operating expenses excluding real estate taxes, increased by $3.6 million or 3.2% in 2013 compared to 2012, due mainly to a $1.4 million increase in repairs and maintenance, a $1.2 million increase in utilities expense, and a $0.9 million increase in administration costs.

ess's business is operated primarily through the operating partnership. ess issues public equity from time to time, but does not otherwise generate any capital itself or conduct any business itself, other than incurring certain expenses in operating as a public company which are fully reimbursed by the operating partnership. ess itself does not hold any indebtedness, and its only material asset is its ownership of partnership interests of the operating partnership. ess's principal funding requirement is the payment of dividends on its common stock and preferred stock. ess's principal source of funding for its dividend payments is distributions it receives from the operating partnership.
as of december 31, 2014, ess owned a 96.7% general partner interest and the limited partners owned the remaining 3.3% interest in the operating partnership.
the liquidity of ess is dependent on the operating partnership's ability to make sufficient distributions to ess. the primary cash requirement of ess is its payment of dividends to its stockholders. ess also guarantees some of the operating partnership's debt, as discussed further in notes 7 and 8 of the notes to consolidated financial statements included elsewhere
41
herein. if the operating partnership fails to fulfill certain of its debt requirements, which trigger the ess's guarantee obligations, then ess will be required to fulfill its cash payment commitments under such guarantees. however, ess's only significant asset is its investment in the operating partnership.
for ess to maintain its qualification as a reit, it must pay dividends to its stockholders aggregating annually at least 90% of its reit taxable income, excluding net capital gains. while historically ess has satisfied this distribution requirement by making cash distributions to its stockholders, it may choose to satisfy this requirement by making distributions of cash or other property, including, in limited circumstances, ess's own stock. as a result of this distribution requirement, the operating partnership cannot rely on retained earnings to fund its ongoing operations to the same extent that other companies whose parent companies are not reits can. ess may need to continue to raise capital in the equity markets to fund the operating partnership's working capital needs, acquisitions and developments.

at december 31, 2014, the company had $25.3 million of unrestricted cash and cash equivalents and $117.2 million in marketable securities, of which $44.2 million were held available for sale.  the company believes that cash flows generated by its operations, existing cash and cash equivalents, marketable securities balances, availability under existing lines of credit, access to capital markets and the ability to generate cash from the disposition of real estate are sufficient to meet all of the company's reasonably anticipated cash needs during 2015.  the timing, source and amounts of cash flows provided by financing activities and used in investing activities are sensitive to changes in interest rates and other fluctuations in the capital markets environment, which can affect the company's plans for acquisitions, dispositions, development and redevelopment activities.

42
tax-exempt variable rate demand notes with a weighted average interest rate of 1.8%. the tax-exempt variable rate demand notes have maturity dates ranging from 2025 to 2040, and $153.2 million are subject to interest rate caps.
the company's unsecured line of credit and unsecured debt agreements contain debt covenants related to limitations on indebtedness and liabilities and maintenance of minimum levels of consolidated earnings before depreciation, interest and amortization.  the company was in compliance with the debt covenants as of december 31, 2014 and 2013.
the company pays quarterly dividends from cash available for distribution. until it is distributed, cash available for distribution is invested by the company primarily in investment grade securities held available for sale or is used by the company to reduce balances outstanding under its line of credit.
the company has benefited from borrowing from fannie mae and freddie mac, and there are no assurances that these entities will lend to the company in the future.  to the extent that the company's access to capital and credit is at a higher cost than the company has experienced in recent years (reflected in higher interest rates for debt financing or a lower stock price for equity financing) the company's ability to make acquisitions, develop communities, obtain new financing, and refinance existing borrowing at competitive rates could be adversely impacted.  for the past two years the company has primarily issued unsecured debt and repaid secured debt when it has matured to place less reliance on mortgage debt financing, and to unencumber more of the company's communities.
derivative activity the company uses interest rate swaps and interest rate cap contracts to manage certain interest rate risks. the valuation of these instruments is determined using widely accepted valuation techniques including discounted cash flow analysis on the expected cash flows of each derivative. this analysis reflects the contractual terms of the derivatives, including the period to maturity, and uses observable market-based inputs, including interest rate curves. the fair values of interest rate swaps are determined using the market standard methodology of netting the discounted future fixed cash receipts (or payments) and the discounted expected variable cash payments (or receipts). the variable cash payments (or receipts) are based on an expectation of future interest rates (forward curves) derived from observable market interest rate curves. the company incorporates credit valuation adjustments to appropriately reflect both its own nonperformance risk and the respective counterparty's nonperformance risk in the fair value measurements.
the company has entered into interest rate swap contracts with an aggregate notional amount of $225.0 million that effectively fixed the interest rate on the $225.0 million unsecured term loan at 2.4%.  these derivatives qualify for hedge accounting.
as of december 31, 2014 the company also had nine interest rate cap contracts totaling a notional amount of $153.2 million that effectively limit the company's exposure to interest rate risk by providing a ceiling on the underlying variable interest rate for $153.2 million of the company's tax exempt variable rate debt.
as of december 31, 2014 and 2013, the aggregate carrying value of the interest rate swap contracts was a liability of $1.8 million and $2.7 million, respectively. the aggregate carrying value of the interest rate cap contracts was zero on the balance sheets as of december 31, 2014 and 2013.
hedge ineffectiveness related to cash flow hedges, which is reported in current year income as interest expense was not significant for the years ended december 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012.

the company expects to fund the development and predevelopment pipeline by using a combination of some or all of the following sources: its working capital, amounts available on its lines of credit, construction loans, net proceeds from public and private equity and debt issuances, and proceeds from the disposition of properties, if any.
redevelopment pipeline the company defines redevelopment communities as existing properties owned or recently acquired, which have been targeted for additional investment by the company with the expectation of increased financial returns through property improvement.  during redevelopment, apartment units may not be available for rent and, as a result, may have less than stabilized operations.  as of december 31, 2014, the company had ownership interests in three major redevelopment communities aggregating 963 apartment units with estimated redevelopment costs of $122.0 million, of which approximately $96.4 million remains to be expended.

(1)   interest on indebtedness for variable debt was calculated using interest rates as of december 31, 2014.
variable interest entities in accordance with accounting standards for consolidation of variable interest entities (vies), the company consolidates 17 downreit limited partnerships (comprising ten communities).  the company consolidates these entities because it is deemed the primary beneficiary.  the consolidated total assets and liabilities related to these vies, net of intercompany eliminations, were approximately $200.0 million and $196.6 million, respectively, as of december 31, 2014, and $194.9 million and $178.3 million respectively, as of december 31, 2013.  interest holders in vies consolidated by the company are allocated net income equal to the cash payments made to those interest holders for services rendered or distributions from cash flow.  the remaining results of operations are generally allocated to the company.  as of december 31, 2014, the company did not have any vie's of which it was not deemed to be the primary beneficiary.
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of consolidated financial statements, in accordance with u.s. generally accepted accounting principles, requires the company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities.  the company defines critical accounting policies as those accounting policies that require the company's management to exercise their most difficult, subjective and complex judgments.  the company's critical accounting policies relate principally to the following key areas: (i) accounting for business combinations; (ii) consolidation under applicable accounting standards of various entities; (iii) assessing the carrying values of the company's real estate and investments in and advances to joint ventures and affiliates; and (iv) internal cost capitalization.  the company bases its estimates on historical experience, current market conditions, and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. actual results may differ from those estimates made by management.
45
the company accounts for its business combinations, including the merger and other acquisitions of investments in real estate, in accordance with asc 805-10, business combinations, which requires the acquired tangible and intangible assets and liabilities to be recorded at fair value, with excess purchase price, if any, recorded to goodwill. the company must make significant assumptions in determining the fair value of the tangible and intangible assets and liabilities acquired and consideration transferred. the use of different assumptions in estimating the fair value could affect the measurement and timing of recognition of acquired assets and liabilities and related expenses.
the consideration transferred in a business combination is generally measured at fair value. for debt assumed by the company, the fair value is determined using estimated market interest rates for debt with comparable terms in place at the time of the acquisition. for equity issued by the company, the fair value is generally based on the fair value of the company's equity interests at the date of issuance.
the fair value of the tangible assets, which principally includes land and building, is determined first by valuing the property as a whole as if it were vacant, using stabilized net operating income and market specific capitalization rates. the fair value of the land and building is then recorded based on its estimated fair value.
in calculating the fair value of identified intangible assets of an acquired property, the in-place leases are valued based on in-place rent rates and estimated time and cost to lease a unit.
the initial purchase accounting is based on the company's preliminary assessment, which may differ when additional information becomes available. subsequent adjustments made to the initial purchase accounting, if any, are made within the measurement period, which will be finalized within one year of the acquisition date.
the company assesses each entity in which it has an investment or contractual relationship to determine if it may be deemed to be a vie.  if such an entity is a vie, then the company performs an analysis to determine who is the primary beneficiary.  if the company is the primary beneficiary, then the entity is consolidated.  the analysis required to identify vies and primary beneficiaries is complex and judgmental, and the analysis must be applied to various types of entities and legal structures.
the company assesses the carrying value of its real estate investments by monitoring investment market conditions and performance compared to budget for operating properties and joint ventures, and by monitoring estimated costs for properties under development.  local market knowledge and data is used to assess carrying values of properties and the market value of acquisition opportunities.  whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of a property held for investment may not be fully recoverable, the carrying amount is evaluated.  if the sum of the property's expected future cash flows (undiscounted and without interest charges) is less than the carrying amount of the property, then the company will recognize an impairment loss equal to the excess of the carrying amount over the fair value of the property.  adverse changes in market conditions or poor operating results of real estate investments could result in impairment charges.  when the company determines that a property is held for sale, it discontinues the periodic depreciation of that property.  the criteria for determining when a property is held for sale requires judgment and has potential financial statement impact as depreciation would cease and an impairment loss could occur upon determination of held for sale status.  assets held for sale are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or estimated fair value less costs to sell.
further, the company evaluates whether its co-investments are other than temporarily impaired and, if so, records an impairment loss equal to the excess of the co-investments' carrying value over its estimated fair value.
the company capitalizes all direct and certain indirect costs, including interest and real estate taxes, incurred during development and redevelopment activities. interest is capitalized on real estate assets that require a period of time to get them ready for their intended use.  the amount of interest capitalized is based upon the average amount of accumulated development expenditures during the reporting period.  included in capitalized costs are management's accounting estimates of the direct and incremental personnel costs and indirect project costs associated with the company's development and redevelopment activities.  indirect project costs consist primarily of personnel costs associated with construction administration and development, including accounting, legal fees, and various corporate and community onsite costs that clearly relate to projects under development.
the company bases its accounting estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances.  actual results may vary from those estimates and those estimates could be different under different assumptions or conditions.
net operating income ("noi")
46
same-property net operating income ("noi") is considered by management to be an important supplemental performance measure to earnings from operations included in the company's consolidated statements of operations.   the presentation of same-property noi assists with the presentation of the company's operations prior to the allocation of depreciation and any corporate-level or financing-related costs.  noi reflects the operating performance of a community and allows for an easy comparison of the operating performance of individual communities or groups of communities. prospective buyers of real estate have different financing and overhead structures, with varying marginal impacts to overhead by acquiring real estate, and noi is considered by many in the real estate industry to be a useful measure for determining the value of a real estate asset or group of assets.  the company defines same-property noi as same-property revenue less same-property operating expenses.

item 1a.    risk factors risks relating to our lead product jakafi we depend heavily on our lead product, jakafi (ruxolitinib), which is marketed as jakavi outside the united states. if we are unable to successfully commercialize jakafi in its approved indications or to successfully obtain regulatory approval for and commercialize ruxolitinib for the treatment of additional indications, or if we are significantly delayed or limited in doing so, our business may be materially harmed.
jakafi is our first product to be approved for sale in the united states. it was approved by the u.s. food and drug administration, or fda, in november 2011 for the treatment of patients with intermediate or high-risk myelofibrosis and in december 2014 for the treatment of patients with polycythemia vera who have had an inadequate response to or are intolerant of hydroxyurea, which we refer to as uncontrolled polycythemia vera. although we have received regulatory approval for these indications, such approval does not guarantee future revenues. the commercial success of jakafi and our ability to generate and maintain revenues from the sale of jakafi will depend on a number of factors, including:
 the number of patients with intermediate or high-risk myelofibrosis or uncontrolled polycythemia vera who are diagnosed with the disease and the number of such patients that may be treated with jakafi;
 the acceptance of jakafi by patients and the healthcare community;
 whether physicians, patients and healthcare payors view jakafi as therapeutically effective and safe relative to cost and any alternative therapies;
 the ability to obtain and maintain sufficient coverage or reimbursement by third-party payors;
 the ability of our third-party manufacturers to manufacture jakafi in sufficient quantities with acceptable quality;
 the ability of our company and our third-party providers to provide marketing and distribution support for jakafi;
 the label and promotional claims allowed by the fda;
 the maintenance of regulatory approval for the approved indications in the united states; and
 our ability to develop, obtain regulatory approval for and commercialize ruxolitinib in the united states for additional indications.
if we are not successful in commercializing jakafi in the united states, or are significantly delayed or limited in doing so, our business may be materially harmed and we may need to delay other drug discovery and development initiatives or even significantly curtail operations.
in addition, our receipt of royalties under our collaboration agreement with novartis for sales of jakavi outside the united states will depend on factors similar to those listed above for jurisdictions outside the united states.
if we are unable to obtain, or maintain at anticipated levels, reimbursement for jakafi from government health administration authorities, private health insurers and other organizations, our pricing may be affected or our product sales, results of operations or financial condition could be harmed.
we may not be able to sell jakafi on a profitable basis or our profitability may be reduced if we are required to sell jakafi at lower than anticipated prices or reimbursement is unavailable or limited in scope or amount. jakafi is expensive and almost all patients will require some form of third party coverage to afford its cost. our future revenues and profitability will be adversely affected if we cannot depend on government and other third-party payors to defray the cost of jakafi to the patient. in the
28
united states, there have been, and we expect there will continue to be, efforts to control and reduce healthcare costs. government and other third-party payors are challenging the prices charged for healthcare products and increasingly limiting and attempting to limit both coverage and level of reimbursement for prescription drugs. if these entities refuse to provide coverage and reimbursement with respect to jakafi, determine to provide a lower level of coverage and reimbursement than anticipated, or reduce previously approved levels of coverage and reimbursement, then our pricing or reimbursement for jakafi may be affected and our product sales, results of operations or financial condition could be harmed.
we depend upon a limited number of specialty pharmacies and group purchasing organizations for a significant portion of any revenues from jakafi, and the loss of, or significant reduction in sales to, any one of these specialty pharmacies or group purchasing organizations could adversely affect our operations and financial condition.
we sell jakafi primarily to specialty pharmacies and group purchasing organizations, which in turn dispense jakafi to patients in fulfillment of prescriptions. we do not promote jakafi to specialty pharmacies and group purchasing organizations, and they do not set or determine demand for jakafi. our ability to successfully commercialize jakafi will depend, in part, on the extent to which we are able to provide adequate distribution of jakafi to patients. although we have contracted with a number of specialty pharmacies and group purchasing organizations, they are expected generally to carry a very limited inventory and may be reluctant to be part of our distribution network in the future if demand for the product does not increase. further, it is possible that these specialty pharmacies and group purchasing organizations could decide to change their policies or fees, or both, at some time in the future. this could result in their refusal to carry smaller volume products such as jakafi, or cause higher product costs, lower margins or the need to find alternative methods of distributing our product. although we believe we can find alternative channels to distribute jakafi on relatively short notice, our revenue during that period of time may suffer and we may incur additional costs to replace any such specialty pharmacy or group purchasing organization. the loss of any large specialty pharmacy or group purchasing organization as part of our distribution network, a significant reduction in sales we make to specialty pharmacies or group purchasing organizations, or any failure to pay for the products we have shipped to them could materially and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.
if we are unable to establish and maintain effective sales, marketing and distribution capabilities, or to enter into agreements with third parties to do so, we will not be able to successfully commercialize jakafi.
prior to our commercialization of jakafi, we had no experience selling and marketing drug products and with pricing and obtaining adequate third-party reimbursement for drug products. under our collaboration and license agreement with novartis, we have retained commercialization rights to jakafi in the united states. we have established commercial capabilities in the united states, but cannot guarantee that we will be able to maintain our own capabilities or enter into and maintain any marketing, distribution or third-party logistics agreements with third-party providers on acceptable terms, if at all. we may not be able to correctly judge the size and experience of the sales and marketing force and the scale of distribution capabilities necessary to successfully market and sell jakafi. establishing and maintaining sales, marketing and distribution capabilities are expensive and time-consuming. competition for personnel with experience in sales and marketing can be high. our expenses associated with building and maintaining the sales force and distribution capabilities may be disproportional compared to the revenues we may be able to generate on sales of jakafi.
29
our reliance on other parties to manufacture jakafi could result in a short supply of jakafi, increased costs, and withdrawal of regulatory approval.
we do not currently operate manufacturing facilities for commercial production of jakafi. accordingly, we will be subject to the risks described below under "other risks relating to our businessour reliance on other parties to manufacture our drug products and drug candidates could result in a short supply of the drugs, delays in clinical trials or drug development, increased costs, and withdrawal or denial of a regulatory authority's approval."
if we fail to comply with applicable laws and regulations, we could lose our approval to market jakafi or be subject to other governmental enforcement activity.
we cannot guarantee that we will be able to maintain regulatory approval to market jakafi in the united states. if we do not maintain our regulatory approval to market jakafi, our results of operations will be materially harmed. we and our collaborators, third-party manufacturers and suppliers are subject to rigorous and extensive regulation by the fda and other federal and state agencies. these regulations continue to apply after product marketing approval, and cover, among other things, testing, manufacturing, quality control, labeling, advertising, promotion, risk mitigation, and adverse event reporting requirements.
our commercialization of jakafi is subject to post-regulatory approval product surveillance, and jakafi may have to be withdrawn from the market or subject to restrictions if previously unknown problems occur. regulatory agencies may also require additional clinical trials or testing for jakafi, and jakafi may be recalled or may be subject to reformulation, additional studies, changes in labeling, warnings to the public and negative publicity.
failure to comply with the laws and regulations administered by the fda or other agencies could result in:
 administrative and judicial sanctions, including warning letters;
 fines and other civil penalties;
 withdrawal of regulatory approval to market jakafi;
 interruption of production;
 operating restrictions;
 product recall or seizure;
 injunctions; and
 criminal prosecution.
the occurrence of any such event may have a material adverse effect on our business.
if the use of jakafi harms patients, or is perceived to harm patients even when such harm is unrelated to jakafi, our regulatory approval could be revoked or otherwise negatively impacted or we could be subject to costly and damaging product liability claims.
the testing of jakafi and the manufacturing, marketing and sale of jakafi expose us to product liability and other risks. side effects and other problems experienced by patients from the use of jakafi could:
 lessen the frequency with which physicians decide to prescribe jakafi;
 encourage physicians to stop prescribing jakafi to their patients who previously had been prescribed jakafi;
30
 cause serious harm to patients that may give rise to product liability claims against us; and
 result in our need to withdraw or recall jakafi from the marketplace.
if jakafi is used by a wide patient population, new risks and side effects may be discovered, the rate of known risks or side effects may increase, and risks previously viewed as less significant could be determined to be significant.
previously unknown risks and adverse effects of jakafi may also be discovered in connection with unapproved, or off-label, uses of jakafi. we are prohibited by law from promoting or in any way supporting or encouraging the promotion of jakafi for off-label uses, but physicians are permitted to use products for off-label purposes. in addition, we are studying and expect to continue to study jakafi in diseases for potential additional indications in controlled clinical settings, and independent investigators are doing so as well. in the event of any new risks or adverse effects discovered as new patients are treated for intermediate or high-risk myelofibrosis or uncontrolled polycythemia vera and as jakafi is studied in or used by patients for off-label indications, regulatory authorities may delay or revoke their approvals, we may be required to conduct additional clinical trials, make changes in labeling of jakafi, reformulate jakafi or make changes and obtain new approvals. we may also experience a significant drop in the sales of jakafi, experience harm to our reputation and the reputation of jakafi in the marketplace or become subject to lawsuits, including class actions. any of these results could decrease or prevent sales of jakafi or substantially increase the costs and expenses of commercializing jakafi.
patients who have been enrolled in our clinical trials or who may use jakafi in the future often have severe and advanced stages of disease and known as well as unknown significant pre-existing and potentially life-threatening health risks. during the course of treatment, patients may suffer adverse events, including death, for reasons that may or may not be related to jakafi. such events could subject us to costly litigation, require us to pay substantial amounts of money to injured patients, delay, negatively impact or end our opportunity to receive or maintain regulatory approval to market jakafi, or require us to suspend or abandon our commercialization efforts. even in a circumstance in which we do not believe that an adverse event is related to jakafi, the investigation into the circumstance may be time consuming or inconclusive. these investigations may interrupt our sales efforts, impact and limit the type of regulatory approvals jakafi receives or maintains, or delay the regulatory approval process for our collaborator novartis in other countries.
factors similar to those listed above also apply to our collaboration partner novartis for jurisdictions outside the united states.
if we market jakafi in a manner that violates various federal and state health care related laws and regulations, we may be subject to civil or criminal penalties.
in addition to fda and related regulatory requirements, we are subject to health care "fraud and abuse" laws, such as the federal false claims act, the anti-kickback provisions of the federal social security act, and other state and federal laws and regulations. federal and state anti-kickback laws prohibit, among other things, knowingly and willfully offering, paying, soliciting or receiving remuneration to induce, or in return for purchasing, leasing, ordering or arranging for the purchase, lease or order of any health care item or service reimbursable under medicare, medicaid, or other federally- or state-financed health care programs. federal false claims laws prohibit any person from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, a false claim for payment to the federal government, or knowingly making, or causing to be made, a false statement to get a false claim paid. pharmaceutical companies have been prosecuted under these laws for a variety of alleged promotional and marketing activities.
although physicians are permitted, based on their medical judgment, to prescribe products for indications other than those approved by the fda, manufacturers are prohibited from promoting their products for such off-label uses. we market jakafi for intermediate or high-risk myelofibrosis and
31
uncontrolled polycythemia vera and provide promotional materials to physicians regarding the use of jakafi for these indications. although we believe that our promotional materials for physicians do not constitute off-label promotion of jakafi, the fda or other agencies may disagree. if the fda or another agency determines that our promotional materials or other activities constitute off-label promotion of jakafi, it could request that we modify our promotional materials or other activities or subject us to regulatory enforcement actions, including the issuance of a warning letter, injunction, seizure, civil fine and criminal penalties. it is also possible that other federal, state or foreign enforcement authorities might take action if they believe that the alleged improper promotion led to the submission and payment of claims for an unapproved use, which could result in significant fines or penalties under other statutory authorities, such as laws prohibiting false claims for reimbursement. even if it is later determined we are not in violation of these laws, we may be faced with negative publicity, incur significant expenses defending our position and have to divert significant management resources from other matters.
the majority of states also have statutes or regulations similar to the federal anti-kickback law and false claims laws, which apply to items and services reimbursed under medicaid and other state programs, or, in several states, apply regardless of the payor. in recent years, several states and localities, including california, connecticut, the district of columbia, massachusetts, minnesota, nevada, new mexico, texas, vermont, and west virginia, have enacted legislation requiring pharmaceutical companies to establish marketing compliance programs, file periodic reports with the state or make periodic public disclosures on sales, marketing, pricing, clinical trials, and other activities. similar legislation is being considered in other states. additionally, as part of the patient protection and affordable care act, the federal government has enacted the physician payment sunshine provisions. the sunshine provisions require manufacturers to publicly report certain payments or other transfers of value made to physicians and teaching hospitals. many of these requirements are new and uncertain, and the penalties for failure to comply with these requirements are unclear. nonetheless, if we are found not to be in full compliance with these laws, we could face enforcement action and fines and other penalties, and could receive adverse publicity. see also "other risks relating to our businessif we fail to comply with the extensive legal and regulatory requirements affecting the health care industry, we could face increased costs, penalties and a loss of business" below.
other risks relating to our business we may be unsuccessful in our efforts to discover and develop drug candidates and commercialize drug products.
none of our drug candidates, other than jakafi/jakavi, has received regulatory approval. our ability to discover and develop drug candidates and to commercialize additional drug products will depend on our ability to:
 hire and retain key employees;
 identify high quality therapeutic targets;
 identify potential drug candidates;
 develop products internally or license drug candidates from others;
 identify and enroll suitable human subjects, either in the united states or abroad, for our clinical trials;
 complete laboratory testing and clinical trials on humans;
 obtain and maintain necessary intellectual property rights to our products;
 obtain and maintain necessary regulatory approvals for our products, both in the united states and abroad;
32
 enter into arrangements with third parties to provide services or to manufacture our products on our behalf;
 deploy sales and marketing resources effectively or enter into arrangements with third parties to provide these functions in compliance with all applicable laws;
 obtain appropriate coverage and reimbursement levels for the cost of our products from governmental authorities, private health insurers and other third-party payors;
 lease facilities at reasonable rates to support our growth; and
 enter into arrangements with third parties to license and commercialize our products.
we have limited experience with the activities listed above and may not be successful in discovering, developing, or commercializing drug products. discovery and development of drug candidates are expensive and time-consuming, and we do not know if our efforts will lead to discovery of any drug candidates that can be successfully developed and marketed. of the compounds or biologics that we identify as potential drug products or that we may in-license from other companies, only a few, if any, are likely to lead to successful drug development programs and commercialized drug products.
we depend heavily on the success of our most advanced drug candidates. we might not be able to commercialize any of our drug candidates successfully, and we may spend significant time and money attempting to do so.
we have invested significant resources in the development of our most advanced drug candidates. ruxolitinib is in phase iii clinical trials for the treatment of advanced or metastatic pancreatic cancer, as well as in other clinical trials. further, we have a number of drug candidates in phase i and phase ii clinical trials. our ability to generate product revenues will depend on the successful development and eventual commercialization of our most advanced drug candidates. we, or our collaborators or licensees, may decide to discontinue development of any or all of our drug candidates at any time for commercial, scientific or other reasons. for example, in september 2011, we announced that we had discontinued development of our lead sheddase inhibitor, incb7839, for the treatment of breast cancer. if a product is developed, but is not marketed, we may have spent significant amounts of time and money on it, which could adversely affect our operating results and financial condition.
although we obtained a special protocol assessment agreement for ruxolitinib for advanced or metastatic pancreatic cancer, a special protocol assessment agreement does not guarantee any particular outcome from regulatory review, including any regulatory approval.
we have obtained a special protocol assessment, or spa, agreement with the fda for a registration trial, which is one of two phase iii trials in the development plan, for ruxolitinib for the treatment of advanced or metastatic pancreatic cancer in a subgroup of patients with elevated crp. the spa process allows for fda evaluation of a clinical trial protocol intended to form the primary basis of an efficacy claim in support of a new drug application, or nda, and provides a product sponsor with an agreement confirming that the design and size of a trial will be appropriate to form the primary basis of an efficacy claim for an nda if the trial is performed according to the spa. even if we believe that the data from a clinical trial are supportive, an spa is not a guarantee of approval, and we cannot be certain that the design of, or data collected from, a trial will be adequate to demonstrate safety and efficacy, or otherwise be sufficient to support regulatory approval. there can be no assurance that the terms of an spa will ultimately be binding on the fda, and the fda is not obligated to approve an nda, if any, even if the clinical outcome is positive. the fda retains significant latitude and discretion in interpreting the terms of an spa and the data and results from a clinical trial, and can require trial design changes or additional studies if issues arise essential to determining safety or efficacy. data may subsequently become available that causes the fda to reconsider the previously agreed upon scope of review and the fda may have
33
subsequent safety or efficacy concerns that override an spa, and we can give no assurance that as clinical trials proceed or as part of an nda review process, if any, the fda will determine that a previously approved spa is still valid.
additionally, an spa may be changed only with the written agreement of the fda, and any further changes we may propose to the protocol will remain subject to the fda's approval. the fda may not agree to any such amendment and, even if they agree, they may request other amendments to the trial design that could require additional cost and time, as well as increase the degree of difficulty in reaching clinical endpoints. as a result, even with an spa, we cannot be certain that the trial results will be found to be adequate to support an efficacy claim and product approval.
we depend on our collaborators and licensees for the future development and commercialization of some of our drug candidates. conflicts may arise between our collaborators and licensees and us, or our collaborators and licensees may choose to terminate their agreements with us, which may adversely affect our business.
we have licensed to novartis rights to ruxolitinib outside of the united states and worldwide rights to our c-met inhibitor compounds and licensed to lilly worldwide rights to baricitinib. we have also licensed to pfizer our portfolio of ccr2 antagonist compounds. under the terms of our agreements with these collaborators, we have no or limited control over the further clinical development of these drug candidates and any revenues we may receive if these drug candidates receive regulatory approval and are commercialized will depend primarily on the development and commercialization efforts of others.
conflicts may arise with our collaborators and licensees if they pursue alternative technologies or develop alternative products either on their own or in collaboration with others as a means for developing treatments for the diseases that we have targeted. competing products and product opportunities may lead our collaborators and licensees to withdraw their support for our drug candidates. any failure of our collaborators and licensees to perform their obligations under our agreements with them or otherwise to support our drug candidates could negatively impact the development of our drug candidates, lead to our loss of potential revenues from product sales and milestones and delay our achievement, if any, of profitability. additionally, conflicts may arise if, among other things, there is a dispute about the achievement and payment of a milestone amount or the ownership of intellectual property that is developed during the course of a collaborative relationship.
our existing collaborative and license agreements can be terminated by our collaborators and licensees for convenience, among other circumstances. if any of our collaborators or licensees terminates its agreement with us, or terminates its rights with respect to certain indications or drug candidates, we may not be able to find a new collaborator for them, and our business could be adversely affected. should an agreement be terminated before we have realized the benefits of the collaboration or license, our reputation could be harmed, we may not obtain revenues that we anticipated receiving, and our business could be adversely affected.
the success of our drug discovery and development efforts may depend on our ability to find suitable collaborators to fully exploit our capabilities. if we are unable to establish collaborations or if these future collaborations are unsuccessful in the development and commercialization of our drug candidates, our research, development and commercialization efforts may be unsuccessful, which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.
an important element of our business strategy is to enter into collaborative or license arrangements with other parties, under which we license our drug candidates to those parties for development and commercialization or under which we study our drug candidates in combination with such parties' compounds or biologics. we are evaluating strategic relationships with respect to several of our other programs and may enter into an agreement with respect to one or more of these programs in the future.
34
however, because collaboration and license arrangements are complex to negotiate, we may not be successful in our attempts to establish these arrangements. also, we may not have drug candidates that are desirable to other parties, or we may be unwilling to license a drug candidate to a particular party because such party interested in it is a competitor or for other reasons. the terms of any such arrangements that we establish may not be favorable to us. alternatively, potential collaborators may decide against entering into an agreement with us because of our financial, regulatory or intellectual property position or for scientific, commercial or other reasons. if we are not able to establish collaboration or license arrangements, we may not be able to develop and commercialize a drug product, which could adversely affect our business and our revenues.
in order for any of these collaboration or license arrangements to be successful, we must first identify potential collaborators or licensees whose capabilities complement and integrate well with ours. we may rely on these arrangements for not only financial resources, but also for expertise or economies of scale that we expect to need in the future relating to clinical trials, manufacturing, sales and marketing, and for licenses to technology rights. however, it is likely that we will not be able to control the amount and timing of resources that our collaborators or licensees devote to our programs or drug candidates. if our collaborators or licensees prove difficult to work with, are less skilled than we originally expected, do not devote adequate resources to the program, pursue alternative technologies or develop alternative products, or do not agree with our approach to development or manufacturing of the drug candidate, the relationship could be unsuccessful. if a business combination involving a collaborator or licensee and a third party were to occur, the effect could be to terminate or cause delays in development of a drug candidate.
if we fail to enter into additional licensing agreements or if these arrangements are unsuccessful, our business and operations might be adversely affected.
in addition to establishing collaborative or license arrangements under which other parties license our drug candidates for development and commercialization or under which we study our drug candidates in combination with such parties' compounds or biologics, we may explore opportunities to develop our clinical pipeline by in-licensing drug candidates that fit within our focus on oncology, such as our collaboration with agenus. we may be unable to enter into any additional in-licensing agreements because suitable drug candidates that are within our expertise may not be available to us on terms that are acceptable to us or because competitors with greater resources seek to in-license the same drug candidates. drug candidates that we would like to develop may not be available to us because they are controlled by competitors who are unwilling to license the rights to the drug candidate to us. in addition, we may enter into license agreements that are unsuccessful and our business and operations might be adversely affected by the termination of a drug candidate and termination and winding down of the related license agreement. we may also need to license drug delivery or other technology in order to continue to develop our drug candidates. if we are unable to enter into additional agreements to license drug candidates, drug delivery technology or other technology or if these arrangements are unsuccessful, our research and development efforts could be adversely affected.
even if a drug candidate that we develop receives regulatory approval, we may decide not to commercialize it if we determine that commercialization of that product would require more money and time than we are willing to invest.
even if any of our drug candidates receives regulatory approval, it could be subject to post-regulatory surveillance, and may have to be withdrawn from the market or subject to restrictions if previously unknown problems occur. regulatory agencies may also require additional clinical trials or testing, and the drug product may be recalled or may be subject to reformulation, additional studies, changes in labeling, warnings to the public and negative publicity. as a result, we may not continue to commercialize a product even though it has obtained regulatory approval. further, we may decide not to continue to commercialize
35
a product if the market does not accept the product because it is too expensive or because third parties such as insurance companies or medicare have not approved it for substantial reimbursement. in addition, we may decide not to continue to commercialize a product if competitors develop and commercialize similar or superior products or have proprietary rights that preclude us from ultimately marketing our products.
any approved drug product that we bring to the market may not gain market acceptance by physicians, patients, healthcare payors and others in the medical community.
even if we are successful in gaining regulatory approval of any of our drug candidates in addition to jakafi, we may not generate significant product revenues and we may not become profitable if these drug products do not achieve an adequate level of acceptance. physicians may not recommend our drug products until longer-term clinical data or other factors demonstrate the safety and efficacy of our drug products as compared to other alternative treatments. even if the clinical safety and efficacy of our drug products is established, physicians may elect not to prescribe these drug products for a variety of reasons, including the reimbursement policies of government and other third-party payors and the effectiveness of our competitors in marketing their products.
market acceptance of our drug products, if approved for commercial sale, will depend on a number of factors, including:
 the willingness and ability of patients and the healthcare community to use our drug products;
 the ability to manufacture our drug products in sufficient quantities with acceptable quality and to offer our drug products for sale at competitive prices;
 the perception of patients and the healthcare community, including third-party payors, regarding the safety, efficacy and benefits of our drug products compared to those of competing products or therapies;
 the label and promotional claims allowed by the fda;
 the pricing and reimbursement of our drug products relative to existing treatments; and
 marketing and distribution support for our drug products.
we have limited capacity to conduct preclinical testing and clinical trials, and our resulting dependence on other parties could result in delays in and additional costs for our drug development efforts.
we have limited internal resources and capacity to perform preclinical testing and clinical trials. as part of our development strategy, we often hire clinical research organizations, or cros, to perform preclinical testing and clinical trials for drug candidates. if the cros that we hire to perform our preclinical testing and clinical trials do not meet deadlines, do not follow proper procedures, or a conflict arises between us and our cros, our preclinical testing and clinical trials may take longer than expected, may cost more, may be delayed or may be terminated. if we were forced to find a replacement entity to perform any of our preclinical testing or clinical trials, we may not be able to find a suitable entity on favorable terms, or at all. even if we were able to find another company to perform a preclinical test or clinical trial, the delay in the test or trial may result in significant additional expenditures. events such as these may result in delays in our obtaining regulatory approval for our drug candidates or our ability to commercialize our products and could result in increased expenditures that would adversely affect our operating results.
36
if we are unable to obtain regulatory approval for our drug candidates in the united states and foreign jurisdictions, we will not be permitted to commercialize products resulting from our research.
in order to commercialize drug products in the united states, our drug candidates will have to obtain regulatory approval from the fda. satisfaction of regulatory requirements typically takes many years. to obtain regulatory approval, we must first show that our drug candidates are safe and effective for target indications through preclinical testing (animal testing) and clinical trials (human testing). preclinical testing and clinical development are long, expensive and uncertain processes, and we do not know whether the fda will allow us to undertake clinical trials of any drug candidates in addition to our compounds currently in clinical trials.
completion of clinical trials may take several years and failure may occur at any stage of testing. the length of time required varies substantially according to the type, complexity, novelty and intended use of the drug candidate. interim results of a preclinical test or clinical trial do not necessarily predict final results, and acceptable results in early clinical trials may not be repeated in later clinical trials. for example, a drug candidate that is successful at the preclinical level may cause harmful or dangerous side effects when tested at the clinical level. our rate of commencement and completion of clinical trials may be delayed by many factors, including:
 the high degree of risk associated with drug development;
 our inability to formulate or manufacture sufficient quantities of materials for use in clinical trials;
 variability in the number and types of patients available for each study;
 difficulty in maintaining contact with patients after treatment, resulting in incomplete data;
 unforeseen safety issues or side effects;
 poor or unanticipated effectiveness of drug candidates during the clinical trials; or
 government or regulatory delays.
data obtained from clinical trials are susceptible to varying interpretation, which may delay, limit or prevent regulatory approval. many companies in the pharmaceutical industry, including biotechnology companies, have suffered significant setbacks in advanced clinical trials, even after achieving promising results in earlier clinical trials. in addition, regulatory authorities may refuse or delay approval as a result of other factors, such as changes in regulatory policy during the period of product development and regulatory agency review. for example, the fda has in the past required and could in the future require that we conduct additional trials of any of our drug candidates, which would result in delays.
compounds or biologics developed by us or with or by our collaborators and licensees may not prove to be safe and effective in clinical trials and may not meet all of the applicable regulatory requirements needed to receive marketing approval. if regulatory approval of a product is granted, this approval will be limited to those disease states and conditions for which the product is demonstrated through clinical trials to be safe and effective. failure to obtain regulatory approval would delay or prevent us from commercializing products.
outside the united states, our ability to market a product is contingent upon receiving a marketing authorization from the appropriate regulatory authorities. this foreign regulatory approval process typically includes all of the risks associated with the fda approval process described above and may also include additional risks. the requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary greatly from country to country and may require us to perform additional testing and expend additional resources. approval by the fda does not ensure approval by regulatory authorities in other countries, and approval by one foreign regulatory authority does not ensure approval by regulatory authorities in other countries or by the fda.
37
we face significant competition for our drug discovery and development efforts, and if we do not compete effectively, our commercial opportunities will be reduced or eliminated.
the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries are intensely competitive and subject to rapid and significant technological change. our drug discovery and development efforts may target diseases and conditions that are already subject to existing therapies or that are being developed by our competitors, many of which have substantially greater resources, larger research and development staffs and facilities, more experience in completing preclinical testing and clinical trials, and formulation, marketing and manufacturing capabilities. as a result of these resources, our competitors may develop drug products that render our products obsolete or noncompetitive by developing more effective drugs or by developing their products more efficiently. our ability to develop competitive products would be limited if our competitors succeeded in obtaining regulatory approvals for drug candidates more rapidly than we were able to or in obtaining patent protection or other intellectual property rights that limited our drug development efforts. any drug products resulting from our research and development efforts, or from our joint efforts with collaborators or licensees, might not be able to compete successfully with our competitors' existing and future products, or obtain regulatory approval in the united states or elsewhere.
our reliance on other parties to manufacture our drug products and drug candidates could result in a short supply of the drugs, delays in clinical trials or drug development, increased costs, and withdrawal or denial of a regulatory authority's approval.
we do not currently operate manufacturing facilities for clinical or commercial production of jakafi and our other drug candidates. we currently hire third parties to manufacture the raw materials, active pharmaceutical ingredient, or api, and finished drug product of jakafi and our other drug candidates for clinical trials. in addition, we expect to continue to rely on third parties for the manufacture of commercial supplies of raw materials, api and finished drug product for any drugs that we successfully develop. for jakafi and most of our drug candidates, we hire third parties to manufacture the raw materials, another third party to manufacture the api and another to make the finished drug product and to package and label the finished product. the fda requires that the raw materials, api and finished product for jakafi and our other drug candidates be manufactured according to its current good manufacturing practices regulations and regulatory authorities in other countries have similar requirements. there are only a limited number of manufacturers that comply with these requirements. failure to comply with current good manufacturing practices and the applicable regulatory requirements of other countries in the manufacture of our drug candidates and products could result in the fda or foreign regulatory authority halting our clinical trials, withdrawing or denying regulatory approval of our drug product, enforcing product recalls or other enforcement actions, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.
we may not be able to obtain sufficient quantities of our drug candidates or any drug products we may develop if our designated manufacturers do not have the capacity or capability to manufacture them according to our schedule and specifications. in addition, we may not be able to arrange for our drug candidates or any drug products that we may develop to be manufactured by one of these parties on reasonable terms, if at all. also, required raw materials may only be available from a limited number of suppliers and, in the case of jakafi, are currently supplied by a single source. as noted above, generally, we have a single source or a limited number of suppliers that are qualified to supply each of the api and finished product of jakafi and our other drug candidates. if any of these suppliers were to become unable or unwilling to supply us with raw materials, api or finished product that complies with applicable regulatory requirements, we could incur significant delays in our clinical trials or interruption of commercial supply that could have a material adverse effect on our business. if we have promised delivery of a drug candidate or drug product and are unable to meet the delivery requirement due to manufacturing difficulties, our development programs could be delayed, we may have to expend additional sums in order to ensure that manufacturing capacity is available when we need it even if we do not use all of the manufacturing capacity, and our business and operating results could be harmed.

manufacturers of pharmaceutical products often encounter difficulties in production, especially in scaling up initial production. these problems include difficulties with production costs and yields, quality control and assurance and shortages of qualified personnel, as well as compliance with strictly enforced federal, state and foreign regulations.
in order to obtain approval of our products by the fda and foreign regulatory agencies, we need to complete testing on both the api and on the finished product in the packaging we propose for commercial sales. this includes testing of stability, identification of impurities and testing of other product specifications by validated test methods. in addition, we will be required to consistently produce the api in commercial quantities and of specified quality on a repeated basis and document our ability to do so. this requirement is referred to as process validation.
we may not be able to adequately manage and oversee the manufacturers we choose, they may not perform as agreed or they may terminate their agreements with us. foreign manufacturing approval processes typically include all of the risks associated with the fda approval process for manufacturing and may also include additional risks.
under our collaboration with agenus, agenus has primary responsibility for manufacturing activities, including selecting and monitoring third-party manufacturers. manufacturing antibodies and products containing antibodies is a more complex process than manufacturing small molecule drugs and subject to additional risks. the process of manufacturing antibodies and products containing antibodies is highly susceptible to product loss due to contamination, equipment failure or improper installation or operation of equipment, vendor or operator error, inconsistency in yields, variability in product characteristics, and difficulties in scaling the production process. even minor deviations from normal manufacturing processes could result in reduced production yields, product defects and other supply disruptions. if microbial, viral or other contaminations are discovered in our product candidates or in the manufacturing facilities in which our product candidates are made, such manufacturing facilities may need to be closed for an extended period of time to investigate and remedy the contamination.
if we fail to comply with the extensive legal and regulatory requirements affecting the health care industry, we could face increased costs, penalties and a loss of business.
our activities, and the activities of our collaborators, partners and third-party providers, are subject to extensive government regulation and oversight both in the united states and in foreign jurisdictions. the fda and comparable agencies in other jurisdictions directly regulate many of our most critical business activities, including the conduct of preclinical and clinical studies, product manufacturing, advertising and promotion, product distribution, adverse event reporting and product risk management. states increasingly have been placing greater restrictions on the marketing practices of healthcare companies. in addition, pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies have been the target of lawsuits and investigations alleging violations of government regulations, including claims asserting submission of incorrect pricing information, impermissible off-label promotion of pharmaceutical products, payments intended to influence the referral of federal or state healthcare business, submission of false claims for government reimbursement, antitrust violations, violations of the foreign corrupt practices act and similar anti-bribery or anti-corruption laws, or violations related to environmental matters. violations of governmental regulation may be punishable by criminal and civil sanctions, including fines and civil monetary penalties and exclusion from participation in government programs, including medicare and medicaid. in addition to penalties for violation of laws and regulations, we could be required to repay amounts we received from government payors, or pay additional rebates and interest if we are found to have miscalculated the pricing information we have submitted to the government. we cannot ensure that our compliance controls, policies, and procedures will in every instance protect us from acts committed by our employees, collaborators, partners or third-party providers that would violate the laws or regulations of the jurisdictions in which we operate. whether or not we have complied with the law, an investigation into
39
alleged unlawful conduct could increase our expenses, damage our reputation, divert management time and attention and adversely affect our business.
health care reform measures could impact the pricing and profitability of pharmaceuticals, and adversely affect the commercial viability of our drug candidates. our ability to generate revenues will be diminished if we are unable to obtain an adequate level of reimbursement from private insurers, government insurance programs or other third-party payors of health care costs, which could be affected by recent healthcare reform legislation.
our ability to commercialize our drug candidates successfully will depend in part on the extent to which adequate reimbursement levels for the cost of our products and related treatment are obtained from third-party payors, such as private insurers, government insurance programs, including medicare and medicaid, health maintenance organizations (hmos) and other health care related organizations.
in recent years, through legislative and regulatory actions, the federal government has made substantial changes to various payment systems under the medicare and other federal health care programs. comprehensive reforms to the u.s. healthcare system were recently enacted, including changes to the methods for, and amounts of, medicare reimbursement. these reforms could significantly reduce payments from medicare and medicaid. reforms or other changes to these payment systems, may change the availability, methods and rates of reimbursements from medicare, private insurers and other third-party payors for our drug candidates. some of these changes and proposed changes could result in reduced reimbursement rates, which could reduce the price that we or any of our collaborators or licensees receive for any products, if commercialized, in the future, and which would adversely affect our business strategy, operations and financial results. further federal and state proposals and health care reforms are possible, which could limit the prices that can be charged for any of our drug candidates and may further limit the commercial viability of our drug candidates. in certain foreign markets, pricing or profitability of prescription pharmaceuticals is subject to government control. if reimbursement for our products, if commercialized, is unavailable, limited in scope or amount, or if pricing is set at unsatisfactory levels, our business could be materially harmed. there may be future changes that result in reductions in current coverage and reimbursement levels for our drug candidates, and we cannot predict the scope of any future changes or the impact that those changes would have on our operations.
third-party payors are increasingly challenging the prices charged for medical products and services. also, the trend toward managed health care in the united states, the organizations for which could control or significantly influence the purchase of health care services and products, as well as legislative proposals to reform health care or reduce government insurance programs, may all result in lower prices for or rejection of our products. adoption of our drug candidates by the medical community may be limited without adequate reimbursement for our products. cost control initiatives may decrease coverage and payment levels for our drug candidates and, in turn, the price that we will be able to charge for any product, if commercialized. our drug candidates may not be considered cost-effective, and coverage and reimbursement may not be available or sufficient to allow us to sell our products on a profitable basis. we are unable to predict all changes to the coverage or reimbursement methodologies that will be applied by private or government payors to our drug candidates.
the continuing efforts of third-party payors to contain or reduce the costs of health care, any denial of private or government payor coverage or inadequate reimbursement for our drug candidates could materially and adversely affect our business strategy, operations, future revenues and profitability, and the future revenues and profitability of our potential customers, suppliers, collaborators and licensees and the availability of capital.
40
as our drug discovery and development operations are conducted at our headquarters in wilmington, delaware, the loss of access to this facility would negatively impact our business.
our facility in wilmington, delaware is our headquarters and is also where we conduct all of our drug discovery, research, development and marketing activities. our lease contains provisions that provide for its early termination upon the occurrence of certain events of default. in addition, natural disasters or actions of activists opposed to aspects of pharmaceutical research may disrupt our experiments or our ability to access or use our facility. the loss of access to or use of our wilmington, delaware, facility, either on a temporary or permanent basis, or early termination of our lease would result in an interruption of our business and, consequently, would adversely affect our overall business.
we depend on key employees in a competitive market for skilled personnel, and the loss of the services of any of our key employees or our inability to attract and retain additional personnel would affect our ability to expand our drug discovery and development programs and achieve our objectives.
we are highly dependent on the members of our executive management team and principal members of our commercial, development, medical, operations and scientific staff. we experience intense competition for qualified personnel. our future success also depends in part on the continued service of our executive management team and key personnel and our ability to recruit, train and retain essential personnel for our drug discovery and development programs, and for our medical affairs and commercialization activities. if we lose the services of any of these people or if we are unable to recruit sufficient qualified personnel, our research and product development goals, and our commercialization efforts could be delayed or curtailed. we do not maintain "key person" insurance on any of our employees.
if we fail to manage our growth effectively, our ability to develop and commercialize products could suffer.
we expect that if our drug discovery efforts continue to generate drug candidates, our clinical drug candidates continue to progress in development, and we continue to build our development, medical and commercial organizations, we will require significant additional investment in personnel, management and resources. our ability to achieve our research, development and commercialization objectives depends on our ability to respond effectively to these demands and expand our internal organization, systems, controls and facilities to accommodate additional anticipated growth. if we are unable to manage our growth effectively, our business could be harmed and our ability to execute our business strategy could suffer.
risks associated with expanding our operations to europe could adversely affect our business.
we plan to expand our operations and conduct certain development activities in europe. we have limited experience with conducting activities outside of the united states. international operations and business expansion plans are subject to numerous additional risks, including:
 multiple, conflicting and changing laws and regulations such as tax laws, privacy regulations, export and import restrictions, employment, immigration and labor laws, regulatory requirements, and other governmental approvals, permits and licenses;
 difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations;
 risks associated with obtaining and maintaining, or the failure to obtain or maintain, regulatory approvals for the sale or use of our products in various countries;
 complexities associated with managing government payor systems, multiple payor-reimbursement regimes or patient self-pay systems;
 financial risks, such as longer payment cycles, difficulty enforcing contracts and collecting accounts receivable and exposure to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations;
41
 general political and economic conditions in the countries in operate, including terrorism and political unrest, curtailment of trade and other business restrictions;
 regulatory and compliance risks that relate to maintaining accurate information and control over activities that may fall within the purview of the u.s. foreign corrupt practices act, its books and records provisions or its anti-bribery provisions, or similar anti-bribery or anti-corruption laws and regulations;
any of these risks, if encountered, could significantly increase our costs of operating internationally, prevent us from operating in certain jurisdictions, or otherwise significantly harm our future international expansion and operations, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
if product liability lawsuits are brought against us, we could face substantial liabilities and may be required to limit commercialization of our products and our results of operations could be harmed.
in addition to the risks described above under "risks relating to our lead product jakafiif the use of jakafi harms patients, or is perceived to harm patients even when such harm is unrelated to jakafi, our regulatory approval could be revoked or otherwise negatively impacted or we could be subject to costly and damaging product liability claims," the conduct of clinical trials of medical products that are intended for human use entails an inherent risk of product liability. if any product that we or any of our collaborators or licensees develops causes or is alleged to cause injury during clinical trials or commercialization, we may be held liable. if we cannot successfully defend ourselves against product liability claims, we may incur substantial liabilities, including substantial damages to be paid to the plaintiffs and legal costs, or we may be required to limit further development and commercialization of our products. additionally, any product liability lawsuit could cause injury to our reputation, participants and investigators to withdraw from clinical trials, and potential collaborators or licensees to seek other partners, any of which could impact our results of operations.
our product liability insurance policy may not fully cover our potential liabilities. in addition, we may determine that we should increase our coverage, and this insurance may be prohibitively expensive to us or our collaborators or licensees and may not fully cover our potential liabilities. our inability to obtain sufficient product liability insurance at an acceptable cost to protect against potential product liability claims could prevent or inhibit the development or commercialization of our drug candidates and products.
because our activities involve the use of hazardous materials, we may be subject to claims relating to improper handling, storage or disposal of these materials that could be time consuming and costly.
we are subject to various environmental, health and safety laws and regulations governing, among other things, the use, handling, storage and disposal of regulated substances and the health and safety of our employees. our research and development processes involve the controlled use of hazardous and radioactive materials and biological waste resulting in the production of hazardous waste products. we cannot completely eliminate the risk of accidental contamination or discharge and any resultant injury from these materials. if any injury or contamination results from our use or the use by our collaborators or licensees of these materials, we may be sued and our liability may exceed our insurance coverage and our total assets. further, we may be required to indemnify our collaborators or licensees against all damages and other liabilities arising out of our development activities or products produced in connection with these collaborations or licenses. compliance with the applicable environmental and workplace laws and regulations is expensive. future changes to environmental, health, workplace and safety laws could cause us to incur additional expense or may restrict our operations or impair our research, development and production efforts.
42
risks relating to our financial results we expect to incur losses in the future and we may not achieve or maintain profitability in the future.
we had net losses from inception in 1991 through 1996 and in 1999 through december 31, 2014. because of those losses, we had an accumulated deficit of $1.8 billion as of december 31, 2014. we intend to continue to spend significant amounts on our efforts to discover and develop drugs. as a result, we could continue to incur losses in 2015 and in future periods as well.
we anticipate that our drug discovery and development efforts and related expenditures will increase as we focus on the studies, including preclinical tests and clinical trials prior to seeking regulatory approval, that are required before we can sell a drug product.
the development of drug products will require us to spend significant funds on research, development, testing, obtaining regulatory approvals, manufacturing and marketing. to date, we do not have any drug products that have generated significant revenues other than from sales of jakafi and we cannot assure you that we will generate significant revenues from the drug candidates that we license or develop, including jakafi, for several years, if ever.
we cannot be certain whether or when we will achieve profitability because of the significant uncertainties relating to our ability to generate commercially successful drug products. even if we are successful in obtaining regulatory approvals for manufacturing and commercializing drug products in addition to jakafi, we expect that we will continue to incur losses if our drug products do not generate significant revenues. if we achieve profitability, we may not be able to sustain or increase profitability.
we will need additional capital in the future. if we are unable to generate sufficient funds from operations, the capital markets may not permit us to raise additional capital at the time that we require it, which could result in limitations on our research and development or commercialization efforts or the loss of certain of our rights in our technologies or drug candidates.
our future funding requirements will depend on many factors and we anticipate that we may need to raise additional capital to fund our business plan and research and development efforts going-forward and to repay our indebtedness.
additional factors that may affect our future funding requirements include:
 the amount of revenues generated from our business activities;
 any changes in the breadth of our research and development programs;
 the results of research and development, preclinical testing and clinical trials conducted by us or our current or future collaborators or licensees, if any;
 our exercise of any co-development options with collaborators that may require us to fund future development;
 the acquisition of businesses, technologies, or drug candidates, or the licensing of technologies or drug candidates, if any;
 our ability to maintain and establish new corporate relationships and research collaborations;
 competing technological and market developments;
 the time and costs involved in filing, prosecuting, defending and enforcing patent and intellectual property claims;
 the receipt of contingent licensing or milestone fees or royalties on product sales from our current or future collaborative and license arrangements, if established; and
43
 the timing of regulatory approvals, if any.
if we require additional capital at a time when investment in companies such as ours, or in the marketplace generally, is limited due to the then prevailing market or other conditions, we may have to scale back our operations, eliminate one or more of our research or development programs, or attempt to obtain funds by entering into an agreement with a collaborator or licensee that would result in terms that are not favorable to us or relinquishing our rights in certain of our proprietary technologies or drug candidates. if we are unable to raise funds at the time that we desire or at any time thereafter on acceptable terms, we may not be able to continue to develop our drug candidates. the sale of equity or additional convertible debt securities in the future may be dilutive to our stockholders, and debt financing arrangements may require us to pledge certain assets or enter into covenants that could restrict our operations or our ability to incur further indebtedness.
we have a large amount of debt and our debt service obligations may prevent us from taking actions that we would otherwise consider to be in our best interests.
as of december 31, 2014, the aggregate principal amount of our total consolidated debt was $840.9 million and our stockholders' deficit was $81.6 million. our substantial leverage could have significant negative consequences for our future operations, including:
 increasing our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions;
 limiting our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital, capital and research and development expenditures, and general corporate purposes;
 requiring the dedication of a substantial portion of our expected cash flow or our existing cash to service our indebtedness, thereby reducing the amount of our cash available for other purposes, including working capital, capital expenditures and research and development expenditures;
 limiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industry in which we compete; or
 placing us at a possible competitive disadvantage compared to less leveraged competitors and competitors that have better access to capital resources.
we may not generate sufficient cash flow from our operations in the future to enable us to meet our anticipated fixed charges, including our obligations with respect to our outstanding convertible senior notes. as of december 31, 2014, $90.9 million aggregate principal amount of our 4.75% convertible senior notes due 2015 was outstanding and due in october 2015. the remaining interest payments for our 4.75% convertible senior notes through 2015, assuming that none of these notes are converted, repurchased or exchanged, will total $4.3 million. as of december 31, 2014, $375.0 million aggregate principal amount of our 0.375% convertible senior notes due 2018 was outstanding and due in november 2018. annual interest payments for our 0.375% convertible senior notes through 2018, assuming that none of these notes are converted, repurchased or exchanged, are $1.4 million. as of december 31, 2014, $375.0 million aggregate principal amount of our 1.25% convertible senior notes due 2020 was outstanding and due in november 2020. annual interest payments for our 1.25% convertible senior notes through 2020, assuming that none of these notes are converted, repurchased or exchanged, are $4.7 million. if we are unable to generate cash from our operations or raise additional cash through financings sufficient to meet the remaining obligations under our convertible senior notes, we will need to use existing cash or liquidate marketable securities in order to fund these obligations, which may delay or curtail our research, development and commercialization programs.
44
our marketable securities are subject to certain risks that could adversely affect our overall financial position.
we invest our cash in accordance with an established internal policy and customarily in instruments, corporate bonds and money market funds which historically have been highly liquid and carried relatively low risk. recently similar types of investments and money market funds have experienced losses in value or liquidity issues which differ from their historical pattern.
should a portion of our cash or marketable securities lose value or have their liquidity impaired, it could adversely affect our overall financial position by imperiling our ability to fund our operations and forcing us to seek additional financing sooner than we would otherwise. such financing, if available, may not be available on commercially attractive terms.
our current revenues are derived from jakafi product sales, jakavi product royalties, collaborations and from licensing our intellectual property. if we are unable to achieve milestones, develop products or renew or enter into new collaborations, our revenues may decrease, and future milestone and royalty payments may not contribute significantly to revenues for several years, and may never result in revenues.
we derived substantially all of our revenues for the year ended december 31, 2014 from jakafi product revenues, jakavi product royalties and our collaborations and licensing our intellectual property to others. future revenues from research and development collaborations depend upon continuation of the collaborations, the achievement of milestones and royalties we earn from any future products developed from our research. if we are unable to successfully achieve milestones or our collaborators fail to develop successful products, we will not earn the future revenues contemplated under our collaborative agreements.
risks relating to intellectual property and legal matters if we are subject to arbitration, litigation and infringement claims, they could be costly and disrupt our drug discovery and development efforts.
the technology that we use to make and develop our drug products, the technology that we incorporate in our products, and the products we are developing may be subject to claims that they infringe the patents or proprietary rights of others. the success of our drug discovery and development efforts will also depend on our ability to develop new compounds, drugs and technologies without infringing or misappropriating the proprietary rights of others. we are aware of patents and patent applications filed in certain countries claiming intellectual property relating to some of our drug discovery targets and drug candidates. while the validity of issued patents, patentability of pending patent applications and applicability of any of them to our programs are uncertain, if any of these patents are asserted against us or if we choose to license any of these patents, our ability to commercialize our products could be harmed or the potential return to us from any product that may be successfully commercialized could be diminished.
from time to time we have received, and we may in the future receive, notices from third parties offering licenses to technology or alleging patent, trademark, or copyright infringement, claims regarding trade secrets or other contract claims. receipt of these notices could result in significant costs as a result of the diversion of the attention of management from our drug discovery and development efforts. parties sending these notices may have brought and in the future may bring litigation against us or seek arbitration relating to contract claims.
we may be involved in future lawsuits or other legal proceedings alleging patent infringement or other intellectual property rights or contract violations. in addition, litigation or other legal proceedings may be necessary to:
 assert claims of infringement;
45
 enforce our patents or trademarks;
 protect our trade secrets or know-how; or
 determine the enforceability, scope and validity of the proprietary rights of others.
we may be unsuccessful in defending or pursuing these lawsuits, claims or other legal proceedings. regardless of the outcome, litigation or other legal proceedings can be very costly and can divert management's efforts. an adverse determination may subject us to significant liabilities or require us or our collaborators or licensees to seek licenses to other parties' patents or proprietary rights. we or our collaborators or licensees may also be restricted or prevented from manufacturing or selling a drug or other product that we or they develop. further, we or our future collaborators or licensees may not be able to obtain any necessary licenses on acceptable terms, if at all. if we are unable to develop non-infringing technology or license technology on a timely basis or on reasonable terms, our business could be harmed.
we may be unable to adequately protect or enforce our proprietary information, which may result in its unauthorized use, a loss of revenue under a collaboration agreement or loss of sales to generic versions of our products or otherwise reduce our ability to compete in developing and commercializing products.
our business and competitive position depends in significant part upon our ability to protect our proprietary technology, including any drug products that we create. despite our efforts to protect this information, unauthorized parties may attempt to obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary. for example, one of our collaborators may disclose proprietary information pertaining to our drug discovery efforts. in addition, while we have filed numerous patent applications with respect to ruxolitinib and our drug candidates in the united states and in foreign countries, our patent applications may fail to result in issued patents. in addition, because patent applications can take several years to issue as patents, there may be pending patent applications of others that may later issue as patents that cover some aspect of ruxolitinib and our drug candidates. our existing patents and any future patents we may obtain may not be broad enough to protect our products or all of the potential uses of our products, or otherwise prevent others from developing competing products or technologies. in addition, our patents may be challenged and invalidated or may fail to provide us with any competitive advantages if, for example, others were first to invent or first to file a patent application for the technologies and products covered by our patents.
additionally, when we do not control the prosecution, maintenance and enforcement of certain important intellectual property, such as a drug candidate in-licensed to us or subject to a collaboration with a third party, the protection of the intellectual property rights may not be in our hands. if we do not control the intellectual property rights in-licensed to us with respect to a drug candidate and the entity that controls the intellectual property rights does not adequately protect those rights, our rights may be impaired, which may impact our ability to develop, market and commercialize the in-licensed drug candidate.
our means of protecting our proprietary rights may not be adequate, and our competitors may:
 independently develop substantially equivalent proprietary information, products and techniques;
 otherwise gain access to our proprietary information; or
 design around patents issued to us or our other intellectual property.
we pursue a policy of having our employees, consultants and advisors execute proprietary information and invention agreements when they begin working for us. however, these agreements may not provide meaningful protection for our trade secrets or other proprietary information in the event of unauthorized use or disclosure. if we fail to maintain trade secret and patent protection, our potential, future revenues may be decreased.
46
if the effective term of our patents is decreased due to changes in the united states patent laws or if we need to refile some of our patent applications, the value of our patent portfolio and the revenues we derive from it may be decreased.
the value of our patents depends in part on their duration. a shorter period of patent protection could lessen the value of our rights under any patents that we obtain and may decrease the revenues we derive from our patents. the united states patent laws were amended in 1995 to change the term of patent protection from 17 years from patent issuance to 20 years from the earliest effective filing date of the application. because the time from filing to issuance of biotechnology applications may be more than three years depending on the subject matter, a 20-year patent term from the filing date may result in substantially shorter patent protection.
additionally, united states patent laws were amended in 2011 with the enactment of the america invents act and third parties are now able to challenge the validity of issued u.s. patents through various review proceedings; thus rendering the validity of u.s. patents more uncertain. we may be obligated to participate in review proceedings to determine the validity of our u.s. patents. we cannot predict the ultimate outcome of these proceedings, the conduct of which could result in substantial costs and diversion of our efforts and resources. if we are unsuccessful in these proceedings some or all of our claims in the patents may be narrowed or invalidated and the patent protection for our products and drug candidates in the united states could be substantially shortened. further, if all of the patents covering one of our products are invalidated, the fda could approve requests to manufacture a generic version of that product prior to the expiration date of those patents.
other changes in the united states patent laws or changes in the interpretation of patent laws could diminish the value of our patents or narrow the scope of our patent protection. for example, the supreme court of the united states recently ruled that isolated dna sequences cannot be patented. although we no longer receive significant revenues generated from our former information products business, the majority of our gene patent portfolio from that business consists of patents on isolated dna sequences, and this ruling limits our ability to derive additional revenues from our gene patent portfolio. additionally, the supreme court recently resolved a split among the circuit courts of appeals regarding antitrust challenges to settlements of patent infringement lawsuits under the hatch-waxman act between brand-name drug companies and generic drug companies. the court rejected the "scope of the patent" test and ruled that settlements involving "reverse payments" from brand-name drug companies to generic drug companies should be analyzed under the rule of reason. this ruling may create uncertainty and make it more difficult to settle patent litigation if a company seeking to manufacture a generic version of one of our products challenges the patents covering that product prior to the expiration date of those patents.
international patent protection is particularly uncertain and costly, and our involvement in opposition proceedings in foreign countries may result in the expenditure of substantial sums and management resources.
biotechnology and pharmaceutical patent law outside the united states is even more uncertain and costly than in the united states and is currently undergoing review and revision in many countries. further, the laws of some foreign countries may not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as united states laws. for example, certain countries do not grant patent claims that are directed to the treatment of humans. we have participated, and may in the future participate, in opposition proceedings to determine the validity of our foreign patents or our competitors' foreign patents, which could result in substantial costs and diversion of our efforts. for example, there is a patent opposition proceeding in india against our indian patent that covers the composition of matter and use of certain janus kinase inhibitors, including ruxolitinib phosphate, for the treatment of myeloid proliferative disorders, cancer, immune-related diseases, skin disorders, and other diseases. successful challenges to our patent or other intellectual property rights through these proceedings could result in a loss of rights in the relevant jurisdiction and allow third parties to use our proprietary technologies without a license from us or our collaborators, which may also result in loss of future royalty payments. in addition, successful challenges may jeopardize or delay our ability to enter into new collaborations or commercialize potential products, which could harm our business and results of operations.

license agreements novartis in november 2009, we entered into a collaboration and license agreement with novartis. under the terms of the agreement, novartis received exclusive development and commercialization rights outside of the united states to ruxolitinib and certain back-up compounds for hematologic and oncology indications, including all hematological malignancies, solid tumors and myeloproliferative diseases. we retained exclusive development and commercialization rights to jakafi (ruxolitinib) in the united states and in certain other indications. novartis also received worldwide exclusive development and commercialization rights to our c-met inhibitor compound capmatinib and certain back-up compounds in all indications. we retained options to co-develop and to co-promote capmatinib in the united states.
under this agreement, we received an upfront payment and immediate milestone payment totaling $210.0 million and were initially eligible to receive additional payments of up to approximately $1.2 billion if defined development and commercialization milestones are achieved. in 2014, 2013 and 2012, we received $92.0 million, $25.0 million and $40.0 million, respectively, in milestone payments under this agreement. we are also eligible to receive tiered, double-digit royalties ranging from the upper-teens to the mid-twenties on future ruxolitinib net sales outside of the united states. in addition, novartis has received reimbursement and pricing approval for ruxolitinib in a specified number of countries, and we are now obligated to pay to novartis tiered royalties in the low single digits on future ruxolitinib net sales within the united states. each company is responsible for costs relating to the development and commercialization of ruxolitinib in its respective territories, with costs of collaborative studies shared equally. novartis is now responsible for all costs relating to the development and commercialization of capmatinib. jakafi is sold outside of the united states by novartis under the name jakavi. for the years ended december 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, we recorded $49.0 million, $28.3 million and $3.7 million, respectively, of product royalty revenues related to novartis net sales of jakavi.
the novartis agreement will continue on a program-by-program basis until novartis has no royalty payment obligations with respect to such program or, if earlier, the termination of the agreement or any program in accordance with the terms of the agreement. royalties are payable by novartis on a product-by-product and country-by-country basis until the latest to occur of (1) the expiration of the last valid claim of the licensed patent rights covering the licensed product in the relevant country, (2) the expiration of regulatory exclusivity for the licensed product in such country and (3) a specified period from
53
first commercial sale in such country of the licensed product by novartis or its affiliates or sublicensees. the agreement may be terminated in its entirety or on a program-by-program basis by novartis for convenience. the agreement may also be terminated by either party under certain other circumstances, including material breach.
lilly in december 2009, we entered into a license, development and commercialization agreement with lilly. under the terms of the agreement, lilly received exclusive worldwide development and commercialization rights to baricitinib and certain back-up compounds for inflammatory and autoimmune diseases. we received an initial payment of $90.0 million, and were initially eligible to receive additional payments of up to $665.0 million based on the achievement of defined development, regulatory and commercialization milestones. in 2012, we recognized a $50.0 million milestone under this agreement, and in 2010, we received $49.0 million in milestone payments under this agreement. we also could receive tiered, double-digit royalty payments on future global net sales with rates ranging up to 20% if the product is successfully commercialized.
we retained options to co-develop our jak1/jak2 inhibitors with lilly on a compound-by-compound and indication-by-indication basis. lilly is responsible for all costs relating to the development and commercialization of the compounds unless we elect to co-develop any compounds or indications. if we elect to co-develop any compounds and/or indications, we would be responsible for funding 30% of the associated future global development costs from the initiation of a phase iib trial through regulatory approval. we would receive an incremental royalty rate increase across all tiers resulting in effective royalty rates ranging up to the high twenties on potential future global net sales for compounds and/or indications that we elect to co-develop. we also retained an option to co-promote products in the united states. in july 2010, we elected to co-develop baricitinib with lilly in rheumatoid arthritis and we are responsible for funding 30% of the associated future global development costs for this indication from the initiation of the phase iib trial through regulatory approval. baricitinib is also being developed in psoriasis and diabetic nephropathy. we have decided not to exercise our co-development option for psoriasis. the lilly agreement will continue until lilly no longer has any royalty payment obligations or, if earlier, the termination of the agreement in accordance with its terms. royalties are payable by lilly on a product-by-product and country-by-country basis until the latest to occur of (1) the expiration of the last valid claim of the licensed patent rights covering the licensed product in the relevant country, (2) the expiration of regulatory exclusivity for the licensed product in such country and (3) a specified period from first commercial sale in such country of the licensed product by lilly or its affiliates or sublicensees. the agreement may be terminated by lilly for convenience, and may also be terminated under certain other circumstances, including material breach.
agenus in january 2015, we entered into a license, development and commercialization agreement with agenus inc. and its wholly-owned subsidiary, 4-antibody ag, which we collectively refer to as agenus. under this agreement, the parties have agreed to collaborate on the discovery of novel immuno-therapeutics using agenus' proprietary retrocyte display antibody discovery platform. the effectiveness of the agreement is conditioned on the expiration of the waiting period under the hart-scott-rodino antitrust improvements act of 1976 (hsr act).
under the terms of this agreement, we received exclusive worldwide development and commercialization rights to four checkpoint modulators directed against gitr, ox40, lag-3 and tim-3. in addition to the initial four program targets, we and agenus have the option to jointly nominate and pursue additional targets within the framework of the collaboration. these targets may be designated profit-share programs, where all costs and profits are shared equally by us and agenus, or royalty-bearing programs, where we will be responsible for all costs associated with discovery, preclinical activities, clinical
54
development and commercialization activities. the programs relating to gitr and ox40 are profit-share programs and the programs relating to lag-3 and tim-3 are royalty-bearing programs. all costs related to the collaboration are subject to a joint research plan. we agreed to pay agenus upfront non-refundable payments totaling $25.0 million. for each royalty-bearing product, agenus will be eligible to receive up to $155.0 million in future contingent development, regulatory and commercialization milestones as well as tiered royalties on global net sales ranging from 6% to 12%. for each profit-share product, agenus will be eligible to receive up to $20.0 million in future contingent development milestones. additionally, agenus retains co-promotion participation rights in the united states on any profit-share product. for each royalty-bearing product, agenus has reserved the right to elect to co-fund 30% of development costs for a commensurate increase in royalties. the agreement may be terminated by us for convenience and may also be terminated under certain other circumstances, including material breach. we have agreed to certain standstill provisions that allow us to acquire up to 15% of agenus inc.'s outstanding voting stock, including shares acquired pursuant to the stock purchase agreement described below, solely for investment purposes.
we also entered into a stock purchase agreement with agenus inc., pursuant to which we agreed to purchase, subject to expiration of the waiting period under the hsr act, approximately 7.76 million shares of agenus inc. common stock for an aggregate purchase price of $35.0 million in cash, or approximately $4.51 per share. we will own approximately 11% of the outstanding shares of agenus inc.'s common stock after such purchase. we have agreed not to dispose of any of the shares of common stock for a period of 12 months and agenus inc. has agreed to certain registration rights with respect to the shares of common stock.
pfizer in january 2006, we entered into a collaborative research and license agreement with pfizer inc. for the pursuit of our ccr2 antagonist program. pfizer gained worldwide development and commercialization rights to our portfolio of ccr2 antagonist compounds. pfizer's rights extend to the full scope of potential indications, with the exception of multiple sclerosis and autoimmune nephritides, where we retained worldwide rights, along with certain compounds. we do not have obligations to pfizer on pre-clinical development candidates we select for pursuit in these indications. the agreement will terminate upon the expiration of the last to expire of patent rights licensed under the agreement. prior to such expiration, either party can terminate the agreement for the uncured material breach of the agreement by the other party or for the insolvency of the other party. in addition, pfizer may terminate the agreement at any time upon 90 days' notice. we received an upfront nonrefundable, non-creditable payment of $40.0 million in january 2006 and are eligible to receive additional future development and milestone payments. we received a $3.0 million milestone payment from pfizer in 2010.
critical accounting policies and significant estimates the preparation of financial statements requires us to make estimates, assumptions and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. on an on-going basis, we evaluate our estimates. we base our estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form our basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. actual results may differ from those estimates under different assumptions or conditions.
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements:
 revenue recognition;
 research and development costs;
55
 stock compensation;
 investments;
 inventory; and
 convertible debt accounting revenue recognition.    revenues are recognized when (1) persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, (2) delivery has occurred or services have been rendered, (3) the price is fixed or determinable and (4) collectability is reasonably assured. revenues are deferred for fees received before earned or until no further obligations exist. we exercise judgment in determining that collectability is reasonably assured or that services have been delivered in accordance with the arrangement. we assess whether the fee is fixed or determinable based on the payment terms associated with the transaction and whether the sales price is subject to refund or adjustment. we assess collectability based primarily on the customer's payment history and on the creditworthiness of the customer. our product revenues consist of u.s. sales of jakafi and are recognized once we meet all four revenue recognition criteria described above. in november 2011, we began shipping jakafi to our specialty pharmacy customers, which in turn dispense jakafi to patients in fulfillment of prescriptions.
we recognize revenues for product received by our specialty pharmacy customers net of allowances for customer credits, including estimated rebates, chargebacks, discounts, returns, distribution service fees, patient assistance programs, and medicare part d coverage gap reimbursements. product shipping and handling costs are included in cost of product revenues.
customer credits:    our specialty pharmacy customers are offered various forms of consideration, including allowances, service fees and prompt payment discounts. we expect our specialty pharmacy customers will earn prompt payment discounts and, therefore, we deduct the full amount of these discounts from total product sales when revenues are recognized. service fees are also deducted from total product sales as they are earned.
rebates:    allowances for rebates include mandated discounts under the medicaid drug rebate program. rebate amounts are based upon contractual agreements or legal requirements with public sector (e.g., medicaid) benefit providers. rebates are amounts owed after the final dispensing of the product to a benefit plan participant and are based upon contractual agreements or legal requirements with public sector benefit providers. the accrual for rebates is based on statutory discount rates and expected utilization as well as historical data we have accumulated since product launch. our estimates for expected utilization of rebates are based on data received from our specialty pharmacy customers. rebates are generally invoiced and paid in arrears so that the accrual balance consists of an estimate of the amount expected to be incurred for the current quarter's activity, plus an accrual balance for known prior quarters' unpaid rebates. if actual future rebates vary from estimates, we may need to adjust prior period accruals, which would affect revenue in the period of adjustment.
chargebacks:    chargebacks are discounts that occur when contracted customers purchase directly from a specialty pharmacy, or an intermediary distributor. contracted customers, which currently consist primarily of public health service institutions, non-profit clinics, and federal government entities purchasing via the federal supply schedule, generally purchase the product at a discounted price. the specialty pharmacy or distributor, in turn, charges back to us the difference between the price initially paid by the specialty pharmacy or distributor and the discounted price paid to the specialty pharmacy or distributor by the customer. the accrual for chargebacks is based on the estimated contractual discounts on the inventory levels on hand in our distribution channel. if actual future chargebacks vary from estimates, we may need to adjust prior period accruals, which would affect revenue in the period of adjustment.
56
medicare part d coverage gap:    medicare part d prescription drug benefit mandates manufacturers to fund 50% of the medicare part d insurance coverage gap for prescription drugs sold to eligible patients. our estimates for the expected medicare part d coverage gap are based on historical invoices received and in part from data received from our specialty pharmacy customers. funding of the coverage gap is generally invoiced and paid in arrears so that the accrual balance consists of an estimate of the amount expected to be incurred for the current quarter's activity, plus an accrual balance for known prior quarters. if actual future funding varies from estimates, we may need to adjust prior period accruals, which would affect revenue in the period of adjustment.
co-payment assistance:    patients who have commercial insurance and meet certain eligibility requirements may receive co-payment assistance. we accrue a liability for co-payment assistance based on actual program participation and estimates of program redemption using data provided by third-party administrators.
product royalty revenues royalty revenues on commercial sales for jakavi by novartis are estimated based on information provided by novartis. we exercise judgment in determining whether the information provided is sufficiently reliable for us to base our royalty revenue recognition thereon. if actual royalties vary from estimates, we may need to adjust prior period which would affect royalty revenue in the period of adjustment.
cost of product revenues cost of product revenues includes all jakafi related costs that are recoverable through the commercialization of the product. beginning in october 2014, we became obligated to pay tiered, low-single digit royalties to novartis on all future sales of jakafi in the united states, which are included in cost of product revenues.
contract and license revenues under agreements involving multiple deliverables, services and/or rights to use assets that we entered into prior to january 1, 2011, the multiple elements are divided into separate units of accounting when certain criteria are met, including whether the delivered items have stand-alone value to the customer and whether there is objective and reliable evidence of the fair value of the undelivered items. when separate units of accounting exist, consideration is allocated among the separate elements based on their respective fair values. the determination of fair value of each element is based on objective evidence from historical sales of the individual elements by us to other customers. if such evidence of fair value for each undelivered element of the arrangement does not exist, all revenue from the arrangement is deferred until such time that evidence of fair value for each undelivered element does exist or until all elements of the arrangement are delivered. when elements are specifically tied to a separate earnings process, revenue is recognized when the specific performance obligation tied to the element is completed. when revenues for an element are not specifically tied to a separate earnings process, they are recognized ratably over the term of the agreement. we assess whether a substantive milestone exists at the inception of our agreements. for all milestones within our arrangements that are considered substantive, we recognize revenue upon the achievement of the associated milestone. if a milestone is not considered substantive, we would recognize the applicable milestone payment over the remaining period of performance under the arrangement. as of december 31, 2014, all remaining potential milestones under our collaborative arrangements are considered substantive.
on january 1, 2011, updated guidance on the recognition of revenues for agreements with multiple deliverables became effective and applies to any agreements we may enter into on or after january 1, 2011. this updated guidance (i) relates to whether multiple deliverables exist, how the deliverables in a revenue
57
arrangement should be separated and how the consideration should be allocated; (ii) requires companies to allocate revenues in an arrangement using estimated selling prices of deliverables if a vendor does not have vendor-specific objective evidence or third-party evidence of selling price; and (iii) eliminates the use of the residual method and requires companies to allocate revenues using the relative selling price method. during the years ended december 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, we did not enter into any agreements that are subject to this updated guidance. if we enter into an agreement with multiple deliverables after january 1, 2011 or amend existing agreements, this updated guidance could have a material effect on our financial statements.
our collaborations often include contractual milestones, which typically relate to the achievement of pre-specified development, regulatory and commercialization events. these three categories of milestone events reflect the three stages of the life-cycle of our drugs, which we describe in more detail in the following paragraphs.
the regulatory review and approval process, which includes preclinical testing and clinical trials of each drug candidate, is lengthy, expensive and uncertain. securing approval by the u.s. food and drug administration (fda) requires the submission of extensive preclinical and clinical data and supporting information to the fda for each indication to establish a drug candidate's safety and efficacy. the approval process takes many years, requires the expenditure of substantial resources, involves post-marketing surveillance and may involve ongoing requirements for post-marketing studies. before commencing clinical investigations of a drug candidate in humans, we must submit an investigational new drug application (ind), which must be reviewed by the fda.
the steps generally required before a drug may be marketed in the united states include preclinical laboratory tests, animal studies and formulation studies, submission to the fda of an ind for human clinical testing, performance of adequate and well-controlled clinical trials in three phases, as described below, to establish the safety and efficacy of the drug for each indication, submission of a new drug application (nda) or biologics license application (bla) to the fda for review and fda approval of the nda or bla.
similar requirements exist within foreign regulatory agencies as well. the time required satisfying the fda requirements or similar requirements of foreign regulatory agencies may vary substantially based on the type, complexity and novelty of the product or the targeted disease.
preclinical testing includes laboratory evaluation of product pharmacology, drug metabolism, and toxicity, which includes animal studies, to assess potential safety and efficacy as well as product chemistry, stability, formulation, development, and testing. the results of the preclinical tests, together with manufacturing information and analytical data, are submitted to the fda as part of an ind. the fda may raise safety concerns or questions about the conduct of the clinical trials included in the ind, and any of these concerns or questions must be resolved before clinical trials can proceed. we cannot be sure that submission of an ind will result in the fda allowing clinical trials to commence. clinical trials involve the administration of the investigational drug or the marketed drug to human subjects under the supervision of qualified investigators and in accordance with good clinical practices regulations covering the protection of human subjects. clinical trials typically are conducted in three sequential phases, but the phases may overlap or be combined. phase i usually involves the initial introduction of the investigational drug into healthy volunteers to evaluate its safety, dosage tolerance, absorption, metabolism, distribution and excretion. phase ii usually involves clinical trials in a limited patient population to evaluate dosage tolerance and optimal dosage, identify possible adverse effects and safety risks, and evaluate and gain preliminary evidence of the efficacy of the drug for specific indications. phase iii clinical trials usually further evaluate clinical efficacy and safety by testing the drug in its final form in an expanded patient population, providing statistical evidence of efficacy and safety, and providing an adequate basis for labeling. we cannot guarantee that phase i, phase ii or phase iii testing will be completed successfully within any specified period of time, if at all. furthermore, we, the institutional review board for a trial, or
58
the fda may suspend clinical trials at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the subjects or patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk.
generally, the milestone events contained in our collaboration agreements coincide with the progression of our drugs from development, to regulatory approval and then to commercialization. the process of successfully discovering a new development candidate, having it approved and successfully commercialized is highly uncertain. as such, the milestone payments we may earn from our partners involve a significant degree of risk to achieve. therefore, as a drug candidate progresses through the stages of its life-cycle, the value of the drug candidate generally increases.
research and development costs.    our policy is to expense research and development costs as incurred. we often contract with clinical research organizations (cros) to facilitate, coordinate and perform agreed upon research and development of a new drug. to ensure that research and development costs are expensed as incurred, we record monthly accruals for clinical trials and preclinical testing costs based on the work performed under the contract.
these cro contracts typically call for the payment of fees for services at the initiation of the contract and/or upon the achievement of certain clinical trial milestones. in the event that we prepay cro fees, we record the prepayment as a prepaid asset and amortize the asset into research and development expense over the period of time the contracted research and development services are performed. most professional fees, including project and clinical management, data management, monitoring, and medical writing fees are incurred throughout the contract period. these professional fees are expensed based on their percentage of completion at a particular date. our cro contracts generally include pass through fees. pass through fees include, but are not limited to, regulatory expenses, investigator fees, travel costs, and other miscellaneous costs, including shipping and printing fees. we expense the costs of pass through fees under our cro contracts as they are incurred, based on the best information available to us at the time. the estimates of the pass through fees incurred are based on the amount of work completed for the clinical trial and are monitored through correspondence with the cros, internal reviews and a review of contractual terms. the factors utilized to derive the estimates include the number of patients enrolled, duration of the clinical trial, estimated patient attrition, screening rate and length of the dosing regimen. cro fees incurred to set up the clinical trial are expensed during the setup period.
under our clinical trial collaboration agreements, we may be reimbursed for certain development costs incurred. such costs are recorded as a reduction of research and development expense in the period in which the related expense is incurred.
stock compensation.    share-based payment transactions with employees, which include stock options, restricted stock units (rsus) and performance shares (psus), are recognized as compensation expense over the requisite service period based on their estimated fair values on the dates of grant. the stock compensation process requires significant judgment and the use of estimates, particularly surrounding black-scholes assumptions such as stock price volatility over the option term and expected option lives, as well as expected forfeiture rates and the probability of psus vesting. the fair value of stock options, which are subject to graded vesting, are recognized as compensation expense over the requisite service period using the accelerated attribution method. the fair value of rsus, which are generally subject to cliff vesting, are recognized as compensation expense over the requisite service period using the straight line attribution method. the fair value of psus are recognized as compensation expense beginning at the time in which the performance conditions are deemed probable of achievement, over the remaining requisite service period. we recorded $62.2 million, $38.4 million and $38.5 million of stock compensation expense for the years ended december 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively.
investments.    we carry our investments at their respective fair values. we periodically evaluate the fair values of our investments to determine whether any declines in the fair value of investments represent an other-than-temporary impairment. this evaluation consists of a review of several factors, including the
59
length of time and extent that a security has been in an unrealized loss position, the existence of an event that would impair the issuer's future repayment potential, the near term prospects for recovery of the market value of a security and if we intend to sell or if it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis. if management determines that such an impairment exists, we would recognize an impairment charge. because we may determine that market or business conditions may lead us to sell our marketable securities prior to maturity, we classify our marketable securities as "available-for-sale." investments in securities that are classified as available-for-sale and have readily determinable fair values are measured at fair market value in the balance sheets, and unrealized holding gains and losses for these investments are reported as a separate component of stockholders' equity until realized. we classify marketable securities that are available for use in current operations as current assets on the consolidated balance sheets.
inventory.    inventories are determined at the lower of cost or market value with cost determined under the specific identification method and may consist of raw materials, work in process and finished goods. we began capitalizing inventory in mid-november 2011 once the fda approved jakafi as the related costs were expected to be recoverable through the commercialization of the product. costs incurred prior to approval of jakafi have been recorded as research and development expense in our statements of operations. as a result, cost of product revenues for approximately the next 21 to 24 months will reflect a lower average per unit cost of materials.
the raw materials and work-in-process inventory is not subject to expiration and the shelf life for finished goods inventory is 36 months from the start of manufacturing of the finished goods. we evaluate for potential excess inventory by analyzing current and future product demand relative to the remaining product shelf life. we build demand forecasts by considering factors such as, but not limited to, overall market potential, market share, market acceptance and patient usage. we classify inventory as current on the consolidated balance sheets when we expect inventory to be consumed for commercial use within the next twelve months.
convertible debt accounting.    we perform an assessment of all embedded features of a debt instrument to determine if (1) such features should be bifurcated and separately accounted for, and (2) if bifurcation requirements are met, whether such features should be classified and accounted for as equity or liability instruments. if the embedded feature meets the requirements to be bifurcated and accounted for as a liability, the fair value of the embedded feature is measured initially, included as a liability on the consolidated balance sheet, and re-measured to fair value at each reporting period. any changes in fair value are recorded in the consolidated statement of operations. we monitor, on an ongoing basis, whether events or circumstances could give rise to a change in our classification of embedded features.
we determined the embedded conversion options in the 0.375% convertible senior notes due 2018 (the 2018 notes) and the 1.25% convertible senior notes due 2020 (the 2020 notes) are not required to be separately accounted for as derivatives. however, since the 2018 notes and the 2020 notes can be settled in cash or common shares or a combination of cash and common shares at our option, we are required to separate the 2018 notes and 2020 notes into a liability and equity component. the carrying amount of the liability component is calculated by measuring the fair value of a similar liability that does not have an associated equity component. the carrying amount of the equity component representing the embedded conversion option is determined by deducting the fair value of the liability component from the initial proceeds. the excess of the principal amount of the liability component over its carrying amount is amortized to interest expense over the expected life of the 2018 notes and 2020 notes using the effective interest method. the equity component is not re-measured as long as it continues to meet the conditions for equity classification for contracts in an entity's own equity.
the fair value of the liability component of the 2018 notes was estimated at $299.4 million at issuance. therefore, the difference between the $375.0 million face value of the 2018 notes and the $299.4 million
60
estimated fair value of the liability component will be amortized to interest expense over the term of the 2018 notes through november 15, 2018 using the effective interest method.
the fair value of the liability component of the 2020 notes was estimated at $274.8 million at issuance. therefore, the difference between the $375.0 million face value of the 2020 notes and the $274.8 million estimated fair value of the liability component will be amortized to interest expense over the term of the 2020 notes through november 15, 2020 using the effective interest method.
the estimated fair value of the liability components at the date of issuance for the 2018 notes and 2020 notes were determined using valuation models and are complex and subject to judgment. significant assumptions within the valuation models included an implied credit spread, the expected volatility and dividend yield of our common stock and the risk free interest rate for notes with a similar term.
prior to may 14, 2014, the 2018 notes and 2020 notes were not convertible except in connection with a make-whole fundamental change, as defined in the respective indentures. beginning on, and including, may 15, 2014, the 2018 notes and 2020 notes are convertible prior to the close of business on the business day immediately preceding may 15, 2018, in the case of the 2018 notes, and may 15, 2020, in the case of the 2020 notes, only under the following circumstances: (1) during any calendar quarter commencing after the calendar quarter ending on march 31, 2014 (and only during such calendar quarter), if the last reported sale price of our common stock for at least 20 trading days (whether or not consecutive) during a period of 30 consecutive trading days ending on the last trading day of the immediately preceding calendar quarter is greater than or equal to 130% of the conversion price for the 2018 notes or 2020 notes, as applicable, on each applicable trading day; (2) during the five business day period after any five consecutive trading day period (the measurement period) in which the trading price per $1,000 principal amount of 2018 notes or 2020 notes, as applicable, for each trading day of the measurement period was less than 98% of the product of the last reported sale price of our common stock and the conversion rate for the 2018 notes or 2020 notes, as applicable, on each such trading day; or (3) upon the occurrence of specified corporate events. on or after may 15, 2018, in the case of the 2018 notes, and may 15, 2020, in the case of the 2020 notes, until the close of business on the second scheduled trading day immediately preceding the relevant maturity date, the notes are convertible at any time, regardless of the foregoing circumstances. upon conversion we will pay or deliver, as the case may be, cash, shares of common stock or a combination of cash and shares of common stock, at our election.
on a quarterly basis, we perform an assessment in order to determine whether the 2018 notes or 2020 notes have become convertible at the option of the holder, based on meeting any of the conversion criteria described above. should either the 2018 notes or the 2020 notes become convertible, we then assess our intent and ability to settle the 2018 notes or the 2020 notes in cash, shares of common stock, or a combination of cash and shares of common stock, in order to determine the appropriate classification of the 2018 notes and the 2020 notes at the balance sheet date. on january 1, 2015, the 2018 notes and 2020 notes became convertible through at least march 31, 2015, based on meeting the conversion criteria related to the sale price of our common stock during the calendar quarter ended december 31, 2014 as described above. management's intent is to settle any conversions of 2018 notes or 2020 notes in common shares and, therefore, the 2018 and 2020 notes are reflected in long term liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet as of december 31, 2014.

our product revenues, net from jakafi for the years ended december 31, 2014 and 2013, were $357.6 million and $235.4 million, respectively. this increase was comprised of a volume increase of $92.3 million and a price increase of $29.9 million. product revenues from the sale of jakafi are recorded net of estimated product returns, pricing discounts including rebates offered pursuant to mandatory federal and state government programs and chargebacks, prompt pay discounts and distribution fees and co-pay assistance. our revenue recognition policies require estimates of the aforementioned sales allowances each period.
the following table provides a summary of activity with respect to our sales allowances and accruals for the year ended december 31, 2014:

balance at january 1, 2014                      $803               $3,435              $108            $292            $4,638

government rebates and chargebacks are the most significant component of our sales allowances. increases in certain government reimbursement rates are limited to a measure of inflation, and when the price of a drug increases faster than this measure of inflation it will result in a penalty adjustment factor that causes a larger sales allowance to those government related entities. we expect government rebates and chargebacks as a percentage of our gross product sales will continue to increase in connection with any future jakafi price increases greater than the rate of inflation, and any such increase in these government rebates and chargebacks will have a negative impact on our reported product revenues, net.
we expect our sales allowances to fluctuate from quarter to quarter as a result of the medicare part d coverage gap, the volume of purchases eligible for government mandated discounts and rebates as well as changes in discount percentages which are impacted by potential future price increases, rate of inflation, and other factors.

product royalty revenues on commercial sales for jakavi by novartis are based on net sales of licensed products in licensed territories as provided by novartis. our net product royalty revenues for the years ended december 31, 2014 and 2013, were $49.0 million and $28.3 million, respectively. future product royalty revenues on commercial sales for jakavi by novartis could be impacted by foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations.
our contract revenues were $104.8 million and $91.0 million in 2014 and 2013, respectively. for the years ended december 31, 2014 and 2013, contract revenues were derived from the straight line recognition of revenue associated with the novartis and lilly upfront fees over the estimated performance periods as well as milestone payments earned during the periods. the upfront fees related to the novartis agreement included a $150.0 million upfront payment received in 2009, a $60.0 million immediate milestone payment received in 2010 and $10.9 million of reimbursable costs incurred prior to the effective date of the agreement. the upfront fees related to the lilly agreement consisted of a $90.0 million upfront payment received in 2010. the increase from 2013 to 2014 primarily relates to recognition of $92.0 million in milestone payments from novartis in 2014 compared to the recognition of $25.0 from novartis in 2013 and $53.2 million of amortization of the novartis upfront payment in 2013, through the substantive completion date of our performance obligation with novartis.
cost of product revenues we began capitalizing inventory in mid-november 2011 once the fda approved jakafi as the related costs were expected to be recoverable through the commercialization of the product. costs incurred prior to fda approval of $9.6 million were recorded as research and development expenses in our statements of operations prior to commercialization of jakafi. at december 31, 2014, inventory with $2.3 million of product costs incurred prior to fda approval had not yet been sold. we expect to sell the pre-commercialization inventory over the next 24 months; however, the time period over which this inventory is consumed will depend on a number of factors, including the amount of future jakafi sales, and the ability to utilize inventory prior to its expiration date. as a result, cost of product revenues for the next 24 months will reflect a lower average per unit cost of materials. commencing in october 2014, we became obligated to pay tiered, low-single digit royalties to novartis on all sales of jakafi in the united states, which is included in cost of product revenues.
cost of product revenues was $3.0 million and $0.6 million for the years ended december 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. cost of product revenues increased from 2013 to 2014 due to increased jakafi sales and our obligation that commenced in october 2014 to pay royalties to novartis on all jakafi sales in the united states. we expect future cost of product revenues to range in the mid-single digits as a percentage of net product sales subsequent to the utilization of all of the remaining pre-launch inventory.

we currently account for research and development costs by natural expense line and not costs by project. salary and benefits related expense increased from 2013 to 2014 due primarily to increased development headcount to sustain our development pipeline. stock compensation expense may fluctuate from period to period based on the number of options granted, stock price volatility and expected option lives, as well as expected option forfeiture rates which are used to value equity-based compensation. the increase in clinical research and outside services expense from 2013 to 2014 was primarily the result of increased development costs. research and development expenses for the year ended december 31, 2014 and 2013 were net of $4.3 million, $5.1 million, respectively, of costs reimbursed by our collaborative partners. research and development expenses may fluctuate from period to period depending upon the stage of certain projects and the level of pre-clinical and clinical trial related activities. many factors can affect the cost and timing of our clinical trials, including requests by regulatory agencies for more information, inconclusive results requiring additional clinical trials, slow patient enrollment, adverse side effects among patients, insufficient supplies for our clinical trials and real or perceived lack of effectiveness or safety of our investigational drugs in our clinical trials. in addition, the development of all of our products will be subject to extensive governmental regulation. these factors make it difficult for us to predict the timing and costs of the further development and approval of our products.
in july 2010, we elected to co-develop baricitinib with lilly in rheumatoid arthritis and we are responsible for funding 30% of the associated future global development costs for this indication from the initiation of the phase iib trial through regulatory approval. research and development expenses recorded under the lilly agreement representing 30% of the global development costs for baricitinib for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis were $49.3 million and $52.4 million for the years ended december 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. we have retained certain mechanisms to give us cost protection as baricitinib advances in clinical development. we can defer our portion of co-development study costs by indication if they exceed a predetermined level. this deferment would be credited against future milestones or royalties and we would still be eligible for the full incremental royalties related to the co-development option. in addition, even if we have started co-development funding for any indication, we can at any time opt out, which will stop future co-development cost sharing. if we elect to do this we would still be eligible for our base royalties plus an incremental pro-rated royalty commensurate with our contribution to the total co-development cost for those indications for which we contributed funding.

salary and benefits related expense increased from 2013 to 2014 due to increased headcount. this increased headcount was due primarily to the ongoing commercialization efforts related to jakafi for intermediate or high-risk myelofibrosis and preparation for the commercial launch in uncontrolled polycythemia vera in december 2014. stock compensation expense may fluctuate from period to period based on the number of options granted, stock price volatility and expected option lives, as well as expected option forfeiture rates which are used to value equity-based compensation. the increase in other contract services and outside costs was primarily the result of marketing activities for jakafi for intermediate or high-risk myelofibrosis and preparation for the commercial launch in uncontrolled polycythemia vera in december 2014.

prior to the three months ended september 30, 2012, we used the sell- through method for revenue recognition as we had limited historical data on product returns. under the sell-through method, we deferred revenue until the patients received jakafi. in the three months ended september 30, 2012, we determined that we had sufficient experience with product returns and transitioned to the sell-in method for recognizing revenue, under which we recognize revenue for product sales of jakafi at the time the product is received by our specialty pharmacy customers.

we had net losses from inception in 1991 through 1996 and in 1999 through december 31, 2014. because of those losses, we had an accumulated deficit of $1.8 billion as of december 31, 2014. we have funded our research and development operations through sales of equity securities, the issuance of convertible notes, cash received from customers, and collaborative arrangements. at december 31, 2014, we had available cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities of $600.3 million. our cash and marketable securities balances are held in a variety of interest-bearing instruments, including money market accounts, corporate debt securities and u.s. government agency and non-agency mortgage-backed securities. available cash is invested in accordance with our investment policy's primary objectives of liquidity, safety of principal and diversity of investments.
cash provided by (used in) operating activities.    the $17.1 million increase in cash provided by operating activities from 2013 to 2014 was due primarily due a lower net loss, increased non-cash depreciation and amortization and changes in working capital. the $104.0 million decrease in cash used in operating activities from 2012 to 2013 was due primarily to timing of milestone receipts in 2013 and other changes in working capital.
cash used in investing activities.    our investing activities, other than purchases, sales and maturities of marketable securities, have consisted predominantly of capital expenditures and sales and purchases of long-term investments. in the future, net cash used by investing activities may fluctuate significantly from period to period due to the timing of strategic equity investments, acquisitions and capital expenditures and maturities/sales and purchases of marketable securities.
cash provided by financing activities.    during 2014, net cash provided by financing activities was $93.1 million, consisting primarily of proceeds from issuance of common stock under our stock plans and employee stock purchase plan. during 2013, net cash provided by financing activities was $275.6 million, consisting of $728.7 million of net proceeds from the issuance of our 2018 notes and our 2020 notes and

$73.2 million of proceeds from issuance of common stock under our stock plans and employee stock purchase plan, offset by $500.0 million related to the repurchase of $117.3 million aggregate principal amount of our 2015 notes, $11.5 million related to the exchange of $186.0 million aggregate principal amount of our 2015 notes for the underlying shares of common stock and cash, and $15.0 million related to a letter of credit for the facility lease for the benefit of the landlord. during 2012, net cash provided by financing activities was $47.7 million of proceeds from issuance of common stock under our stock plans and employee stock purchase plan.
the following summarizes our significant contractual obligations as of december 31, 2014 and the effect those obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flow in future periods (in millions):

contractual obligations:
principal on convertible senior debt       $840.9          $90.9           $            $375.0          $375.0
interest on convertible senior debt        38.1            10.4            12.2          10.8            4.7
non-cancelable lease obligations:
related to corporate headquarters          88.5            6.7             12.0          12.1            57.7
total contractual obligations              $967.5          $108.0          $24.2         $397.9          $437.4
we have entered into and may in the future seek to license additional rights relating to technologies or drug development candidates in connection with our drug discovery and development programs. under these licenses, we may be required to pay up-front fees, milestone payments, and royalties on sales of future products. the table above does not reflect any future potential payments, including the agenus upfront payment of $25.0 million and related stock purchase of $35.0 million which we expect to make in the first quarter of 2015.
we believe that our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities will be adequate to satisfy our capital needs for at least the next twelve months. our cash requirements depend on numerous factors, including our expenditures in connection with our drug discovery and development programs and commercialization operations; expenditures in connection with litigation or other legal proceedings; competing technological and market developments; the cost of filing, prosecuting, defending and enforcing patent claims and other intellectual property rights; our receipt of any milestone or other payments under any collaborative agreements we may enter into, including the agreements with novartis, lilly and pfizer; the extent to which commercialization of jakafi is successful; expenditures in connection with potential exchanges of our outstanding convertible senior notes; and expenditures in connection with strategic relationships and license agreements, including our agreement with agenus, strategic equity investments or potential acquisitions. changes in our research and development or commercialization plans or other changes affecting our operating expenses may result in changes in the timing and amount of expenditures of our capital resources.
until we can generate a sufficient amount of product revenues to finance our cash requirements, which we may never do, we expect to finance future cash needs primarily through public or private equity offerings, debt financings, borrowings or strategic collaborations. the sale of equity or additional convertible debt securities in the future may be dilutive to our stockholders, and may provide for rights, preferences or privileges senior to those of our holders of common stock. debt financing arrangements may require us to pledge certain assets or enter into covenants that could restrict our operations or our ability to incur further indebtedness. we do not know whether additional funding will be available on acceptable terms, if at all. if we are not able to secure additional funding when needed, we may have to scale back our operations, delay or eliminate one or more of our research or development programs, or attempt to obtain funds by entering into an agreement with a collaborator or licensee that would result in
69
terms that are not favorable to us or relinquishing our rights in certain of our proprietary technologies or drug candidates.
off balance sheet arrangements we have no off-balance sheet arrangements other than those that are discussed above.

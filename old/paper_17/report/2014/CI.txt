item 1a. risk factors as a large company operating in a complex industry, we encounter a variety of risks and uncertainties that could have a material adverse effect on our business, liquidity, results of operations or financial condition. you should carefully consider each of the risks and uncertainties discussed below, in management's discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition and information contained elsewhere in this annual report on form 10-k. these risks and uncertainties are not the only ones we face. additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently believe to be immaterial may also adversely affect us.
our business is subject to substantial government regulation, as well as new laws or regulations or changes in existing laws or regulations that could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.
our business is regulated at the federal, state, local and international levels. the laws and rules governing our business and related interpretations, including, among others, those associated with health care reform, are increasing in number and complexity, are subject to frequent change and can be inconsistent or in conflict with each other. as a public company with global operations, we are subject to the laws of multiple jurisdictions and the rules and regulations of various governing bodies, such as those related to financial and other disclosures, corporate governance, privacy, data protection, labor and employment, consumer protection, tax and anti-corruption.
we must identify, assess and respond to new trends in the legislative and regulatory environment, as well as comply with the various existing regulations applicable to our business. existing or future laws, rules, regulatory interpretations or judgments could force us to change how we conduct our business, restrict revenue and enrollment growth, increase health care, technology and administrative costs, including capital requirements, and require enhancements to our compliance infrastructure and internal controls environment. existing or future laws and rules also could require us to take other actions such as changing our business practices, thereby increasing our liability in federal and state courts for coverage determinations, contract interpretation and other actions.
in the foreseeable future, the impact of existing regulations and future regulatory and legislative changes could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows by, among other things:

reducing the potential for growth in revenues and customers by disrupting the employer-based market (currently the primary market for our commercial operating segment) if employers cease to offer health care coverage for their employees;

restricting revenue, premium and customer growth in certain products and markets or expansion into new markets;

increasing health care or other benefit costs through enhanced or guaranteed coverage requirements;

increasing operating costs through the imposition of new regulatory requirements, increased taxes and other financial assessments;

restricting our ability to increase premium rates to meet costs (including denial or delays in approval and implementation of those rates);

limiting the level of margin we can earn on premiums through mandated minimum medical loss ratios and required rebates in the event we do not meet mandated minimum ratios;

restricting our ability to participate in and derive revenue from government-sponsored programs; and

significantly reducing the level of medicare program payments.
specifically, in the united states, significant changes are occurring in the health care system as a result of health care reform. substantially all of the key provisions of health care reform are now effective. while federal agencies have published interim and final regulations with respect to certain requirements, many issues remain uncertain. it is difficult to predict the impact of health care reform on our business due to the law's complexity, the political environment, the continuing development of implementing regulations and interpretive guidance, legal challenges and possible future legislative changes. we are unable to predict how these events will develop and what impact they will have on health care reform, and in turn, on our business including, but not limited to, our relationships with current and future customers, producers and health care providers, products, services, processes and technology. further, if we fail to effectively implement or adjust our strategic and operational initiatives, such as by reducing operating costs, adjusting premium pricing or benefit design or transforming our business model, in response to health care reform and any other future legislative or regulatory changes, this failure may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows, including, but not limited to, our ability to maintain the value of our goodwill and other intangible assets.
our insurance and hmo subsidiaries must be licensed by and are subject to the regulations of the jurisdictions in which they conduct business. for example, health maintenance organizations and insurance companies are regulated under state insurance holding company regulations and other health care-related regulations. state regulations mandate minimum capital or restricted cash reserve requirements and subject us to assessments under guaranty fund laws and related regulations for certain obligations to claimants of insolvent insurance companies, which would expose our business to the risk of insolvency of a competitor in these states. we also participate in the emerging private exchange marketplace and the extent to which states may issue regulations that apply to private exchanges remains uncertain.
in addition to the regulations discussed above, we are required to obtain and maintain insurance and other regulatory approvals to market many of our products, increase prices for certain regulated products and consummate some of our acquisitions and dispositions. delays in obtaining or failure to obtain or maintain these approvals could reduce our revenue or increase our costs.

back to contents part i item 1a. risk factors the health care industry also is regularly subject to negative media attention, including as a result of the political environment and the ongoing debate concerning health care reform. such publicity may adversely affect our stock price and reputation in certain markets.
for more information on regulation, see "business  regulation" in part i, item 1 of this form 10-k. see also the description of health care reform's minimum medical loss ratio and customer rebate requirements in the "business  global health care" section beginning on page 2 of this form 10-k.
we face risks related to litigation, regulatory audits and investigations.
we are routinely involved in numerous claims, lawsuits, regulatory audits, investigations and other legal matters arising in the ordinary course of business, including that of administering and insuring employee benefit programs. these could include benefit claims, breach of contract actions, tort claims, claims disputes under federal or state laws and disputes regarding reinsurance arrangements, employment and employment discrimination-related suits, anti-trust claims, employee benefit claims, wage and hour claims, tax, privacy, intellectual property and real estate disputes. in addition, we have incurred and likely will continue to incur liability for practices and claims related to our health care business, such as marketing misconduct, failure to timely or appropriately pay for or provide health care, provider network structure, poor outcomes for care delivered or arranged, provider disputes, including disputes over compensation or contractual provisions, and claims related to self-funded business. there are currently, and may be in the future, attempts to bring class action lawsuits against the industry or, absent a class action, individual plaintiffs may bring multiple claims regarding the same subject matter against us and other companies in our industry.
court decisions and legislative activity may increase our exposure for any of these types of claims. in some cases, substantial non-economic or punitive damages may be sought. we seek to procure insurance coverage to cover some of these potential liabilities. however, certain potential liabilities may not be covered by insurance, insurers may dispute coverage or the amount of insurance may be insufficient to cover the entire damages awarded. in addition, certain types of damages, such as punitive damages, may not be covered by insurance, and insurance coverage for all or certain forms of liability may become unavailable or prohibitively expensive in the future. it is possible that the resolution of current or future legal matters and claims could result in losses material to our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.
we are frequently the subject of regulatory market conduct and other reviews, audits and investigations by state insurance and health and welfare departments, attorneys general, cms and the oig and comparable authorities in foreign jurisdictions. with respect to our medicare advantage business, cms and oig perform audits to determine a health plan's compliance with federal regulations and contractual obligations, including compliance with proper coding practices and fraud and abuse enforcement practices through audits designed to detect and correct improper payments. there also continues to be heightened review by federal and state regulators of business and reporting practices within the health care and disability insurance industry and increased scrutiny by other state and federal governmental agencies (such as state attorney general offices) empowered to bring criminal actions in circumstances that could have previously given rise only to civil or administrative proceedings. these regulatory audits or reviews or actions by other governmental agencies could result in changes to or clarifications of our business practices, retroactive adjustments to certain premiums, significant fines, penalties, civil liabilities, criminal liabilities or other sanctions, including restrictions on our ability to operate, that could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operation, financial condition and liquidity.
a description of material pending legal actions and other legal matters is included in note 23 to our consolidated financial statements included in this form 10-k. the outcome of litigation and other legal matters is always uncertain, and outcomes that are not justified by the evidence or existing law can occur.
future performance of our business will depend on our ability to execute our strategic and operational initiatives effectively.
the future performance of our business will depend in large part on our ability to effectively implement and execute our strategic and operational initiatives including: (1) driving growth in targeted geographies, product lines, customer buying segments and distribution channels; (2) improving our strategic and financial flexibility; and (3) pursuing additional opportunities in high-growth markets with particular focus on individuals. successfully executing these initiatives depends on a number of factors, including our ability to:

differentiate our products and services from those of our competitors;

develop and introduce new products or programs, particularly in response to government regulation and the increased focus on consumer-directed products;

grow our commercial product portfolio, including expanded participation in the public health insurance exchanges;

identify and introduce the proper mix or integration of products that will be accepted by the marketplace;

attract and retain sufficient numbers of qualified employees;

attract, develop and maintain collaborative relationships with a sufficient number of qualified partners, including physicians and other health care providers in an environment of growing shortages of primary care professionals and consolidation within the provider industry;

transition health care providers from volume-based fee for service arrangements to a value-based system;

improve medical cost competitiveness in targeted markets;

manage our medical and administrative costs effectively;


back to contents part i item 1a. risk factors

reduce our global health care operating expenses to achieve sustainable benefits.
if these initiatives fail or are not executed effectively, it could harm our consolidated financial position and results of operations. for example, efforts to reduce operating expenses while maintaining the necessary resources and talent pool are important and, if not managed effectively, could have long-term effects on our business by negatively impacting our ability to drive improvements in the quality of our products. for our strategic initiatives to succeed, we must effectively integrate our operations, including our acquired businesses, actively work to ensure consistency throughout the organization, and promote a global mind-set and a focus on individual customers. if we fail to do so, our business may be unable to grow as planned, or the result of expansion may be unsatisfactory. in addition, the current competitive, economic and regulatory environment requires our organization to adapt rapidly and nimbly to new opportunities and challenges. we will be unable to do so if we do not make important decisions quickly, define our appetite for risk specifically, implement new governance, managerial and organizational processes smoothly and communicate roles and responsibilities clearly.
as a global company, we face political, legal, operational, regulatory, economic and other risks that present challenges and could negatively affect our multinational operations and/or our long-term growth.
as a global company, our business is increasingly exposed to risks inherent in foreign operations. these risks, which can vary substantially by market, include political, legal, operational, regulatory, economic and other risks, including government intervention that we do not face in our u.s. operations. the global nature of our business and operations may present challenges including, but not limited to, those arising from:

varying regional and geopolitical business conditions and demands;

regulation that may discriminate against u.s. companies, favor nationalization or expropriate assets;

price controls or other pricing issues and exchange controls or other restrictions that prevent us from transferring funds from these operations out of the countries in which we operate or converting local currencies that our foreign operations hold into u.s. dollars or other currencies;

foreign currency exchange rates and fluctuations that may have an impact on the future costs or on future sales and cash flows from our international operations, and any measures that we may implement to reduce the effect of volatile currencies and other risks of our international operations may not be effective;

our reliance on local sales forces for some operations in countries that may have labor problems and/or less flexible employee relationships that can be difficult and expensive to terminate, or where changes in local regulation or law may disrupt business operations;

effectively managing our partner relationships in countries outside of the united states;

managing more geographically diverse operations and projects;

operating in new foreign markets that may require considerable management time before operations generate any significant revenues and earnings;

the need to provide data protection on a global basis and sufficient levels of technical support in different locations;

political instability or acts of war, terrorism, natural disasters or pandemics in locations where we operate; and

general economic and political conditions.
these factors may increase in significance as we continue to expand globally, and any one of these challenges could negatively affect our operations or long-term growth. for example, due to the concentration of business in south korea, the global supplemental benefits segment is exposed to potential losses resulting from economic, regulatory and geopolitical developments in that country, as well as foreign currency movements affecting the south korean currency, that could have a significant impact on the segment's results and our consolidated financial results.
international operations also require us to devote significant resources to implement controls and systems in new markets to comply, and to ensure that our vendors and partners comply, with u.s. and foreign laws prohibiting bribery, corruption and money laundering, in addition to other regulations regarding, among other things, our products, direct-to-consumer communications, customer privacy and data protection. violations of these laws and regulations could result in fines, criminal sanctions against us, our officers or employees, restrictions or outright prohibitions on the conduct of our business, and significant reputational harm. we must regularly reassess the size, capability and location of our global infrastructure and make appropriate changes, and must have effective change management processes and internal controls in place to address changes in our business and operations. our success depends, in part, on our ability to anticipate these risks and manage these difficulties. our failure to comply with laws and regulations governing our conduct outside the united states or to establish constructive relations with non-u.s. regulators could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition, liquidity and long-term growth.
there are various risks associated with participating in government-sponsored programs, such as medicare, including dependence upon government funding, changes occurring as a result of health care reform, compliance with government contracts and increased regulatory oversight.
through our cigna-healthspring business, we contract with cms and various state governmental agencies to provide managed health care services, including medicare advantage plans and medicare-approved prescription drug plans. revenues from medicare programs are dependent, in whole or in part, upon annual funding from the federal government through cms and/or applicable state or local

back to contents part i item 1a. risk factors governments. funding for these programs is dependent on many factors outside our control, including general economic conditions, continuing government efforts to contain health care costs and budgetary constraints at the federal or applicable state or local level and general political issues and priorities. these entities generally have the right to not renew or cancel their contracts with us on short notice without cause or if funds are not available. unanticipated changes in funding, such as the application of sequestration by the federal or state governments, could substantially reduce our revenues and profitability.
the medicare program has been the subject of recent regulatory reform initiatives, including health care reform. the premium rates paid to medicare advantage plans are established by contract, although the rates differ depending on a combination of factors, many of which are outside our control. effective in 2012, health care reform ties a portion of each medicare advantage plan's reimbursement to the plan's "star rating" by cms, with those plans receiving a rating of three or more stars eligible for quality-based bonus payments. the star rating system considers various measures adopted by cms, including, among other things, quality of care, preventative services, chronic illness management and customer satisfaction. beginning in 2015, plans must have a star rating of four or higher to qualify for bonus payments. our medicare advantage plans' operating results, premium revenue and benefit offerings are likely to continue to be significantly determined by their star ratings. if we do not maintain or continue to improve our star ratings, our plans may not be eligible for full-level quality bonuses, which could adversely affect the benefits that our plans can offer, reduce our customer base and/or reduce margins.
contracts with cms and the various state governmental agencies contain certain provisions regarding data submission, provider network maintenance, quality measures, claims payment, continuity of care, call center performance and other requirements. if we fail to comply with these requirements, we may be subject to fines or penalties that could impact our profitability.
in addition, any failure to comply with various state and federal health care laws and regulations, including those directed at preventing fraud and abuse in government funded programs, could result in investigations or litigation, such as actions under the federal false claims act and similar whistleblower statutes under state laws. this could subject us to fines, limits on expansion, restrictions or exclusions from programs or other agreements with federal or state governmental agencies that could adversely impact our business, cash flows, financial condition and results of operations.
in addition, our medicare advantage and medicare prescription drug businesses face a number of other risks including potential uncollectible receivables resulting from processing and/or verifying enrollment, inadequate underwriting assumptions, inability to receive and process correct information or increased medical or pharmaceutical costs. actual results may be materially different than our assumptions and estimates regarding these complex and wide-ranging programs, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
if we fail to develop and maintain satisfactory relationships with physicians, hospitals and other health care providers, our business and results of operations may be adversely affected.
we contract with physicians, hospitals and other health care providers for services rendered to our customers. our results of operations are substantially dependent on our ability to contract for these services at competitive prices. in any particular market, physicians, hospitals and health care providers could refuse to contract, demand higher payments or take other actions that could result in higher medical costs or less desirable products for our customers. in some markets, certain providers, particularly hospitals, physician/hospital organizations and multi-specialty physician groups, may have significant or controlling market positions that could result in a diminished bargaining position for us. if providers refuse to contract with us, use their market position to negotiate favorable contracts or place us at a competitive disadvantage, our ability to market products or to be profitable in those areas could be materially and adversely affected.
our ability to develop and maintain satisfactory relationships with health care providers also may be negatively impacted by other factors not associated with us, such as changes in medicare and/or medicaid reimbursement levels, increasing revenue and other pressures on health care providers and consolidation activity among hospitals, physician groups and health care providers. for example, ongoing reductions by cms and state governments in amounts payable to providers, particularly hospitals, for services provided to medicare and medicaid enrollees may pressure the financial condition of certain providers and, in turn, adversely impact our ability to maintain or develop new cost-effective health care provider contracts or result in a loss of revenues or customers.
recent and continuing consolidation among physicians, hospitals and other health care providers, development of accountable care organizations and other changes in the organizational structures that physicians, hospitals and health care providers choose may change the way these providers interact with us and may change the competitive landscape in which we operate. in some instances, these organizations may compete directly with us, potentially affecting the way that we price our products or causing us to incur increased costs if we change our operations to be more competitive. our focus on developing collaborative accountable care organizations and independent practice associations or similar business arrangements with physicians and other health care providers may not achieve intended benefits, which could adversely affect our strategy or prospects.
out-of-network providers do not have an understanding with us about the amount of compensation due for their services. some states define by law or regulation the amounts due, but in most instances it is not defined or is established by a standard that is not clearly translatable into dollar terms. in such instances, providers may believe that they were underpaid and may litigate or arbitrate their dispute with us or try to recover from our customers the difference between what we have paid them and the amount they charged us. the outcome of disputes where we do not have a provider contract may cause us to pay higher medical or other benefit costs than we projected.

back to contents part i item 1a. risk factors we are dependent on the success of our relationships with third parties for various services and functions, including, but not limited to, pharmacy benefit management services.
to improve operating costs, productivity and efficiencies, we outsource to, or enter into partnership arrangements with, third parties for selected services and functions, such as pharmacy benefit management, information technology, independent practice associations, medical management, call centers and claim services. our operations may be vulnerable if these third parties fail to satisfy their obligations to us or if the arrangement is terminated in whole or in part for any reason or if there is a contractual dispute between us and these third parties. even though contracts are intended to provide certain protections, we have limited control over the actions of third parties. for example, noncompliance with any privacy or security laws and regulations or any security breach involving one of our third-party vendors or a dispute between us and a third party vendor related to our arrangement could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition, liquidity and reputation. in addition, with respect to outsourced services or functions to third parties in foreign jurisdictions, we also are exposed to risks inherent in conducting business outside of the united states.
outsourcing also may require us to change our existing operations, adopt new processes for managing these providers and/or redistribute responsibilities to realize the potential productivity and operational efficiencies. if there are delays or difficulties in changing business processes or our third party vendors do not perform as expected, we may not realize, or realize on a timely basis, the anticipated economic and other benefits of these relationships. this could result in substantial costs or regulatory compliance issues, divert management's attention from other strategic activities, negatively affect employee morale or create other operational or financial problems for us. terminating or transitioning in whole or in part arrangements with key vendors could result in additional costs or penalties, risks of operational delays or potential errors and control issues during the termination or transition phase. we may not be able to find an alternative vendor in a timely manner or on acceptable terms. if there is an interruption in business or loss of access to data resulting from a termination or transition, we may not be able to meet the demands of our customers and, in turn, our business and results of operations could be unfavorably impacted.
acquisitions, joint ventures and other transactions involve risks and we may not realize the expected benefits because of integration difficulties, underperformance relative to our expectations and other challenges.
as part of our growth strategy, we regularly consider and enter into strategic transactions, including mergers, acquisitions, joint ventures, licenses and other relationships (collectively referred to as "transactions"), with the expectation that these transactions will result in various benefits. our ability to achieve the anticipated benefits of these transactions is subject to numerous uncertainties and risks, including our ability to integrate operations, resources and systems in an efficient and effective manner. we could also face challenges in implementing business plans; changes in laws and regulations or conditions imposed by regulators applicable to the business; retaining key employees; and general competitive factors in the marketplace. these events could result in increased costs, decreases in expected revenues, earnings or cash flow, and goodwill or other intangible asset impairment charges. further, we may finance transactions by issuing common stock for some or all of the purchase price, which could dilute the ownership interests of our shareholders, or by incurring additional debt that could impact our ability to access capital in the future.
in addition, effective internal controls are necessary to provide reliable and accurate financial reports and to mitigate the risk of fraud. the integration of businesses is likely to result in our systems and internal controls becoming increasingly complex and more difficult to manage. any difficulties in assimilating businesses into our control system could cause us to fail to meet our financial reporting obligations. ineffective internal controls also could cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information, which could negatively impact the trading price of our stock and our access to capital.
our business depends on our ability to effectively invest in, implement improvements to and properly maintain the uninterrupted operation and data integrity of our information technology and other business systems.
our business is highly dependent on maintaining both effective information systems and the integrity and timeliness of the data we use to serve our customers and health care professionals and to operate our business. if our data were found to be inaccurate or unreliable due to fraud or other error, or if we or the third-party service providers were to fail to maintain information systems and data integrity effectively, we could experience operational disruptions that may impact our customers and health care professionals and hinder our ability to establish appropriate pricing for products and services, retain and attract customers, establish reserves and report financial results timely and accurately and maintain regulatory compliance, among other things.
our information technology strategy and execution are critical to our continued success. increasing regulatory and legislative mandated changes will place additional demands on our information technology infrastructure that could have a direct impact on available resources for projects more directly tied to strategic initiatives. we must continue to invest in long-term solutions that will enable us to anticipate customer needs and expectations, enhance the customer experience, act as a differentiator in the market and protect against cybersecurity risks and threats. our success is dependent, in large part, on maintaining the effectiveness of existing technology systems and continuing to deliver and enhance technology systems that support our business processes in a cost-efficient and resource-efficient manner. we also must develop new systems to meet current market standards and keep pace with continuing changes in information processing technology, evolving industry and regulatory standards and customer needs. failure to do so may impede our ability to deliver

back to contents part i item 1a. risk factors services at a competitive cost. further, because system development projects are long-term in nature, they may be more costly than expected to complete and may not deliver the expected benefits upon completion.
in addition, our business is highly dependent upon our ability to perform, in an efficient and uninterrupted fashion, necessary business functions, such as claims processing and payment, internet support and customer call centers, and processing new and renewal business. unavailability, cyber-attack or other failure of one or more of our information technology or other systems could cause slower response times, resulting in claims not being processed as quickly as clients or customers desire, decreased levels of client or customer service and satisfaction, and harm to our reputation. because our information technology and other systems interface with and depend on third-party systems, we could experience service denials if demand for such service exceeds capacity or a third-party system fails or experiences an interruption. if sustained or repeated, such business interruptions, systems failures or service denials could have material adverse effects on our business, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.
we may be subject to cyber-attacks. if we are unable to prevent or contain the effects of any such attacks, we may suffer exposure to substantial liability, reputational harm, loss of revenue or other damages.
our business depends on our clients' and customers' willingness to entrust us with their health-related and other sensitive personal information. computer systems may be vulnerable to physical break-ins, computer viruses, programming errors, attacks by third parties or similar disruptive problems. as we increase the amount of personal information that we store and share digitally, our exposure to these data security and related cybersecurity risks increases, including the risk of undetected attacks, damage, loss or unauthorized disclosure or access, and the cost of attempting to protect against these risks also increases. we have implemented security technologies, processes and procedures to protect consumer identity; however, there are no assurances that such measures will be effective against all types of breaches.
events that negatively affect that trust, including failing to keep our information technology systems and our clients' and customers' sensitive information secure from attack, damage, loss or unauthorized disclosure or access, whether as a result of our action or inaction or that of our business associates or vendors, could adversely affect our reputation, membership and revenues and also expose us to mandatory disclosure to the media, litigation and other enforcement proceedings, material fines, penalties and/or remediation costs, and compensatory, special, punitive and statutory damages, consent orders and other adverse actions, any of which could adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition or liquidity.
if we fail to comply with applicable privacy, security, and data laws, regulations and standards, our business and reputation could be materially and adversely affected.
the collection, maintenance, protection, use, transmission, disclosure and disposal of sensitive personal information are regulated at the federal, state, international and industry levels and requirements are imposed on us by contracts with customers. in some cases, such laws, rules and regulations also apply to our vendors and require us to obtain written assurances of their compliance with such requirements or may hold us liable for any violations by our vendors. international laws, rules and regulations governing the use and disclosure of such information are generally more stringent than in the united states, and they vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction.
these laws, rules and requirements are subject to change. compliance with new privacy and security laws, regulations and requirements may result in increased operating costs, and may constrain or require us to alter our business model or operations. for example, the hitech amendments to hipaa may further restrict our ability to collect, disclose and use sensitive personal information and may impose additional compliance requirements on our business. while we have prepared for the transition to icd-10, if unforeseen circumstances arise, it is possible that we could be exposed to investigations and allegations of noncompliance, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position and cash flows. in addition, if some providers continue to use icd-9 codes on claims after the final implementation date, we will have to reject such claims, leading to claim resubmissions, increased call volume and provider and customer dissatisfaction. further, providers may use icd-10 codes differently than they used icd-9 codes in the past, potentially resulting in lost revenues under risk adjustment. during the transition to icd-10, certain claims processing and payment information we have historically used to establish our reserves may not be reliable or available in a timely manner. if we do not adequately implement the new icd-10 coding set, or if providers in our network do not adequately transition to the new icd-10 coding set, our results of operations, financial position and cash flows may be materially adversely affected.
effective prevention, detection and control systems are critical to maintain regulatory compliance and prevent fraud and failure of these systems could adversely affect us.
federal and state governments have made investigating and prosecuting health care and other insurance fraud and abuse a priority. fraud and abuse prohibitions encompass a wide range of activities, including kickbacks for referral of members, billing for unnecessary medical services, improper marketing, and violations of patient privacy rights. the regulations and contractual requirements applicable to us are complex and subject to change. in addition, ongoing vigorous law enforcement, a highly technical regulatory scheme and the dodd-frank act legislation and related regulations being adopted to enhance regulators' enforcement powers and whistleblower incentives and protections mean that our compliance efforts in this area will continue to require significant resources.

back to contents part i item 1a. risk factors failure of our prevention, detection or control systems related to regulatory compliance or the failure of employees to comply with our internal policies, including data systems security or unethical conduct by managers and employees, could adversely affect our reputation and also expose us to litigation and other proceedings, fines and penalties.
in addition, provider or customer fraud that is not prevented or detected could impact our medical costs or those of our self-insured customers. further, during an economic downturn, we may experience increased fraudulent claims volume that may lead to additional costs due to an increase in disputed claims and litigation.
our pharmacy benefit management business and related operations are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties that are in addition to those we face in our health care business.
notwithstanding our pharmacy benefits management services arrangement with a third-party vendor, we remain responsible to regulators and members for the delivery of pharmacy benefits. this business is subject to federal and state regulation, including federal and state anti-remuneration laws, erisa, hipaa and laws related to the operation of internet and mail-service pharmacies. in addition, certain of our subsidiaries are pharmacies subject to state licensing and u.s. drug enforcement agency registration requirements and laws concerning labeling, packaging, advertising and adulteration of prescription drugs and dispensing of controlled substances. noncompliance with such regulations by us or our third-party vendor could have material adverse effects on our business, results of operations, financial condition, liquidity and reputation.
our pharmacy benefit management business also would be adversely affected by an inability to contract on favorable terms with pharmaceutical manufacturers and we could suffer claims and reputational harm in connection with purported errors by mail order or retail pharmacy businesses.
in operating onsite clinics and other types of medical facilities, we may be subject to additional liability that could result in significant time and expense.
in addition to contracting with physicians and other health care providers for services, we employ physicians and other health care professionals at onsite low acuity and primary care clinics that we operate for our customers, as well as certain clinics for our employees. in addition, our cigna-healthspring business operates livingwell health centers and we own and operate multispecialty health care centers, low acuity clinics and other types of centers in the phoenix, arizona metropolitan area that employ physicians and other health care professionals. as a direct employer of health care professionals and as an owner or operator of medical facilities, we are subject to liability for negligent acts, omissions, or injuries occurring at one of these clinics or caused by one of our employees. even if any claims brought against us are unsuccessful or without merit, we still have to defend against such claims. the defense of any actions may result in significant expenses that could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.
we face price competition and other pressures that could result in premiums that are insufficient to cover the cost of the health care services delivered to our members and inadequate medical claims reserves.
while health plans compete on the basis of many service and quality-related factors, we expect that price will continue to be a significant basis of competition. our client and customer contracts are subject to negotiation as clients and customers seek to contain their costs, including by reducing benefits offered or elected. alternatively, our clients and customers may purchase different types of products that are less profitable, or move to a competitor to obtain more favorable premiums. each of these events would likely negatively impact our financial results.
further, federal and state regulatory agencies may restrict our ability to implement changes in premium rates. for example, health care reform includes an annual rate review requirement to prohibit unreasonable rate increases in the individual and small group health insurance markets. fiscal concerns regarding the continued viability of programs such as medicare may cause decreasing reimbursement rates, delays in premium payments or insufficient increases in reimbursement rates for government-sponsored programs in which we participate. any limitation on our ability to maintain or increase our premium or reimbursement levels, or a significant loss of membership resulting from our need to increase or maintain premium or reimbursement levels, could adversely affect our business, cash flows, financial condition and results of operations.
in addition, factors such as business consolidations, strategic alliances, legislation and marketing practices will likely continue to create pressure to contain or otherwise restrict premium price increases, despite increasing medical costs. for example, the gramm-leach-bliley act gives banks and other financial institutions the ability to be affiliated with insurance companies. this may lead to new competitors with significant financial resources. our product margins and growth depend, in part, on our ability to compete effectively in our markets, set rates appropriately in highly competitive markets to keep or increase our market share, increase membership as planned, and avoid losing accounts with favorable medical cost experience while retaining or increasing membership in accounts with unfavorable medical cost experience.
premiums in the health care business are generally set for one-year periods, based on our estimate of future health care costs over such period. actual costs may exceed what we estimate and charge in premiums due to factors such as medical cost inflation, higher than expected utilization of medical services, new or costly treatments and technology, and membership mix. our health care costs also are affected by external events that we cannot forecast or project and over which we have little or no control, such as influenza-related health care costs, epidemics, pandemics, terrorist attacks or other man-made disasters, natural disasters or other events that materially increase utilization of medical and/or other covered services, as well as changes in members' health care utilization patterns and provider billing practices. our profitability depends, in part, on our ability to accurately predict and control future health care costs through

back to contents part i item 1a. risk factors underwriting criteria, provider contracting, utilization management and product design.
we record medical claims reserves on our balance sheet for estimated future payments. while we continually review estimates of future payments relating to medical claims costs for services incurred in the current and prior periods and make adjustments to our reserves, the actual health care costs may exceed the reserves we have recorded.
significant stock market or interest rate declines could result in additional unfunded pension obligations, resulting in the need for additional plan funding by us and increased pension expenses.
we currently have unfunded obligations in our frozen pension plans. a significant decline in the value of the plans' equity and fixed income investments or unfavorable changes in applicable laws or regulations could materially increase our expenses and change the timing and amount of required plan funding. this could reduce the cash available to us, including our subsidiaries. we also are exposed to interest rate and equity risk associated with our pension and other post-retirement obligations. sustained declines in interest rates could have an adverse impact on the funded status of our pension plans and our reinvestment yield on new investments. see note 9 to our consolidated financial statements for more information on our obligations under the pension plan.
significant changes in market interest rates affect the value of our financial instruments that promise a fixed return or benefit and the value of particular assets and liabilities.
as an insurer, we have substantial investment assets that support insurance and contractholder deposit liabilities. generally low levels of interest rates on investments, such as those experienced in u.s. and foreign financial markets during recent years, have negatively impacted our level of investment income earned in recent periods.
substantially all of our investment assets are in fixed interest-yielding debt securities of varying maturities, fixed redeemable preferred securities and commercial mortgage loans. the value of these investment assets can fluctuate significantly with changes in market conditions. a rise in interest rates would likely reduce the value of our investment portfolio and increase interest expense if we were to access our available lines of credit.
a downgrade in the financial strength ratings of our insurance subsidiaries could adversely affect new sales and retention of current business, and a downgrade in our debt ratings would increase the cost of borrowed funds and negatively affect our ability to access capital.
financial strength, claims paying ability and debt ratings by recognized rating organizations are each important factors in establishing the competitive position of insurance and health benefits companies. ratings information by nationally recognized ratings agencies is broadly disseminated and generally used throughout the industry. we believe that the claims paying ability and financial strength ratings of our principal insurance subsidiaries are important factors in marketing our products to certain customers. our debt ratings impact both the cost and availability of future borrowings, and accordingly, our cost of capital. each of the rating agencies reviews ratings periodically and there can be no assurance that current ratings will be maintained in the future. a downgrade of these ratings in the future could make it more difficult to either market our products successfully or raise capital to support business growth within our insurance subsidiaries.
global market, economic and geopolitical conditions may cause fluctuations in equity market prices, interest rates and credit spreads that could impact our ability to raise or deploy capital and affect our overall liquidity.
if the equity and credit markets experience extreme volatility and disruption, there could be downward pressure on stock prices and credit capacity for certain issuers without regard to those issuers' underlying financial strength. extreme disruption in the credit markets could adversely impact our availability and cost of credit in the future. in addition, unpredictable or unstable market conditions or continued pressure in the global or u.s. economy could result in reduced opportunities to find suitable opportunities to raise capital.
as of december 31, 2014, our outstanding long-term debt totaled $5.0 billion. in the event of adverse economic and industry conditions, we may be required to dedicate a greater percentage of our cash flow from operations to the payment of principal and interest on our debt, thereby reducing the funds we have available for other purposes, such as investments in ongoing businesses, acquisitions, dividends and stock repurchases. in these circumstances, our ability to execute our strategy may be limited, our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in business and market conditions may be reduced, or our access to capital markets may be limited such that additional capital may not be available or may be available only on unfavorable terms.
unfavorable developments in economic conditions may adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.
global economic conditions continue to be challenging. many factors, including geopolitical issues, confidence in any economic recoveries and any future economic downturns, availability and cost of credit and other capital and consumer spending, can negatively impact expectations for the u.s. and global economies. our results of operations could be materially and adversely affected by the impact of unfavorable economic conditions on our customers (both employers and individuals), health care providers and third-party vendors. for example:

employers may take action to reduce their operating costs by modifying, delaying or canceling plans to purchase our products or making changes in the mix of products purchased that are unfavorable to us.

back to contents part i item 1a. risk factors

higher unemployment rates and workforce reductions could result in lower enrollment in our employer-based plans (including an increase in the number of employees who opt out of employer-based plans) or our individual plans.

because of unfavorable economic conditions or health care reform, employers may stop offering health care coverage to employees or elect to offer this coverage on a voluntary, employee-funded basis as a means to reduce their operating costs.

our historical disability claim experience and industry data indicate that submitted disability claims rise under adverse economic conditions.

if customers are not successful in generating sufficient profits or are precluded from securing financing, they may not be able to pay, or may delay payment of, accounts receivable that are owed to us.

our customers or potential customers may force us to compete more vigorously on factors such as price and service to retain or obtain their business.

a prolonged unfavorable economic environment could adversely impact the financial position of hospitals and other health care providers, potentially increasing our medical costs as these providers attempt to maintain revenue levels in their efforts to adjust to their own economic challenges.

our third-party vendors could significantly and quickly increase their prices or reduce their output to reduce their operating costs. our business depends on our ability to perform necessary business functions in an efficient and uninterrupted fashion.
these factors could lead to a decrease in our customer base, revenues or margins and/or an increase in our operating costs.
in addition, during a prolonged unfavorable economic environment, state and federal budgets could be materially and adversely affected, resulting in reduced reimbursements or payments in state and federal government programs, such as medicare and social security. these state and federal budgetary pressures also could cause the government to impose new or a higher level of taxes or assessments on us, such as premium taxes on insurance companies and hmos and surcharges or fees on select fee-for-service and capitated medical claims. although we could attempt to mitigate or cover our exposure from such increased costs through, among other things, increases in premiums, there can be no assurance that we will be able to mitigate or cover all of such costs, which may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.
we are subject to the credit risk of our reinsurers.
we enter into reinsurance arrangements with other insurance companies, primarily to limit losses from large exposures or to permit recovery of a portion of direct losses. we also may enter into reinsurance arrangements in connection with acquisition or divestiture transactions when the underwriting company is not being acquired or sold.
under all reinsurance arrangements, reinsurers assume insured losses, subject to certain limitations or exceptions that may include a loss limit. these arrangements also subject us to various obligations, representations and warranties with the reinsurers. reinsurance does not relieve us of liability as the originating insurer. we remain liable to the underlying policyholders if a reinsurer defaults on obligations under the reinsurance arrangement. although we regularly evaluate the financial condition of reinsurers to minimize exposure to significant losses from reinsurer insolvencies, reinsurers may become financially unsound. if a reinsurer fails to meet its obligations under the reinsurance contract or if the liabilities exceed any applicable loss limit, we will be forced to cover the claims on the reinsured policies.
the collectability of amounts due from reinsurers is subject to uncertainty arising from a number of factors, including whether the insured losses meet the qualifying conditions of the reinsurance contract, whether reinsurers or their affiliates have the financial capacity and willingness to make payments under the terms of the reinsurance contract, and the magnitude and type of collateral supporting our reinsurance recoverable, such as by holding sufficient qualifying assets in trusts or letters of credit issued. although a portion of our reinsurance exposures are secured, the inability to collect a material recovery from a reinsurer could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.

management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations ("md&a") is intended to provide information to assist you in better understanding and evaluating our financial condition and results of operations. we encourage you to read this md&a in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements included in part ii, item 8 of this annual report on form 10-k and the "risk factors" contained in part i item 1a of this annual report on form 10-k ("form 10-k").
unless otherwise indicated, financial information in the md&a is presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america ("gaap"). see note 2 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding the company's significant accounting policies. we measure the financial results of our segments using "segment earnings (loss)", defined as shareholders' net income (loss) before after-tax realized investment results. in this md&a, we also present information using adjusted income from operations on both a consolidated and segment basis. adjusted income (loss) from operations is another measure of profitability used by our management because it presents the underlying results of operations of our businesses and permits analysis of trends in underlying revenue, expenses and shareholders' net income. adjusted income (loss) from operations is defined as segment earnings (loss) excluding special items (described in the table on page 36 of this form 10-k) and results of the gmib business. this measure is not determined in accordance with gaap and should not be viewed as a substitute for the most directly comparable gaap measures, which are shareholders' net income on a consolidated basis and segment earnings (loss) on a segment basis. we exclude special items because management does not believe they are representative of our underlying results of operations. we also exclude the results of the gmib business because, prior to february 4, 2013, the changes in the fair value of gmib assets and liabilities were volatile and unpredictable. in some of our financial tables in this md&a, we present either percentage changes or "n/m" when those changes are so large as to become not meaningful, and changes in percentages are expressed in basis points ("bps").
overview cigna corporation, together with its subsidiaries (either individually or collectively referred to as "cigna," the "company," "we," "our" or "us") is a global health services organization dedicated to a mission of helping individuals improve their health, well-being and sense of security. to execute on our mission, cigna's strategy is to "go deep", "go global" and "go individual" with a differentiated set of medical, dental, disability, life and accident insurance and related products and services offered by our subsidiaries.
for further information on our business and strategy, please see item 1, "business" in this form 10-k.
our segments as explained in note 22 to the consolidated financial statements, effective with the first quarter of 2014, we began combining the results of our run-off reinsurance business with other immaterial operating segments in other operations for segment reporting purposes. prior year segment information has been conformed to the current year presentation.

back to contents part ii item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations we present the financial results of our businesses in the following three reportable segments:
segment                                    % of revenues               description global health care                         78%                         aggregates the commercial and government operating segments:
commercial
                                                                                       encompasses both our u.s. commercial and certain international health care businesses.
                                                                                       serves employers and their employees, including globally mobile individuals, and other groups (e.g., governmental and non-governmental organizations, unions and associations). in addition, our u.s.
commercial health care business also serves individuals.
                                                                                       offers insured and self-insured medical, dental, behavioral health, vision, and prescription drug benefit plans, health advocacy programs and other products and services that may be integrated as part of a comprehensive global health care benefit program.
government
                                                                                       offers medicare advantage, medicare part d and medicaid plans.
global supplemental benefits               9%                          offers supplemental health, life and accident insurance products in selected international markets and the u.s.
group disability and life                  11%                         offers group long-term and short-term disability, group life, accident and specialty insurance products and related services.
we present the remainder of our segment results in other operations, consisting of the corporate-owned life insurance business ("coli"), run-off reinsurance and settlement annuity businesses and deferred gains associated with the sales of the individual life insurance and annuity and retirement benefits businesses.
key transactions and other significant items the following is a summary of key transactions and other significant items since january 1, 2012 affecting period-to-period comparisons of our results.
run-off reinsurance transaction.    prior to february 4, 2013, our run-off reinsurance business had significant exposures, primarily from our guaranteed minimum death benefits ("gmdb" also known as "vadbe") and guaranteed minimum income benefits ("gmib") businesses. effective february 4, 2013, we entered into an agreement with berkshire to reinsure future exposures for this business, net of existing retrocessional arrangements, up to a specified limit, for a payment of $2.2 billion. the reinsurance transaction aligned with our strategy of increasing financial flexibility by accomplishing an effective exit from the gmdb and gmib businesses. as a result of this transaction, we recorded an after-tax charge of $507 million in the first quarter of 2013 that was reported as a special item. see note 7 to the consolidated financial statements and the other operations section of this md&a for additional information.
pharmacy benefit management ("pbm") services agreement.    in june 2013, we entered into a 10-year pharmacy benefit management services agreement with catamaran corporation. under this agreement, we utilize their technology and service platforms, retail network contracting and claims processing services. in the second quarter of 2013, we recorded one-time transaction costs of $37 million pre-tax ($24 million after-tax) that were reported as a special item. this arrangement has produced a positive contribution to earnings in 2014 through improved clinical management, purchasing and administrative efficiencies.
organizational efficiency plans.    we regularly evaluate ways to deliver our products and services more efficiently and at a lower cost. during 2013 and 2012, we adopted specific plans to increase our organizational efficiency, resulting in a charge of $60 million pre-tax ($40 million after-tax) in 2013 and $77 million pre-tax ($50 million after-tax in 2012. see note 6 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.

back to contents part ii item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations with the terms of the agreement upon re-examination, we may be subject to additional fines or penalties. in addition to the monitoring states, most other jurisdictions have joined the agreement as participating, non-monitoring states.
health care industry developments health care reform and the implementing regulations have resulted in broad changes that are meaningfully impacting the industry, including relationships with customers and health care providers, the design of products and services, and pricing and delivery systems. in 2013, the industry saw government-prescribed reductions to medicare reimbursement rates (i.e., sequestration), ongoing payment reductions for medicare advantage plans by the centers for medicare and medicaid services ("cms") and changes in requirements associated with operational and performance metrics used to determine medicare advantage payments and benefits. for 2014, there have been further changes resulting from health care reform and the implementing regulations including public exchanges, a non-deductible industry tax in addition to fees and assessments, and minimum medical loss ratio requirements for medicare advantage and medicare part d plans. collectively, these changes have had a significant impact on our business and customers, requiring adjustments to our business model to mitigate their effects on our results of operations and cash flows.
the "regulation" section of this form 10-k provides a detailed and up-to-date description of health care reform provisions and other legislative initiatives that impact our domestic health care business, including regulations issued by cms and the departments of the treasury and health and human services ("hhs"). the table presented below provides a summary of the financial impacts of key provisions of health care reform in 2014 and beyond.
item                                                                  description medicare advantage ("ma") and part d program impacts                  sequestration: as a result of sequestration, federal government reimbursement rates for ma and part d were lowered by 2% beginning april 1, 2013. this program is expected to
 sequestration  ma rates  medical loss ratio (ma and               run through 2023. while these rate reductions significantly impact our government operating segment, their overall effect on consolidated net income and cash flows was immaterial in 2013 and 2014 and is expected to continue to be immaterial.
part d)                                                               ma rates: in april 2014, cms published its notice of final federal government reimbursement rates for calendar year 2015. based on industry data, overall ma rates for 2015 are expected to be
2% lower than 2014 for ma carriers. assuming a similar book of business to 2014, we would expect a 2% rate decrease to lower full-year 2015 ma premiums by approximately $100 million. we do not expect these lower rates to have a significant impact on our 2015 net income or cash flows based on our 2015 bid submissions that included adjustments to our programs and services to reflect the 2015 rates.
the 2014 federal government reimbursement rates established by cms included a variety of payment reductions to medicare plans. overall, these rates were reduced by approximately 6% compared with 2013. assuming a similar book of business to 2013, we estimated this rate decrease would lower full-year 2014 ma premiums by approximately $300 million. in 2014, premium decreases related to the cms rate reductions have been partially mitigated through changes in member risk scores and customer enrollment mix (in total, and by county).
these rate reductions, together with the impact of the health insurance industry tax, have negatively impacted margins for the government operating segment.
medical loss ratio ("mlr"): beginning in 2014, if our mlr for ma or part d business is less than the required 85% minimum, we will be required to pay a rebate to cms. the effect of these mlr rebates was not material to our results of operations or cash flows in 2014.

back to contents part ii item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations item                                            description health care reform taxes and fees               health insurance industry tax: see note 2 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information. in 2014, we recognized $238 million in operating expenses for the
 industry tax                                  industry tax. because this tax is not deductible for federal income tax purposes, our effective tax rate increased in 2014, both on a consolidated basis and for the global health care segment. of the full-year tax, $134 million relates to our commercial business and the remaining $104 million relates to our medicare business. for our commercial business, we incorporated the 2014 fees into our targeted pricing actions. for our medicare business, although we have partially mitigated the effect of the tax through benefit changes and customer premium increases, the combination of the tax and lower ma rates in 2014 have contributed to lower margins in the government operating segment in 2014. see the consolidated results of operations and global health care segment sections of this md&amp;a for further discussion.
 reinsurance fee                               reinsurance fee: this fee is a fixed dollar per customer levy that applies to insurers and self-insured major medical plans excluding medicare advantage and medicare part d products. proceeds from the fee will be used to fund the reinsurance program for non-grandfathered individual business sold either on or off the public exchanges beginning in
2014. for our insured business, the amount of the fee is approximately $110 million in 2014 and is tax deductible. we incorporated the 2014 fees into our targeted pricing actions. see the global health care section of this md&amp;a for further discussion.
public health exchanges                         public health exchanges: for 2014, we offered individual coverage on five public health insurance exchanges (arizona, colorado, florida, tennessee and texas). beginning in 2015, in addition to those five states, we began offering coverage on exchanges in maryland, georgia and missouri. see the global health care segment section of this md&amp;a for further discussion around the results from our individual business.
risk mitigation programs                        risk mitigation programs: see note 2 to the consolidated financial statements for a description of these programs that commenced on january 1, 2014 along with our accounting policy. we recorded receivables of approximately $200 million after-tax in 2014 related to these programs.
commercial mlr                                  commercial mlr: the effect of the commercial mlr rebate accrual was not material to our results of operations or cash flows in 2014.

back to contents part ii item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations consolidated results of operations: 2014 compared to 2013 and 2013 compared to 2012

revenues: the components of revenue changes are discussed further below:   
premiums. the increase in 2014 compared with 2013 reflects premium growth in each of our ongoing reporting segments: global health care, global supplemental benefits and group disability and life. these results are primarily attributable to rate increases to recover both medical cost trend and new taxes and fees assessed under health care reform. business growth in certain of our market segments and products, including u.s. commercial individual, stop loss and medicaid also contributed to the increase. the increase in 2013 compared with 2012 was driven primarily by continued customer growth in targeted markets of all of the ongoing segments, and, to a lesser extent, acquisitions in late 2012 in the global supplemental benefits segment.

fees and other revenues. the increase in 2014 compared with 2013 largely resulted from growth in specialty contributions, including pharmacy and cost containment. for 2013, the growth in fees and other revenues over 2012 was due to customer growth as well as increased specialty contributions. fees and other revenues also included pre-tax losses of $39 million in 2013 and $119 million in 2012 attributable to the hedge program associated with the gmdb and gmib businesses prior to the reinsurance transaction with berkshire in 2013.

net investment income. in 2014, net investment income was flat compared with 2013, reflecting higher average investment assets offset by lower yields. the slight increase in 2013, compared with 2012, was primarily due to higher yields driven in part by higher partnership income, partially offset by lower average investment assets primarily due to sales of assets to fund the reinsurance transaction with berkshire.

mail order pharmacy revenues. increases in each of 2014 and 2013 compared with the prior year, primarily reflected higher prescription volume for specialty medications (injectibles) and price increases to recover pharmacy cost trend.

realized investment results. in 2014, realized investment results decreased compared with 2013, primarily due to significantly lower gains on sales of fixed maturities that were partially offset by a gain on the sale of an equity interest in 2014. the significant increase in 2013, compared with 2012, primarily resulted from gains on the sales of real estate joint ventures and higher gains on sales of fixed maturities. in the first quarter of 2013, we realized large gains on sales of fixed maturities primarily to fund the reinsurance transaction with berkshire. see note 14 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.

global health care medical claims expense. see the global health care section of this md&a for further discussion.

other benefit expenses. the decrease in other benefit expenses in 2014 compared with 2013 resulted from the absence of the charges recorded in the first quarter of 2013 associated with the reinsurance agreement with berkshire ($727 million pre-tax), partially offset by continued business growth in the global supplemental and group disability and life segments. in 2013, the increase compared with 2012 reflected the charges recorded in the first quarter of 2013 associated with the reinsurance agreement with berkshire and, to a lesser extent, continued business growth in the global supplemental and group disability and life segments.

mail order pharmacy costs. the increases in both 2014 and 2013 are due to volume increases for specialty medications (injectibles) and higher unit costs.

other operating expenses. in 2014, the increase in other operating expenses over 2013 was largely driven by new taxes and fees assessed under health care reform and business growth in all of our ongoing segments. the increase in 2013 compared with 2012 was due primarily to business growth in all of our ongoing segments. see the segment reporting section of this md&a for additional discussion of operating expenses.

shareholders' net income. for 2014, the significant increase in shareholders' net income compared with 2013 is largely due to the absence of the $507 million after-tax charge associated with the reinsurance agreement with berkshire recorded in the first quarter of 2013. the decrease in shareholders' net income in 2013, compared with 2012 was also driven by this after-tax charge, partially offset by an increase in adjusted income from operations.

adjusted income from operations. in 2014, the increase in adjusted income from operations compared with 2013 was largely driven by higher earnings in our ongoing business segments (global health care, global supplemental benefits, and group disability and life), partially offset by higher taxes in corporate related to health care reform and the absence of favorable tax benefits recorded in the third quarter of 2013. the increase in adjusted income from operations in 2013 compared with 2012 was largely attributable to earnings growth in all of our ongoing business segments (global health care, global supplemental benefits, and group disability and life). see the segment discussions later in this md&a for further information.

consolidated effective tax rate. the increase in the consolidated effective tax rate in 2014, compared with 2013, was primarily driven by the non-deductible health insurance industry tax first assessed under health care reform in 2014. the consolidated effective tax rate decreased in 2013, compared with 2012, primarily driven by favorable tax benefits reported in the third quarter of 2013. see note 19 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.

global medical customers (excluding limited benefits). we exited the limited benefits business in 2014 as required by health care reform. excluding limited benefits customers, our medical customer base increased in both 2014 and 2013 compared with comparable prior years, primarily driven by continued growth in our targeted market segments.

shareholders' equity              $10,774         $10,567          $9,769
consolidated short-term investments decreased in 2014 compared with 2013 as a result of the company reinvesting proceeds from maturities of short-term investments in longer-term holdings. the increase in short-term investments in 2013 compared with 2012 was driven by purchases of liquid commercial paper and united states government obligations.
liquidity we maintain liquidity at two levels: the subsidiary level and the parent company level.
liquidity requirements at the subsidiary level generally consist of:

claim and benefit payments to policyholders; and

operating expense requirements, primarily for employee compensation and benefits, information technology and real estate.
our subsidiaries normally meet their operating requirements by:

maintaining appropriate levels of cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments;

using cash flows from operating activities;

selling investments;

matching investment durations to those estimated for the related insurance and contractholder liabilities; and

borrowing from the parent company.
liquidity requirements at the parent company level generally consist of:

debt service and dividend payments to shareholders; and

pension plan funding.
the parent company normally meets its liquidity requirements by:

maintaining appropriate levels of cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments;

collecting dividends from its subsidiaries;

using proceeds from issuance of debt (including commercial paper) and equity securities; and

borrowing from its subsidiaries.
cash flows for the years ended december 31, were as follows:
(in millions)                                             2014              2013            2012
net cash provided by operating activities                 $1,994            $719            $2,350
net cash provided by (used in) investing activities       $(1,755)          $15             $(3,857)
net cash used in financing activities                     $(1,582)          $(930)          $(228)
cash flows from operating activities consist of cash receipts and disbursements for premiums and fees, mail order pharmacy, other revenues, investment income, taxes, benefits and expenses, and, prior to february 4, 2013, gains and losses recognized in connection with our gmdb and gmib equity hedge programs. because certain income and expense transactions do not generate cash, and because cash transactions related to revenues and expenses may occur in periods different from when those revenues and expenses are recognized in shareholders' net income, cash flows from operating activities can be significantly different from shareholders' net income.
cash flows from investing activities generally consist of net investment purchases or sales and net purchases of property and equipment including capitalized software, as well as cash used to acquire businesses.
cash flows from financing activities are generally comprised of issuances and re-payment of debt at the parent company level, proceeds on the issuance of common stock resulting from stock option exercises, and stock repurchases. in addition, the subsidiaries report deposits to and withdrawals from investment contract liabilities (including universal life insurance liabilities) because such liabilities are considered financing activities with policyholders.
operating activities cash flows from operating activities increased substantially in 2014 compared with 2013, primarily due to the absence of the 2013 reinsurance payments totaling $2.2 billion to berkshire. excluding those payments and tax benefits realized in connection with the berkshire transaction, cash flows from operating activities in 2014 decreased by $0.6 billion, compared with 2013. this decrease was primarily related to the volume and timing of reimbursements prescribed by government programs.

part ii item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations cash provided by operating activities declined by $1.6 billion in 2013 compared with 2012 primarily due to reinsurance payments totaling $2.2 billion made in 2013 to berkshire.
investing activities cash flows from investing activities decreased by $1.8 billion in 2014 compared with 2013, primarily due to higher net purchases of fixed maturities. in 2013, net purchases of fixed maturities were lower than 2014 primarily due to funding the berkshire transaction. cash flows from investing activities increased by $3.9 billion in 2013 compared with 2012 primarily driven by the absence of 2012 payments to acquire healthspring.
financing activities cash used in financing activities increased in 2014 compared with the same period in 2013, primarily reflecting $0.6 billion in higher repurchases of common stock. cash used in financing activities in 2013 increased by $0.7 billion compared with 2012 primarily due to higher repurchases of common stock.
share repurchase we maintain a share repurchase program that was authorized by our board of directors. the decision to repurchase shares depends on market conditions and alternate uses of capital. we have repurchased, and may continue to repurchase, shares on the open market through a rule 10b5-1 plan that permits a company to repurchase its shares at times when it otherwise might be precluded from doing so under insider trading laws or because of self-imposed trading blackout periods. we suspend activity under this program from time to time and also remove such suspensions, generally without public announcement.
in 2014, we repurchased 18.5 million shares for $1.6 billion. from january 1, 2015 through february 25, 2015 we repurchased 1.9 million shares for $217 million. on february 25, 2015, the company's board of directors increased share repurchase authority by $500 million. accordingly, the total remaining share repurchase authorization as of february 25, 2015 was $966 million. in 2013, the company repurchased 13.6 million shares for $1.0 billion and, in 2012, we repurchased 4.4 million shares for $208 million.
interest expense interest expense on long-term debt, short-term debt and capital leases was as follows:

interest expense       $265          $270          $268
the weighted average interest rate for outstanding short-term debt (primarily commercial paper) was 0.27% at december 31, 2014 and 0.41% at december 31, 2013.
capital resources our capital resources (primarily retained earnings and proceeds from the issuance of debt and equity securities) provide protection for policyholders, furnish the financial strength to underwrite insurance risks and facilitate continued business growth.
management, guided by regulatory requirements and rating agency capital guidelines, determines the amount of capital resources that we maintain. management allocates resources to new long-term business commitments when returns, considering the risks, look promising and when the resources available to support existing business are adequate.
we prioritize our use of capital resources to:

provide the capital necessary to support growth and maintain or improve the financial strength ratings of subsidiaries;

consider acquisitions that are strategically and economically advantageous; and

return capital to investors through share repurchase.
the availability of capital resources will be impacted by equity and credit market conditions. extreme volatility in credit or equity market conditions may reduce our ability to issue debt or equity securities.
liquidity and capital resources outlook at december 31, 2014, there was approximately $400 million in cash and short-term investments available at the parent company level. in 2015, the parent company's combined cash obligations are expected to be approximately $380 million to pay for commercial paper maturities, interest, dividends and required pension contributions.
we expect, based on the parent company's current cash position, current projections for subsidiary dividends, and the ability to refinance its commercial paper borrowing, to have sufficient liquidity to meet the obligations discussed above.

back to contents part ii item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations agreement was available to us. within the maximum debt leverage covenant in the line of credit agreement, we have $6.5 billion of borrowing capacity in addition to the $5.2 billion of debt outstanding.
though we believe we have adequate sources of liquidity, continued significant disruption or volatility in the capital and credit markets could affect our ability to access those markets for additional borrowings or increase costs associated with borrowing funds.
we maintain a capital management strategy to retain overseas a significant portion of the earnings from our foreign operations. these undistributed earnings are deployed outside of the u.s. in support of the liquidity and capital needs of our foreign operations. as of december 31, 2014 undistributed earnings were approximately $1.8 billion. approximately $15 million of cash and cash equivalents held overseas would, if repatriated, be subject to a charge representing the difference between the u.s. and foreign tax rates. this strategy does not materially limit our ability to meet our liquidity and capital needs in the united states. cash and cash equivalents in foreign operations are held primarily to meet local liquidity and surplus needs with excess funds generally invested in longer duration, high quality securities.
unfunded pension plan liability.    as of december 31, 2014, our unfunded pension liability was $1.1 billion, reflecting an increase of approximately $0.5 billion from december 31, 2013. the year over year increase in the unfunded liability reflected $0.6 billion in higher projected benefit obligations primarily as a result of a decrease of 75 basis points in the assumed discount rate, and changes to our mortality assumptions based on an updated pension mortality table. these impacts were partially offset by $0.1 billion in asset growth driven by pension contributions and strong asset returns. in 2015, we do not expect to make pension contributions in excess of the $5 million minimum required under the pension protection act of 2006. see note 9 for additional information regarding our pension plans.
solvency ii.    our businesses in the european union will be subject to the directive on insurance regulation, solvency and governance requirements known as solvency ii. this directive will impose economic risk-based solvency and governance requirements and supervisory rules and becomes effective in 2016, although certain eu country regulators are requiring companies to demonstrate technical capability and comply with increased capital levels in advance of this effective date. our european insurance companies are capitalized at levels consistent with projected solvency ii requirements and in compliance with anticipated governance and technical capability requirements.
guarantees and contractual obligations we are contingently liable for various contractual obligations entered into in the ordinary course of business. the maturities of our primary contractual cash obligations, as of december 31, 2014, are estimated to be as follows:

insurance liabilities.  contractual cash obligations for insurance liabilities, excluding unearned premiums, represent estimated net benefit payments for health, life and disability insurance policies and annuity contracts. recorded contractholder deposit funds reflect current fund balances primarily from universal life customers. contractual cash obligations for these universal life contracts are estimated by projecting future payments using assumptions for lapse, withdrawal and mortality. these projected future payments include estimated future interest crediting on current fund balances based on current investment yields less the estimated cost of insurance charges and mortality and administrative fees. actual obligations in any single year will vary based on actual morbidity, mortality, lapse, withdrawal, investment and premium experience. the sum of the obligations presented above exceeds the corresponding insurance and contractholder liabilities of $20 billion recorded on the balance sheet because the recorded insurance liabilities reflect discounting for interest and the recorded

other long-term liabilities.  this table includes estimated payments for gmib contracts, pension and other postretirement and postemployment benefit obligations, supplemental and deferred compensation plans, interest rate and foreign currency swap contracts, and certain tax and reinsurance liabilities. these items are presented in accounts payable, accrued expenses and other liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets.
estimated payments of $76 million for deferred compensation, non-qualified and international pension plans and other postretirement and postemployment benefit plans are expected to be paid in less than one year. our best estimate is that contributions to the qualified domestic pension plans during 2015 will be approximately $5 million. we expect to make payments subsequent to 2015 for these obligations, however subsequent payments have been excluded from the table as their timing is based on plan assumptions that may materially differ from actual activities. see note 9 to the consolidated financial statements for further information on pension and other postretirement benefit obligations.
the above table also does not contain $26 million of liabilities for uncertain tax positions because we cannot reasonably estimate the timing of their resolution with the respective taxing authorities. see note 19 to the consolidated financial statements for the year ended december 31, 2014 for further information.

part ii item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations critical accounting estimates the preparation of consolidated financial statements in accordance with gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts and related disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. management considers an accounting estimate to be critical if:

it requires assumptions to be made that were uncertain at the time the estimate was made; and

changes in the estimate or different estimates that could have been selected could have a material effect on our consolidated results of operations or financial condition.
management has discussed the development and selection of its critical accounting estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors and the audit committee has reviewed the disclosures presented below.
in addition to the estimates presented in the following table, there are other accounting estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements, including estimates of liabilities for future policy benefits, as well as estimates with respect to unpaid claims and claim expenses, postemployment and postretirement benefits other than pensions, certain compensation accruals, and income taxes.
management believes the current assumptions used to estimate amounts reflected in our consolidated financial statements are appropriate. however, if actual experience differs from the assumptions used in estimating amounts reflected in our consolidated financial statements, the resulting changes could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations and, in certain situations, could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity and financial condition.

requires management judgment. the degree of judgment involved generally correlates to the level of pricing readily observable in the markets. financial instruments with quoted prices in active markets or with market observable inputs to determine fair value, such as public securities, generally require less judgment. conversely, private placements including more complex securities that are traded infrequently are typically measured using pricing models that require more judgment as to the inputs and assumptions used to estimate fair value. there may be a number of alternative inputs to select, based on an understanding of the issuer, the structure of the security and overall market conditions. in addition, these factors are inherently variable in nature as they change frequently in response to market conditions. approximately two-thirds of our fixed maturities are public securities, and one-third are private placement securities. see note 10 to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of our fair value measurements and the procedures performed by management to determine that the amounts represent appropriate estimates.

excluding the special items reported in 2013, segment earnings and adjusted income from operations increased in 2014, compared with 2013. this growth was primarily driven by increased specialty contributions, including strong pharmacy results, partially offset by lower earnings in our government segment primarily due to taxes and fees mandated by health care reform and a higher medical care ratio in our medicare part d business. in addition, results include the impact of higher operating expenses reflecting investment spending to enhance our capabilities, and lower margins in our u.s. commercial group risk business, including our exit from the limited benefits business. results in the u.s. commercial individual business (after considering receivables from the government risk mitigation programs) were flat.
earnings discussion: 2013 compared to 2012
the increase in global health care's segment earnings and adjusted income from operations in 2013, compared with 2012, reflected revenue growth from a higher customer base and rate increases consistent with underlying medical cost trends. results in 2013 also benefited from increased specialty contributions and higher net investment income.
these favorable effects were partially offset by a higher mcr in medicare advantage in 2013 driven by lower per member government reimbursements and higher inpatient and outpatient medical costs. in 2013, results also included higher operating expenses associated with customer growth and enhancements to our capabilities, partially offset by operating cost efficiencies.

premiums. the increase in 2014 compared with 2013 was primarily driven by rate increases on most products in the commercial segment to recover underlying medical cost trends and taxes and fees mandated by health care reform. in addition, premiums reflect customer growth in our u.s. commercial individual business, as well as in targeted markets for stop loss and medicaid products. these increases were partially offset by a decline in group commercial risk customers including a shift from our insured to self-insured products and our exit from the limited benefits business.
premiums increased in 2013, compared with 2012, in the u.s. commercial segment due to customer growth and rate increases consistent with underlying medical cost trends. in addition, medicare advantage premiums were higher due to timing of the healthspring acquisition and customer growth.
fees and other revenues. the increase in 2014, compared with 2013, largely resulted from growth in specialty contributions, including pharmacy and cost containment. in 2013, the growth in fees and other revenues compared to 2012 was due to customer growth as well as increased cost containment revenues.
net investment income. the increases in both 2014 and 2013, compared with each prior year, were due to higher assets and higher income from partnership investments, with the 2014 increase partially offset by lower yields.

part ii item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations medical claims expense. the 5% increase in 2014 compared with 2013 primarily reflects medical cost inflation and customer growth, partially offset by our exit from the limited benefits business.
medical claims expense increased 12% in 2013 compared with 2012, primarily due to medical cost inflation, the timing of the healthspring acquisition, and customer growth. higher medicare advantage inpatient and outpatient medical costs also contributed to the increase.
the guaranteed cost medical care ratio increased slightly in 2014, compared with 2013, due to a higher medical care ratio in the u.s. individual business and the exit from the limited benefits business, offset by rate increases to cover new taxes and fees mandated by health care reform.
the medicare advantage medical care ratio decreased in 2014, compared to 2013, reflecting improved per-customer revenues. the ratio increased in 2013, compared with 2012, driven by lower government reimbursement rates as well as higher medical costs.
the medicare part d medical care ratio increased in 2014, compared with 2013, primarily due to higher pharmacy costs including some impact from the mix and channel of customer drug purchases as well as increased specialty medication costs.
operating expenses. operating expenses increased 8% in 2014 compared with 2013. excluding the 2013 special items and the health care reform taxes and fees that became effective in 2014, operating expenses increased 3% in 2014 compared with 2013. the increase primarily reflects higher volume-related expenses and greater spending to enhance our capabilities, partially offset by cost efficiencies.
operating expenses increased 5% in 2013 compared with 2012, primarily reflecting customer growth, increased spending to enhance our capabilities, including costs associated with our new pbm arrangement, and the timing of the healthspring acquisition, partially offset by cost efficiencies.
the operating expense ratios, both including and excluding special items, are essentially flat in 2014, compared with 2013. excluding the health care reform taxes and fees that became effective in 2014, the operating expense ratios decreased in 2014 compared with 2013, reflecting cost efficiencies and higher revenue, partially offset by higher spending to enhance our capabilities.
the operating expense ratios including and excluding special items decreased in 2013, compared with 2012, primarily driven by revenue growth and cost efficiencies partially offset by higher spending to enhance our capabilities, including 2013 costs associated with our new pbm arrangement.
effective tax rates. the increase in the segment's effective tax rate in 2014 compared with 2013 was attributable to the 2014 health insurance industry tax that is not tax deductible. the slight decline in the effective tax rate in 2013 compared with 2012 primarily reflected the recognition of tax benefits in certain of the segment's foreign operations.
other items affecting health care results global health care medical claims payable medical claims payable increased 6% in 2014 compared with 2013, primarily driven by growth in the individual and stop loss books of business. medical claims payable increased 10% in 2013 compared with 2012, primarily reflecting growth in the stop loss and healthspring books of business.

2013 and 2012 exclude limited benefits customers.
as required by health care reform, we exited the limited benefits business effective december 31, 2013. excluding this impact, our medical customer base increased 3% in 2014, primarily driven by continued growth in the middle market, select, individual, and government market segments, partially offset by a decline in the national market segment.
excluding limited benefits customers, medical customers increased 2% in 2013 compared to 2012, primarily reflecting continued aso customer growth due to strong retention and sales in targeted market segments.
global supplemental benefits segment segment description the key factors affecting segment earnings and adjusted income from operations for this segment are:

premium growth, including new business and customer retention;

benefits expense as a percentage of earned premium (loss ratio);

operating expense and acquisition expense as a percentage of segment revenues (expense ratio and acquisition cost ratio);

the impact of movements in foreign currency; and

the effective tax rate.
throughout this discussion, prior period currency adjusted income from operations, revenues, and benefits and expenses are being calculated by applying the current period's exchange rates to reported results in the prior period. a strengthening u.s. dollar against foreign currencies will decrease segment earnings, while a weakening u.s. dollar produces the opposite effect.
as described in note 3 to the consolidated financial statements, the global supplemental benefits segment acquired two businesses during the second half of 2012: great american supplemental benefits and finans emeklilik (also referred to as the "turkey jv"). collectively, throughout this discussion these two transactions are referred to as "the acquisitions."

the increase in segment earnings and adjusted income from operations was driven in part by a lower acquisition cost ratio and continuing business growth, primarily in south korea, partially offset by a higher loss ratio driven by a business mix shift and higher incurred claims. 2014 results also included favorable tax-related items of $21 million recorded in the third quarter of 2014 (see effective tax rate discussion below).
earnings discussion: 2013 compared to 2012
the increase in segment earnings and adjusted income from operations was primarily driven by business growth, primarily in south korea, lower acquisition costs in europe reflecting a decision to cease selling activities in certain markets, and earnings of the acquisitions during the second half of 2013, partially offset by higher acquisition and benefits expenses.
revenues premiums increased in both 2014 and 2013 compared with each prior year. when applying 2014 exchange rates to 2013 and 2012 results, premiums increased by 13% in 2014 and 25% in 2013. these increases were primarily attributable to new sales, particularly in south korea and the u.s. reflecting both customer growth and sales of higher premium products. in 2013, the increase was also due to the impact of the acquisitions in the second half of 2012.
net investment income. in 2014, net investment income increased compared with 2013, primarily due to asset growth in south korea. net investment income increased in 2013 compared with 2012, primarily due to the impact of the acquisitions in the second half of 2012.
benefits and expenses benefit expenses increased in both 2014 and 2013, compared with each prior year. applying actual 2014 currency exchange rates to 2013 results, benefit expenses increased by 16%. these increases were primarily due to business growth and higher claims primarily in south korea and the u.s. applying actual 2014 currency exchange rates to prior year results, benefit expenses increased 28% in 2013, compared with 2012, primarily due to the acquisitions in the second half of 2012 and business growth.
loss ratios increased in 2014 and 2013 compared with each prior year. in 2014, the increase is due primarily to a business mix shift toward products with higher loss ratios and higher incurred claims. for 2013, the increase primarily results from the inherently higher loss ratios of the acquisitions in the second half of 2012.

back to contents part ii item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations operating expenses. included in operating expenses for the global supplemental benefits segment are both policy acquisition costs and other operating expenses. overall operating expenses were higher in 2014 and 2013 compared with each prior year, reflecting increases in both policy acquisition costs and other operating expenses. for 2014, the increase in policy acquisition costs reflects higher commissions in hong kong, the u.k. and the u.s., primarily driven by higher sales. for 2013, the increase in policy acquisition costs was largely attributable to the acquisitions and business growth, partially offset by lower acquisition costs in europe reflecting a decision to cease selling activities in certain markets during 2012. the increases in other operating expenses in both 2014 and 2013 compared with each prior year were largely driven by strategic business investments.
acquisition cost ratios decreased in both 2014 and 2013 compared with each prior year. for 2014, the decline in the ratio largely represents a shift toward higher premium products and more disciplined acquisition cost spending. the decrease in the ratio in 2013 was primarily driven by lower acquisition costs in europe reflecting a decision to cease selling activities in certain markets during 2012 and, to a lesser extent, the impact of the lower acquisition cost ratios associated with our supplemental benefits business in the u.s.
the expense ratio (excluding acquisition costs) was flat in 2014 compared with 2013 reflecting strategic business investments largely offset by operating efficiencies. in 2013, the expense ratio decreased compared with 2012 primarily due to the lower expense ratios associated with our supplemental benefits business in the u.s., partially offset by strategic business investments.
effective tax rates. the effective tax rate for the global supplemental benefits segment decreased in 2014 compared with 2013, due to favorable tax related items reported in the third quarter of 2014, primarily the favorable effect of expanding our capital management strategy to retain a significant portion of our foreign operations' earnings overseas. effective tax rates in 2013 and 2012 largely reflect the continuing favorable impact of this capital management strategy.
other items affecting global supplemental benefits results for our global supplemental benefits segment, south korea is the single largest geographic market. south korea generated 52% of the segment's revenues and 76% of the segment's earnings in 2014. due to the concentration of business in south korea, the global supplemental benefits segment is exposed to potential losses resulting from economic, regulatory and geopolitical developments in that country, as well as foreign currency movements affecting the south korean won, that could have a significant impact on the segment's results and our consolidated financial results. in south korea and certain other geographic markets, we continue to innovate and broaden our product and channel distribution capabilities to support business growth and mitigate potential adverse effects of increased data privacy regulatory requirements and other risks to telemarketing distribution. in 2014, our global supplemental benefits segment operations in south korea represented 4% of our total consolidated revenues and 8% of shareholders' net income.
group disability and life segment key factors for this segment are:

premium growth, including new business and customer retention;

net investment income;

benefit expenses as a percentage of earned premium (loss ratio); and

other operating expense as a percentage of earned premiums and fees (expense ratio).

segment earnings increased in 2014 compared with 2013 due primarily to the absence of the $51 million after-tax charge related to a disability claims regulatory matter. see the overview section of this md&a for further information. the increase in adjusted income from operations reflected favorable life results, higher net investment income and a lower expense ratio partially offset by higher disability claim costs largely due to a lower discount rate. disability claim costs were lower in 2013 in part due to the $29 million favorable after-tax effect of a higher discount rate on claims incurred in 2013, resulting from the reallocation of higher yielding assets to the disability and life portfolio that had previously supported liabilities in the run-off reinsurance business. the favorable after-tax effects of reserve reviews were $52 million in 2014 and $60 million in 2013.

segment earnings decreased in 2013 compared with 2012 primarily due to the charge associated with the disability claims regulatory matter. adjusted income from operations increased reflecting lower disability claim costs, a lower expense ratio and higher net investment income partially offset by unfavorable life claims experience. lower disability claim costs included the $29 million favorable after-tax effect of a higher discount rate on claims incurred during 2013 as discussed above. results included the favorable after-tax effect of reserve reviews of $60 million in 2013 and $43 million in 2012.
revenues premiums.    the increases in both 2014 and in 2013 reflected new business growth due to disability and life sales and continued strong customer retention.
net investment income.    the increases in both 2014 and in 2013 were primarily due to higher assets partially offset by lower yields.
benefits and expenses benefit expenses.    the increase in 2014 compared with 2013 was due primarily to premium growth and higher disability claims costs including the effect of a lower discount rate, partially offset by the absence of the $77 million before-tax charge for the disability claims regulatory matter and favorable life results. disability claim costs in 2013 benefited from the $40 million before-tax impact of higher discount rates driven by the reallocation of higher yielding assets to the disability and life portfolio as noted above. the favorable life results reflected lower new claim incidence. benefit expenses included the before-tax favorable impact of reserve reviews of $75 million in 2014 compared with $84 million in 2013.
the increase in benefit expenses in 2013 compared with 2012 was primarily due to the $77 million before-tax impact of the disability claims regulatory matter, premium growth and unfavorable life claims experience partially offset by lower disability claim costs. the unfavorable life claims experience was driven by higher new claim sizes and the lower disability claim costs were driven by discount rate changes in 2013 as discussed above and the favorable impact of reserve reviews. benefit expenses in 2013 included the before-tax favorable impact of reserve reviews of $84 million compared with $60 million in 2012.

back to contents part ii item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations operating expense ratio.    the decrease in the operating expense ratio in both 2014 and 2013 reflected continued expense discipline.
effective tax rate.    the segment's effective tax rate is generally lower than the federal tax rate of 35%, primarily due to tax-exempt interest income on bonds. the increase in the effective tax rate in 2014 compared with 2013 resulted from a decline in the proportion of the segment's income that was attributable to tax-exempt interest and, to a lesser extent, the absence of the tax benefit reported in 2013 related to the completion of irs tax audits. the decline in the effective tax rate in 2013 compared with 2012 was due to the tax benefit reported in 2013 related to the completion of irs tax audits.
other operations description cigna's coli business contributes the majority of earnings in other operations. in the first quarter of 2014, we combined the results of the run-off reinsurance segment with other immaterial segments in other operations, because the results are expected to be immaterial subsequent to the reinsurance transaction with berkshire in 2013. cigna's other operations segment also includes the results from the run-off settlement annuity business, as well as the remaining deferred gains recognized from the sale of the individual life insurance and annuity and retirement benefits businesses. prior year information has been conformed to the current year presentation.

segment earnings increased significantly in 2014 compared with 2013, due primarily to the absence of the 2013 charge related to the reinsurance transaction with berkshire. adjusted income from operations decreased in 2014 compared with 2013, primarily reflecting the absence of the $14 million favorable impact of the 2009-2010 irs examinations completed during the third quarter of 2013 and higher coli claims experience in 2014.
earnings discussion: 2013 compared to 2012
the decrease in segment results in 2013 compared with 2012 was driven largely by the 2013 charge related to the reinsurance transaction with berkshire. the increase in adjusted income from operations in 2013, compared with 2012, primarily resulted from the absence of the 2012 reserve strengthening in the gmdb business of $27 million and the $14 million favorable impact of completing the 2009-2010 irs examinations during the third quarter of 2013. see note 19 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on the irs examinations.
revenues premiums reflect revenue primarily on universal and whole life insurance policies in the coli business. premiums increased in 2014 compared with 2013 driven primarily by strong persistency as well as the impact of higher mortality in 2014 on experience-rated business. in 2013, premiums decreased compared with 2012, due to the absence of vadbe premium in 2013 because of the reinsurance transaction, partially offset by higher coli premium.
fees and other revenues included losses of $39 million in 2013 and $119 million in 2012 associated with a dynamic hedge program for the run-off reinsurance business that was discontinued in 2013 with

back to contents part ii item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the effective exit from the gmdb and gmib businesses. excluding this hedge activity, other revenues were slightly lower in both 2014 and 2013 compared with each prior year, primarily due to the continued decline in deferred gain amortization related to the sold retirement benefits and individual life insurance and annuity businesses.
net investment income decreased in 2014 and, to a much more significant degree, in 2013 compared with each prior year. these decreases were primarily due to lower average yields and the selling or reallocating of investment assets in 2013 as a result of the reinsurance transaction with berkshire.
benefits and expenses benefit expenses decreased in 2014 compared with 2013 primarily due to the absence of the $727 million charge resulting from the berkshire transaction as well as gmdb activity prior to the transaction, partially offset by higher claims experience in the coli business. excluding the $727 million charge resulting from the berkshire transaction, benefit expenses decreased in 2013 compared with 2012 largely due to the gmdb activity prior to the berkshire transaction, that was favorable in early 2013 and unfavorable in 2012.
operating expenses decreased in 2014 compared with 2013 primarily due to the absence of expenses associated with the berkshire transaction and lower ongoing expenses subsequent to the transaction. operating expenses in 2012 included gmib fair value gains of $(41) million. excluding this gmib activity, operating expenses increased in 2013 compared with 2012 primarily due to expenses associated with the berkshire transaction.

corporate's segment loss and adjusted loss from operations increased in 2014 compared with 2013, primarily due to an increase in taxes related to certain employee stock compensation costs that are not deductible for income tax purposes under health care reform.
the decrease in corporate's segment loss in 2013 compared with 2012 is primarily attributable to the absence of special item costs associated with both litigation matters and the healthspring acquisition in 2012.

the fixed maturity portfolio increased approximately $2.5 billion during 2014, reflecting increased investment in fixed maturities and the impact of decreased market yields on asset valuations. although overall asset values are well in excess of amortized cost, there are specific securities with amortized cost in excess of fair value by $42 million in aggregate as of december 31, 2014. see note 11 to the consolidated financial statements for further information.
as of december 31, 2014, $17.1 billion, or 90%, of the fixed maturities in our investment portfolio were investment grade (baa and above, or equivalent), and the remaining $1.9 billion were below investment grade. the majority of the bonds that are below investment grade are rated at the higher end of the non-investment grade spectrum. these quality characteristics have not materially changed during the year.
our investment in state and local government securities, with an average quality rating of aa2 is diversified by issuer and geography with no single exposure greater than $28 million. we assess each issuer's credit quality based on a fundamental analysis of underlying financial information and do not rely solely on statistical rating organizations or monoline insurer guarantees.
we invest in high quality foreign government obligations, with an average quality rating of aa3 as of december 31, 2014. these investments are primarily concentrated in asia consistent with the geographic distribution of our international business operations. foreign government obligations also include $218 million of investments in european sovereign debt, none of which are in countries with significant political or economic concerns (portugal, italy, ireland, greece, and spain).
corporate fixed maturities include private placement investments of $5.2 billion that are generally less marketable than publicly-traded bonds. however, yields on these investments tend to be higher than yields on publicly-traded bonds with comparable credit risk. we perform a credit analysis of each issuer, diversify investments by industry and issuer and require financial and other covenants that allow us to monitor issuers for deteriorating financial strength and pursue remedial actions, if warranted. corporate fixed maturities include $343 million of investments in companies that are domiciled or have significant business interests in italy, ireland, and spain. these investments have an average quality rating of baa2 and are diversified by industry sector, including approximately 2% invested in financial institutions. corporate fixed maturities also include investments in the energy and natural gas sector of $1.4 billion that have an average quality rating of baa and are diversified by issuer with no single exposure greater than $45 million.
commercial mortgage loans our commercial mortgage loans are fixed rate loans, diversified by property type, location and borrower. loans are secured by high quality commercial properties and are generally made at less than 75% of the property's value at origination of the loan. property value, debt service coverage, quality, building tenancy and stability of cash flows are all important financial underwriting considerations. we hold no direct residential mortgage loans and do not securitize or service mortgage loans.
we completed an annual in-depth review of our commercial mortgage loan portfolio during the second quarter of 2014. this review included an analysis of each property's year-end 2013 financial statements, rent rolls, operating plans and budgets for 2014, a physical inspection of the property and other pertinent factors. based on property values and cash flows estimated as part of this review and subsequent fundings and repayments, the portfolio's average loan-to-value ratio improved to 63% at december 31, 2014, from 64% as of december 31, 2013, reflecting a modest increase in values for high quality commercial real estate. the portfolio's average debt service coverage ratio also improved, increasing to 1.66 at december 31, 2014 from 1.62 as of december 31, 2013. see note 11 to the consolidated financial statements for further information.
commercial real estate capital markets remain most active for well leased, quality commercial real estate located in strong institutional investment markets. the vast majority of properties securing the mortgages in our mortgage portfolio possess these characteristics. while commercial real estate fundamentals continued to improve, the improvement has varied across geographies and property types.
the commercial mortgage loan portfolio contains approximately 80 loans, including five impaired loans with a carrying value totaling $166 million that are classified as problem or potential problem loans. two of these loans totaling $86 million, net of $4 million in reserves, are current based on restructured terms and three loans totaling

$80 million, net of $8 million in reserves, are current. all of the remaining loans continue to perform under their contractual terms. we have $247 million of loans maturing in the next twelve months. given the quality and diversity of the underlying real estate, positive debt service coverage and significant borrower cash investment averaging 30%, we remain confident that the vast majority of borrowers will continue to perform as expected under the contract terms.
other long-term investments other long-term investments of $1.5 billion primarily include investments in security partnership and real estate funds as well as direct investments in real estate joint ventures. the funds typically invest in mezzanine debt or equity of privately held companies (securities partnerships) and equity real estate. given our subordinate position in the capital structure of these underlying entities, we assume a higher level of risk for higher expected returns. to mitigate risk, investments are diversified across approximately 110 separate partnerships, and approximately 65 general partners who manage one or more of these partnerships. also, the funds' underlying investments are diversified by industry sector or property type, and geographic region. no single partnership investment exceeds 6% of our securities and real estate partnership portfolio.
although the total fair values of investments exceeded their carrying values as of december 31, 2014, the fair value of our ownership interest in certain funds that are carried at cost was less than carrying value by $17 million. we expect to recover our carrying value over the average remaining life of these investments of approximately 5 years. given the current economic environment, future impairments are possible; however, management does not expect those losses to have a material effect on our results of operations, financial condition or liquidity. see note 11 to the consolidated financial statements for further information regarding other long-term investments.
problem and potential problem investments
"problem" bonds and commercial mortgage loans are either delinquent by 60 days or more or have been restructured as to terms, including concessions by us for modification of interest rate, principal payment or maturity date. "potential problem" bonds and commercial mortgage loans are considered current (no payment more than 59 days past due), but management believes they have certain characteristics that increase the likelihood that they may become problems. the characteristics management considers include, but are not limited to, the following:

request from the borrower for restructuring;

principal or interest payments past due by more than 30 but fewer than 60 days;

downgrade in credit rating;

collateral losses on asset-backed securities; and

for commercial mortgages, deterioration of debt service coverage below 1.0 or value declines resulting in estimated loan-to-value ratios increasing to 100% or more.
we recognize interest income on problem bonds and commercial mortgage loans only when payment is actually received because of the risk profile of the underlying investment. the amount that would have been reflected in net income if interest on non-accrual investments had been recognized in accordance with the original terms was not significant for 2014 or 2013.

other long-term investments included $7 million at december 31, 2013 of restructured loans that were previously reported in commercial mortgage loans.
net problem and potential problem investments representing approximately 1% of total investments, excluding policy loans at december 31, 2014, increased by approximately $30 million from december 31, 2013, primarily due to the addition of one commercial mortgage loan to problem investments.
included in realized investment gains (losses) were increases in valuation reserves related to commercial mortgage loans and other-than-temporary impairments on fixed maturities and partnership investments of $52 million. see note 11 to the consolidated financial statements for further information.
investment outlook although financial markets in the united states continued to stabilize during 2014, they have more recently been impacted by continuing global uncertainty. fixed income asset values have appreciated broadly since the beginning of the year, however the changes in valuation have varied amongst investment sectors depending on perceived risk in the global markets. future realized and unrealized investment results will be driven largely by market conditions that exist when a transaction occurs or at the reporting date. these future conditions are not reasonably predictable. we believe that the vast majority of our fixed maturity investments will continue to perform under their contractual terms and that the commercial mortgage loan portfolio is positioned to perform well due to its solid aggregate loan-to-value ratio and strong debt service coverage. based on our strategy to match the duration of invested assets to the duration of insurance and contractholder liabilities, we expect to hold a significant portion of these assets for the long term. although future impairment losses resulting from credit deterioration and interest rate movements remain possible, we do not expect these losses to have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or liquidity.

back to contents part ii item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations market risk financial instruments our assets and liabilities include financial instruments subject to the risk of potential losses from adverse changes in market rates and prices. our primary market risk exposures are:

interest-rate risk on fixed-rate, medium-term instruments. changes in market interest rates affect the value of instruments that promise a fixed return and our employee pension liabilities.

foreign currency exchange rate risk of the u.s. dollar primarily to the south korean won, euro, british pound, chinese yuan renminbi and taiwan dollar. an unfavorable change in exchange rates reduces the carrying value of net assets denominated in foreign currencies.
our management of market risks we predominantly rely on three techniques to manage our exposure to market risk:

investment/liability matching.  we generally select investment assets with characteristics (such as duration, yield, currency and liquidity) that correspond to the underlying characteristics of our related insurance and contractholder liabilities so that we can match the investments to our obligations. shorter-term investments support generally shorter-term life and health liabilities. medium-term, fixed-rate investments support interest-sensitive and health liabilities. longer-term investments generally support products with longer pay out periods such as annuities and long-term disability liabilities.

use of local currencies for foreign operations.  we generally conduct our international business through foreign operating entities that maintain assets and liabilities in local currencies. while this technique does not reduce foreign currency exposure on our net assets, it substantially limits exchange rate risk to those net assets.

use of derivatives.  we generally use derivative financial instruments to minimize certain market risks. in 2014, we entered into interest rate swap contracts to convert a portion of our interest rate exposure on long-term debt from fixed rates to variable rates to more closely align interest expense with interest income received on our cash equivalent and short-term investment balances.
see notes 2(c) and 12 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information about financial instruments, including derivative financial instruments.
effect of market fluctuations the examples that follow illustrate the adverse effect of hypothetical changes in market rates or prices on the fair value of certain financial instruments including:

a hypothetical increase in market interest rates, primarily for fixed maturities and commercial mortgage loans, partially offset by liabilities for long-term, fixed-rate debt; and

a hypothetical strengthening of the u.s. dollar to foreign currencies, primarily for the net assets of foreign subsidiaries denominated in a foreign currency.
management believes that actual results could differ materially from these examples because:

these examples were developed using estimates and assumptions;

changes in the fair values of all insurance-related assets and liabilities have been excluded because their primary risks are insurance rather than market risk;

changes in the fair values of investments recorded using the equity method of accounting and liabilities for pension and other postretirement and postemployment benefit plans (and related assets) have been excluded, consistent with the disclosure guidance; and

changes in the fair values of other significant assets and liabilities such as goodwill, deferred policy acquisition costs, taxes, and various accrued liabilities have been excluded; because they are not financial instruments, their primary risks are other than market risk.
the effects of hypothetical changes in market rates or prices on the fair values of certain of our financial instruments, subject to the exclusions noted above (particularly insurance liabilities), would have been as follows as of december 31:

100 basis point increase in interest rates                   $850          $585
10% strengthening in u.s. dollar to foreign currencies       $320          $285
the effect of a hypothetical increase in interest rates was determined by estimating the present value of future cash flows using various models, primarily duration modeling. the impact of a hypothetical increase to interest rates at december 31, 2014 was greater than that at december 31, 2013 reflecting increased asset purchases as well as valuation increases resulting from lower market yields of fixed maturities during 2014.
the effect of a hypothetical strengthening of the u.s. dollar relative to the foreign currencies held by us was estimated to be 10% of the u.s. dollar equivalent fair value. our foreign operations hold investment assets, such as fixed maturities, cash, and cash equivalents, that are generally invested in the currency of the related liabilities. due to the increase in 2014 of the amount of these investments that are primarily denominated in the south korean won, the effect of a hypothetical 10% strengthening in the u.s. dollar to foreign currencies at december 31, 2014 was greater than that effect at december 31, 2013.

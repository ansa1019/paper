item 1a.   risk factors.
an investment in our common stock involves various risks, including those mentioned below and those that are discussed from time to time in our periodic filings with the sec. investors should carefully consider these risks, along with the other information contained in this report, before making an investment decision regarding our common stock. there may be additional risks of which we are currently unaware, or which we currently consider immaterial. any of these risks could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, and value of our common stock.
risks relating to our business and the financial services industry.
our revenues are based on the market value and composition of the assets under our management, all of which are subject to fluctuation caused by factors outside of our control.
we derive our revenues primarily from investment advisory services provided by our subsidiaries to individual and institutional investors in the t. rowe price mutual funds distributed in the u.s. and other investment portfolios. our investment advisory fees typically are calculated as a percentage of the market value of the assets under our management. we generally earn higher fees on assets invested in our equity funds and equity investment portfolios than we earn on assets invested in our fixed income funds and portfolios. among equity investments, there is a significant variation in fees earned from index-based funds and portfolios at the low end and emerging markets funds and portfolios at the high end. fees also vary across the fixed income funds and portfolios, though not as widely as equity investments, with stable value portfolios and money market securities at the lower end and non-u.s. dollar denominated bonds at the high end. as a result, our revenues are dependent on the value and composition of the assets under our management, all of which are subject to substantial fluctuation due to many factors, including:
•   investor mobility. our investors generally may withdraw their funds at any time, on very short notice and without any significant penalty.
•   general market declines. a downturn in stock or bond prices would cause the value of assets under our management to decrease, and may also cause investors to withdraw their investments, thereby further decreasing the level of assets under our management.
•   investment performance. if the investment performance of our managed portfolios is less than that of our competitors or applicable third-party benchmarks, we could lose existing and potential customers and suffer a decrease in assets under management. institutional investors in particular consider changing investment advisers based upon poor relative investment performance. individual investors in contrast are more likely to react to poor absolute investment performance. prolonged periods of strong relative investment performance may result in capacity constraints within certain portfolios, which in turn may negatively impact our ability to achieve strong investments results in subsequent periods.
•   investing trends. changes in investing trends and, in particular, investor preference for passive or alternative investment portfolios, retirement savings trends, including the prevalence of defined contribution retirement plans and target-date retirement products, may reduce interest in our funds and portfolios and may alter our mix of assets under management.
•   interest rate changes. investor interest in and the valuation of our fixed income investment funds and portfolios are affected by changes in interest rates.
•   international exposure. our managed portfolios may have significant investments in international markets that are subject to risk of loss from political or diplomatic developments, government policies, civil unrest, currency fluctuations, and changes in legislation related to foreign ownership. international markets, particularly emerging markets, which are often smaller, may not have the liquidity of established markets, may lack established regulations, and may experience significantly more volatility than established markets.
•   tax regulation changes. changes in the status of tax deferred retirement plan investments and tax-free municipal bonds, the capital gains and corporate dividend tax rates, and other individual and corporate tax rates and regulations could adversely affect investor behavior and may cause investors to view certain investment offerings less favorably and withdraw their investment assets, thereby decreasing the level of assets under our management.
a decrease in the value of assets under our management, or an adverse change in their composition, could have a material adverse effect on our investment advisory fees and revenues. for any period in which revenues decline, net income and operating margins will likely decline by a greater proportion because certain expenses will be fixed over that finite period and may not decrease in proportion to the decrease in revenues.
page  11
the performance of our money market funds and portfolios are impacted by the historically low interest rate environment.
our money market funds' and portfolios' performance or yield is dependent on the income earned from the underlying securities exceeding the operating costs of the fund. when interest rates are at or near the historic lows, the operating costs of the funds will become a greater portion of the portfolio's net income, thereby reducing the yield of the funds to very low levels. since the second half of 2009, such an environment has led us to voluntarily waive our advisory and other fees earned on our money market funds and trusts in order to maintain yields at or above 0% for fund investors. such actions reduce our advisory fee income and net income. the actual amount of fees waived is dependent on a number of variables including, among others, changes in the net assets held by our money market funds, changes in market yields, changes in the expense levels of the funds, and our willingness to voluntarily continue such fee waivers. also, bank deposits may become more attractive to investors and money market funds could experience significant redemptions, which could decrease our revenues and net income. for further discussion of the fees we waived in the current period, management's expectation as to future fee waivers, and the net cash flows of our money market funds and trusts, please see our management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in item 7 of this form 10-k.
a significant majority of our revenues are based on contracts with the price funds that are subject to termination without cause and on short notice.
we provide investment advisory, distribution, and other administrative services to the price funds under various agreements. investment advisory services are provided to each price fund under individual investment management agreements. the board of each price fund must annually approve the terms of the investment management and service agreements and can terminate the agreement upon 60-days notice. if a price fund seeks to lower the fees that we receive or terminate its contract with us, we would experience a decline in fees earned from the price funds, which could have a material adverse effect on our revenues and net income.
we operate in an intensely competitive industry, which could cause a loss of customers and their assets, thereby reducing our assets under management and our revenues and net income.
we are subject to competition in all aspects of our business from:
•   asset management firms,
•   mutual fund companies,
•   commercial banks and thrift institutions,
•   insurance companies,
•   hedge funds,
•   exchange traded funds,
•   brokerage and investment banking firms, and
•   other financial institutions including multinational firms and subsidiaries of diversified conglomerates.
many of these financial institutions have substantially greater resources than we do and may offer a broader range of financial products across more markets. some operate in a different regulatory environment than we do which may give them certain competitive advantages in the investment products and portfolio structures that they offer. we compete with other providers of investment advisory services primarily based on the availability and objectives of the investment portfolios offered, investment performance, fees and related expenses, and the scope and quality of investment advice and other client services. some institutions have proprietary products and distribution channels that make it more difficult for us to compete with them. most of our investment portfolios are available without sales or redemption fees, which means that investors may be more willing to transfer assets to competing funds.
if current or potential customers decide to use one of our competitors, we could face a significant decline in market share, assets under management, revenues, and net income. in the event that we were to decide to reduce the fees we charge for investment advisory services in response to competitive pressures, revenues and operating margins could be adversely impacted.
page  12
our success depends on our key personnel and our financial performance could be negatively affected by the loss of their services.
our success depends on our highly skilled personnel, including our portfolio and fund managers, investment analysts, sales and client relationship personnel, and corporate officers, many of whom have specialized expertise and extensive experience in our industry. strong financial services professionals are in demand, and we face significant competition for highly qualified employees. our key employees do not have employment contracts, and generally can terminate their employment with us at any time. we cannot assure that we will be able to retain or replace key personnel. we have near- and long-term succession planning processes, including programs to develop our future leaders, which are intended to address future talent needs and minimize the impact of losing key talent. however, in order to retain or replace our key personnel, we may be required to increase compensation, which would decrease net income. the loss of key personnel could damage our reputation and make it more difficult to retain and attract new employees and investors. losses of assets from our client investors would decrease our revenues and net income, possibly materially.
our operations are complex and a failure to perform operational tasks or the misrepresentation of products and services could have an adverse effect on our reputation and subject us to regulatory sanctions, fines, penalties, litigation, and a decrease in revenues.
operating risks include:
•   failure to properly perform or oversee fund or portfolio recordkeeping responsibilities, including portfolio accounting, security pricing, corporate actions, investment restrictions compliance, daily net asset value computations, account reconciliations, and required distributions to fund shareholders to comply with tax regulations;
•   failure to properly perform transfer agent and participant recordkeeping responsibilities, including transaction processing, supervision of staff, tax reporting, and record retention;
•   sales and marketing risks, including the intentional or unintentional misrepresentation of products and services in advertising materials, public relations information, or other external communications, and failure to properly calculate and present investment performance data accurately and in accordance with established guidelines and regulations; and
•   our reliance on third-party vendors who, now or in the future, may perform or support important parts of our operations as there can be no assurance that they will perform properly or that our processes and plans to transition or delegate these functions to others will be successful or that there will not be interruptions in services from these third parties.
any damage to our reputation could harm our business and lead to a loss of revenues and net income.
we have spent many years developing our reputation for integrity, strong investment performance, and superior client services. our brand is a valuable intangible asset, but it is vulnerable to a variety of threats that can be difficult or impossible to control, and costly or even impossible to remediate. regulatory inquiries and rumors can tarnish or substantially damage our reputation, even if those inquiries are satisfactorily addressed. any damage to our brand could impede our ability to attract and retain customers and key personnel, and reduce the amount of assets under our management, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our revenues and net income.
our expenses are subject to significant fluctuations that could materially decrease net income.
our operating results are dependent on the level of our expenses, which can vary significantly for many reasons, including:
•   changes in the level of our advertising expenses, including the costs of expanding investment advisory services to investors outside of the u.s. and further penetrating u.s. distribution channels;
•   variations in the level of total compensation expense due to, among other things, bonuses, stock option grants and other stock-based awards, changes in employee benefit costs due to regulatory or plan design changes, changes in our employee count and mix, competitive factors, and inflation;
•   a future impairment of investments recognized in our consolidated balance sheet;
•   a future impairment of goodwill that is recognized in our consolidated balance sheet;
•   unanticipated material fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates applicable to the costs of our operations abroad;
•   expenses and capital costs incurred to maintain and enhance our administrative and operating services infrastructure, such as technology assets, depreciation, amortization, and research and development;
page  13
•   unanticipated costs incurred to protect investor accounts and client goodwill; and
•   disruptions of third-party services such as communications, power, and mutual fund transfer agent and accounting systems.
under our agreements with the t. rowe price mutual funds, we charge the mutual funds certain administrative fees and related expenses based upon contracted terms. if we fail to accurately estimate our underlying expense levels or are required to incur expenses relating to the mutual funds that are not otherwise paid by the funds, our operating results will be adversely affected. while we are under no obligation to provide financial support to any of our sponsored investment products, any financial support provided would reduce capital available for other purposes and may have an adverse effect on revenues and net income.
we have contracted with third-party financial intermediaries that distribute our investment portfolios in the u.s. and abroad and such relationships may not be available or profitable to us in the future.
these contracted third-party intermediaries generally offer their clients various investment products in addition to, and in competition with, our investment offerings, and have no contractual obligation to encourage investment in our portfolios. it would be difficult for us to acquire or retain the management of those assets without the assistance of the intermediaries, and we cannot assure that we will be able to maintain an adequate number of investment product offerings and successful distribution relationships. in addition, some investors rely on third-party financial planners, registered investment advisers, and other consultants or financial professionals to advise them on the choice of investment adviser and investment portfolio. these professionals and consultants can favor a competing investment portfolio as better meeting their particular client's needs. we cannot assure that our investment offerings will be among their recommended choices in the future. further, their recommendations can change over time and we could lose their recommendation and their client assets under our management. mergers, acquisitions, and other ownership or management changes could also adversely impact our relationships with these third-party intermediaries. the presence of any of the adverse conditions discussed above would reduce revenues and net income, possibly by material amounts.
natural disasters and other unpredictable events could adversely affect our operations.
armed conflict, terrorist attacks, cyber-attacks, power failures, and natural disasters could adversely affect our revenues, expenses, and net income by:
•   decreasing investment valuations in, and returns on, the investment portfolios that we manage,
•   causing disruptions in national or global economies that decrease investor confidence and make investment products generally less attractive,
•   incapacitating or inflicting losses of lives among our associates,
•   interrupting our business operations or those of critical service providers,
•   triggering technology delays or failures, and
•   requiring substantial capital expenditures and operating expenses to remediate damage, replace our facilities, and restore our operations.
a significant portion of our business operations are concentrated in the baltimore, maryland region and in london, england. we have developed various backup systems and contingency plans but we cannot be assured that they will be adequate in all circumstances that could arise or that material interruptions and disruptions will not occur. in addition, we rely to varying degrees on outside vendors for disaster contingency support, and we cannot be assured that these vendors will be able to perform in an adequate and timely manner. if we lose the availability of any associates, or if we are unable to respond adequately to such an event in a timely manner, we may be unable to timely resume our business operations, which could lead to a tarnished reputation and loss of customers that results in a decrease in assets under management, lower revenues, and materially reduced net income.
our investment income and asset levels may be negatively impacted by fluctuations in our investment portfolio.
we currently have a substantial portion of our assets invested in sponsored stock, blended asset, and bond funds. all of these investments are subject to investment market risk and our non-operating investment income could be adversely affected by the realization of losses upon the disposition of our investments or the recognition of significant other-than-temporary impairments page  14
in the case of our available-for-sale portfolio and the recognition of unrealized losses related to our sponsored investment portfolios that are held as trading and accounted for under the equity method. in addition, related investment income has fluctuated significantly over the years depending upon the performance of our corporate investments, including the impact of market conditions and interest rates, and the size of our corporate money market and longer-term mutual fund holdings. fluctuations in other investment income are expected to occur in the future.
we may review and pursue acquisition and venture opportunities in order to maintain or enhance our competitive position.
any strategic transaction can involve a number of risks, including additional demands on our staff; unanticipated problems regarding integration of investor account and investment security recordkeeping, additional or new regulatory requirements, operating facilities and technologies, and new employees; adverse effects in the event acquired intangible assets or goodwill become impaired; and the existence of liabilities or contingencies not disclosed to or otherwise known by us prior to closing a transaction.
we own a 26% investment in uti asset management company ltd (uti), an indian asset management company, and we may consider non-controlling minority investments in other entities in the future. we may not realize future returns from such investments or any collaborative activities that may develop in the future.
we are exposed to a number of risks arising from our international operations.
we operate in a number of jurisdictions outside of the u.s. and have an equity investment in uti. our international operations require us to comply with the legal and regulatory requirements of various foreign jurisdictions and expose us to the political consequences of operating in foreign jurisdictions. our foreign business operations are also subject to the following risks:
•   difficulty in managing, operating, and marketing our international operations;
•   fluctuations in currency exchange rates which may result in substantial negative effects on assets under our management, revenues, expenses, and assets in our u.s. dollar based financial statements; and
•   significant adverse changes in international legal and regulatory environments.
legal and regulatory risks.
compliance within a complex regulatory environment imposes significant financial and strategic costs on our business, and non-compliance could result in fines and penalties.
if we are unable to maintain compliance with applicable laws and regulations, we could be subject to criminal and civil liability, the suspension of our employees, fines, penalties, sanctions, injunctive relief, exclusion from certain markets, or temporary or permanent loss of licenses or registrations necessary to conduct our business. a regulatory proceeding, even if it does not result in a finding of wrongdoing or sanctions, could consume substantial expenditures of time and capital. any regulatory investigation and any failure to maintain compliance with applicable laws and regulations could severely damage our reputation, adversely affect our ability to conduct business, and decrease revenue and net income.
legal and regulatory developments in the mutual fund and investment advisory industry could increase our regulatory burden, impose significant financial and strategic costs on our business, and cause a loss of, or impact the servicing of, our clients and fund shareholders.
our regulatory environment is frequently altered by new regulations and by revisions to, and evolving interpretations of, existing regulations. future changes could require us to modify or curtail our investment offerings and business operations, or impact our expenses and profitability. additionally, some regulations may not directly apply to our business but may impact the capital markets, service providers or other indirect effects on our ability to provide services to our clients.
potential impacts of current or proposed legal or regulatory requirements include, without limitation, the following:
•   the volcker rule will not directly impact t. rowe price group; however, there remains the risk that the rule could impact the liquidity in capital markets, which may make it more difficult or costly to execute certain security transactions on behalf of our clients.
•   as part of the debate in washington, d.c. related to the economy and the u.s. deficit, there has been increasing focus on the framework of the u.s. retirement system. we could incur increased costs if new regulatory requirements are adopted page  15
since retirement plans are a significant part of our client base and other types of retirement accounts invest in our mutual funds. in addition, changes to the current framework may impact our business in other ways. for example, proposals to reduce contributions to individual retirement accounts and defined contribution plans for certain individuals, as well as potential changes to defined benefit plans, may result in increased plan terminations and reduce our opportunity to manage and service retirement assets.
•   the u.s. department of labor and securities and exchange commission (sec) are considering changes to definitions and rules related to fiduciaries. depending on their nature, these changes may impact our ability to service clients or engage in certain distribution or other business activities.
•   the federal reserve board has adopted final regulations related to non-bank systemically important financial institutions (sifis), and other jurisdictions are contemplating similar regulation. it has been suggested that large mutual funds, particularly money market funds, should be designated as sifis. we do not believe that mutual funds should be deemed sifis. further, we do not believe sifi designation was intended for traditional asset management businesses. if, however, any t. rowe price fund or t. rowe price affiliate is deemed a sifi, increased regulatory oversight would apply, which may include enhanced capital, liquidity, leverage, stress testing, resolution planning, and risk management requirements.
•   on july 23, 2014, the sec adopted additional reforms regulating money market funds. the reforms will require institutional non-government money market funds to operate with a floating net asset value (nav) and require all non-government money market funds to impose liquidity fees and redemption gates under certain conditions. government and retail money market funds will continue using current pricing and accounting methods to seek to maintain a stable nav. the sec adopted other reforms for money market funds, including additional disclosure and reporting requirements, tightening of diversification requirements, and enhanced stress testing. these reforms will take effect over the next two years and could have a negative impact on the attractiveness of such funds to investors and also subject us to additional regulatory requirements and costs to comply with such requirements.
•   the commodity futures trading commission has adopted certain amendments to its rules that would limit the ability of mutual funds and certain other products we sponsor to use commodities, futures, swaps, and other derivatives without additional registration. if our use of these products on behalf of client accounts increases so as to require registration, we would be subject to additional regulatory requirements and costs associated with registration.
•   there has been increased global regulatory focus on the manner in which intermediaries are paid for distribution of mutual funds. changes to long-standing market practices related to fees or enhanced disclosure requirements may negatively impact sales of mutual funds by intermediaries, especially if such requirements are not applied to other investment products.
•   global regulations on otc derivatives are evolving, including new and proposed regulations under the dodd-frank wall street reform and consumer protection act and european market infrastructure regulation relating to central clearing counterparties, trade reporting, and repositories. there remains uncertainty related to various requirements under these regulations and the exact manner in which they will impact current trading strategies for our clients.
•   the revised markets in financial instruments directive (mifid ii directive) and regulation (mifir) (together "mifid ii") will apply across the european union (eu) and member states of the european economic area from january 3, 2017. implementation of mifid ii will significantly impact both the structure and operation of eu financial markets. some of the main changes introduced under mifid ii include applying enhanced disclosure requirements, further conduct of business requirements, enhancing governance requirements, broadening the scope of pre and post trade transparency, increasing transaction reporting requirements, and changes to the regulation of trading venues. compliance with mifid ii will increase our costs.
we cannot predict the nature of future changes to the legal and regulatory requirements applicable to our business, nor the extent of the impacts that will result from current or future proposals. however, any such changes are likely to increase the costs of compliance and the complexity of our operations. they may also result in changes to our product or service offerings. the changing regulatory landscape may also impact a number of our service providers and to the extent such providers alter their services or increase their fees it may impact our expenses or those of the products we offer.
page  16
we may become involved in legal and regulatory proceedings that may not be covered by insurance.
we are subject to regulatory and governmental inquiries and civil litigation. an adverse outcome of any such proceeding could involve substantial financial penalties. from time to time, various claims against us arise in the ordinary course of business, including employment-related claims. there also has been an increase in litigation and in regulatory investigations in the financial services industry in recent years, including customer claims, class action suits, and government actions alleging substantial monetary damages and penalties.
we carry insurance in amounts and under terms that we believe are appropriate. we cannot be assured that our insurance will cover every liability and loss to which we may be exposed, or that our insurance policies will continue to be available at acceptable terms and fees. certain insurance coverage may not be available or may be prohibitively expensive in future periods. as our insurance policies come up for renewal, we may need to assume higher deductibles or co-insurance liabilities, or pay higher premiums, which would increase our expenses and reduce our net income.
net capital requirements may impede the business operations of our subsidiaries.
certain of our subsidiaries are subject to net capital requirements imposed by various federal, state, and foreign authorities. each of our subsidiaries' net capital meets or exceeds all current minimum requirements; however, a significant change in the required net capital, an operating loss, or an extraordinary charge against net capital could adversely affect the ability of our subsidiaries to expand or even maintain their operations if we were unable to make additional investments in them.
technology risks.
we require specialized technology to operate our business and would be adversely affected if we fail to maintain adequate infrastructure to conduct or expand our operations or if our technology became inoperative or obsolete.
we depend on highly specialized and, in many cases, proprietary technology to support our business functions, including among others:
•   securities analysis,
•   securities trading,
•   portfolio management,
•   customer service,
•   accounting and internal financial reporting processes and controls, and
•   regulatory compliance and reporting.
all of our technology systems, including those provided by vendors, are vulnerable to disability or failures due to cyber-attacks such as hacking or viruses, natural disasters, power failures, acts of war or terrorism, sabotage, and other causes. a suspension or termination of vendor-provided software licenses or related support, upgrades, and maintenance could cause system delays or interruption. although we have robust business and disaster recovery plans, if our technology systems were to fail and we were unable to recover in a timely way, we would be unable to fulfill critical business functions, which could lead to a loss of customers and could harm our reputation. a technological breakdown could also interfere with our ability to comply with financial reporting and other regulatory requirements, exposing us to disciplinary action and to liability to our customers.
in addition, our continued success depends on our ability to effectively integrate operations across many countries, and to adopt new or adapt existing technologies to meet client, industry, and regulatory demands. we might be required to make significant capital expenditures to maintain competitive infrastructure. if we are unable to upgrade our infrastructure in a timely fashion, we might lose customers and fail to maintain regulatory compliance, which could affect our results of operations and severely damage our reputation.
we could be subject to losses if we fail to properly safeguard sensitive and confidential information.
as part of our normal operations, we maintain and transmit confidential information about our clients as well as proprietary information relating to our business operations. we maintain a system of internal controls designed to provide reasonable assurance that fraudulent activity, including misappropriation of assets, fraudulent financial reporting, and unauthorized access to sensitive or confidential data is either prevented or timely detected. our systems or our third-party service providers' systems page  17
could be victimized by unauthorized users or corrupted by computer viruses or other malicious software code, or authorized persons could inadvertently or intentionally release confidential or proprietary information. such disclosure could, among other things:
•   seriously damage our reputation,
•   allow competitors access to our proprietary business information,
•   subject us to liability for a failure to safeguard client data,
•   result in the termination of contracts by our existing customers,
•   subject us to regulatory action, and
•   require significant capital and operating expenditures to investigate and remediate the breach.
item 7.   management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations.
general.
our revenues and net income are derived primarily from investment advisory services provided to individual and institutional investors in our sponsored u.s. mutual funds and other investment portfolios. the other investment portfolios include separately managed accounts, subadvised funds, and other sponsored investment portfolios including collective investment trusts, target-date retirement trusts, luxembourg-based funds offered to investors outside the u.s., and portfolios offered through variable annuity life insurance plans in the u.s. investment advisory clients outside the u.s. account for 5.6% of our assets under management at december 31, 2014.
page  21
we manage a broad range of u.s., international, and global stock, bond, and money market mutual funds and other investment portfolios, which meet the varied needs and objectives of individual and institutional investors. investment advisory revenues depend largely on the total value and composition of assets under our management. accordingly, fluctuations in financial markets and in the composition of assets under management affect our revenues and results of operations.
we remain debt-free with substantial liquidity and resources that allow us to take advantage of attractive growth opportunities; invest in key capabilities, including investment professionals, technologies, and new fund offerings; and most importantly, provide our clients with strong investment management expertise and service both now and in the future. we expect to continue our investment in long-term initiatives to sustain and deepen our investment talent, add investment capabilities both in terms of new strategies and new investment vehicles, expand capabilities through enhanced technology, and broaden our distribution reach globally.
background.
u.s. equities, as measured by the s&p 500 index, rose in 2014 for the sixth consecutive year, as the economy rebounded strongly from a first-quarter weather-related contraction. although economic growth faltered overseas and geopolitical tensions increased because of russia's actions involving ukraine and international sanctions, the u.s. market was supported by falling long-term interest rates, favorable corporate earnings, and expanded stimulus efforts in the eurozone and japan. also, tumbling oil prices in the second half of the year, though unfavorable for the energy sector, were seen as a generally positive factor for the u.s.
equities in developed non-u.s. markets declined in dollar terms in 2014, as a stronger u.s. dollar versus other currencies reduced overseas returns to u.s. investors. asian markets generally held up better than european markets. in japan, the economy entered recession following an april 1, 2014 sales tax increase that caused consumers and businesses to significantly curtail spending. the eurozone struggled with low inflation, high unemployment, and a loss of consumer and business confidence.
emerging markets equities, in aggregate, declined in dollar terms but held up better than developed non-u.s. markets. developing asian markets performed best with many markets in the region producing strong returns. latin american markets mostly declined. emerging european markets underperformed amid severe weakness in russia, whose currency plunged 45%.
results of several major equity market indexes for the full year 2014 are as follows:
index s&amp;p 500 index                                     13.7   %
nasdaq composite index (excluding dividends)          13.4   %
russell 2000 index                                     4.9   %

msci emerging markets index                           (1.8   )%
global bonds produced mostly positive returns in 2014. in the u.s., lower-quality corporate bonds underperformed investment-grade issues for the year and declined in the second half of the year because of weakness in the energy sector, the largest segment of the high yield market. investment-grade issues produced good results, led by long-term treasury securities amid strong demand for relatively high-yielding safe-haven government debt. long-term interest rates declined despite the federal reserve's reduction of monthly asset purchases and conclusion of such purchases in october. the 10-year treasury note yield finished 2014 at 2.2% versus 3.0% at the end of 2013.
government bonds in developed non-u.s. markets produced moderate losses in u.s. dollar terms, as the stronger dollar more than offset local-currency gains stemming from declining yields in key government bond markets. emerging markets bonds performed well amid persistent demand for higher-yielding assets and as concerns about the impact of fed tapering on global liquidity diminished as the year progressed. dollar-denominated emerging markets bonds performed better than local-currency issues.

assets under management.
reflecting the strong growth in equity markets, our assets under management ended 2014 at a record $746.8 billion, an increase of $54.4 billion from the end of 2013. market appreciation and income, net of distributions not reinvested, added $50.7 billion, and net cash inflows added $3.7 billion in assets under management during 2014.

the net cash inflows in our sponsored u.s. mutual funds over the last three years were sourced primarily from third-party financial intermediaries. in 2013, a vast majority of the net outflows from our other investment portfolios were concentrated page  23
among several large institutional clients outside the u.s. and intermediary clients that changed their investment objectives, repositioned their strategy allocations, or experienced investment performance challenges within their portfolio. in 2014, the net outflows from our other investment portfolios were primarily from a few institutional and subadvisory clients who redeemed significant amounts from a small number of equity and fixed income strategies.
the majority of the assets transferred by clients from our sponsored mutual funds to our other investment portfolios disclosed in the previous table were moved from our target-date retirement funds to our collective investment trusts and target-date retirement trusts.
our target-date retirement funds and trusts, which invest in a broadly diversified portfolio of other t. rowe price funds and t. rowe price collective investment trusts and automatically rebalance to maintain their specific asset allocation weightings, are a significant source of cash flows. net cash flows shown in the previous table include or are net of the following net cash inflows that originated in our target-date portfolios.

total target-date portfolios      $10.1             $11.5             $17.7
assets under management at december 31, 2014, in these target-date portfolios totaled $148.5 billion, including $126.0 billion in target-date retirement funds and $22.5 billion in target-date retirement trusts.
strong investment performance and brand awareness is a key driver to attracting assets and to our long-term success. for 2014, 74% of the t. rowe price u.s. mutual funds across their share classes outperformed their comparable lipper averages on a total return basis for the three-year period ended december 31, 2014, 80% outperformed for the five-year period, 88% outperformed for the 10-year period, and 73% outperformed for the one-year period. in addition, t. rowe price stock, bond and blended asset funds that were given an overall rating of four or five stars from morningstar at december 31, 2014, account for 82% of the assets under management in our rated funds. the performance of our institutional strategies against their benchmarks was substantially similar. our target-date retirement funds continue to deliver very attractive long-term performance, with 100% of these funds outperforming their comparable lipper averages on a total return basis for the three- and five-year periods ended december 31, 2014.
we incur significant expenditures to attract new investment advisory clients and additional investments from our existing clients. these efforts often involve costs that precede any future revenues that we may recognize from an increase to our assets under management.

investment advisory fees earned in 2014 are up 14.6% over 2013 as average assets under our management increased $90.9 billion, or 14.3%, to $724.7 billion. the average annualized fee rate earned on our assets under management was 47.8 basis points during 2014, virtually unchanged from the 47.7 basis points earned in 2013. in 2014, we voluntarily waived $58.4 million in money market-related fees, including advisory fees and fund expenses, in order to maintain a positive yield for fund investors. the fee waivers in 2014 were up $7.2 million from the $51.2 million waived in 2013 and represent about 2% of total investment advisory revenues earned in 2014. fees were waived from each of our money market funds and trusts, which have combined net assets at december 31, 2014, of $16.0 billion, or 2.1% of our total assets under management. we expect that these fee waivers will continue in 2015.
greater average assets under management have increased our investment advisory revenues and helped lift our operating margin in 2014 to 47.5% compared to 47.0% in the 2013 period. non-operating investment income in 2014 includes higher gains of $35.8 million realized from the sale of certain of our sponsored fund holdings. the proceeds from these sales were primarily used to provide additional seed capital to other sponsored funds in support of our distribution efforts outside the u.s.
net revenues investment advisory revenues earned from the t. rowe price mutual funds distributed in the u.s. were $2.5 billion in 2014, an increase of 16.9%, or $359.7 million, on higher average mutual fund assets. in 2014, average mutual fund assets were $460.9 billion, an increase of 17.8% from the 2013 average.
mutual fund assets were $477.6 billion at december 31, 2014, an increase of $42.3 billion from $435.3 billion at the end of 2013. investors added net cash inflows during 2014 of $11.8 billion, including $3.7 billion into our stock and blended asset funds and $8.3 billion into our bond funds. the money market funds had net outflows of $.2 billion. these cash flow amounts are presented net of $5.3 billion that clients transferred to the other investment portfolios, primarily our collective investment trusts and target-date retirement trusts. without these transfers, the mutual funds would have had net cash inflows of $17.1 billion in 2014. market appreciation and income, net of distributions not reinvested, added $30.5 billion to our mutual fund assets under management in 2014.
investment advisory revenues earned on the other investment portfolios that we manage increased $82.2 million, or 9.2%, to $978.7 million. average assets in these portfolios were $263.8 billion during 2014, an increase of $21.2 billion, or 8.7%, from the 2013 year. assets in these portfolios at december 31, 2014, were $269.2 billion, an increase of $12.1 billion from the end of 2013. market appreciation and income of $20.2 billion was partially offset by net outflows of $8.1 billion during 2014. net outflows during 2014 are presented net of the $5.3 billion assets that clients transferred in from the mutual funds. these net outflows were primarily from a few number of institutional and subadvisory clients who redeemed significant amounts from a small number of equity and fixed income strategies.
administrative fees increased $30.3 million to $374.0 million in 2014. the increase is primarily attributable to increased costs incurred to provide fund accounting services and transfer agent servicing activities to the mutual funds and their investors. changes in administrative fee revenues are generally offset by similar changes in related operating expenses that are incurred to provide services to the funds and their investors.
distribution and servicing fee revenues earned from 12b-1 plans of the advisor class, r class, and variable annuity class shares of our sponsored portfolios were $143.6 million in 2014, an increase of $26.4 million from the comparable 2013 period, on greater average assets under management in these share classes. the 12b-1 fees earned are offset entirely by the costs paid to third-party intermediaries who source these assets. these costs are reported as distribution and servicing costs on the face of our consolidated income statements.
operating expenses compensation and related costs increased 14.9% from 2013 to about $1.3 billion. a significant part of the increase is attributable to a $60.7 million increase in our annual variable compensation program and a $60.8 million increase in salaries and related benefits, which result from a modest increase in salaries at the beginning of 2014 combined with a 4.8% increase in our average staff size over the 2013 period. we continue to increase our staff size to support both business growth and added capabilities. higher temporary staff expenses, noncash stock-based compensation expense, and other employee costs account for the remainder of the increase in compensation and related costs in the 2014 period. at december 31, 2014, we employed 5,870 associates, an increase of 3.6% from the end of 2013.
advertising and promotion expenditures were $76.0 million in 2014, a decrease of $11.0 million from the 2013 period. the decrease in cost from the 2013 period is primarily a result of repurposing this spending to other distribution activities. we page  25
currently expect that advertising and promotion costs for the first quarter of 2015 to be comparable to the fourth quarter of 2014, and the full year 2015 costs could increase about 5% from 2014 levels.
occupancy and facility costs together with depreciation expense increased $29.2 million, or 12.9%, versus 2013. nearly half of the increase is attributable to the opening of two new buildings at our owings mills campus in the fourth quarter of 2013 and the renovation of certain existing facilities. the increase also includes the added costs to update and enhance our technology capabilities, including related maintenance programs. these increases were offset by the non-recurrence of the $3.5 million in costs recognized to terminate certain facility leases in 2013.
other operating expenses were $286.4 million in 2014, an increase of $27.1 million from the comparable 2013 period, as higher business demands and our continued investment in our capabilities have increased our costs. these increased costs include those related to our defined contribution recordkeeping business, information and other third-party service costs, travel costs, and other general and administrative costs.
non-operating investment income our non-operating investment income, which includes the recognition of investment gains and losses, was up $49.2 million from the 2013 period. the increase is due in part to the 2014 results including $49.3 million in gains realized on the sale of certain sponsored fund holdings compared with $13.5 million in gains realized in the comparable 2013 period. larger year-end dividends, including capital gain distributions, earned from our mutual fund investments of $21.8 million were offset in part by a decrease in net investment gains recognized on certain of our other investments in the 2014 period. the 2013 year also included a $1.5 million gain recognized on the sale of our savings bank subsidiary.
provision for income taxes our effective tax rate was 38.6% in 2014 compared to 38.4% in 2013. we currently estimate our effective tax rate for 2015 will be about 38.5%. our effective income tax rate reflects the relative contribution of pretax income generated by our foreign subsidiaries that are subject to tax rates lower than our u.s. rates. changes in the relative contribution of pretax income from u.s. and foreign sources or changes in tax rates in relevant foreign jurisdictions may affect our effective income tax rate and overall net income in the future.
2013 versus 2012.
investment advisory fees in 2013 are up over 2012 as average assets under our management increased $84.4 billion to $633.8 billion for the 2013 year. in addition, the average annualized fee rate earned on our assets under management increased to 47.7 basis points during 2013 from the 47.2 basis points earned in 2012, due primarily to asset growth in higher than average fee rate strategies. we voluntarily waived $51.2 million in money market advisory fees in 2013, an increase of $16.2 million from the $35.0 million waived in 2012, in order to maintain a positive yield for fund investors. these fee waivers represent about 2% of total investment advisory revenues earned in 2013. fees were waived from each of our money market funds and trusts that have combined net assets at december 31, 2013, of $16.3 billion, or 2.4% of our total assets under management.
greater average assets under management and a higher annualized fee rate have increased our investment advisory revenues and helped lift our operating margin in 2013 to 47.0% compared to 45.1% in the 2012 period. non-operating investment income in 2013 is down compared to 2012, primarily because we sold fewer sponsored fund holdings in 2013 resulting in lower realized gains.
net revenues investment advisory revenues earned from the t. rowe price mutual funds distributed in the u.s. were $2.1 billion in 2013, an increase of 18.8%, or $335.8 million, on higher average mutual fund assets. average mutual fund assets in 2013 were $391.2 billion, an increase of 19.8% from the 2012 average. mutual fund assets at december 31, 2013, were $435.3 billion, up $88.4 billion from the end of 2012.
net inflows into the mutual funds during 2013 were $10.2 billion, including $5.8 billion into our stock and blended asset funds, $3.5 billion into our bond funds, and $.9 billion into the money market funds. these mutual fund net inflow amounts are presented net of $7.7 billion that clients transferred to the other investment portfolios, primarily our collective investment trusts and target-date retirement trusts. without these transfers, the mutual funds would have had net cash inflows of $17.9 billion in 2013. market appreciation and income, net of distributions not reinvested, added $78.2 billion to our mutual fund assets under management in 2013.
page  26
investment advisory revenues earned on the other investment portfolios that we manage increased $94.8 million, or 11.8%, to $896.5 million. average assets in these portfolios were $242.6 billion during 2013, an increase of $19.8 billion, or 8.9%, from the 2012 year. ending assets at december 31, 2013, were $257.1 billion, an increase of $27.2 billion from the end of 2012. market appreciation and income of $49.4 billion was reduced by net outflows of $22.2 billion during 2013. net outflows during 2013 are presented net of the $7.7 billion assets that clients transferred in from the mutual funds. the vast majority of these net outflows were concentrated among several large institutional clients outside the u.s. and intermediary clients that changed their investment objectives, repositioned their strategy allocations, or experienced investment performance challenges within their portfolio.
administrative fees increased $11.1 million to $343.7 million in 2013. the increase is primarily attributable to our transfer agent servicing activities and defined contribution recordkeeping services for the mutual funds and their investors. changes in administrative fee revenues are generally offset by similar changes in related operating expenses that are incurred to provide services to the funds and their investors.
distribution and servicing fee revenues earned from 12b-1 plans of the advisor class, r class, and variable annuity class shares of our sponsored portfolios were $117.2 million in 2013, an increase of $21.1 million from the comparable 2012 period on greater average assets under management in these share classes. the 12b-1 fees earned are offset entirely by the costs paid to third-party intermediaries who source these assets. these costs are reported as distribution and servicing costs on the face of our consolidated income statements.
operating expenses compensation and related costs increased 10.4% from 2012 to about $1.2 billion. a significant part of the increase is attributable to a $45.4 million increase in our annual variable compensation program and a $37.2 million increase in salaries and related benefits. we increased our average staff size by 4.1% over 2012 to support both business growth and added capabilities. higher temporary staff expenses, noncash stock-based compensation expense, and other employee costs account for the remainder of the increase in compensation and related costs in the 2013 period. at december 31, 2013, we employed 5,668 associates, an increase of 5.5% from the end of 2012.
advertising and promotion expenditures were $87.0 million in 2013 compared to $88.5 million in 2012. the decrease in cost from the 2012 period is primarily attributable to process efficiencies realized through the realignment of certain marketing activities.
occupancy and facility costs together with depreciation expense increased $20.8 million, or 10.1%, versus 2012. the increase in costs is largely attributable to the expansion of our international facilities, the opening of two new buildings located at our owings mills campus, and continued investment in our technology capabilities, including related maintenance programs. the 2013 year also includes a non-recurring charge of $3.5 million related to the termination of certain facility leases.
other operating expenses were $259.3 million in 2013, an increase of $38.9 million from the comparable 2012 period as increased business demands and our continued investment in our capabilities have increased our costs. these costs include consulting and professional fees, costs related to our defined contribution recordkeeping business, information services, and other third-party services. we also made a higher charitable contribution to the t. rowe price foundation in 2013 than in 2012.
non-operating investment income our non-operating investment income, which includes the recognition of investment gains and losses, was down $7.8 million from the 2012 period. the decrease is due in part to the 2013 results including $13.5 million in gains realized on the sale of certain sponsored fund holdings compared with $35.1 million in gains realized in the comparable 2012 period. this reduction in realized gains was partially offset by $7.9 million in higher dividends received on our sponsored mutual fund holdings and $5.6 million in higher gains recognized on our other investments. the 2013 year also includes a $1.5 million gain recognized on the sale of our savings bank subsidiary.
provision for income taxes our 2013 effective tax rate of 38.4% is unchanged from the 2012 rate. our effective income tax rate reflects the relative contribution of pretax income generated by our non-u.s. subsidiaries that are subject to tax rates lower than our u.s. rates. changes in the relative contribution of pretax income from u.s. and non-u.s. sources or changes in tax rates in relevant non-u.s. jurisdictions may affect our effective income tax rate and overall net income in the future.

capital resources and liquidity.
during 2014, stockholders' equity increased from $4.8 billion to $5.4 billion. in 2014, we paid $1.76 per share in regular dividends and expended $415.5 million to repurchase 5,312,663 common shares from existing cash balances and cash generated from operations. we generally repurchase shares of our common stock over time to offset the dilution created by our equity-based compensation plans. tangible book value is $4.7 billion at december 31, 2014, and our cash and fund investment holdings total $3.4 billion. given the availability of these financial resources, we do not maintain an available external source of liquidity.
at december 31, 2014, we had outstanding commitments to make additional contributions totaling $36.6 million to various investment partnerships in which we have an existing investment. these outstanding commitments, if called, will be funded from operating resources. we currently expect total capital expenditures for facilities, equipment, and technology development for 2015 to be up to $175 million, which will be funded from operating resources.
2014 versus 2013.
operating activities during 2014 provided cash flows of nearly $1.3 billion, up $58.1 million from the 2013 period. higher net income, noncash depreciation and amortization, and noncash stock-based compensation in the 2014 period increased cash flows, in aggregate, $221.8 million over the 2013 levels. this aggregate increase was offset by $64.5 million in more cash used in 2014 to seed new sponsored investment portfolios that we are consolidating and treating their underlying investment holdings as trading securities. timing differences in the cash settlement of our accounts receivable and accrued revenues, payables and accrued liabilities, and other assets and liabilities also decreased our operating cash flows by $69.2 million compared to the 2013 year. our 2014 operating cash flows were also increased by $35.8 million in higher gains realized from the sale of certain available-for-sale sponsored fund investments as the related proceeds are reflected as an investing activity in our consolidated statements of cash flows.
net cash used in investing activities totaled $443.4 million, an increase of $5.9 million from 2013. we increased our capital expenditures and other investments activity in 2014 by $20.4 million and $12.1 million, respectively. these increases in net cash used were more than offset by $35.2 million in less net cash invested in our sponsored funds, as we sold more existing investments to fund the new investments in 2014 compared to the 2013 period. the 2013 year also included $8.6 million in net cash proceeds related to our savings bank subsidiary and its sale in december 2013.
net cash used in financing activities was $739.8 million in 2014, up $463.0 million from the comparable 2013 period. we increased our common stock repurchases by $401.4 million in 2014 compared with the 2013 period. cash used for dividends paid in 2014 increased $65.4 million due primarily to the 16% increase in our per-share dividend rate.
2013 versus 2012.
operating activities during 2013 provided cash flows of $1.2 billion, up $330.4 million from the 2012 period, including a $164.1 million increase in net income. timing differences in the cash settlement of our accounts receivable and accrued revenues, payables and accrued liabilities, and other assets and liabilities increased our operating cash flows by $62.4 million compared to the 2012 year. the increase from 2012 is also a result of a $63.7 million reduction in cash used to make net purchases of trading securities held by our consolidated sponsored investment portfolios and a $21.6 million reduction in the adjustment for gains realized from the sale of certain available-for-sale sponsored fund investments as less investments were sold in 2013.
net cash used in investing activities totaled $437.5 million, up $127.4 million from 2012. we made $60.1 million more net investments in our sponsored funds during 2013 compared with 2012 as we utilized more of our cash to make additional investments as compared to the rebalancing of the portfolio in 2012. the 2012 year also included greater net cash proceeds of $40.1 million from the sale of debt securities held by our savings bank subsidiary as the bank was sold in early december 2013. we spent $28.9 million more in property and equipment additions in 2013 compared to the 2012 period. the 2013 year also includes a net cash outflow of $11.7 million related to the sale of our savings bank subsidiary as the cash that was held by the bank on the closing date was greater than the $23.6 million in proceeds we received.
net cash used in financing activities was $276.8 million in 2013, down $334.7 million from the comparable 2012 period. the decrease is primarily attributable to the repurchase of 2.1 million more shares of common stock and the payment of a $1.00 special dividend in 2012.

contractual obligations.
the following table presents a summary of our future obligations (in millions) under the terms of existing operating leases and other contractual cash purchase commitments at december 31, 2014. other purchase commitments include contractual amounts that will be due for the purchase of goods or services to be used in our operations and may be cancelable at earlier times than those indicated, under certain conditions that may involve termination fees. because these obligations are generally of a normal recurring nature, we expect that we will fund them from future cash flows from operations. the information presented does not include operating expenses or capital expenditures that will be committed in the normal course of operations in 2015 and future years. the information also excludes the $5.6 million of unrecognized tax benefits discussed in note 7 to our consolidated financial statements because it is not possible to estimate the time period in which a payment might be made to the tax authorities.

we also have outstanding commitments to fund additional contributions to investment partnerships totaling $36.6 million at december 31, 2014. the vast majority of these additional contributions will be made to investment partnerships in which we have an existing investment. in addition to such amounts, a percentage of prior distributions may be called under certain circumstances.
critical accounting policies.
the preparation of financial statements often requires the selection of specific accounting methods and policies from among several acceptable alternatives. further, significant estimates and judgments may be required in selecting and applying those methods and policies in the recognition of the assets and liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets, the revenues and expenses in our consolidated statements of income, and the information that is contained in our significant accounting policies and notes to consolidated financial statements. making these estimates and judgments requires the analysis of information concerning events that may not yet be complete and of facts and circumstances that may change over time. accordingly, actual amounts or future results can differ materially from those estimates that we include currently in our consolidated financial statements, significant accounting policies, and notes.
we present those significant accounting policies used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements as an integral part of those statements within this 2014 annual report. in the following discussion, we highlight and explain further certain of those policies that are most critical to the preparation and understanding of our financial statements.
other-than-temporary impairments of available-for-sale securities. we generally classify our investment holdings in sponsored funds as available-for-sale if we are not deemed to a have a controlling financial interest. at the end of each quarter, we mark the carrying amount of each investment holding to fair value and recognize an unrealized gain or loss as a component of comprehensive income within the consolidated statements of comprehensive income. we next review each individual security position that has an unrealized loss or impairment to determine if that impairment is other than temporary.
in determining whether a mutual fund holding is other-than-temporarily impaired, we consider many factors, including the duration of time the impairment has existed, the severity of the impairment, any subsequent changes in value, and our intent and ability to hold the security for a period of time sufficient for an anticipated recovery in fair value. subject to the other considerations noted above, we believe a fund holding with an unrealized loss that has persisted daily throughout the six months between quarter-ends is generally presumed to have an other-than-temporary impairment. we may also recognize an other-than-temporary impairment for losses that have existed for less than six months in our consolidated statements of income if the particular circumstances of the underlying investment do not warrant our belief that a near-term recovery is possible.
other-than-temporary impairments of equity method investments. we evaluate our equity method investments, including our investment in uti, for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the investment exceeds its fair value, and the decline in fair value is other than temporary.

goodwill. we internally conduct, manage, and report our operations as one investment advisory business. we do not have distinct operating segments or components that separately constitute a business. accordingly, we attribute goodwill to a single reportable business segment and reporting unit - our investment advisory business.
we evaluate the carrying amount of goodwill in our consolidated balance sheets for possible impairment on an annual basis in the third quarter of each year using a fair value approach. goodwill would be considered impaired whenever our historical carrying amount exceeds the fair value of our investment advisory business. our annual testing has demonstrated that the fair value of our investment advisory business (our market capitalization) exceeds our carrying amount (our stockholders' equity) and, therefore, no impairment exists. should we reach a different conclusion in the future, additional work would be performed to ascertain the amount of the noncash impairment charge to be recognized. we must also perform impairment testing at other times if an event or circumstance occurs indicating that it is more likely than not that an impairment has been incurred. the maximum future impairment of goodwill that we could incur is the amount recognized in our consolidated balance sheets, $665.7 million.
stock options. we recognize stock option-based compensation expense in our consolidated statements of income using a fair value based method. fair value methods use a valuation model for shorter-term, market-traded financial instruments to theoretically value stock option grants even though they are not available for trading and are of longer duration. the black-scholes option-pricing model that we use includes the input of certain variables that are dependent on future expectations, including the expected lives of our options from grant date to exercise date, the volatility of our underlying common shares in the market over that time period, and the rate of dividends that we will pay during that time. our estimates of these variables are made for the purpose of using the valuation model to determine an expense for each reporting period and are not subsequently adjusted. unlike most of our expenses, the resulting charge to earnings using a fair value based method is a non-cash charge that is never measured by, or adjusted based on, a cash outflow.
provision for income taxes. after compensation and related costs, our provision for income taxes on our earnings is our largest annual expense. we operate in numerous states and countries through our various subsidiaries and must allocate our income, expenses, and earnings under the various laws and regulations of each of these taxing jurisdictions. accordingly, our provision for income taxes represents our total estimate of the liability that we have incurred in doing business each year in all of our locations. annually, we file tax returns that represent our filing positions with each jurisdiction and settle our return liabilities. each jurisdiction has the right to audit those returns and may take different positions with respect to income and expense allocations and taxable earnings determinations. from time to time, we may also provide for estimated liabilities associated with uncertain tax return filing positions that are subject to, or in the process of, being audited by various tax authorities. because the determination of our annual provision is subject to judgments and estimates, it is likely that actual results will vary from those recognized in our financial statements. as a result, we recognize additions to, or reductions of, income tax expense during a reporting period that pertain to prior period provisions as our estimated liabilities are revised and actual tax returns and tax audits are settled. we recognize any such prior period adjustment in the discrete quarterly period in which it is determined.
newly issued but not yet adopted accounting guidance.
in may 2014, the fasb issued accounting standards update no. 2014-09 - revenue from contracts with customers. the objective of the new standard is to provide a single, comprehensive revenue recognition model for all contracts with customers to improve comparability within industries, across industries, and across capital markets. the revenue standard contains principles that will be applied to determine the measurement of revenue and timing of when it is recognized. we are required to adopt the new standard on january 1, 2017. we are currently evaluating the impact this standard will have on our financial position and results of operations.
we have considered all newly issued accounting guidance that is applicable to our operations and the preparation of our consolidated financial statements, including that which we have not yet adopted. we do not believe that any such guidance will have a material effect on our financial position or results of operation.

forward-looking information.
from time to time, information or statements provided by or on behalf of t. rowe price, including those within this report, may contain certain forward-looking information, including information or anticipated information relating to: our revenues, net income, and earnings per share on common stock; changes in the amount and composition of our assets under management; our expense levels; our estimated effective income tax rate; and our expectations regarding financial markets, future transactions, dividends, investments, capital expenditures, and other conditions. readers are cautioned that any forward-looking information provided by or on behalf of t. rowe price is not a guarantee of future performance. actual results may differ materially from those in forward-looking information because of various factors including, but not limited to, those discussed below and in item 1a, risk factors, of this form 10-k annual report. further, forward-looking statements speak only as of the date on which they are made, and we undertake no obligation to update any forward-looking statement to reflect events or circumstances after the date on which it is made or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events.
our future revenues and results of operations will fluctuate primarily due to changes in the total value and composition of assets under our management. such changes result from many factors including, among other things: cash inflows and outflows in the t. rowe price mutual funds and other managed investment portfolios, fluctuations in global financial markets that result in appreciation or depreciation of the assets under our management, our introduction of new mutual funds and investment portfolios, and changes in retirement savings trends relative to participant-directed investments and defined contribution plans. the ability to attract and retain investors' assets under our management is dependent on investor sentiment and confidence; the relative investment performance of the price mutual funds and other managed investment portfolios as compared to competing offerings and market indexes; the ability to maintain our investment management and administrative fees at appropriate levels; competitive conditions in the mutual fund, asset management, and broader financial services sectors; and our level of success in implementing our strategy to expand our business. our revenues are substantially dependent on fees earned under contracts with the price funds and could be adversely affected if the independent directors of one or more of the price funds terminated or significantly altered the terms of the investment management or related administrative services agreements. non-operating investment income will also fluctuate primarily due to the size of our investments, changes in their market valuations, and any other-than-temporary impairments that may arise or, in the case of our equity method investments, our proportionate share of the investee's net income.
our future results are also dependent upon the level of our expenses, which are subject to fluctuation for the following or other reasons: changes in the level of our advertising expenses in response to market conditions, including our efforts to expand our investment advisory business to investors outside the u.s. and to further penetrate our distribution channels within the u.s.; variations in the level of total compensation expense due to, among other things, bonuses, stock option and other equity grants, other incentive awards, changes in our employee count and mix, and competitive factors; any goodwill or other asset impairment that may arise; fluctuation in foreign currency exchange rates applicable to the costs of our international operations; expenses and capital costs, such as technology assets, depreciation, amortization, and research and development, incurred to maintain and enhance our administrative and operating services infrastructure; unanticipated costs that may be incurred to protect investor accounts and the goodwill of our clients; and disruptions of services, including those provided by third parties, such as facilities, communications, power, and the mutual fund transfer agent and accounting systems.
our business is also subject to substantial governmental regulation, and changes in legal, regulatory, accounting, tax, and compliance requirements may have a substantial effect on our operations and results, including, but not limited to, effects on costs that we incur and effects on investor interest in mutual funds and investing in general or in particular classes of mutual funds or other investments.

risk factors to be

table of contents considered in determining the allowance for credit losses, we have determined that the long-term receivables from farmers in brazil are a single portfolio segment.
we evaluate this single portfolio segment by class of receivables, which is defined as a level of information
(below a portfolio segment) in which the receivables have the same initial measurement attribute and a similar method for assessing and monitoring risk. we have identified accounts in legal collection processes and renegotiated amounts as classes of long-term receivables from farmers. valuation allowances for accounts in legal collection processes are determined by us on individual accounts based on the fair value of the collateral provided as security for the secured advance or credit sale. the fair value is determined using a combination of internal and external resources, including published information concerning brazilian land values by region. for determination of the valuation allowances for renegotiated amounts, we consider historical experience with the individual farmers, current weather and crop conditions, as well as the fair value of non-crop collateral.
for both classes, a long-term receivable from farmers in brazil is considered impaired, based on current information and events, if we determine it to be probable that all amounts due under the original terms of the receivable will not be collected. recognition of interest income on secured advances to farmers is suspended once the farmer defaults on the originally scheduled delivery of agricultural commodities as the collection of future income is determined not to be probable. no additional interest income is accrued from the point of default until ultimate recovery, where amounts collected are credited first against the receivable and then to any unrecognized interest income.
inventories and derivatives we use derivative instruments for the purpose of managing the exposures associated with agricultural commodity prices, transportation costs, foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates and energy costs and for positioning our overall portfolio relative to expected market movements in accordance with established policies and procedures.
we are exposed to loss in the event of non-performance by counterparties to certain of these contracts. the risk of non-performance is routinely monitored and adjustments recorded, if necessary, to account for potential non-
performance. different assumptions, changes in economic circumstances or the deterioration of the financial condition of the counterparties to these derivative instruments could result in additional fair value adjustments and increased expense reflected in cost of goods sold, foreign exchange or interest expense. we did not have significant allowances relating to non-performance by counterparties at december 31, 2014 or 2013.
our readily marketable commodity inventories, forward purchase and sale contracts, and exchange traded futures and options are primarily valued at fair value. readily marketable inventories are freely-traded, have quoted market prices, may be sold without significant additional processing and have predictable and insignificant disposal costs. we estimate fair values of commodity inventories and forward purchase and sale contracts based on exchange-
quoted prices, adjusted for differences in local markets. changes in the fair values of these inventories and contracts are recognized in our consolidated statements of income as a component of cost of goods sold. if we used different methods or factors to estimate fair values, amounts reported as inventories and unrealized gains and losses on derivative contracts in the consolidated balance sheets and cost of goods sold could differ.
additionally, if market conditions change subsequent to year-end, amounts reported in future periods as inventories, unrealized gains and losses on derivative contracts and cost of goods sold could differ.
recoverable taxes we evaluate the collectability of our recoverable taxes and record valuation allowances if we determine that collection is doubtful. recoverable taxes primarily represent value-added or other similar transactional taxes paid on the acquisition of raw materials and other services which can be
61
table of contents recovered in cash or as compensation of outstanding balances against income taxes or certain other taxes we may owe. management's assumption about the collectability of recoverable taxes requires significant judgment because it involves an assessment of the ability and willingness of the applicable federal or local government to refund the taxes. the balance of these allowances fluctuates depending on the sales activity of existing inventories, purchases of new inventories, percentages of export sales, seasonality, changes in applicable tax rates, cash payment by the applicable government agencies and compensation of outstanding balances against income or certain other taxes owed to the applicable governments. at december 31, 2014 and 2013, the allowance for recoverable taxes was $43 million and $70 million, respectively. we continue to monitor the economic environment and events taking place in the applicable countries and in cases where we determine that recovery is doubtful, recoverable taxes are reduced by allowances for the estimated unrecoverable amounts.
property, plant and equipment and other finite-lived intangible assets long-lived assets include property, plant and equipment and other finite-lived intangible assets. when facts and circumstances indicate that the carrying values of property, plant and equipment assets may be impaired, an evaluation of recoverability is performed by comparing the carrying value of the assets to the projected future cash flows to be generated by such assets. if it appears that the carrying value of our assets is not recoverable, we recognize an impairment loss as a charge against results of operations. our judgments related to the expected useful lives of property, plant and equipment assets and our ability to realize undiscounted cash flows in excess of the carrying amount of such assets are affected by factors such as the ongoing maintenance of the assets, changes in economic conditions and changes in operating performance. as we assess the ongoing expected cash flows and carrying amounts of our property, plant and equipment assets, changes in these factors could cause us to realize material impairment charges. bunge recorded impairment charges of $114 million for certain agricultural and industrial assets in its sugar and bioenergy segment during the year ended december 31, 2014.
contingencies we are a party to a large number of claims and lawsuits, primarily tax and labor claims in brazil and tax claims in argentina, and have accrued our estimates of the probable costs to resolve these claims. these estimates have been developed in consultation with in-house and outside counsel and are based on an analysis of potential results, assuming a combination of litigation and settlement strategies. future results of operations for any particular quarterly or annual period could be materially affected by changes in our assumptions or the effectiveness of our strategies relating to these proceedings. for more information on tax and labor claims in brazil, see "item 3.
legal proceedings."
income taxes we record valuation allowances to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that we are likely to realize. we consider projections of future taxable income and prudent tax planning strategies to assess the need for and the size of the valuation allowances. if we determine that we can realize a deferred tax asset in excess of our net recorded amount, we decrease the valuation allowance, thereby increasing net income. conversely, if we determine that we are unable to realize all or part of our net deferred tax asset, we increase the valuation allowance, thereby decreasing net income.
62
table of contents we apply a "more likely than not" threshold to the recognition and de-recognition of tax benefits. the calculation of our uncertain tax positions involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations in a multitude of jurisdictions across our global operations. we recognize potential liabilities and record uncertain tax positions for anticipated tax audit issues in the united states, brazil, argentina and other tax jurisdictions based on our estimate of whether it is more likely than not additional taxes will be due. we adjust these liabilities in light of changing facts and circumstances; however, due to the complexity of some of these uncertainties, the ultimate resolution may result in a payment that is materially different from our current estimate of the tax liabilities. if our estimate of uncertain tax positions proves to be less than the ultimate assessment, an additional charge to expense would result. if payment of these amounts ultimately proves to be less than the recorded amounts, the reversal of the liabilities would result in tax benefits being recognized in the period when we determined the liabilities are no longer necessary. at december 31, 2014 and 2013, we had recorded uncertain tax positions of $83 million and $171 million, respectively, in our consolidated balance sheets.
new accounting pronouncements new accounting pronouncementsin may 2014, the fasb amended asc (topic 605)revenue recognitionand created asc
(topic 606)revenue from contracts with customers. the core principle of the guidance is that an entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. the standard is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after december 15, 2016. early application is not permitted. bunge is evaluating the expected impact of this standard on its consolidated financial statements.
in february 2015, the fasb issued asu (topic 810)consolidationamendments to the consolidation analysis.the standard makes targeted amendments to the current consolidation guidance and ends the deferral granted to investment companies from applying the variable interest entity (vie) guidance. the standard is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after december 15, 2015. early adoption is allowed. bunge is evaluating the expected impact of this standard on the consolidation of certain private equity and other investment funds related to our asset management business.
item 7a.quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk risk management as a result of our global operating and financing activities, we are exposed to changes in, among other things, agricultural commodity prices, transportation costs, foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates and energy costs which may affect our results of operations and financial position. we actively monitor and manage these various market risks associated with our business activities. our risk management decisions take place in various locations but exposure limits are centrally set and monitored. we have a corporate risk management group which analyzes and monitors various risk exposures globally. additionally, our board of directors' finance and risk policy committee oversees our overall risk management policies and limits.
we use derivative instruments for the purpose of managing the exposures associated with commodity prices, transportation costs, foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates and energy costs and for positioning our overall portfolio relative to expected market movements in accordance with established policies and procedures. we enter into derivative instruments primarily with major financial institutions, commodity exchanges in the case of commodity futures and options, or approved exchange-clearing shipping companies in the case of ocean freight. while these derivative instruments are subject to fluctuations in value, for hedged exposures those fluctuations are generally offset by the changes in
63
table of contents fair value of the underlying exposures. the derivative instruments that we use for hedging purposes are intended to reduce the volatility on our results of operations; however, they can occasionally result in earnings volatility, which may be material.
credit and counterparty risk through our normal business activities, we are subject to significant credit and counterparty risks that arise through normal commercial sales and purchases, including forward commitments to buy or sell, and through various other otc derivative instruments that we utilize to manage risks inherent in our business activities. we define credit and counterparty risk as a potential financial loss due to the failure of a counterparty to honor its obligations. the exposure is measured based upon several factors, including unpaid accounts receivable from counterparties and unrealized gains from otc derivative instruments (including forward purchase and sale contracts). credit and counterparty risk also includes sovereign credit risk. we actively monitor credit and counterparty risk through credit analysis by local credit staffs and review by various local and corporate committees which monitor counterparty performance. we record provisions for counterparty losses from time to time as a result of our credit and counterparty analysis.
during periods of tight conditions in global credit markets, downturns in regional or global economic conditions, and/or significant price volatility, credit and counterparty risks are heightened. this increased risk is monitored through, among other things, increased communication with key counterparties, management reviews and specific focus on counterparties or groups of counterparties that we may determine as high risk. in addition, we have limited new credit extensions in certain cases and reduced our use of non-exchange cleared derivative instruments.
commodities risk we operate in many areas of the food industry, from agricultural raw materials to the production and sale of branded food products. as a result, we purchase and produce various materials, many of which are agricultural commodities, including: soybeans, soybean oil, soybean meal, softseeds (including sunflower seed, rapeseed and canola) and related oil and meal derived from them, wheat and corn. in addition, we grow and purchase sugarcane to produce sugar, ethanol and electricity. agricultural commodities are subject to price fluctuations due to a number of unpredictable factors that may create price risk. as described above, we are also subject to the risk of counterparty non-performance under forward purchase or sale contracts. from time to time, we have experienced instances of counterparty non-performance, including as a result of significant declines in counterparty profitability under these contracts due to significant movements in commodity prices between the time the contracts were executed and the contractual forward delivery period.
we enter into various derivative contracts with the primary objective of managing our exposure to adverse price movements in the agricultural commodities used and produced in our business operations. we have established policies that limit the amount of unhedged fixed price agricultural commodity positions permissible for our operating companies, which are generally a combination of volume and value-at-risk ("var") limits. we measure and review our net commodities position on a daily basis.
our daily net agricultural commodity position consists of inventory, forward purchase and sale contracts, otc and exchange traded derivative instruments, including those used to hedge portions of our production requirements. the fair value of that position is a summation of the fair values calculated for each agricultural commodity by valuing all of our commodity positions at quoted market prices for the period where available or utilizing a close proxy.
var is calculated on the net position and monitored at the 95% confidence interval. in addition, scenario analysis and stress testing are performed. for example, one measure of market risk is estimated as the potential loss in fair value

position value ocean freight risk ocean freight represents a significant portion of our operating costs. the market price for ocean freight varies depending on the supply and demand for ocean vessels, global economic conditions and other factors. we enter into time charter agreements for time on ocean freight vessels based on forecasted requirements for the purpose of transporting agricultural commodities. our time charter agreements generally have terms ranging from two months to approximately seven years. we use financial derivatives, generally freight forward agreements, to hedge portions of our ocean freight costs. the ocean freight derivatives are included in other current assets and other current liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets at fair value.
energy risk we purchase various energy commodities such as bunker fuel, electricity and natural gas that are used to operate our manufacturing facilities and ocean freight vessels. the energy commodities are subject to price risk. we use financial derivatives, including exchange traded and otc swaps and options for various purposes, including to manage our exposure to volatility in energy costs. these energy derivatives are included in other current assets and other current liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets at fair value.
currency risk our global operations require active participation in foreign exchange markets. our primary foreign currency exposures are the brazilianreal, the euroand other european currencies, the argentine pesoand the chineseyuan/renminbi. to reduce the risk arising from foreign exchange rate fluctuations, we enter into derivative instruments, such as forward contracts and swaps and foreign currency options. the changes in market value of such contracts have a high correlation to the price changes in the related currency exposures. the potential loss in fair value for such net currency position resulting from a hypothetical 10% adverse change in foreign currency exchange rates as of december 31, 2014 was not material.
we have significant operations in argentina. we utilize the official exchange rate published by the argentine government for our commercial transactions and re-measurement purposes of financial statements. due to exchange controls put in place by the argentine government, a parallel market exists for exchanging argentine pesos to u.s.
dollars at rates less favorable than the official rate. the argentinepesoexperienced increased devaluation and volatility in 2014. our financial position and results of operations are not materially impacted; however we continue to monitor political and economic conditions, including inflation in argentina.
when determining our exposure, we exclude intercompany loans that are deemed to be permanently invested. the repayments of permanently invested intercompany loans are not planned or anticipated in the foreseeable future and therefore are treated as analogous to equity for accounting purposes. as a result, the foreign exchange gains and losses on these borrowings are excluded from the determination of net income and recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive
65
table of contents income (loss) in the consolidated balance sheets. included in other comprehensive income (loss) are foreign exchange losses of $296 million and $344 million for the years ended december 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively, related to permanently invested intercompany loans.
interest rate risk we have debt in fixed and floating rate instruments. we are exposed to market risk due to changes in interest rates. we may enter into interest rate swap agreements to manage our interest rate exposure related to our debt portfolio.
the aggregate fair value of our short and long-term debt, including non-recourse investment fund debt, based on market yields at december 31, 2014, was $4,062 million with a carrying value of $3,857 million.
a hypothetical 100 basis point increase in the interest yields on our debt at december 31, 2014 would result in a decrease of approximately $58 million in the fair value of our debt. similarly, a decrease of 100 basis points in the interest yields on our debt at december 31, 2014 would cause an increase of approximately $61 million in the fair value of our debt.
a hypothetical 1% change in libor would result in a change of approximately $18 million in our interest expense.
some of our variable rate debt is denominated in currencies other than in u.s. dollars and is indexed to non-u.s.
dollar-based interest rate indices, such as euribor and tjlp. as such, the hypothetical 1% change in interest rate ignores the potential impact of any currency movements.
derivative instruments interest rate derivativesinterest rate derivatives used by us as hedging instruments are recorded at fair value in the consolidated balance sheets with changes in fair value recorded contemporaneously in earnings. certain of these swap agreements may be designated as fair value hedges. the carrying amount of the associated hedged debt is also adjusted through earnings for changes in the fair value arising from changes in benchmark interest rates.
ineffectiveness is recognized to the extent that these two adjustments do not offset. we may enter into interest rate swap agreements for the purpose of managing certain of our interest rate exposures. we may also enter into interest rate basis swap agreements that do not qualify as hedges for accounting purposes. changes in fair value of such interest rate basis swap agreements are recorded in earnings. there were no outstanding interest rate swap agreements as of december 31, 2014 or 2013.
we recognized gains of approximately $12 million, $20 million and $20 million, respectively, as a reduction of interest expense in the consolidated statements of income, related to the amortization of deferred gains on termination of interest rate swap agreements for the years ended december 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012.
foreign exchange derivativeswe use a combination of foreign exchange forward swap and option contracts in certain of our operations to mitigate the risk from exchange rate fluctuations in connection with certain commercial and balance sheet exposures. the foreign exchange forward swap and option contracts may be designated as cash flow hedges. we may also use net investment hedges to partially offset the translation adjustments arising from the remeasurement of our investment in certain of our foreign subsidiaries.
we assess, both at the inception of the hedge and on an ongoing basis, whether the derivatives that are used in hedge transactions are highly effective in offsetting changes in the hedged items.

commodity derivativeswe use derivative instruments to primarily manage exposure to movements associated with agricultural commodity prices. we generally use exchange traded futures and options contracts to minimize the effects of changes in the prices of agricultural commodities on agricultural commodity inventories and forward purchase and sale contracts, but may also from time to time enter into otc commodity transactions, including swaps, which are settled in cash at maturity or termination based on exchange-quoted futures prices. changes in fair values of exchange traded futures contracts representing the unrealized gains and/or losses on these instruments are settled daily generally through our 100% owned futures clearing subsidiary. forward purchase and sale contracts are primarily settled through delivery of agricultural commodities. while we consider these exchange traded futures and forward purchase and sale contracts to be effective economic hedges, we do not designate or account for the majority of our commodity contracts as hedges. changes in fair values of these contracts and related readily marketable agricultural commodity inventories are included in cost of goods sold in the consolidated statements of income. the forward contracts require performance of both us and the contract counterparty in future periods.
contracts to purchase agricultural commodities generally relate to current or future crop years for delivery periods quoted by regulated commodity exchanges. contracts for the sale of agricultural commodities generally do not extend beyond one future crop cycle.

table of contents item 9a.controls and procedures disclosure controls and procedures disclosure controls and procedures are the controls and other procedures that are designed to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by the issuer in the reports that it files or submits under the exchange act of 1934, as amended (the "exchange act") is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the securities and exchange commission's rules and forms. disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by an issuer in the reports that it files or submits under the exchange act is accumulated and communicated to the issuer's management, including the principal executive and principal financial officer, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.
as of december 31, 2014, we carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures, as that term is defined in exchange act rules 13a-15(e)
and 15d-15(e), as of the end of the period covered by this annual report on form 10-k. based upon that evaluation, our chief executive officer and chief financial officer have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level as of the end of the fiscal year covered by this annual report on form 10-k.
management's report on internal control over financial reporting bunge limited's management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in exchange act rules 13a-15(f). bunge limited's internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with u.s. generally accepted accounting principles.
under the supervision and with the participation of management, including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of the end of the fiscal year covered by this annual report based on the framework ininternal controlintegrated framework (2013)issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission (coso).
based on this assessment, management concluded that bunge limited's internal control over financial reporting was effective as of the end of the fiscal year covered by this annual report.
deloitte & touche llp, the independent registered public accounting firm that has audited and reported on bunge limited's consolidated financial statements included in this annual report, has issued its written attestation report on bunge limited's internal control over financial reporting, which is included in this annual report on form 10-k.
changes in internal control over financial reporting there has been no change in our internal control over financial reporting during the fourth fiscal quarter ended december 31, 2014 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
inherent limitations on effectiveness of controls our management, including our chief executive officer and our chief financial officer, does not expect that our disclosure controls or our internal control over financial reporting will prevent or detect
69
table of contents all errors and all fraud. a control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the control system's objectives will be met. the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. further, because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that misstatements due to error or fraud will not occur or that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within the company have been detected. these inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake.
controls may also be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people or by management override of the controls. the design of any system of controls is based in part on certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions. projections of any evaluation of controls effectiveness to future periods are subject to risks. over time, controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or deterioration in the degree of compliance with policies or procedures.

table of contents report of independent registered public accounting firm to the board of directors and shareholders of bunge limited white plains, new york we have audited the internal control over financial reporting of bunge limited and subsidiaries (the "company") as of december 31, 2014, based on criteria established in internal controlintegrated framework (2013)issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission. the company's management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanyingmanagement's report on internal control over financial reporting. our responsibility is to express an opinion on the company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.
we conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the public company accounting oversight board (united states). those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. we believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
a company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the company's principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, and effected by the company's board of directors, management, and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. a company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
because of the inherent limitations of internal control over financial reporting, including the possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls, material misstatements due to error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. also, projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that the controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
in our opinion, the company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of december 31, 2014, based on the criteria established in internal controlintegrated framework
(2013)issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission.
we have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the public company accounting oversight board (united states), the consolidated financial statements and financial statement schedule as of and for the year ended december 31, 2014 of the company and our report dated february 27, 2015 expressed an unqualified opinion on the consolidated financial statements and financial statement schedule.

we conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the public company accounting oversight board (united states). those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. an audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. an audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. we believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
in our opinion, such consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of bunge limited and subsidiaries as of december 31, 2014 and 2013, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended december 31, 2014, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america. also, in our opinion, such financial statement schedule, when considered in relation to the basic consolidated financial statements taken as a whole, presents fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth therein.

table of contents bunge limited and subsidiaries notes to the consolidated financial statements
1. nature of business, basis of presentation, and significant accounting policies description of businessbunge limited, a bermuda holding company, together with its consolidated subsidiaries and variable interest entities ("vies") in which it is considered the primary beneficiary, through which its businesses are conducted (collectively "bunge"), is an integrated, global agribusiness and food company. bunge's common shares trade on the new york stock exchange under the ticker symbol "bg." bunge operates in four principal business areas, which include five reportable segments: agribusiness, edible oil products, milling products, sugar and bioenergy and fertilizer.
agribusinessbunge's agribusiness segment is an integrated business involved in the purchase, storage, transport, processing and sale of agricultural commodities and commodity products. bunge's agribusiness operations and assets are located in north america, south america, europe and asia-pacific with merchandising and distribution offices throughout the world.
bunge's agribusiness segment also participates in related financial activities, such as offering trade structured finance, which leverages its international trade flows, providing risk management services to customers by assisting them with managing price exposure to agricultural commodities, proprietary trading of foreign exchange and other financial instruments and developing private investment vehicles to invest in businesses complementary to bunge's commodities operations.
edible oil productsbunge's edible oil products segment produces and sells edible oil products, such as packaged and bulk oils, shortenings, margarine, mayonnaise and other products derived from the vegetable oil refining process. bunge's edible oil products operations are located in north america, south america, europe and asia-
pacific.
milling productsbunge's milling products segment includes wheat, corn and rice milling businesses, which purchase wheat, corn and rice directly from growers and dealers and process them into milled products for food processors, bakeries, brewers, snack food producers and other customers. bunge's wheat milling activities are primarily in mexico and brazil. corn and rice milling activities are in the united states.
sugar and bioenergybunge's sugar and bioenergy segment includes its global sugar merchandising and distribution activities, sugar and ethanol production in brazil, and ethanol production investments. this segment is an integrated business involved in the growing and harvesting of sugarcane from land owned or managed through agricultural partnership agreements and additional sourcing of sugarcane from third parties to be processed at its eight mills in brazil to produce sugar, ethanol and electricity. the sugar and bioenergy segment is also a merchandiser and distributor of sugar and ethanol within brazil and a global merchandiser and distributor of sugar through its global trading offices. in addition, the segment includes investments in corn-based ethanol producers in the united states and argentina.
fertilizerbunge's fertilizer segment operates primarily as a producer and blender of npk (nitrogen, phosphate and potassium) fertilizer formulas, including phosphate based liquid and solid nitrogen fertilizers through its operations in argentina to farmers and distributors in argentina, uruguay, paraguay and bolivia. this segment also includes the operations of fertilizer ports in brazil and argentina.
historically, bunge was involved in every stage of the fertilizer business in brazil, from mining of phosphate-
based raw materials to the sale of blended fertilizer products. in may 2010, bunge sold its fertilizer nutrients assets in brazil, including its phosphate mining assets and its investment in f-8

1. nature of business, basis of presentation, and significant accounting policies (continued)
fosfertil s.a., a phosphate and nitrogen producer. bunge sold its brazilian fertilizer distribution business, including blending facilities, brands and warehouses to yara international asa ("yara") in 2013, for $750 million in cash. as a result of the transaction, bunge no longer has significant ongoing cash flows related to the brazilian fertilizer business or any significant ongoing participation in the operations of this business (see note
3).
basis of presentationthe consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america ("u.s. gaap").
discontinued operationsin determining whether a group of assets disposed (or to be disposed) of should be presented as discontinued operations, bunge makes a determination of whether the group of assets being disposed of comprises a component of the entity; that is, whether it has historical operations and cash flows that can be clearly distinguished (both operationally and for financial reporting purposes). bunge also determines whether the cash flows associated with the group of assets have been or will be significantly eliminated from the ongoing operations of bunge as a result of the disposal transaction and whether bunge has no significant continuing involvement in the operations of the group of assets after the disposal transaction. if these determinations are made affirmatively, the results of operations of the group of assets being disposed of (as well as any gain or loss on the disposal transaction) are aggregated for separate presentation apart from the continuing operations of the company for all periods presented in the consolidated financial statements (see note 3).
principles of consolidationthe accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of bunge, its subsidiaries and vies in which bunge is considered to be the primary beneficiary, and as a result, include the assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses of all entities over which bunge exercises control. equity investments in which bunge has the ability to exercise significant influence but does not control are accounted for by the equity method of accounting. investments in which bunge does not exercise significant influence are accounted for by the cost method of accounting. intercompany accounts and transactions are eliminated. bunge consolidates vies in which it is considered the primary beneficiary and reconsiders such conclusion at each reporting period. an enterprise is determined to be the primary beneficiary if it has a controlling financial interest under gaap, defined as (a) the power to direct the activities of a vie that most significantly impact the vie's business and
(b) the obligation to absorb losses of or the right to receive benefits from the vie that could potentially be significant to the vie's operations. performance of that analysis requires the exercise of judgment. where bunge has an interest in an entity that has qualified for the deferral of the consolidation rules, it follows consolidation rules prior to january 1, 2010. these rules require an analysis to (a) determine whether an entity in which bunge has a variable interest is a vie and (b) whether bunge's involvement, through the holding of equity interests directly or indirectly in the entity or contractually through other variable interests, would be expected to absorb a majority of the variability of the entity. this latter evaluation resulted in the consolidation of certain private equity and other investment funds (the consolidated funds) related to an asset management business acquisition completed in 2012.
the consolidated funds are, for u.s. gaap purposes, investment companies and therefore are not required to consolidate their majority owned and controlled investments. rather, bunge reflects these investments at fair value. in addition, certain of these consolidated funds have limited partner investors f-9
table of contents bunge limited and subsidiaries notes to the consolidated financial statements (continued)
1. nature of business, basis of presentation, and significant accounting policies (continued)
with investments in the form of equity, which are accounted for as noncontrolling interests and investments in the form of debt for which bunge has elected the fair value option.
noncontrolling interests in subsidiaries related to bunge's ownership interests of less than 100% are reported as noncontrolling interests in the consolidated balance sheets. the noncontrolling ownership interests in bunge's earnings, net of tax, is reported as net (income) loss attributable to noncontrolling interests in the consolidated statements of income.
reclassificationscertain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to current year presentation.
use of estimatesthe preparation of consolidated financial statements requires the application of accounting policies that often involve substantial judgment or estimation in their application. these judgments and estimations may significantly affect reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements. they may also affect reported amounts of revenues and expenses. the policies bunge considers to be most dependent on the application of estimates and assumptions include allowances for doubtful accounts, valuation allowances for recoverable taxes and deferred tax assets, impairment of long-lived assets and unconsolidated affiliates, restructuring charges, useful lives of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets, contingent liabilities, liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits and pension plan obligations. in addition, significant management estimates and assumptions are required in allocating the purchase price paid in business acquisitions to the assets and liabilities acquired (see note 2) and the determination of fair values of level 3 assets and liabilities (see note 15).
translation of foreign currency financial statementsbunge's reporting currency is the u.s. dollar. the functional currency of the majority of bunge's foreign subsidiaries is their local currency and, as such, amounts included in the consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income (loss), cash flows and changes in equity are translated using average exchange rates during each period. assets and liabilities are translated at period-end exchange rates and resulting foreign exchange translation adjustments are recorded in the consolidated balance sheets as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss).
foreign currency transactionsmonetary assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the functional currency are remeasured into their respective functional currencies at exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date. the resulting exchange gain or loss is included in bunge's consolidated statements of income as foreign exchange gain (loss) unless the remeasurement gain or loss relates to an intercompany transaction that is of a long-term investment nature and for which settlement is not planned or anticipated in the foreseeable future. gains or losses arising from translation of such transactions are reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in bunge's consolidated balance sheets.
cash and cash equivalentscash and cash equivalents include time deposits and readily marketable securities with original maturity dates of three months or less at the time of acquisition.
trade accounts receivable and secured advances to supplierstrade accounts receivable and secured advances to suppliers are stated at their historical carrying amounts net of write-offs and allowances for uncollectible accounts. bunge establishes an allowance for uncollectible trade accounts receivable and f-10
table of contents bunge limited and subsidiaries notes to the consolidated financial statements (continued)
1. nature of business, basis of presentation, and significant accounting policies (continued)
secured advances to farmers based on historical experience, farming economics and other market conditions as well as specific customer collection issues. uncollectible accounts are written off when a settlement is reached for an amount below the outstanding historical balance or when bunge has determined that collection is unlikely.
secured advances to suppliers bear interest at contractual rates which reflect current market interest rates at the time of the transaction. there are no deferred fees or costs associated with these receivables. as a result, there are no imputed interest amounts to be amortized under the interest method. interest income is calculated based on the terms of the individual agreements and is recognized on an accrual basis.
bunge follows accounting guidance on the disclosure of the credit quality of financing receivables and the allowance for credit losses which requires information to be disclosed at disaggregated levels, defined as portfolio segments and classes.
under this guidance, a class of receivables is considered impaired, based on current information and events, if bunge determines it probable that all amounts due under the original terms of the receivable will not be collected.
recognition of interest income is suspended once the farmer defaults on the originally scheduled delivery of agricultural commodities as the collection of future income is determined not to be probable. no additional interest income is accrued from the point of default until ultimate recovery, at which time amounts collected are credited first against the receivable and then to any unrecognized interest income.
inventoriesreadily marketable inventories are agricultural commodity inventories that are readily convertible to cash because of their commodity characteristics, widely available markets and international pricing mechanisms. all of bunge's readily marketable inventories are valued at fair value. these agricultural commodity inventories have quoted market prices in active markets, may be sold without significant further processing and have predictable and insignificant disposal costs. changes in the fair values of merchandisable agricultural commodities inventories are recognized in earnings as a component of cost of goods sold.
inventories other than readily marketable inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market by inventory product class. cost is determined using primarily the weighted-average cost method.
derivative instruments and hedging activitiesbunge enters into derivative instruments to manage its exposure to movements associated with agricultural commodity prices, transportation costs, foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates and energy costs. bunge's use of these instruments is generally intended to mitigate the exposure to market variables (see note 15).
generally, derivative instruments are recorded at fair value in other current assets or other current liabilities in bunge's consolidated balance sheets. bunge assesses, both at the inception of a hedge and on an ongoing basis, whether any derivatives designated as hedges are highly effective in offsetting changes in the hedged items. the effective and ineffective portions of changes in fair values of derivative instruments designated as fair value hedges, along with the gains or losses on the related hedged items are recorded in earnings in the consolidated statements of income in the same caption as the hedged items. the effective portion of changes in fair values of derivative instruments that are designated as cash flow hedges are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) and are f-11
table of contents bunge limited and subsidiaries notes to the consolidated financial statements (continued)
1. nature of business, basis of presentation, and significant accounting policies (continued)
reclassified to earnings when the hedged cash flows are realized or when the hedge is no longer considered to be effective. in addition, bunge may designate certain derivative instruments as net investment hedges to hedge the exposure associated with its equity investments in foreign operations. the effective portions of changes in the fair values of net investment hedges, which are evaluated based on forward rates, are recorded in the foreign exchange translation adjustment component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in the consolidated balance sheets and the ineffective portions of such derivative instruments are recorded in foreign exchange gains
(losses) in the consolidated statements of income.
recoverable taxesrecoverable taxes include value-added taxes paid upon the acquisition of raw materials and taxable services and other transactional taxes which can be recovered in cash or as compensation against income taxes or other taxes owed by bunge, primarily in brazil. these recoverable tax payments are included in other current assets or other non-current assets based on their expected realization. in cases where bunge determines that recovery is doubtful, recoverable taxes are reduced by allowances for the estimated unrecoverable amounts.
property, plant and equipment, netproperty, plant and equipment, net is stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and depletion. major improvements that extend the life, capacity or efficiency or improve the safety of an asset are capitalized, while maintenance and repairs are expensed as incurred. costs related to legal obligations associated with the future retirement of capitalized assets are capitalized as part of the cost of the related asset. bunge generally capitalizes eligible costs to acquire or develop internal-use software that are incurred during the application development stage. interest costs on borrowings during construction/completion periods of major capital projects are also capitalized.
included in property, plant and equipment are biological assets, primarily sugarcane, that are stated at cost less accumulated depletion. depletion is calculated using the estimated units of production based on the remaining useful life of the growing sugarcane. depreciation is computed based on the straight line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets.
useful lives for property, plant and equipment are as follows:
years biological assets                5 - 6
buildings                        10 - 50
machinery and equipment          7 - 25
furniture, fixtures and other    3 - 20
computer software                3 - 10
goodwillgoodwill represents the cost in excess of the fair value of net assets acquired in a business acquisition.
goodwill is not amortized but is tested annually for impairment or between annual tests if events or circumstances indicate potential impairment. bunge's annual impairment testing is generally performed during the fourth quarter of its fiscal year.
f-12
table of contents bunge limited and subsidiaries notes to the consolidated financial statements (continued)
1. nature of business, basis of presentation, and significant accounting policies (continued)
goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level. for the majority of bunge's recorded goodwill, the reporting unit is equivalent to bunge's reportable segments (see note 8).
impairment of property, plant and equipment and finite-lived intangible assetsfinite-lived intangible assets include primarily trademarks, customer lists and port facility usage rights and are amortized on a straight-line basis over their contractual or legal lives (see note 9) or their estimated useful lives where such lives are not determined by law or contract.
bunge reviews its property, plant and equipment and finite-lived intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that carrying amounts may not be recoverable. bunge bases its evaluation of recoverability on such indicators as the nature, future economic benefits and geographic locations of the assets, historical or future profitability measures and other external market conditions. if these indicators result in the expected non-recoverability of the carrying amount of an asset or asset group, bunge evaluates potential impairment using undiscounted estimated future cash flows. if such undiscounted future cash flows during the asset's remaining useful life are below its carrying value, a loss is recognized for the shortfall, measured by the present value of the estimated future cash flows or by third-party appraisals. bunge records impairments related to property, plant and equipment and finite-lived intangible assets used in the processing of its products in cost of goods sold in its consolidated statements of income. any impairment of marketing or brand assets is recognized in selling, general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of income (see note 10).
property, plant and equipment and other finite-lived intangible assets to be sold or otherwise disposed of are reported at the lower of carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell.
impairment of investments in affiliatesbunge reviews its investments annually or when an event or circumstances indicate that a potential decline in value may be other than temporary. bunge considers various factors in determining whether to recognize an impairment charge, including the length of time that the fair value of the investment is expected to be below its carrying value, the financial condition, operating performance and near-term prospects of the affiliate and bunge's intent and ability to hold the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for recovery of the fair value. impairment charges for investments in affiliates are included within other income (expense)-net (see note 10).
stock-based compensationbunge maintains equity incentive plans for its employees and non-employee directors (see note 25). bunge accounts for stock-based compensation using the modified prospective transition method. under the modified prospective transition method, compensation cost is recognized based on the grant date fair value.
income taxesincome tax expenses and benefits are recognized based on the tax laws and regulations in the jurisdictions in which bunge's subsidiaries operate. under bermuda law, bunge is not required to pay taxes in bermuda on either income or capital gains. the provision for income taxes includes income taxes currently payable and deferred income taxes arising as a result of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities in bunge's financial statements and their respective tax bases. deferred tax assets are reduced by valuation allowances if it is determined that it is more likely than not that the deferred tax asset will not be realized. accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits are recognized in income tax (expense) benefit in the consolidated statements of income (see note 14).

1. nature of business, basis of presentation, and significant accounting policies (continued)
the calculation of tax liabilities involves management's judgments concerning uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations in the many jurisdictions in which bunge operates and involves consideration of liabilities for potential tax audit issues in those many jurisdictions based on estimates of whether it is more likely than not those additional taxes will be due. investment tax credits are recorded in income tax expense in the period in which such credits are granted.
revenue recognitionsales of agricultural commodities, fertilizers and other products are recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, the price is determinable, the product has been delivered, title to the product and risk of loss transfer to the customer, which is dependent on the agreed upon sales terms with the customer and when collection of the sale price is reasonably assured. sales terms provide for passage of title either at the time and point of shipment or at the time and point of delivery of the product being sold. net sales consist of gross sales less discounts related to promotional programs and sales taxes. interest income on secured advances to suppliers is included in net sales due to its operational nature (see note 6). shipping and handling charges billed to customers are included in net sales and related costs are included in cost of goods sold.
research and developmentresearch and development costs are expensed as incurred. research and development expenses were $20 million, $19 million and $19 million for the years ended december 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively.
new accounting pronouncementsin may 2014, the fasb amended asc (topic 605) revenue recognition and created asc
(topic 606) revenue from contracts with customers. the core principle of the guidance is that an entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. the standard is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after december 15, 2016. early application is not permitted. bunge is evaluating the expected impact of this standard on its consolidated financial statements.
in february 2015, the fasb issued asu (topic 810)consolidationamendments to the consolidation analysis.the standard makes targeted amendments to the current consolidation guidance and ends the deferral granted to investment companies from applying the vie guidance. the standard is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after december 15, 2015. early adoption is allowed. bunge is evaluating the expected impact of this standard on the consolidation of certain private equity and other investment funds related to its asset management business.
2. business acquisitions in november 2014, bunge and asociación de cooperativas argentinas formed a new legal entity, terminal de fertilizantes argentinos sa, which acquired the assets of the mosaic quebracho complex located in puerto general san martin, argentina for $24 million in cash. bunge has a 75% controlling interest and will consolidate this legal entity. the purchase price allocation resulted in $24 million of assets, primarily property, plant and equipment, including a single super phosphate production plant and a port strategically located in the up-river parana region in argentina.
in february 2014, bunge acquired the assets of corn flour producers, llc ("cfp") for $12 million in cash. the purchase price allocation resulted in $12 million, primarily property, plant and f-14

2. business acquisitions (continued)
equipment, with the remainder in working capital. cfp produces corn flour products and is located in indiana in the united states.
in december 2013, bunge acquired a wheat milling business in mexico consisting of six wheat milling facilities for
$312 million, for a purchase price of $216 million in cash, net of $7 million of cash acquired, and non-cash settlement of an existing loan from bunge to the business of $96 million. the customers in this business are primarily in the mexican food processing sector. the acquisition supports bunge's strategy of growing its global presence in high growth, value-added food & ingredients businesses supplying food processing customers.
the final purchase price of $312 million primarily included the allocation of $282 million to tangible assets.
goodwill of $61 million was assigned to the mexico milling products operation which is non-deductible for income tax purposes and represents the excess of cost over the fair value of the net tangible and intangible assets acquired.
in november 2013, bunge acquired wheat milling assets in brazil in its milling products segment for $35 million in cash. the final allocation of the purchase price based on the fair values of assets and liabilities acquired included $12 million allocated to property, plant and equipment, $8 million to other assets and $10 million to inventories, net of liabilities assumed of $2 million. the transaction also resulted in $7 million of goodwill allocated to the milling products operations in brazil.
in january 2013, bunge acquired two biodiesel facilities in its agribusiness segment adjacent to existing bunge facilities from its european biodiesel joint venture for $11 million in cash, net of cash acquired. the purchase price allocation resulted in $4 million of inventory, $17 million of other current assets, $10 million of property, plant and equipment, $19 million of other current liabilities and $1 million of long-term deferred taxes. there were no changes to the joint venture ownership or governance structure as a result of this transaction.
3. discontinued operations and business divestitures on december 17, 2013, ocp group ("ocp") and bunge completed a transaction for ocp to acquire bunge's 50% ownership interest in its moroccan fertilizer joint venture for $37 million in cash. the joint venture, bunge maroc phosphore s.a. was formed in 2008 to produce fertilizers in morocco and to serve as an additional source of phosphate-based raw materials and intermediate products for bunge's fertilizer businesses in south america.
on august 8, 2013, bunge sold its brazilian fertilizer distribution business, including blending facilities, brands and warehouses to yara for $750 million in cash. as a result of the transaction, bunge no longer has significant ongoing cash flows related to the brazilian fertilizer business or any significant ongoing participation in the operations of this business. bunge received cash proceeds of the brazilianrealequivalent of $750 million in cash upon closing the transaction, resulting in a gain of $148 million ($112 million net of tax) which is included in discontinued operations in the consolidated statement of income for the year ended december 31, 2013. included in the gain are approximately $7 million of transaction costs incurred in connection with the divestiture and $41
million release of the cumulative translation adjustment associated with the disposed business.
additionally, in december 2012 bunge sold its u.s. fertilizer distribution venture to its partner growmark, inc.
and ceased its north american fertilizer distribution operations. the operating results of the brazilian and north american fertilizer distribution businesses are reported within f-15

4. trade structured finance program bunge engages in various trade structured finance activities to leverage the value of its trade flows across its operating regions. these activities include a program under which a bunge entity generally obtains u.s. dollar-
denominated letters of credit ("lcs") (each based on an underlying commodity trade flow) from financial institutions, as well as foreign exchange forward contracts, and time deposits denominated in the local currency of the financial institution counterparties, all of which are subject to legally enforceable set-off agreements. the lcs and foreign exchange contracts are presented within the line item letter of credit obligations under trade structured finance program on the consolidated balance sheets as of december 31, 2014 and december 31, 2013. the net return from activities under this program, including fair value changes, is included as a reduction of cost of goods sold in the accompanying consolidated statements of income.
at december 31, 2014 and december 31, 2013, time deposits (with weighted-average interest rates of 7.95% and 8.36%, respectively) and lcs, including foreign exchange contracts, totaled $1,343 million and $4,470 million, respectively. in addition, at december 31, 2014 and december 31, 2013, the fair values of the time deposits (level

(1) prepaid commodity purchase contracts represent advance payments against fixed price contracts for future delivery of specified quantities of agricultural commodities. (2) bunge provides cash advances to suppliers, primarily brazilian farmers of soybeans and sugarcane, to finance a portion of the suppliers' production costs.
bunge does not bear any of the costs or risks associated with the related growing crops. the advances are largely collateralized by future crops and physical assets of the suppliers, carry a local market interest rate and settle when the farmer's crop is harvested and sold. the secured advances to farmers are reported net of allowances of $2
million and $20 million at december 31, 2014 and december 31, 2013, respectively. changes in the allowance for 2014
included primarily a reduction in the allowance resulting from recoveries of $7 million, and reclassifications to long-term of $8 million. changes in the allowance for 2013 included an increase of $20 million for additional bad debt provisions and a reduction in the allowance for recoveries of $12 million.
interest earned on secured advances to suppliers of $37 million, $32 million and $27 million, respectively, for the years ended december 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively, is included in net sales in the consolidated statements of income.

8. goodwill bunge performs its annual goodwill impairment testing in the fourth quarter of each year. step 1 of the goodwill impairment test compares the fair value of bunge's reporting units to which goodwill has been allocated to the carrying values of those reporting units. the fair value of the agribusiness segment reporting unit is determined using a combination of two methods: estimates based on market earnings multiples of peer companies identified for the reporting unit (the market approach) and a discounted cash flow model with estimates of future cash flows based on internal forecasts of revenues and expenses (the income approach). the market multiples are generally derived from public information related to comparable companies with operating and investment characteristics similar to those of the agribusiness reporting unit and from market transactions in the industry. the income approach estimates fair value by discounting a reporting unit's estimated future cash flows using a weighted-average cost of capital that reflects current market conditions and the risk profile of the respective business unit and includes, among other things, assumptions about variables such as commodity prices, crop and related throughput and production volumes, profitability, future capital expenditures and discount rates, all of which are subject to a high degree of judgment. for other reporting units, the estimated fair value of the reporting unit is determined utilizing a discounted cash flow analysis.
there were no significant impairment charges resulting from bunge's annual impairment testing of any of its reporting units goodwill for the years ended december 31, 2014 and 2013.
for the year ended december 31, 2012, a very low level of market transactions in the sugar and bioenergy industry and consecutive years of weak sugarcane harvests that resulted from adverse weather conditions in 2012 and 2011
combined with low ethanol prices in brazil, resulted in the estimated fair value of bunge's sugar and bioenergy reporting unit being below book value. step 2 of the analysis was f-19

with respect to its unremitted earnings that are not considered to be indefinitely reinvested, bunge has provided a deferred tax liability totaling $10 million and $22 million as of december 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. as of december 31, 2014, bunge has determined it has unremitted earnings that are considered to be indefinitely reinvested of approximately $978 million and, accordingly, no provision for income taxes has been made. if these earnings were distributed in the form of dividends or otherwise, bunge would be subject to income taxes either in the form of withholding taxes or income taxes to the recipient; however, it is not practicable to estimate the amount of taxes that would be payable upon remittance of these earnings.
at december 31, 2014, bunge's pre-tax loss carryforwards totaled $4,771 million, of which $2,690 million have no expiration, including loss carryforwards of $1,895 million in brazil. while loss carryforwards in brazil can be carried forward indefinitely, annual utilization is limited to 30% of taxable income calculated on an entity by entity basis as brazil tax law does not provide for a consolidated return concept. as a result, realization of these carryforwards may take in excess of five f-28

years. the remaining tax loss carryforwards expire at various periods beginning in 2015 through the year 2030.
income tax valuation allowancesbunge records valuation allowances when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of its deferred tax assets might not be realized. the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets depends primarily on bunge's ability to generate sufficient timely future income of the appropriate character in the appropriate taxing jurisdiction.
bunge recorded an adjustment to the beginning-of-the-year balance of valuation allowances of $6 million and $512
million for the years ended december 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. the 2014 net amount includes $15 million of charges related to full valuation allowances in certain legal entities, primarily in china, which were more than offset by $21 million of reversals of valuation allowances in certain russian legal entities. for 2013, $464
million related to a full valuation allowance on deferred tax assets in bunge's industrial sugar business in brazil, resulting from increased cumulative losses, coupled with a negative market outlook, brazil's existing energy policy, and bunge's decision to commence comprehensive process to explore all alternatives to optimize the value of this business.
uncertain tax positionsasc topic 740 requires applying a "more likely than not" threshold to the recognition and de-recognition of tax benefits. at december 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively, bunge had recorded uncertain tax positions of $81 million and $169 million in other non-current liabilities and $2 million and $2 million in current liabilities in its consolidated balance sheets. during 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively, bunge recognized $16
million, $10 million and $1 million of interest and penalty charges in income tax (expense) benefit in the consolidated statements of income. at december 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively, bunge had included accrued interest and penalties of $26 million and $20 million within the related tax liability line in the consolidated balance sheets. a reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of unrecognized tax benefits follows:

substantially all of the unrecognized tax benefits balance, if recognized, would affect bunge's effective income tax rate. bunge believes that it is reasonably possible that approximately $2 million of its unrecognized tax benefits may be recognized by the end of 2015 as a result of a lapse of the statute of limitations or settlement with the tax authorities.

14. income taxes (continued)
bunge, through its subsidiaries, files income tax returns in the united states (federal and various states) and non-united states jurisdictions. the table below reflects the tax years for which bunge is subject to income tax examinations by tax authorities:
open tax years north america    2007 - 2014
south america    2005 - 2014
europe           2006 - 2014
asia-pacific     2003 - 2014
as of december 31, 2014 and 2013, bunge had received from the brazilian tax authorities proposed adjustments
(reduced by existing net operating loss carryforwards) of 1,135 million and 1,163 million brazilianreais($427
million and $497 million), respectively plus applicable interest and penalties, related to multiple examinations of income tax returns for certain subsidiaries for years up to 2009. management, in consultation with external legal advisors, believes that it is more likely than not that bunge will prevail on the majority of the proposed adjustments. as of december 31, 2014 and, 2013, bunge had recognized uncertain tax positions related to these tax assessments of 38 million and 192 million brazilianreais($14 million and $82 million), respectively. the brazilian tax authorities commenced an audit of bunge's largest brazilian subsidiary for the tax years 2010, 2011, and 2012
in july of 2014.
in addition, as of december 31, 2014 and 2013, bunge's argentine subsidiary had received an income tax assessment relating to fiscal years 2006 and 2007 with a claim of approximately 436 million argentinepesos(approximately $51
million and $67 million, respectively), plus applicable interest on the outstanding amount due of approximately 907
million and 750 million argentinepesos(approximately $106 million and $115 million, respectively). management, in consultation with external legal advisors, believes that it is more likely than not that bunge will prevail on the majority of the proposed adjustments. fiscal years 2008 and 2009 are currently being audited by the tax authorities. it is likely that the tax authorities will also audit fiscal years 2010-2013, although no notice has been rendered to bunge's argentine subsidiary (see also note 22).
bunge made cash income tax payments, net of refunds received, of $303 million, $156 million and $325 million during the years ended december 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively.
15. financial instruments and fair value measurements bunge's various financial instruments include certain components of working capital such as cash and cash equivalents, trade accounts receivable and trade accounts payable. additionally, bunge uses short and long-term debt to fund operating requirements. cash and cash equivalents, trade accounts receivable, trade accounts payable and short-term debt are stated at their carrying value, which is a reasonable estimate of fair value. see note 18
for deferred purchase price receivable related to sales of trade receivables. see note 12 for long-term receivables from farmers in brazil, net and other long-term investments, see note 17 for long-term debt and see note 10 for other non-recurring fair value measurements. bunge's financial instruments also include derivative instruments and marketable securities, which are stated at fair value.

15. financial instruments and fair value measurements (continued)
fair value is the expected price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. bunge determines the fair values of its readily marketable inventories, derivatives, and certain other assets based on the fair value hierarchy, which requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value.
observable inputs are inputs based on market data obtained from sources independent of bunge that reflect the assumptions market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability. unobservable inputs are inputs that are developed based on the best information available in circumstances that reflect bunge's own assumptions based on market data and on assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability. the fair value standard describes three levels within its hierarchy that may be used to measure fair value.
level 1: quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. level 1 assets and liabilities include exchange traded derivative contracts.
level 2: observable inputs, including level 1 prices (adjusted), quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities, quoted prices in markets that are less active than traded exchanges and other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities. level 2 assets and liabilities include readily marketable inventories and over-the-counter ("otc") commodity purchase and sale contracts and other otc derivatives whose value is determined using pricing models with inputs that are generally based on exchange traded prices, adjusted for location specific inputs that are primarily observable in the market or can be derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data.
level 3: unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are a significant component of the fair value of the assets or liabilities. in evaluating the significance of fair value inputs, bunge gives consideration to items that individually or when aggregated with other inputs, generally represent more than 10% of the fair value of the assets or liabilities. for such identified inputs, judgments are required when evaluating both quantitative and qualitative factors in the determination of significance for purposes of fair value level classification and disclosure. level 3 assets and liabilities include assets and liabilities whose value is determined using proprietary pricing models, discounted cash flow methodologies or similar techniques; as well as, assets and liabilities for which the determination of fair value requires significant management judgment or estimation. bunge believes a change in these inputs would not result in a significant change in the fair values.
the majority of bunge's exchange traded agricultural commodity futures are settled daily generally through its clearing subsidiary and, therefore, such futures are not included in the table below. assets and liabilities are classified in their entirety based on the lowest level of input that is a significant component of the fair value measurement. the lowest level of input is considered level 3.

million and $392 million, at december 31, 2014 and $6 million and $457 million at december 31, 2013, respectively, related to certain delivered inventory for which the receivable and payable, respectively, fluctuate based on changes in commodity prices. these receivables and payables are hybrid financial instruments for which bunge has elected the fair value option. (2) unrealized gains on designated and undesignated derivative contracts are generally included in other current assets. there are no such amounts included in other non-current assets at december 31, 2014 and december 31, 2013, respectively. (3) other includes the fair values of marketable securities and investments in other current assets and other non-current assets.

(4) unrealized losses on designated and undesignated derivative contracts are generally included in other current liabilities. there are no such amounts included in other non-current liabilities at december 31, 2014 and december
31, 2013, respectively.
derivativesexchange traded futures and options contracts are valued based on unadjusted quoted prices in active markets and are classified within level 1. bunge's forward commodity purchase and sale contracts are classified as derivatives along with other otc derivative instruments relating primarily to freight, energy, foreign exchange and interest rates, and are classified within level 2 or level 3 as described below. bunge estimates fair values based on exchange quoted prices, adjusted as appropriate for differences in local markets. these differences are generally valued using inputs from broker or dealer quotations, or market transactions in either the listed or otc markets. in such cases, these derivative contracts are classified within level 2.
otc derivative contracts include swaps, options and structured transactions that are valued at fair value generally determined using quantitative models that require the use of multiple market inputs including quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets which are not highly active, other observable inputs relevant to the asset or liability, and market inputs corroborated by correlation or other means. these valuation models include inputs such as interest rates, prices and indices to generate continuous yield or pricing curves and volatility factors. where observable inputs are available for substantially the full term of the asset or liability, the instrument is categorized in level 2.
certain otc derivatives trade in less active markets with less availability of pricing information and certain structured transactions can require internally developed model inputs that might not be observable in or corroborated by the market. when unobservable inputs have a significant impact on the measurement of fair value, the instrument is categorized in level 3.
exchange traded or cleared derivative contracts are classified in level 1, thus transfers of assets and liabilities into and/or out of level 1 occur infrequently. transfers into level 1 would generally only be expected to occur when an exchange cleared derivative contract historically valued using a valuation model as the result of a lack of observable inputs becomes sufficiently observable, resulting in the valuation price being essentially the exchange traded price. there were no significant transfers into or out of level 1 during the periods presented.
readily marketable inventoriesreadily marketable inventories reported at fair value are valued based on commodity futures exchange quotations, broker or dealer quotations, or market transactions in either listed or otc markets with appropriate adjustments for differences in local markets where bunge's inventories are located. in such cases, the inventory is classified within level 2. certain inventories may utilize significant unobservable data related to local market adjustments to determine fair value. in such cases, the inventory is classified as level 3.
if bunge used different methods or factors to determine fair values, amounts reported as unrealized gains and losses on derivative contracts and readily marketable inventories at fair value in the consolidated balance sheets and consolidated statements of income could differ. additionally, if market conditions change subsequent to the reporting date, amounts reported in future periods as unrealized gains and losses on derivative contracts and readily marketable inventories at fair value in the consolidated balance sheets and consolidated statements of income could differ.

table of contents bunge limited and subsidiaries notes to the consolidated financial statements (continued)
15. financial instruments and fair value measurements (continued)
level 3 measurementstransfers in and/or out of level 3 represent existing assets or liabilities that were either previously categorized as a higher level for which the inputs to the model became unobservable or assets and liabilities that were previously classified as level 3 for which the lowest significant input became observable during the period. bunge's policy regarding the timing of transfers between levels is to record the transfers at the beginning of the reporting period.
level 3 derivativeslevel 3 derivative instruments utilize both market observable and unobservable inputs within the fair value measurements. these inputs include commodity prices, price volatility, interest rates, volumes and locations. in addition, with the exception of the exchange cleared instruments, bunge is exposed to loss in the event of the non-performance by counterparties on otc derivative instruments and forward purchase and sale contracts. adjustments are made to fair values on occasions when non-performance risk is determined to represent a significant input in bunge's fair value determination. these adjustments are based on bunge's estimate of the potential loss in the event of counterparty non-performance. bunge did not have significant adjustments related to non-performance by counterparties at december 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively.
level 3 readily marketable inventories and otherthe significant unobservable inputs resulting in level 3
classification for readily marketable inventories, physically settled forward purchase and sale contracts, and trade accounts receivable and payable, net, relate to certain management estimations regarding costs of transportation and other local market or location-related adjustments, primarily freight related adjustments in the interior of brazil and the lack of market corroborated information in canada. in both situations, bunge uses proprietary information such as purchase and sale contracts and contracted prices for freight, premiums and discounts to value its contracts. movements in the price of these unobservable inputs alone would not have a material effect on bunge's financial statements as these contracts do not typically exceed one future crop cycle.

derivative instruments interest rate derivativesbunge from time-to-time uses interest rate derivatives, including interest rate swaps, interest rate basis swaps, interest rate options or interest rate futures. interest rate derivatives used by bunge as hedging instruments are recorded at fair value in the consolidated balance sheets with changes in fair value recorded contemporaneously in earnings. certain of these interest rate derivatives agreements may be designated as fair value hedges. the carrying amount of the associated hedged debt is also adjusted through earnings for changes in the fair value arising from changes in benchmark interest rates. ineffectiveness is recognized to the extent that these two adjustments do not offset. bunge may enter into interest rate derivatives agreements for the purpose of managing certain of its interest rate exposures. bunge may also enter into interest rate derivatives agreements that do not qualify as hedges for accounting purposes. changes in fair value of such interest rate basis derivatives agreements are recorded in earnings.
foreign exchange derivativesbunge uses a combination of foreign exchange forward, swap and option contracts in certain of its operations to mitigate the risk from exchange rate fluctuations in connection with certain commercial and balance sheet exposures. the foreign exchange forward and option contracts may be designated as cash flow hedges. bunge may also use net investment hedges to partially offset the translation adjustments arising from the remeasurement of its investment in certain of its foreign subsidiaries.
bunge assesses, both at the inception of the hedge and on an ongoing basis, whether the derivatives that are used in hedge transactions are highly effective in offsetting changes in the hedged items.

commodity derivativesbunge uses commodity derivative instruments to manage its exposure to movements associated with agricultural commodity prices. bunge generally uses exchange traded futures and options contracts to minimize the effects of changes in the prices of agricultural commodities on its agricultural commodity inventories and forward purchase and sale contracts, but may also from time-to-time enter into otc commodity transactions, including swaps, which are settled in cash at maturity or termination based on exchange-quoted futures prices.
forward purchase and sale contracts are primarily settled through delivery of agricultural commodities. while bunge considers these exchange traded futures and forward purchase and sale contracts to be effective economic hedges, bunge does not designate or account for the majority of its commodity contracts as hedges. the forward contracts require performance of both bunge and the contract counterparty in future periods. contracts to purchase agricultural commodities generally relate to current or future crop years for delivery periods quoted by regulated commodity exchanges. contracts for the sale of agricultural commodities generally do not extend beyond one future crop cycle.

bunge's commercial paper program is supported by an identical amount of committed back up bank credit lines (the
"liquidity facility") provided by banks that are rated at least a-1 by standard & poor's financial services and p-1
by moody's investors service. on november 20, 2014, we entered into an unsecured $600 million five-year liquidity facility with certain lenders party thereto. the f-40

liquidity facility replaced the then existing $600 million five-year liquidity facility, dated as of november 17,
2011. the cost of borrowing under the liquidity facility would typically be higher than the cost of issuing under bunge's commercial paper program. at december 31, 2014, there were no borrowings outstanding under the commercial paper program and no borrowings under the liquidity facility. at december 31, 2013, there was $100 million outstanding under the commercial paper program and no borrowings under the liquidity facility.
in addition to the committed facilities discussed above, from time-to-time, bunge limited and/or its financing subsidiaries enter into uncommitted bilateral short-term credit lines as necessary based on its financing requirements. at december 31, 2014 and december 31, 2013, $50 million and $120 million were outstanding under these bilateral short-term credit lines, respectively. loans under such credit lines are non-callable by the respective lenders. in addition, bunge's operating companies had $521 million in short-term borrowings outstanding from local bank lines of credit at december 31, 2014 to support working capital requirements.

on december 12, 2014, bunge entered into an unsecured five year multi-currency syndicated term loan agreement (the
"loan") in the japanese loan market, with certain lenders party thereto. the loan is comprised of three tranches:
tranche a of japanese yen 28.5 billion, bearing interest at 3 months libor plus a margin of 0.75%; tranche b of japanese yen 6 billion bearing a fixed interest rate of 0.96%; and tranche c of $85 million bearing interest at 3
months libor plus a margin of 1.30%. at december 31, 2014, there were no borrowings outstanding under the loan.
on november 20, 2014, bunge entered into an unsecured $1,100 million five-year syndicated revolving credit agreement (the "credit agreement") with certain lenders party thereto. bunge has the option to request an extension of the maturity date of the credit agreement for two additional one-year periods, each lender in its sole discretion may agree to any such request. the credit agreement replaced the then existing u.s. $1,085 million five-
year revolving credit agreement, dated as of november 17, 2011. borrowings under the credit agreement will bear interest at libor plus a margin, which will vary from 1.00% to 1.75%, based on the credit ratings of bunge's senior long-term unsecured debt ("rating level"). amounts under the credit agreement that remain undrawn are subject to a commitment fee at rates ranging from 0.10% to 0.25%, varying based on the rating level. bunge may, from time-to-
time, request one or more of the existing lenders or new lenders to increase the total commitments under the credit agreement by up to $500 million pursuant to an accordion provision. at december 31, 2014, there were no borrowings outstanding under the credit agreement.
on june 17, 2014, bunge increased pursuant to an accordion provision, the $665 million five-year syndicated revolving credit agreement with cobank, acb, (the "cobank facility") as administrative agent and certain lender party thereto to $865 million. borrowings under the cobank facility will bear interest at libor plus a margin, which will vary between 1.050% and 1.675% per annum, based on the credit ratings of bunge's long-term senior unsecured debt. amounts under the cobank facility that remain undrawn are subject to a commitment fee at rates ranging from 0.125% to 0.275% per annum based likewise on the ratings of bunge's long-term senior unsecured debt.
at december 31, 2014, there was $338 million outstanding under the cobank facility.
on march 17, 2014, bunge entered into an unsecured $1,750 million three-year syndicated revolving credit facility
(the "facility") with certain lenders party thereto, maturing on march 17, 2017. bunge has the option to request an extension of the maturity date on the facility for two additional one-year periods, each lender in its sole discretion may agree to any such request. borrowings under the facility will bear interest at libor plus a margin, which will vary from 0.70% to 1.70% per annum, based on the credit ratings of bunge's senior long-term unsecured debt. bunge will also pay a fee that varies from 0.10% to 0.40% per annum, based on the utilization of the facility. amounts under the facility that remain undrawn are subject to a commitment fee payable quarterly in arrears at a rate of 35% of the margin specified above, which will vary based on the rating level at each quarterly payment date. bunge may, from time-to-time, with the consent of the facility agent, request one or more of the existing lenders or new lenders to increase the total commitments under the facility by up to $250 million pursuant to an accordion provision. at december 31, 2014, there were no borrowings outstanding under the facility.

bunge's credit facilities and certain senior notes require it to comply with specified financial covenants related to minimum net worth, minimum current ratio, a maximum debt to capitalization ratio and limitations on secured indebtedness. bunge was in compliance with these covenants at december 31, 2014.
during the years ended december 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, bunge paid interest, net of interest capitalized, of $223
million, $330 million and $259 million, respectively.
18. trade receivables securitization program bunge and certain of its subsidiaries participate in a trade receivables securitization program ("program") with a financial institution, as administrative agent, and certain commercial paper conduit purchasers and committed purchasers (collectively, the purchasers) that provides for funding up to $700 million against receivables sold into the program. the program is designed to enhance bunge's financial flexibility by providing an additional source of liquidity for its operations. in connection with the program, certain of bunge's u.s. and non-u.s.
subsidiaries that originate trade receivables may sell eligible receivables in their entirety on a revolving basis to a consolidated bankruptcy remote special purpose entity, bunge securitization b.v. ("bsbv") formed under the laws of the netherlands. bsbv in turn sells such purchased trade receivables to the administrative agent (acting on behalf of the purchasers) pursuant to a receivables transfer agreement. in connection with these sales of accounts receivable, bunge receives a portion of the proceeds up front and an additional amount upon the collection of the underlying receivables, which is expected to be generally between 10% and 15% of the aggregate amount of receivables sold through the program.
bunge finance b.v., a wholly owned subsidiary of bunge, acts as master servicer, responsible for servicing and collecting the accounts receivable for the program. the program terminates on june 1, f-43

18. trade receivables securitization program (continued)
2016. however, each committed purchaser's commitment to fund trade receivables sold under the program will terminate on may 27, 2015 unless extended for an additional 364-day periods in accordance with the terms of the receivables transfer agreement. the trade receivables sold under the program are subject to specified eligibility criteria, including eligible currencies, country and obligor concentration limits.
as of december 31, 2014, and 2013, $599 million and $696 million, respectively, of receivables sold under the program were derecognized from bunge's consolidated balance sheets. proceeds received in cash related to transfers of receivables under the program totaled $12,030 million and $12,596 million for the years ended december 31, 2014
and 2013, respectively. in addition, cash collections from customers on receivables previously sold were $12,202
million and $12,769 million, respectively. as this is a revolving facility, cash collections from customers are reinvested to fund new receivable sales. gross receivables sold under the program for the years ended december 31,
2014 and 2013 were $12,179 million and $12,779 million, respectively. these sales resulted in discounts of $7
million, $7 million and $8 million for the years ended december 31, 2014 and 2013 and 2012, respectively, which were included in sg&a in the consolidated statements of income. servicing fees under the program were not significant in any period.
bunge's risk of loss following the sale of the trade receivables is limited to the deferred purchase price ("dpp"), which at december 31, 2014 and december 31, 2013 had a fair value of $78 million and $96 million, respectively, and is included in other current assets in the consolidated balance sheets (see note 6). the dpp will be repaid in cash as receivables are collected, generally within 30 days. delinquencies and credit losses on trade receivables sold under the program during the years ended december 31, 2014 and 2013 were insignificant. bunge has reflected all cash flows under the program as operating cash flows in the consolidated statements of cash flows for the years ended december 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012.
19. pension plans employee defined benefit planscertain u.s., canadian, european and brazilian based subsidiaries of bunge sponsor non-contributory defined benefit pension plans covering substantially all employees of the subsidiaries. the plans provide benefits based primarily on participants' salary and length of service.
the funding policies for bunge's defined benefit pension plans are determined in accordance with statutory funding requirements. the most significant defined benefit plan is in the united states. the u.s. funding policy requires at least those amounts required by the pension protection act of 2006. assets of the plans consist primarily of equity and fixed income investments.
plan amendments and transfers in and outthere were no significant amendments, settlements or transfers into or out of bunge's employee benefit plans during the years ended december 31, 2014 or 2013.

compensation levels the sponsoring subsidiaries select the expected long-term rate of return on assets in consultation with their investment advisors and actuaries. these rates are intended to reflect the average rates of earnings expected on the funds invested or to be invested to provide required plan benefits. the plans are assumed to continue in effect as long as assets are expected to be invested.
in estimating the expected long-term rate of return on assets, appropriate consideration is given to historical performance for the major asset classes held or anticipated to be held by the applicable plan trusts and to current forecasts of future rates of return for those asset classes. cash flows and expenses are taken into consideration to the extent that the expected returns would be affected by them. as assets are generally held in qualified trusts, anticipated returns are not reduced for taxes.
plan assetsthe objectives of the u.s. plans' trust funds are to sufficiently diversify plan assets to maintain a reasonable level of risk without imprudently sacrificing returns, with a target asset allocation of approximately
40% fixed income securities and approximately 60% equities. bunge implements its investment strategy through a combination of indexed mutual funds and a proprietary portfolio of fixed income securities. bunge's policy is not to invest plan assets in bunge limited shares.
plan investments are stated at fair value which is the amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. the plan classifies its investments in level 1, which refers to securities that are actively traded on a public exchange and valued using quoted prices from active markets for identical assets, level 2, which refers to securities not traded in an active market but for which observable market inputs are readily available and level 3, which refers to other assets valued based on significant unobservable inputs.

at december 31, 2014, for measurement purposes related to u.s. plans, an 8.4% annual rate of increase in the per capita cost of covered healthcare benefits was assumed for 2015, decreasing to 4.5% by 2029, remaining at that level thereafter. at december 31, 2013, for measurement purposes related to u.s. plans, a 9.0% annual rate of increase in the per capita cost of covered healthcare benefits was assumed for 2014. for foreign plans, the assumed annual rate of increase in the per capita cost of covered healthcare benefits averaged 7.74% and 7.74% for 2014 and
2013, respectively.

respectively, in interest income in its consolidated statements of income. notes receivable are included in other current assets or other non-current assets in the consolidated balance sheets, according to payment terms.
notes payablebunge holds a note payable with its joint venture bunge scf grain llc with a carrying value of $11
million at december 31, 2014. this note matures on march 21, 2017 with an interest rate of 1 month libor and is included in other long-term liabilities in bunge's consolidated balance sheet.
otherbunge purchased soybeans and other commodity products and received port services from certain of its unconsolidated ventures, totaling $746 million, $446 million and $685 million for the years ended december 31,
2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. bunge also sold soybeans and other commodity products and provided port services to certain of its unconsolidated ventures, totaling $345 million, $440 million and $592 million for the years ended december 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. at december 31, 2014 and 2013, bunge had approximately $75 million and $90 million of receivables from these ventures included in trade accounts receivable in the consolidated balance sheets as of those dates. in addition, at december 31, 2014 and 2013, bunge had approximately $73 million and $29 million of payables to these ventures included in trade accounts payable in the consolidated balance sheets as of those dates.
in addition, bunge provided services during the years ended december 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, to its unconsolidated ventures totaling $111 million, $81 million and $78 million, respectively, for services including primarily tolling and administrative support. bunge believes all of these transaction values are similar to those that would be conducted with third parties.
22. commitments and contingencies bunge is party to a large number of claims and lawsuits, primarily tax and labor claims in brazil and tax claims in argentina, arising in the normal course of business. the ability to predict the ultimate outcome of such matters involves judgments, estimates and inherent uncertainties. bunge records liabilities related to its general claims and lawsuits when the exposure item becomes probable and can be reasonably estimated. bunge management does not expect these matters to have a material adverse effect on bunge's financial condition, results of operations or liquidity. however, these matters are subject to inherent uncertainties and there exists the remote possibility of an adverse impact on bunge's position in the period the uncertainties are resolved whereby the settlement of the identified contingencies could exceed the amount of provisions included in the consolidated balance sheets.
included in other non-current liabilities at december 31, 2014 and december 31, 2013 are the following amounts related to these matters:

tax claimsthese tax claims relate principally to claims against bunge's brazilian subsidiaries, primarily value added tax claims (icms, ipi, pis and cofins). the determination of the manner in which various brazilian federal, state and municipal taxes apply to the operations of bunge is subject to varying interpretations arising from the complex nature of brazilian tax law. in addition to the matter discussed below, bunge monitors other potential claims in brazil regarding these value-added taxes. in particular, bunge monitors the brazilian federal and state governments' responses to recent brazilian supreme court decisions invalidating on constitutional grounds certain icms incentives and benefits granted by various states. while bunge was not a recipient of any of the incentives and benefits that were the subject of these supreme court decisions, it has received other similar tax incentives and benefits. bunge has not received any tax assessment from the states that granted these incentives or benefits related to their validity and, based on the company's evaluation of this matter as required by u.s. gaap, no liability has been recorded in the consolidated financial statements. on february 13, 2015 brazil's supreme federal court (the "court") published a ruling that certain state icms tax credits related to staple foods, including soy oil, margarine, mayonnaise and wheat flours, are unconstitutional (see note 29).
in may 2014, the brazilian tax authorities concluded an examination of the icms tax returns of one of bunge's sugar milling subsidiaries for the years 2010-2011 and proposed adjustments totaling approximately 45 million brazilianreais(approximately $17 million as of december 31, 2014), plus applicable interest and penalties.
management, in consultation with external legal advisors, has determined that no reserves are required.
in december 2012, july 2013 and november 2014, the brazilian tax authorities concluded examinations of the pis cofins tax returns of one of bunge's brazilian subsidiaries for the years 2004-2007, 2008 and 2009, and proposed adjustments totaling approximately 430 million brazilianreais(approximately $162 million as of december 31, 2014), plus applicable interest and penalties. management, in consultation with external legal advisors, has established appropriate reserves for potential exposures.
the argentine tax authorities have been conducting a review of income and other taxes paid by exporters and processors of cereals and other agricultural commodities in the country. in that regard, in october 2010, the argentine tax authorities carried out inspections at several of bunge's locations in argentina relating to allegations of income tax evasion covering the periods from 2007 to 2009. in december 2012, bunge's argentine subsidiary received an income tax assessment relating to fiscal years 2006 and 2007 with a claim of approximately
436 million argentine pesos(approximately $51 million as of december 31, 2014), plus previously accrued interest on the outstanding amount due of approximately 907 million argentinepesos(approximately $106 million as of december
31, 2014). bunge's argentine subsidiary has appealed this assessment before the national tax court. fiscal years
2008 and 2009 are currently being audited by the tax authorities and it is likely that the tax authorities will also audit fiscal years 2010-2013, although no notice has been rendered to bunge's argentine subsidiary.
additionally, in april 2011, the argentine tax authorities conducted inspections of bunge's locations and those of several other grain exporters with respect to allegations of evasion of liability for value-added taxes and an inquest proceeding was initiated in the first quarter of 2012 to determine whether there is any potential criminal culpability relating to these matters. also during 2011, bunge paid $112 million of accrued export tax obligations in argentina under protest while reserving all of its rights in respect of such payment. in the first quarter of
2012, the argentine tax authorities assessed interest on these paid export taxes, which as of december 31, 2014, totaled approximately $176 million.

22. commitments and contingencies (continued)
in april 2012, the argentine government suspended bunge's argentine subsidiary from a registry of grain traders and, in october 2012, the government excluded bunge's subsidiary from this registry in connection with the income tax allegations discussed above. while the suspension and exclusion have not had a material adverse effect on bunge's business in argentina. these actions have resulted in additional administrative requirements and increased logistical costs on domestic grain shipments within argentina. bunge is challenging these actions in the argentine courts. management believes that these tax-related allegations and claims are without merit and intends to vigorously defend against them. however, management is, at this time, unable to predict their outcome.
labor claimsthe labor claims are principally claims against bunge's brazilian subsidiaries. the labor claims primarily relate to dismissals, severance, health and safety, salary adjustments and supplementary retirement benefits.
civil and otherthe civil and other claims relate to various disputes with third parties, including suppliers and customers.
guaranteesbunge has issued or was a party to the following guarantees at december 31, 2014:

total                                     $                255
(1) bunge issued guarantees to certain financial institutions related to debt of certain of its unconsolidated joint ventures. the terms of the guarantees are equal to the terms of the related financings which have maturity dates in 2015 through 2018. there are no recourse provisions or collateral that would enable bunge to recover any amounts paid under these guarantees. at december 31, 2014, bunge had no outstanding recorded obligation related to these guarantees. (2) bunge issued guarantees to certain financial institutions which are party to certain operating lease arrangements for railcars and barges. these guarantees provide for a minimum residual value to be received by the lessor at conclusion of the lease term. these leases expire at various dates from 2016 through
2019. at december 31, 2014, bunge's recorded obligation related to these guarantees was $6 million.
in addition, bunge limited has provided full and unconditional parent level guarantees of the outstanding indebtedness under certain credit facilities entered into and senior notes issued by, its subsidiaries. at december
31, 2014, bunge's consolidated balance sheet includes debt with a carrying amount of $3,284 million related to these guarantees. this debt includes the senior notes issued by two of bunge's 100% owned finance subsidiaries, bunge limited finance corp. and bunge n.a. finance l.p. there are no significant restrictions on the ability of bunge limited finance corp., bunge n.a. finance l.p. or any other bunge subsidiary to transfer funds to bunge limited.
freight supply agreementsin the ordinary course of business, bunge enters into time charter agreements for the use of ocean freight vessels and freight service on railroad lines for the purpose of transporting agricultural commodities. in addition, bunge sells the right to use these ocean freight vessels when excess freight capacity is available. these agreements generally range from two months to approximately seven years, in the case of ocean freight vessels, depending on market conditions, and 5

to 17 years in the case of railroad services. future minimum payment obligations due under these agreements are as follows:

actual amounts paid under these contracts may differ due to the variable components of these agreements and the amount of income earned on the sales of excess capacity. the agreements for the freight service on railroad lines require a minimum monthly payment regardless of the actual level of freight services used by bunge. the costs of bunge's freight supply agreements are typically passed through to the customers as a component of the prices charged for its products.
also in the ordinary course of business, bunge enters into relet agreements related to ocean freight vessels. such relet agreements are similar to sub-leases. bunge received approximately $98 million during the year ended december
31, 2014 and expects to receive payments of approximately $11 million in 2015, $5 million in 2016 and $2 million in
2017 under such relet agreements.
commitmentsat december 31, 2014, bunge had approximately $154 million of purchase commitments related to its inventories, $138 million of power supply contracts and $128 million of contractual commitments related to construction in progress.
23. equity share repurchase programbunge has established a program for the repurchase of up to $975 million of bunge's issued and outstanding common shares. the program runs indefinitely. bunge repurchased 3,780,987 common shares for $300
million during the year ended december 31, 2014. total repurchases under the program from its inception on june 8,
2010 through december 31, 2014 were 12,428,846 shares for a total amount of $774 million. bunge did not repurchase any shares under the program during the year ended december 31, 2013.
cumulative convertible perpetual preference sharesbunge has 6,900,000, 4.875% cumulative convertible perpetual preference shares (convertible preference shares), par value $0.01 outstanding at december 31, 2014. each convertible preference share has an initial liquidation preference of $100 per share plus accumulated unpaid dividends up to a maximum of an additional $25 per share. as a result of adjustments made to the initial conversion price because cash dividends paid on bunge limited's common shares exceeded certain specified thresholds, each convertible preference share is convertible at any time at the holder's option into approximately 1.1220 common shares based on a conversion price of $89.1299 per convertible preference share, subject in each case to certain specified anti-dilution adjustments (which represents 7,741,800 bunge limited common shares at december 31, 2014).
f-56
table of contents bunge limited and subsidiaries notes to the consolidated financial statements (continued)
23. equity (continued)
at any time on or after december 1, 2011, if the closing market price of bunge's common shares equals or exceeds
130% of the conversion price of the convertible preference shares, for 20 trading days within any period of 30
consecutive trading days (including the last trading day of such period), bunge may elect to cause all outstanding convertible preference shares to be automatically converted into the number of common shares that are issuable at the conversion price. the convertible preference shares are not redeemable by bunge at any time.
the convertible preference shares accrue dividends at an annual rate of 4.875%. dividends are cumulative from the date of issuance and are payable, quarterly in arrears, on each march 1, june 1, september 1 and december 1, commencing on march 1, 2007, when, as and if declared by bunge's board of directors. the dividends may be paid in cash, common shares or a combination thereof. accumulated but unpaid dividends on the convertible preference shares will not bear interest. in each of the years ended december 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, bunge recorded $34 million of dividends on its convertible preference shares.

(1) bunge has significant operating subsidiaries in brazil, argentina, north america, europe and asia-pacific. the functional currency of bunge's subsidiaries is the local currency. the assets and liabilities of these subsidiaries are translated into u.s. dollars from local currency at month-end exchange rates, and the resulting foreign exchange translation gains (losses) are recorded in the consolidated balance sheets as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss).
24. earnings per common share basic earnings per share is computed by dividing net income available to bunge common shareholders by the weighted-
average number of common shares outstanding, excluding any dilutive effects of stock options, restricted stock unit awards, convertible preference shares and convertible notes during the reporting period. diluted earnings per share is computed similar to basic earnings per share, except that the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding is increased to include additional shares from the assumed exercise of stock options, restricted stock unit awards and convertible securities and notes, if dilutive. the number of additional shares is calculated by assuming f-58
table of contents bunge limited and subsidiaries notes to the consolidated financial statements (continued)
24. earnings per common share (continued)
that outstanding stock options, except those which are not dilutive, were exercised and that the proceeds from such exercises were used to acquire common shares at the average market price during the reporting period. in addition, bunge accounts for the effects of convertible securities and convertible notes, using the if-converted method.
under this method, the convertible securities and convertible notes are assumed to be converted and the related dividend or interest expense, net of tax, is added back to earnings, if dilutive.

(2) the weighted-average common shares outstanding-diluted excludes approximately 2 million, 3 million and 4
million stock options and contingently issuable restricted stock units, which were not dilutive and not included in the computation of earnings per share for the years ended december 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. (3)
weighted-average common share outstanding-diluted for the years ended december 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012 excludes approximately 8 million weighted-average common shares that are issuable upon conversion of the convertible preference shares that were not dilutive and not included in the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding.
25. share-based compensation for the years ended december 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, bunge recognized approximately $49 million, $53 million and
$44 million, respectively, of total compensation expense for awards classified as equity awards related to its stock option and restricted stock unit awards in additional paid-in capital.
2009 equity incentive plan and equity incentive planduring the year ended december 31, 2009, bunge established the
2009 equity incentive plan (the "2009 eip"), which was approved by shareholders at the 2009 annual general meeting.
under the 2009 eip, the compensation committee of bunge's board of directors may grant equity-based awards to officers, employees, consultants and independent contractors. awards under the 2009 eip may be in the form of stock options, restricted stock units (performance-based or time-vested) or other equity-based awards. prior to may 8,
2009, the date of shareholder approval of the 2009 eip, bunge granted equity-based awards under the equity incentive plan, a shareholder approved plan (the "equity incentive plan"). under the equity incentive plan, the compensation committee of bunge's board of directors was authorized to grant equity-based awards to officers, employees, consultants and independent contractors. the equity incentive plan provided that awards may be in the form of stock options, restricted stock units (performance-based or time-vested) or other equity-based awards.
effective may 8, 2009, no further awards can be granted under the equity incentive plan.
(i)stock option awardsstock options to purchase bunge limited common shares are non-statutory and granted with an exercise price equal to the market value of bunge limited common shares on the date of the grant, as determined under the equity incentive plan or the 2009 eip, as applicable. options expire ten years after the date of the grant and generally vest and become exercisable on a pro-rata basis over a three-year period on each anniversary of the date of the grant. vesting may be accelerated in certain circumstances as provided in the equity incentive plan and the 2009 eip. compensation expense is recognized for option grants beginning in 2006 on a straight-line basis and for options granted prior to 2006, compensation expense is recognized on an accelerated basis over the vesting period of each grant.

25. share-based compensation (continued)
(ii)restricted stock unitsperformance-based restricted stock units and time-vested restricted stock units are granted at no cost to employees. performance-based restricted stock units are awarded at the beginning of a three-
year performance period and vest following the end of that three-year period. performance-based restricted stock units fully vest on the third anniversary of the date of grant. payment of the units is subject to bunge attaining certain targeted cumulative earnings per share ("eps") during the three-year performance period. beginning in 2014, payment of the units is also subject to bunge attaining certain average return on invested capital ("roic") targets during the same three-year performance period. targeted cumulative eps under the equity incentive plan or the 2009
eip, as applicable, is based on income per share from continuing operations and targeted roic is based on roic adjusted for non-recurring charges and other one-time events at the discretion of the compensation committee.
vesting may be accelerated in certain circumstances as provided in the equity incentive plan and the 2009 eip.
payment of the award is calculated based on a sliding scale for each of cumulative eps and average roic whereby 50%
of the performance-based restricted stock unit award vests if the minimum performance target is achieved. no vesting occurs if actual performance is less than the minimum performance target. the award is capped at 200% of the grant for actual performance in excess of the maximum performance target for an award. awards are paid solely in bunge limited common shares.
time-vested restricted stock units are subject to vesting periods varying from three to five years and vest on either a pro-rata basis over the applicable vesting period or 100% at the end of the applicable vesting period, as determined by the compensation committee at the time of the grant. vesting may be accelerated in certain circumstances as provided in the equity incentive plan and the 2009 eip. time-vested restricted stock units are paid in bunge limited common shares upon satisfaction of the applicable vesting terms.
at the time of payout, a participant holding a vested restricted stock unit will also be entitled to receive corresponding dividend equivalent share payments. dividend equivalents on performance-based restricted stock units are capped at the target level. compensation expense for restricted stock units is equal to the market value of bunge limited common shares at the date of the grant and is recognized on a straight-line basis over the vesting period of each grant.
2007 non-employee directors' equity incentive planbunge has established the bunge limited 2007 non-employee directors' equity incentive plan (the "2007 directors' plan"), a shareholder approved plan. under the 2007
directors' plan, the compensation committee may grant equity based awards to non-employee directors of bunge limited. awards may consist of restricted stock, restricted stock units, deferred restricted stock units and non-
statutory stock options.
(i)stock option awardsstock options to purchase bunge limited common shares are granted with an exercise price equal to the market value of bunge limited common shares on the date of the grant, as determined under the 2007
directors' plan. options expire ten years after the date of the grant and generally vest and are exercisable on the third anniversary of the grant date. vesting may be accelerated in certain circumstances as provided in the 2007
directors' plan. compensation expense is recognized on a straight-line basis.
(ii)restricted stock unitsrestricted stock units and deferred restricted stock units are granted at no cost to the non-employee directors. restricted stock units generally vest on the third anniversary of the grant date and payment is made in bunge limited common shares. deferred restricted stock units f-61

25. share-based compensation (continued)
generally vest on the first anniversary of the grant date and payment is deferred until after the third anniversary of the date of grant and made in bunge limited common shares. vesting may be accelerated in certain circumstances as provided in the 2007 directors' plan.
at the time of payment, a participant holding a restricted stock unit or deferred restricted stock unit is also entitled to receive corresponding dividend equivalent share payments. compensation expense is equal to the market value of bunge limited common shares at the date of grant and is recognized on a straight-line basis over the vesting period of each grant.
non-employee directors' equity incentive planprior to the may 25, 2007 shareholder approval of the 2007 directors'
plan, bunge granted equity-based awards to its non-employee directors under the non-employee directors' equity incentive plan (the "directors' plan") which is also a shareholder approved plan. the directors' plan provides for awards of non-statutory stock options to non-employee directors. the options vest and are exercisable on the january 1 stfollowing the grant date. vesting may be accelerated in certain circumstances as provided in the directors' plan. compensation expense has been recognized for option grants beginning in 2006 on a straight-line basis and for options granted prior to 2006 on an accelerated basis over the vesting period of each grant.
effective may 25, 2007, no further awards are granted under the directors' plan.
the fair value of each stock option granted under any of bunge's equity incentive plans is estimated on the grant date using the black-scholes-merton option-pricing model with the assumptions noted in the following table. the expected volatility of bunge's common shares is based on historical volatility calculated using the daily closing price of bunge's shares up to the grant date. bunge uses historical employee exercise behavior for valuation purposes. the expected option term of granted options represents the period of time that the granted options are expected to be outstanding based on historical experience and giving consideration for the contractual terms, vesting periods and expectations of future employee behavior. the risk-free interest rate is based on u.s. treasury zero-coupon bonds with a term equal to the expected option term of the respective grants and grant dates.

in addition, bunge enters into agricultural partnership agreements for the production of sugarcane. these agreements have an average remaining life of six years and cover approximately 230,000 hectares of land under cultivation. amounts owed under these agreements are dependent on several variables including the quantity of sugarcane produced per hectare, the total recoverable sugar ("atr") per ton of sugarcane produced and the price for each kilogram of atr as determined by consecana, the são paulo state sugarcane and sugar and ethanol council.
during the years ended december 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, bunge made payments related to these agreements of $162
million, $169 million and $181 million, respectively. of these amounts $95 million, $107 million and $127 million, respectively, were payments for advances on future production and $67 million, $62 million and $54 million, respectively, were included in cost of goods sold in the consolidated statements of income for the years ended december 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively.
27. segment information bunge has five reportable segmentsagribusiness, edible oil products, milling products, sugar and bioenergy, and fertilizerwhich are organized based upon similar economic characteristics and are similar in nature of products and services offered, the nature of production processes, the type and class of customer and distribution methods.
the agribusiness segment is characterized by both inputs and outputs being agricultural commodities and thus high volume and low margin. the edible oil products segment involves the processing, production and marketing of products derived from vegetable oils. the milling products segment involves the processing, production and marketing of products derived primarily from wheat and corn. the sugar and bioenergy segment involves sugarcane growing and milling in brazil, sugar merchandising in various countries, as well as sugarcane-based ethanol production and corn-based ethanol investments and related activities. following the classification of the brazilian fertilizer distribution and north american fertilizer businesses as discontinued operations, the activities of the fertilizer segment include its port operations in brazil and argentina and its blending and retail operations in argentina.
the "discontinued operations & unallocated" column in the following table contains the reconciliation between the totals for reportable segments and bunge consolidated totals, which consist primarily of amounts attributable to discontinued operations, corporate items not allocated to the operating segments and inter-segment eliminations.

(3) during the year ended december 31, 2012, bunge recorded a pre-tax impairment charge of $514 million in its sugar and bioenergy segment for the write-down of goodwill. in addition, bunge recorded pre-tax impairment charges of $30 million and $19 million in selling, general and administrative expenses and other income (expense)net, respectively related to the write-down of two separate affiliate loans to joint ventures and three separate equity method investments. of these pre-tax impairment charges, $1 million and $9 million were allocated to the agribusiness segment in selling, general and administrative expenses and other income (expense)net, respectively, and $29 million and $10 million was allocated to the sugar and bioenergy segment in selling, general and administrative expenses and other income (expense)net, respectively.
total segment earnings before interest and taxes ("ebit") is an operating performance measure used by bunge's management to evaluate segment operating activities. bunge's management believes total segment ebit is a useful measure of operating profitability, since the measure allows for an evaluation of the performance of its segments without regard to its financing methods or capital structure. in addition, ebit is a financial measure that is widely used by analysts and investors in bunge's industries.
a reconciliation of total segment ebit to net income attributable to bunge follows:

table of contents bunge limited and subsidiaries notes to the consolidated financial statements (continued)
29. subsequent events on february 13, 2015, brazil's supreme federal court (the "court") published a ruling that certain state icms tax credits related to staple foods, including soy oil, margarine, mayonnaise and wheat flours are unconstitutional.
the court previously had announced this ruling on october 16, 2014. the case that was the subject of the ruling is considered to be a "leading case" having general precedent authority on lower court cases regarding these tax credits. the main issue in the case related to products and their inputs that are acquired at a certain icms tax rate from one state and sold at a lower icms tax rate in a different state. companies have historically taken a tax credit for the difference of the icms rates in the different states. bunge, like other companies in the brazilian food industry, is involved in several administrative and judicial disputes with brazilian states regarding these tax credits. management and its external legal advisors recognize that each case is unique, that certain facts in bunge's cases may differ from the leading case and that state laws may differ. however, based on the ruling's general application across the staple foods industry in brazil and based on an analysis of the ruling as published in relation to bunge's pending state proceedings (without any evaluation of the future success of a recently filed motion to clarify or modulate the court's ruling), management has evaluated the risk of loss and as a result of such evaluation, management has recorded a liability and a charge to earnings before income taxes of 468 million brazilianreais(approximately $177 million as of december 31, 2014). management intends to continue to vigorously defend against its pending state cases. it will likewise continue to evaluate its pending state cases relative to this leading case ruling and to monitor further actions in the leading case, including the pending motions for clarifications from the court.

item 7.    management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following should be read in conjunction with "cautionary statement regarding forward looking statements" and our combined consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in item 15 of this annual report on form 10-k.
operating results factors affecting operating results bunge limited, a bermuda company, together with its subsidiaries, is a leading global agribusiness and food company operating in the farm-to-consumer food chain. the commodity nature of the company's principal products, as well as regional and global supply and demand variations that occur as an inherent part of the business make volumes an important operating measure. accordingly, information is included in "segment results" that summarizes certain items in our consolidated statements of income and volumes by reportable segment. the unit of measure for all reported volumes is metric tons, a common unit of measure within our industry. a description of reported volumes for each reportable segment has also been included in the discussion of key factors affecting results of operations in each of our business segments as discussed below.
33
agribusiness in the agribusiness segment, we purchase, store, transport, process and sell agricultural commodities and commodity products. profitability in this segment is affected by the availability and market prices of agricultural commodities and processed commodity products and the availability and costs of energy, transportation and logistics services. profitability in our oilseed processing operations is also impacted by volumes procured, processed and sold and by capacity utilization rates. availability of agricultural commodities is affected by many factors, including weather, farmer planting decisions, plant disease, governmental policies and agricultural sector economic conditions. reported volumes in this segment primarily reflect (i) grains and oilseeds originated from farmers, cooperatives or other aggregators and from which "origination margins" are earned; (ii) oilseeds processed in our oilseed processing facilities and from which "crushing margins" are earnedrepresenting the margin resulting from the industrial separation of the oilseed into its protein meal and vegetable oil components, both of which components are separate commodity products themselves; and (iii) third party sales of grains, oilseeds and related commodity products merchandised through our distribution businesses and from which "distribution margins" are earned. the foregoing sub-segment volumes may overlap as they produce separate margin capture opportunities. for example, oilseeds procured in our south american grain origination activities may be processed in our oilseed processing facilities in asia-pacific and will be reflected at both points within the segment. as such, these reported volumes do not represent solely volumes of net sales to third-parties, but rather where margin is earned, appropriately reflecting their contribution to our global network's capacity utilization and profitability.
demand for our purchased and processed agribusiness products is affected by many factors, including global and regional economic conditions, changes in per capita incomes, the financial condition of customers and customer access to credit, worldwide consumption of food products, particularly pork and poultry, population growth rates, relative prices of substitute agricultural products, outbreaks of disease associated with livestock and poultry, and demand for renewable fuels produced from agricultural commodities and commodity products.
we expect that the factors described above will continue to affect global supply and demand for our agribusiness products for the foreseeable future. we also expect that, from time to time, imbalances will likely exist between oilseed processing capacity and demand for oilseed products in certain regions, which impacts our decisions regarding whether, when and where to purchase, store, transport, process or sell these commodities, including whether to change the location of or adjust our own oilseed processing capacity.
food and ingredients in the food and ingredients business, which consists of our edible oil products and milling products segments, our operating results are affected by changes in the prices of raw materials, such as crude vegetable oils and grains, the mix of products that we sell, changes in consumer eating habits, changes in per capita incomes, consumer purchasing power levels, availability of credit to customers, governmental dietary guidelines and policies, changes in regional economic conditions and the general competitive environment in our markets. raw material inputs to our production processes in the edible oil products segment and the milling products segment are largely sourced at market prices from our agribusiness segment. reported volumes in these segments reflect third-party sales of our finished products and, as such, include the sales of products derived from raw materials sourced from the agribusiness segment as well as from third-parties. the unit of measure for these volumes is metric tons as these businesses are linked to the commodity raw materials which are their primary inputs.
34
sugar and bioenergy our sugar and bioenergy segment is an integrated business which includes the procurement and growing of sugarcane and the production of sugar, ethanol and electricity in our eight mills in brazil, global sugar trading and merchandising activities and investment interests in certain corn-based ethanol producers.
profitability in this segment is affected by the availability and quality of sugarcane, which impact our capacity utilization rates and the amount of sugar that can be extracted from the sugarcane, and by market prices of sugarcane, sugar and ethanol. availability and quality of sugarcane is affected by many factors, including weather, geographical factors such as soil quality and topography, and agricultural practices. once planted, sugarcane may be harvested for several continuous years, but the usable crop decreases with each subsequent harvest. as a result, the current optimum economic cycle is generally five or six consecutive harvests, depending on location. we own and/or have partnership agreements to manage farmland on which we grow and harvest sugarcane. we also purchase sugarcane from third parties. prices of sugarcane in brazil are established by consecana, the são paulo state sugarcane and sugar and ethanol council, and are based on the sucrose content of the cane and the market prices of sugar and ethanol. demand for our products is affected by such factors as changes in global or regional economic conditions, the financial condition of customers and customer access to credit, worldwide consumption of food products, population growth rates, changes in per capita incomes and demand for and governmental support of renewable fuels produced from agricultural commodities, including sugarcane. we expect that these factors will continue to affect supply and demand for our sugar and bioenergy products in the foreseeable future. reported volumes in this segment reflect third-party sales of sugar and ethanol.
fertilizer in the fertilizer segment, demand for our products is affected by the profitability of the agricultural sectors we serve, the availability of credit to farmers, agricultural commodity prices, the types of crops planted, the number of acres planted, the quality of the land under cultivation and weather-related issues affecting the success of the harvests. our profitability is impacted by international selling prices for fertilizers and fertilizer raw materials, such as phosphate, sulfur, ammonia and urea, ocean freight rates and other import costs, as well as import volumes at the port facilities we manage. as our operations are in south america, primarily argentina, our results in this segment are typically seasonal, with fertilizer sales normally concentrated in the third and fourth quarters of the year due to the timing of the south american agricultural cycle. reported volumes in this segment reflect third-party sales of our finished products.
in addition to these industry related factors which impact our business areas, our results of operations in all business areas and segments are affected by the following factors:
foreign currency exchange rates due to the global nature of our operations, our operating results can be materially impacted by foreign currency exchange rates. both translation of our foreign subsidiaries' financial statements and foreign currency transactions can affect our results. on a monthly basis, for subsidiaries whose functional currency is their local currency, subsidiary statements of income and cash flows must be translated into u.s. dollars for consolidation purposes based on weighted-average exchange rates in each monthly period. as a result, fluctuations of local currencies compared to the u.s. dollar during each monthly period impact our consolidated statements of income and cash flows for each reported period (quarter and year-to-date) and also affect comparisons between those reported periods. subsidiary balance sheets are translated using exchange rates as of the balance sheet date with the resulting translation adjustments reported in our consolidated balance sheets as a component of other
35
comprehensive income (loss). included in accumulated other comprehensive income for the years ended december 31, 2014, 2013, and 2012 were foreign exchange net translation gains (losses) of $(1,411) million, $(1,221) million and $(805) million, respectively, resulting from the translation of our foreign subsidiaries' assets and liabilities.
additionally, we record transaction gains or losses on monetary assets and liabilities that are not denominated in the functional currency of the entity. these amounts are remeasured into their respective functional currencies at exchange rates as of the balance sheet date, with the resulting gains or losses included in the entity's statement of income and, therefore, in our consolidated statements of income as foreign exchange gains (losses).
we primarily use a combination of equity and intercompany loans to finance our subsidiaries. intercompany loans that are of a long-term investment nature with no intention of repayment in the foreseeable future are considered permanently invested and as such are treated as analogous to equity for accounting purposes. as a result, any foreign exchange translation gains or losses on such permanently invested intercompany loans are reported in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in our consolidated balance sheets. in contrast, foreign exchange translation gains or losses on intercompany loans that are not of a permanent nature are recorded in our consolidated statements of income as foreign exchange gains (losses).
income taxes as a bermuda exempted company, we are not subject to income taxes on income in our jurisdiction of incorporation. however, our subsidiaries, which operate in multiple tax jurisdictions, are subject to income taxes at various statutory rates ranging from 0% to 39%. the jurisdictions that significantly impact our effective tax rate are brazil, the united states, argentina and bermuda. determination of taxable income requires the interpretation of related and often complex tax laws and regulations in each jurisdiction where we operate and the use of estimates and assumptions regarding future events.
results of operations
2014 overview total segment ebit of $956 million in 2014 decreased from $1,329 million in 2013. ebit for 2014 was reduced by $149 million resulting from impairment and restructuring charges, primarily in our sugar and bioenergy segment. results for 2014 were also impacted by an expense of $112 million resulting from a final court ruling in brazil that certain state icms tax credits related to staple foods, including soy oil, margarine, mayonnaise and wheat flours are unconstitutional. ebit for 2013 included a gain of $63 million resulting from the sale of certain rights to legal claims in brazil, and gains of $10 million from the sales of investments in bioenergy companies in north america, offset partially by $28 million of impairment and restructuring charges in our sugar and bioenergy segment and $7 million of provisions for certain recoverable taxes in brazil.
agribusiness segment ebit of $890 million for 2014 was $142 million lower compared to $1,032 million in 2013. primary drivers of the decrease were significantly lower results in our soybean processing business in asia-pacific, including $30 million of mark-to-market losses on soybeans shipped to china at year end, lower risk management contributions in grains and lower grain trading and distribution results in both europe and asia-pacific. largely offsetting these reductions were record agribusiness results in brazil where strong export demand and margins in grains combined with well executed logistics benefitted our grain origination business and high capacity utilization in oilseed processing produced solid processing margins and volumes. in addition our north american agribusiness operations benefitted from very strong fourth quarter performance in oilseed processing in both the united states and canada, with record capacity utilization realized in some facilities. grain
36
origination activities in north america also experienced strong results, including from our operations in the pacific northwest. in europe, oilseed processing results were strong, led by our operations in spain as was our grains and oilseeds trading and distribution operations in the middle east which benefitted from strong demand.
edible oil products segment ebit decreased by $105 million to $58 million in 2014 from $163 million in 2013, primarily driven by an expense of $98 million related to certain icms tax credits in brazil. ebit for 2013 included a gain of $9 million related to the sale of our rights to certain legal claims. overall, our operational improvement and price management initiatives benefitted 2014 results. in brazil, results were more than 20% above last year with strong margins in packaged oils resulting from efficient management of raw material purchases and from our performance initiatives included price management strategies. in central europe, results improved significantly due to a higher value product mix, and operational process improvement initiatives. these gains were offset by the impact on domestic margins of significant currency depreciation in ukraine and russia. our asia-pacific operations benefitted from higher volumes and margins in our branded and bakery fats businesses in india and from operational and commercial improvement initiatives. volume growth in our argentine bottled oil and margarine businesses was driven by increased sales of refined high oleic products and neutralized oils. also export sales to bolivia, paraguay and uruguay were higher. partially offsetting these increases in results was lower ebit in north america, where lower margins in u.s. refining and canadian packaged oil operations and start-up costs of our new packaging plant in mexico more than offset savings generated from our cost improvements initiatives. these declines were partially offset by improved margins in canada refining and u.s. packaged oils.
milling products segment ebit increased to $131 million in 2014 from $125 million in 2013, primarily driven by our december 2013 acquisition of a wheat milling business in mexico, which contributed a full year of profits and additional benefits from the integration of these mills with our existing mexican wheat milling operations. wheat milling in brazil also increased results compared to 2013 with lower volumes more than offset by higher margins, primarily from price management strategies in a competitive environment with increased wheat supply. in the united states, results in corn milling were adversely impacted by a low margin environment and weaker customer demand. results were also impacted by higher energy costs early in 2014. rice milling results in the u.s. were slightly above last year, as margins improved. ebit for 2014 also included an expense of $14 million on certain icms tax credits in brazil. segment ebit in 2013 included a gain of $9 million related to the sale of our rights to certain legal claims.
sugar and bioenergy segment ebit in 2014 was a loss of $168 million compared to a loss of $60 million in 2013. results were impacted by $133 million and $28 million of impairment and restructuring charges in 2014 and 2013, respectively. our sugarcane milling business finished the year with neutral free cash flow, when adjusted for the impact of inventories varied into 2015 and machinery purchases pulled forward from 2015. cost reduction strategies on growing cane and production processes drove improved operational results, despite lower sugar prices and crush volumes. results were positively impacted by higher volumes of energy cogeneration in our mills, due to improved operational performance and additional capacity. energy margins were also higher, especially in the second half of 2014 due to drought related tight water availability for the generation of hydro-energy. our biofuels business benefitted from a robust ethanol production environment in the united states and our corn wet milling joint venture in argentina that became fully operational in 2014 contributed to results. segment ebit was negatively impacted by start-up losses in our joint venture to produce renewable oils in brazil. in our trading and distribution operations, results declined compared to 2013 as both volumes and margins were down in a low sugar price environment.
fertilizer segment ebit decreased to $45 million in 2014 compared to $69 million in 2013. ebit in 2013 included a gain of $32 million related to the sale of our rights to certain legal claims. adjusted for the 2013 gain, results were higher in 2014, primarily due to higher volumes and margins in our
37
blending and distribution business in argentina, which more than offset lower volumes and margins in our port operations in brazil.
net income attributable to bunge for 2014 was $515 million compared to $306 million for 2013. the decrease in total segment ebit of $373 million discussed above was more than offset by the significantly lower income tax expense from continuing operations ($249 million in 2014 compared with $904 million in 2013). income tax expense in 2014 included net tax benefits of $102 million that resulted primarily from the establishment of deferred tax assets related to the implementation of certain structural transfer pricing strategies in our agribusiness operations. we expect these structural changes to continue to contribute to reducing our overall effective tax rate. income tax expense for 2013 included charges of $512 million for income tax valuation allowances, primarily in our sugar milling business in brazil. net income for 2013 also included a $112 million after-tax gain on the sale of our fertilizer distribution business in brazil to yara for cash of $750 million. this gain is included in discontinued operations.
segment results bunge has five reportable segmentsagribusiness, edible oil products, milling products, sugar and bioenergy and fertilizerwhich are organized based upon similar economic characteristics and are similar in nature of products and services offered, the nature of production processes, the type and class of customer and distribution methods. the agribusiness segment is characterized by both inputs and outputs being agricultural commodities and thus high volume and low margin. the edible oil products segment involves the manufacturing and marketing of products derived from vegetable oils. the milling products segment involves the manufacturing and marketing of products derived primarily from wheat and corn. the sugar and bioenergy segment involves sugarcane growing and milling in brazil, sugar and ethanol trading and merchandising in various countries, as well as sugarcane-based ethanol production and corn-based ethanol investments and related activities. following the completion of the sale of bunge's brazilian fertilizer nutrients assets in 2010, the sale of the brazilian fertilizer blending and distribution, north american fertilizer businesses and the sale of bunge's 50% ownership interest in its joint venture in morocco in 2013, the activities of the fertilizer segment include its port operations in brazil and argentina and its blending and distribution operations in argentina.

total segment earnings before interest and tax ("ebit") is an operating performance measure used by bunge's management to evaluate its segments' operating activities. total segment ebit is a non-u.s. gaap financial measure and is not intended to replace net income attributable to bunge, the most directly comparable u.s. gaap financial measure. bunge's management believes segment ebit is a useful measure of its segments' operating profitability, since the measure allows for an evaluation of the performance of its segments without regard to its financing methods or capital structure. in addition, ebit is a financial measure that is widely used by analysts and investors in bunge's industries. total segment ebit is not a measure of consolidated operating results under u.s. gaap and should not be considered as an alternative to net income attributable to bunge or any other measure of consolidated operating results under u.s. gaap.
a reconciliation of total segment ebit to net income attributable to bunge follows:

2014 compared to 2013
agribusiness segmentagribusiness segment net sales decreased 8% to $42.1 billion in 2014 compared to $45.5 billion in 2013. volumes were 1% higher in the year with increased volumes of grain origination in europe resulting from good crops and harvest pace in the black sea region being offset by lower oilseeds distribution volumes in asia-pacific and processing in china and argentina. global commodity prices were generally lower in the year; especially corn prices, which declined significantly in the first nine months of the year and were on average 28% lower in 2014 compared to 2013. the impact of lower commodity prices on net sales was partly offset by the higher value mix of commodities sold in 2014 when compared with 2013.
cost of goods sold also decreased by 8% to $40.4 billion in 2014, compared with $43.7 billion last year as a result of lower average commodity prices in 2014 and lower results from trading and our risk management strategies. these reductions were only partly offset by the 1% volume increase and higher value sales mix.
gross profit was $1,742 million in 2014, 3% lower than $1,797 million a year ago, primarily as losses in our asia-pacific oilseed processing operations, mainly in china, resulting from low structural margins in the region, and reduced trading and risk management results and approximately $80 million of unrealized mark-to-market impacts related to north american processing and bunker fuel hedges at year end that are expected to reverse in 2015. these reductions more than offset good margins in north and south america, central europe and our oilseed distribution activities to the middle east.
sg&a expenses were $875 million in 2014 compared to $836 million in 2013. in 2014, sg&a expenses included costs from our new terfron port facility in northern brazil and higher employee related costs and, to a lesser extent, higher bad debt expenses. sg&a benefitted from weaker currencies when local currency costs were translated into u.s. dollars, partially offsetting the expense increases.
noncontrolling interests represent (income) loss attributed to the noncontrolling interest holders in joint venture operations that are consolidated in our financial statements. in 2014, $23 million of income compared to losses of $31 million in 2013. improved performance in our joint venture activities was primarily driven by our u.s. pacific northwest port operation and oilseed and biodiesel production ventures in europe.
segment ebit decreased to $890 million in 2014 from $1,032 million in 2013, primarily due to lower gross profit, higher sg&a and approximately $80 million of mark-to-market impacts incurred in the fourth quarter, which are expected to reverse during 2015. ebit for 2013 included a $16 million gain from the sale of certain legal claims in brazil.
edible oil products segmentedible oil products segment net sales were $8 billion in 2014 compared to $9.2 billion in 2013. the lower net sales in 2014 were primarily a result of lower average commodity prices in 2014. volumes decreased by 2% driven by rail logistics issues and soft demand from food processors in north america, and by lower retail demand and implementation of price management strategies in brazil. volumes were positively impacted in argentina by export sales of bulk oil and in asia-pacific with strong volume growth across all our brands and our bakery fats business in india.
cost of goods sold decreased 14% to $7.4 billion in 2014 from $8.6 billion in 2013, primarily due to lower raw material costs resulting from lower global commodity prices and sales volumes.
gross profit in 2014 increased to $548 million from $540 million in 2013, primarily due to higher margins in brazil, driven by a tight supply environment and an increased focus on operational improvements and price management strategies, and in argentina, driven by higher export volumes within south america. margins in north america were essentially flat, with higher margins in u.s.

packaged oils driven by operational improvement programs, partially offset by lower margins in refined oils on weaker export demand, rail logistics issues and, to a lesser extent, higher energy costs in the first quarter due to severe weather conditions in canada.
sg&a expenses increased to $482 million in 2014 from $384 million in 2013; sg&a for 2014 included $98 million expenses on certain icms tax credits in brazil.
segment ebit decreased to $58 million in 2014 from $163 million in 2013 as a result of factors noted above. segment ebit for 2013 included a gain of $9 million from the sale of certain legal claims in brazil.
milling products segmentmilling products segment net sales were $2,064 million in 2014, compared to $2,012 million in 2013. volumes increased by 12% primarily due to contributions from a wheat milling business in mexico, which we acquired in december 2013. this increase was partly offset by lower volumes in our wheat milling business in brazil, primarily due to our strategy to strengthen margins. the net increase in volumes was offset by lower average selling prices for corn and wheat products driven by lower average global commodity market prices relative to last year and by the impact of a weaker brazilian real and mexican  peso when translated into u.s. dollars compared to 2013.
cost of goods sold was essentially flat with $1,753 million and $1,750 million for the years 2014 and 2013, respectively. the impact of the inclusion of the acquired wheat milling business in mexico and higher prices for rice origination in the united states resulting from drought and water shortage was offset by lower prices for corn and wheat compared to the same period last year.
gross profit increased by 19% to $311 million in 2014 from $262 million in 2013, primarily as a result of inclusion of our mexican wheat milling business acquired in december 2013 and the related synergies with our existing wheat milling business in mexico. in addition, margins were higher in brazil resulting from the implementation of price management strategies. in our u.s. milling operations, gross profit declined with lower margins in corn milling only partly offset by stronger margins in rice milling.
sg&a expenses increased by $29 million to $168 million in 2014 from $139 in 2013, primarily resulting from inclusion of our wheat milling business acquired in mexico at the end of last year and $14 million expenses on certain icms tax credits in brazil, partially offset by the benefits of cost reduction initiatives and the impact of the weaker brazilian  real and mexican peso on the translation of local currency expenses to the u.s. dollar.
segment ebit increased by 5% to $131 million in 2014 from $125 million in the same period a year ago, driven by the inclusion of our acquired wheat milling operations in mexico and solid performance in brazil wheat milling and u.s. rice milling, partly offset by higher sg&a expenses, lower results in u.s. corn milling and foreign exchange losses in mexico driven by a strong devaluation of the mexican peso in the fourth quarter. segment ebit for 2013 included a gain of $6 million from the sale of certain legal claims in brazil.
sugar and bioenergy segmentsugar and bioenergy segment net sales increased 8% to $4.5 billion in 2014 compared to $4.2 billion in 2013, as a result of higher sugarcane milling volumes and energy sales in brazil. these increases were partly offset by a 6% decline in volumes, primarily in our trading and merchandising business. average ethanol and energy prices in brazil were higher compared to 2013, while average prices of sugar were lower. in our biofuels business, lower volumes were more than offset by higher u.s. corn ethanol prices.
cost of goods sold increased to $4.6 billion in 2014 from $4.1 billion in 2013. higher costs of purchased sugarcane were partially offset by lower volumes in our trading and merchandising business and the benefit of the weaker brazilian real relative to the u.s. dollar.

gross profit was a loss of $41 million in 2014, driven by $113 million of impairment and related charges related to one of our mills. this compared to a profit of $92 million in 2013. improved overall results in our other sugarcane mills were driven by lower costs, higher margins and increased cogeneration volumes. these improvements were more than offset by lower results in our sugar trading and distribution business in the first half of 2014.
sg&a expenses declined 6% to $156 million in 2014 from $166 in 2013. cost reduction initiatives in our industrial business and translation benefits from the depreciation of the brazilian real on local currency costs reduced sg&a, but were partially offset by $20 million of restructuring costs, including costs of our strategic review of the business. sg&a for 2013 included $11 million of write-offs and restructuring charges.
other income (expenses)net was income of $10 million compared to nil in 2013. increased income from our non-consolidated investments in a u.s. bioenergy producer and a corn wet milling venture in argentina that became fully operational in 2014, was partially offset by losses in our joint venture for the production of renewable oils in brazil.
segment ebit decreased by $108 million to a loss of $168 million in 2014 compared to a loss of $60 million in 2013. in 2014, segment ebit included $133 million of impairment and restructuring charges in our industrial operations. results from our sugarcane mills improved overall and our bioenergy investments in the u.s. and argentina also reported higher results. these improvements were partly offset by weaker trading and merchandising results and start-up losses in our renewable oils venture in brazil.
fertilizer segmentfertilizer segment net sales increased 6% to $474 million in 2014 compared to $448 million in 2013, primarily due to a volume increase of 14% in our argentine blending and distribution operations, partly offset by lower global nitrogen and phosphate prices.
cost of goods sold increased 9% to $413 million in 2014 from $379 million in 2013, primarily as a result of higher volumes and higher equipment rental costs and spare parts write-offs in our brazil port operations. these increases were partly offset by lower raw material costs and the benefit of the weaker argentine peso and brazilian real on local currency costs when translated into u.s. dollars.
gross profit decreased to $61 million in 2014 from $69 million in 2013. the decrease was primarily driven by higher costs in our brazilian port operations, partly offset by higher volumes and margins in argentina.
sg&a was $10 million in 2014 compared to $34 million in 2013. the decrease in 2014 includes the reversal of certain value added tax provisions which are no longer expected to be paid and lower general and administrative expenses. in addition, sg&a benefited from a weaker brazilian real and argentine  peso relative to the u.s. dollar.
segment ebit decreased by $24 million to $45 million in 2014 from $69 million in 2013, primarily due to a $32 million gain on the 2013 sale of certain legal claims in brazil, partially offset by a $5 million loss in 2013 in our morocco phosphate joint venture, which was sold in december 2013.
interesta summary of consolidated interest income and expense for the periods indicated follows:

interest income         $87            $76
interest expense       (347   )       (363   )
interest income in 2014 increased by $11 million compared to 2013, primarily due to higher returns on cash investments in brazil and argentina in the first half of the year and the collection of
43
$12 million of accumulated unpaid interest on a loan provided to a related party. interest expense decreased by 4% compared to last year, primarily due to lower average outstanding debt driven by reduced working capital requirements as a result of lower average commodity prices, partly offset by interest charges of $65 million related to certain icms tax credits in brazil. interest expenses were reduced due to the refinancing of long-term debt at fixed rates with short-term bank loans, which on average bear lower, floating interest rates. interest expense includes facility commitment fees, amortization of deferred financing costs and charges on certain lending transactions, including certain intercompany loans and foreign currency conversions in brazil.
income tax expensein 2014, income tax expense from continuing operations decreased to $249 million from $904 million in 2013 and the effective tax rate in 2014 decreased to 34% compared to 89% in 2013. income tax expense in 2014 included certain income tax benefits of $102 million, primarily $93 million of deferred tax assets in a subsidiary taxable in brazil, $21 million reversal of an income tax valuation allowance in europe and $13 million from adjustment of provisions upon finalization of a tax audit in europe. also, included in income tax expense for 2014 is $45 million of deferred tax assets which were recognized upon the recording of expenses related to a court ruling related to certain icms tax credits in brazil. these items were partly offset by $15 million of income tax valuation allowances resulting from management's evaluation of the recoverability of its net operating loss carryforwards in asia-pacific. income tax expense for 2013 included tax charges of $512 million for income tax valuation allowances, primarily in the sugar and bioenergy segment from management's evaluation of its net deferred tax assets, primarily net operating loss carryforwards, $46 million as a result of new legal precedents that impacted our assessment of an uncertain income tax position in brazil and provisions related to tax years 2008 through 2010.
discontinued operationsdiscontinued operations results in 2014 were income of $32 million, net of tax, compared to income of $97 million, net of tax, in 2013. results in 2014 included benefits related to a tax amnesty program in brazil and collections of previously written-off farmer receivables. results in 2013 represented primarily the gain on the sale of the fertilizer blending and distribution business of $112 million, net of tax.
net income attributable to bungenet income attributable to bunge for 2014 was $515 million compared to $306 million for 2013. the decrease in total segment ebit of $373 million discussed above was more than offset by the significantly lower income tax expense from continuing operations ($249 million in 2014 compared with $904 million in 2013). income tax expense in 2014 included net tax benefits of $102 million that resulted primarily from the establishment of deferred tax assets related to the implementation of certain structural transfer pricing strategies in our agribusiness operations. we expect these structural changes to continue to contribute to reducing our overall effective tax rate. income tax expense for 2013 included charges of $512 million for income tax valuation allowances, primarily in our sugar milling business in brazil. net income for 2013 also included a $112 million after-tax gain on the sale of our fertilizer distribution business in brazil to yara for cash of $750 million. this gain is included in discontinued operations.
2013 compared to 2012
agribusiness segmentagribusiness segment net sales increased 2% to $46 billion in 2013 compared to $45 billion in 2012. volumes were 3% higher in 2013 which drove most of the increase in net sales compared to 2012 and resulted primarily from the record large brazilian harvest and higher distribution volumes into asia-pacific. volumes were slightly lower in north america and europe as these regions recovered from droughts in 2012. price increases in the first half of 2013 were offset by price declines in the second half of the year resulting from large south american harvests followed by large northern hemisphere harvests at the end of the year.
44
cost of goods sold increased 2% in 2013 compared to 2012 primarily as a result of the higher volumes in 2013. the impact of the volume increase was partially offset by the favorable impact of the devaluation of the brazilian real and argentine peso relative to the u.s. dollar on the valuation of u.s. dollar-denominated inventories. cost of goods sold for 2012 includes a charge of $25 million related to certain value-added taxes in brazil.
gross profit was essentially flat in 2013 compared with 2012 with higher volumes largely offset by the impact of the devaluation of the brazilian  real and argentine peso relative to the u.s. dollar on the valuation of u.s. dollar-denominated inventories.
sg&a expenses decreased to $836 million in 2013 from $858 million in 2012. the reduction resulted largely from the favorable impact of the devaluation of the brazilian  real and argentine peso when compared to the u.s. dollar on local currency costs, g&a cost reduction efforts during 2013 and lower bad debt expenses and higher bad debt recoveries in brazil.
foreign exchange gains were $41 million in 2013 compared to gains of $111 million in 2012 and related primarily to the 2013 weakening of international currencies, particularly the brazilian real and argentine peso, relative to the u.s. dollar. foreign exchange results in both 2013 and 2012 were partially offset by inventory mark-to-market impacts included in cost of goods sold.
noncontrolling interests was a loss of $31 million in 2013 compared to $9 million of income in 2012, and represents the noncontrolling interests' share of results at our non-wholly owned subsidiaries. the losses in 2013 primarily reflected $27 million of losses in the investment funds acquired in 2012 as well as losses in our european and north american oilseed processing joint ventures, largely driven by the tight crop situation for most of the year.
other income (expense) for 2013 was expense of $2 million compared to expense of $68 million in 2012. the reduction in net expense from 2012 results from a $66 million loss in 2012 from the sale of certain recoverable tax assets in brazil at a discount and a 2012 impairment charge of $9 million related to two equity method investments in european biodiesel producers.
gain on sale of investments in affiliates of $85 million pre-tax in 2012 resulted from the sale of our investment in solae, a north american soy ingredients joint venture, to our joint venture partner.
agribusiness segment ebit was essentially flat compared to last year, decreasing by $15 million to $1,032 million.
edible oil products segmentedible oil products segment net sales decreased 3% to $9,165 million in 2013 compared to $9,472 million in 2012 as a result of lower average selling prices in 2013, due to the reduction in vegetable oil commodity prices, which was partially offset by a 5% increase in volumes, primarily in europe and asia-pacific.
cost of goods sold decreased 4% in 2013 compared to 2012 primarily due to lower raw material prices as commodity prices declined in the latter half of 2013 due to increased crop production in key production regions. lower costs were partially offset by the higher sales volumes.
gross profit increased 21% to $540 million in 2013 from $446 million in 2012. the increase was primarily due to the 5% increase in volumes, which stemmed from a 31% increase in volumes in brazil, which struggled with an erp system implementation in 2012. margins also improved in brazil with strong pricing management in a market of declining raw material prices. results were also higher in north america, which benefited from higher margins.
sg&a expenses increased to $384 million in 2013 from $353 million in 2012. the 9% increase is primarily due to a result of increased advertising and other selling expenditures consistent with the volume increases. these were partially offset by the favorable impact of the weakening of the brazilian real relative to the u.s. dollar during 2013.
45
foreign exchange gains were $5 million in 2013 compared to losses of $8 million in 2012, which were related to movements of the brazilian  real.
noncontrolling interests were $7 million of income in 2013 compared to $2 million of losses in 2012 and represents the noncontrolling interests' share of period income at our non-wholly-owned subsidiaries, primarily our european operations.
other income (expense)net was income of $10 million in 2013 compared to expense of $7 million in 2012. other income in 2013 included a $9 million gain on the sale of certain legal claims in brazil. other expense for 2012 included a loss of $7 million related to the sale of long-term recoverable tax credits in brazil.
segment ebit increased $83 million to $163 million in 2013 from $80 million in 2012 as a result of higher gross profit, the gain on the sale of certain legal claims in brazil and foreign exchange gains in 2013.
milling products segmentmilling products segment net sales increased 10% to $2,012 million in 2013 compared to $1,833 million in 2012. the net increase in sales was primarily due to higher average selling prices, primarily in the first half of the year before the market began to move from wheat and corn deficits to surpluses in the third quarter of 2013. these price increases were partially offset by a 5% decrease in volumes, primarily in brazilian wheat milling, where volumes declined due to an increased focus on margins.
cost of goods sold increased 7% in 2013 compared with 2012 primarily as a result of higher commodity prices when compared to 2012 partially offset by the impact of lower volumes.
gross profit increased 30% to $262 million in 2013 from $201 million in 2012 primarily due to our brazilian wheat milling operations focused on margin management and largely recovering from difficulties associated with a system implementation in 2012. we also benefitted from a full year of results from the consolidation of our 2012 acquisition of a controlling interest in a wheat milling business in mexico, where volumes and margins improved.
sg&a expenses increased to $139 million in 2013 from $123 million in 2012. the 13% increase is primarily due to additional costs from inclusion of our wheat milling business in mexico partially offset by the favorable impact of the weakening brazilian real relative to the u.s. dollar. sg&a in 2013 included a $7 million charge related to recoverable taxes in brazil.
other income (expense)net was income of $2 million in 2013 compared to nil in 2012. included in 2013 is a $6 million gain on the sale of certain legal claims in brazil.
gain on acquisition of controlling interest of $36 million in 2012 relates to the adjustment to fair value of the previously held noncontrolling interest in a north american wheat milling operation upon assuming control of that operation in the second quarter of 2012.
segment ebit increased $10 million to $125 million in 2013 from $115 million in 2012. the result for 2013 was driven by higher gross profit. included in 2012 was a gain on acquisition of controlling interest of $36 million.
sugar and bioenergy segmentsugar and bioenergy segment net sales decreased 10% to $4,215 million compared to $4,659 million in 2012. the decreased sales were primarily driven by a significant decline in prices, particularly sugar compared with 2012. average selling prices in 2013 were 26% lower than the previous year. the impact of these price declines was partially offset by a 32% increase in volumes in our trading and merchandising business in 2013 that was only partially offset by a reduction in sales volumes in our industrial business.
46
cost of goods sold decreased 10% in 2013 compared to 2012 driven primarily by lower overall sugar prices in our trading and merchandising business and a weaker brazilian  real, which was partially offset by increased sales volumes in our trading and merchandising business.
gross profit increased 44% to $92 million in 2013 from $64 million in 2012 primarily as a result of strong trading and merchandising volumes and good risk management performance, as well as increased production (cane crushing) volumes, which improved capacity utilization and reduced unitary costs.
sg&a expenses decreased to $166 million in 2013 from $194 million in 2012, which included a $29 million charge for impairment of a loan receivable from a north american corn ethanol joint venture and a gain of $16 million related to the sale of an investment in a logistics facility in brazil. sg&a benefited from the weakening of the brazilian  real in 2013 compared with 2012. sg&a in 2013 included impairment and restructuring charges of $11 million related to our cost reduction efforts in our industrial business.
foreign exchange gains were $3 million in 2013 compared to losses of $15 million in 2012, which were related to movements of the brazilian  real.
noncontrolling interests were $9 million of losses in 2013 compared to $25 million of losses in 2012 and represent the noncontrolling interests' shares of period losses from our non-wholly owned brazilian sugarcane mills.
equity of earnings in affiliates was a loss of $2 million in 2013 compared with losses of $27 million in 2012, which included a charge of $10 million related to the write-down of an investment in a north american bioenergy joint venture.
other income (expense)net was nil in 2013 compared to a loss of $3 million in 2012 primarily due to improved results in our north american bioenergy investments.
a goodwill impairment charge of $514 million, representing all of the segment's goodwill assets, was recorded in the fourth quarter of 2012 upon completion of our annual impairment analysis. this analysis applies equal weighting to comparable market multiples (the market approach) and discounted cash flow projections (the income approach) to determine a range of values for the fair value of the reporting unit. all of the goodwill in our sugar business has been assigned at the segment level. the income approach estimates fair value by discounting the segment's estimated future cash flows using a weighted-average cost of capital that reflects current market conditions and the risk profile of the business and includes, among other things, making assumptions about variables such as sugar and ethanol prices, future profitability, future capital expenditures and discount rates that might be used by a market participant. all of these assumptions are subject to a high degree of judgment. there was a significant decline in the estimated fair value of the reporting unit primarily due to lower current trading multiples of comparable companies in the industry, a lack of market transactions to provide independent insight into the market's perception of the current value of sugar milling operations and declines in global prices for both sugar and ethanol. based on a detailed review of the results of these valuation approaches, it was determined that there were indicators of a potential impairment of the goodwill and further analysis was done to evaluate the fair value of the assets and liabilities of the segment as of the october 1, 2012 testing date. this allocation of the fair value included higher replacement values of our sugarcane mills compared to 2011, increased value allocated to sugarcane plantations and increased values of transportation and mechanization equipment related to sugarcane planting and harvesting. upon completion of the analysis, 100% of the goodwill was determined to be impaired and a related charge was recorded within the segment. this non-cash charge does not have any impact on current or future cash flows or the performance of the underlying business.
segment ebit improved by $577 million to a loss of $60 million in 2013 from a loss of $637 million in 2012. included in the 2012 period were $496 million of non-cash impairment charges
47
for goodwill and $39 million of charges related to write-downs of an investment in and loan receivable from a north american biofuels company and a $16 million gain on the sale of a logistics asset in brazil. higher gross profit in 2013 and lower sg&a expenses combined with improved performance in our north american bioenergy investments and foreign exchange gains in the period contributed to the improvement.
fertilizer segmentfertilizer segment net sales decreased 4% to $448 million in 2013 compared to $466 million in 2012. net sales decreased primarily due to lower average selling prices which declined 1% and a 3% decrease in sales volumes from reduced corn and wheat planting in argentina as a result of a drought.
cost of goods sold decreased 3% in 2013 compared to 2012 primarily as a result of sales volume decreases.
gross profit decreased 9% to $69 million in 2013 from $76 million in 2012. the decrease in gross profit was primarily driven by lower 2013 margins in argentina.
sg&a decreased to $34 million in 2013 compared with $35 million in the same period of 2012 and resulted largely from the favorable impact of the devaluation of the argentine peso on local currency costs.
foreign exchange gains were $5 million in 2013 compared to losses of $1 million in 2012.
noncontrolling interests were $5 million of income in 2013 compared to $3 million of income in 2012 and represent the noncontrolling interests' share of period income at our non-wholly-owned subsidiaries, primarily in our fertilizer port terminal operations in brazil.
other income (expense)net was income of $34 million in 2013 compared to a loss of $14 million in 2012. the improved results stemmed from a $32 million gain on the sale of certain legal claims in brazil and reduced losses in our moroccan phosphate joint venture, which was sold in december 2013
segment ebit increased $46 million to $69 million in 2013 from $23 million in 2012 driven by the $32 million gain on the sale of certain legal claims in brazil and lower losses in our moroccan joint venture.
interesta summary of consolidated interest income and expense for the periods indicated follows:

interest income         $76            $53
interest expense       (363   )       (294   )
interest income increased when compared to 2012 as a result of higher average interest bearing cash balances. interest expense increased when compared to the same period last year primarily due to higher average local borrowings and borrowing rates. interest expense includes facility commitment fees, amortization of deferred financing costs and charges on certain lending transactions, including certain intercompany loans and foreign currency conversions in brazil.
income tax expensein 2013, income tax expense from continuing operations was $904 million compared to an income tax benefit of $6 million in 2012. the effective tax rate in 2013 increased to 89% compared to a benefit of 2% in 2012 primarily due to the full valuation allowances of $464 million related to our brazil sugar operations and to other valuation allowances and discrete income tax charges of $98 million. the effective tax rate for 2012 was a benefit of 2% which included a tax benefit of $175 million related to the goodwill impairment charge in our sugar and bioenergy segment. goodwill amortization is tax deductible in brazil. this benefit reduced the effective tax rate for 2012 by 20%.
48
discontinued operationsdiscontinued operations results in 2013 were income of $97 million, net of tax, compared to a loss of $342 million, net of tax, in 2012. results in 2013 were driven by the gain on the sale of the fertilizer blending and distribution business of $112 million, net of tax. the net after-tax loss of $342 million in 2012 is primarily the result of nonrecurring charges associated with the then pending sale of the brazilian fertilizer blending and distribution operations, including an after-tax charge of $32 million related to an evaluation of the impact of the pending sale on recovery of long-term receivables from farmers in brazil and a charge of $266 million related to an income tax valuation allowance as the pending sale of the business reduced our ability to utilize this tax asset. results of operations for the discontinued businesses were a loss of $44 million in 2012 and resulted from weakness in the brazilian fertilizer market and an after-tax charge of $18 million related to a provision for a legacy environmental claim from 1998 in brazil.
net income attributable to bungein 2013, net income attributable to bunge increased to $306 million from $64 million in 2012. net income attributable to bunge for 2013 includes significant tax charges of $512 million for income tax valuation allowances, primarily in the sugar and bioenergy segment from management's evaluation of its net operating loss carryfowards, $46 million as a result of new legal precedents that impacted our assessment of an uncertain income tax position in brazil and provisions related to tax years 2008 through 2010, and $4 million related to the finalization of a european tax audit. net income attributable to bunge for 2013 also includes a $112 million after-tax gain on the sale of our fertilizer blending and distribution business in brazil to yara for cash of $750 million. net income attributable to bunge for 2012 includes a goodwill impairment charge of $327 million (after-tax and noncontrolling interest share) in the sugar and bioenergy segment, an after-tax gain of $54 million on the sale of our investment in the solae company and an after-tax loss of $342 million associated with discontinued fertilizer operations held for sale at december 31, 2012. this 2012 loss in discontinued operations includes a $266 million valuation allowance for certain tax assets that were no longer expected to be recoverable as a result of the planned sale of the fertilizer blending and distribution business.
liquidity and capital resources liquidity our main financial objectives are to prudently manage financial risks, ensure consistent access to liquidity and minimize cost of capital in order to efficiently finance our business and maintain balance sheet strength. we generally finance our ongoing operations with cash flows generated from operations, issuance of commercial paper, borrowings under various bilateral and revolving credit facilities, term loans and proceeds from the issuance of senior notes. acquisitions and long-lived assets are generally financed with a combination of equity and long-term debt.
our current ratio, which is a widely used measure of liquidity and is defined as current assets divided by current liabilities, was 1.50 and 1.42 at december 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively.
cash and cash equivalentscash and cash equivalents were $362 million at december 31, 2014 and $742 million at december 31, 2013. cash balances are managed in accordance with our investment policy, the objectives of which are to preserve the principal value of our cash assets, maintain a high degree of liquidity and deliver competitive returns subject to prevailing market conditions. cash balances are invested in short-term deposits with highly rated financial institutions and in u.s. government securities.
readily marketable inventoriesreadily marketable inventories are agricultural commodity inventories, such as soybeans, soybean meal, soybean oil, corn, wheat, and sugar that are readily convertible to cash because of their commodity characteristics, widely available markets and international pricing mechanisms. readily marketable inventories in our agribusiness segment are
49
reported at fair value and were $4,125 million at december 31, 2014 and $4,325 million at december 31, 2013. of these amounts $2,937 million and $2,927 million were attributable to merchandising activities at december 31, 2014 and december 31, 2013, respectively. readily marketable inventories at fair value in the aggregate amount of $127 million and $138 million at december 31, 2014 and december 31, 2013, respectively, were included in our edible oil products segment inventories. the sugar and bioenergy segment included readily marketable sugar inventories of $157 million and $137 million at december 31, 2014 and december 31, 2013, respectively which can be attributed to our trading and merchandising business.
financing arrangements and outstanding indebtednesswe conduct most of our financing activities through a centralized financing structure that provides the company efficient access to debt and capital markets. this structure includes a master trust, the primary assets of which consist of intercompany loans made to bunge limited and its subsidiaries. certain of bunge limited's 100% owned finance subsidiaries, bunge limited finance corp., bunge finance europe b.v. and bunge asset funding corp., fund the master trust with short and long-term debt obtained from third parties, including through our commercial paper program and certain credit facilities, as well as the issuance of senior notes. borrowings by these finance subsidiaries carry full, unconditional guarantees by bunge limited.
revolving credit facilitiesat december 31, 2014, we had $5,015 million of aggregate committed borrowing capacity under our commercial paper program and revolving credit facilities, of which $4,477 million was unused and available. the following table summarizes these facilities as of the periods presented:

commercial paper                           2019                   $600              $            $100
long-term revolving credit facilities(1)        2016 - 2019             4,415       538           400
total                                                             $5,015            $538          $500
(1)
borrowings under the revolving credit facilities that have maturities greater than one year from the date of the consolidated balance sheets are classified as long-term debt, consistent with the long-term maturity of the underlying facilities. however, individual borrowings under the revolving credit facilities are generally short-term in nature, bear interest at variable rates and can be repaid or renewed as each such individual borrowing matures.
on december 12, 2014, we entered into an unsecured five year multi-currency syndicated term loan agreement (the "loan") in the japanese loan market, with certain lenders party thereto. the loan is comprised of three tranches: tranche a of japanese yen 28.5 billion, bearing interest at 3 months libor plus a margin of 0.75%; tranche b of japanese yen 6 billion bearing a fixed interest rate of 0.96%; and tranche c of $85 million bearing interest at 3 months libor plus a margin of 1.30%. at december 31, 2014, there were no borrowings outstanding under the loan.
on november 20, 2014, we entered into an unsecured $1,100 million five-year syndicated revolving credit agreement (the "credit agreement") with certain lenders party thereto. we have the option to request an extension of the maturity date of the credit agreement for two additional one-year periods, each lender in its sole discretion may agree to any such request. the credit agreement replaced the then existing u.s. $1,085 million five-year revolving credit agreement, dated as of november 17, 2011. borrowings under the credit agreement will bear interest at libor plus a margin, which will vary from 1.00% to 1.75%, based on the credit ratings of our senior long-term unsecured debt ("rating level"). amounts under the credit agreement that remain undrawn are subject to a commitment fee at rates ranging from 0.10% to 0.25%, varying based on the rating level. we may, from time-to-time,
50
request one or more of the existing lenders or new lenders to increase the total commitments under the credit agreement by up to $500 million pursuant to an accordion provision. at december 31, 2014, we had no borrowings outstanding under the credit agreement.
on june 17, 2014, we increased pursuant to an accordion provision the $665 million five-year syndicated revolving credit agreement with cobank, acb, (the "cobank facility") as administrative agent and certain lender party thereto to $865 million. borrowings under the cobank facility will bear interest at libor plus a margin, which will vary between 1.050% and 1.675% per annum, based on the credit ratings of our long-term senior unsecured debt. amounts under the cobank facility that remain undrawn are subject to a commitment fee at rates ranging from 0.125% to 0.275% per annum based likewise on the ratings of our long-term senior unsecured debt. at december 31, 2014, there was $338 million outstanding under the cobank facility.
on march 17, 2014, we entered into an unsecured $1,750 million three-year syndicated revolving credit facility (the "facility") with certain lenders party thereto. we have the option to request an extension of the maturity date of the facility for two additional one-year periods, each lender in its sole discretion may agree to any such request. borrowings under the facility will bear interest at libor plus a margin, which will vary from 0.70% to 1.70% per annum, based on the credit ratings of our senior long-term unsecured debt. we will also pay a fee that varies from 0.10% to 0.40% per annum, based on the utilization of the facility. amounts under the facility that remain undrawn are subject to a commitment fee payable quarterly in arrears at a rate of 35% of the margin specified above, which will vary based on the rating level at each such quarterly payment date. we may, from time-to-time, with the consent of the facility agent, request one or more of the existing lenders or new lenders to increase the total commitments under the facility by up to $250 million pursuant to an accordion provision. at december 31, 2014, we had no borrowings outstanding under the facility.
our commercial paper program is supported by committed back-up bank credit lines (the "liquidity facility") equal to the amount of the commercial paper program provided by lending institutions that are required to be rated at least a-1 by standard & poor's and p-1 by moody's investor services. the cost of borrowing under the liquidity facility would typically be higher than the cost of issuance under our commercial paper program. on november 20, 2014 we entered into an unsecured $600 million five-year liquidity facility with certain lenders party thereto. the liquidity facility replaced the then existing $600 million five-year liquidity facility, dated as of november 17, 2011. we have the option to request an extension of the expiration date of the liquidity agreement for two additional one-year periods, each lender in its sole discretion may agree to any such request. at december 31, 2014, there were no borrowings outstanding under both the commercial paper program and the liquidity facility. our commercial paper program is our only revolving credit facility that requires lenders to maintain minimum credit ratings.
in addition to committed credit facilities, from time-to-time, we enter into bilateral short-term credit lines as necessary based on our financing requirements. at december 31, 2014 and 2013, $50 million and $120 million, respectively, were outstanding under these bilateral short-term credit lines.
short and long-term debtour short and long-term debt decreased by $787 million at december 31, 2014 from december 31, 2013, primarily due to lower working capital financing requirements, driven by lower average global commodity prices. for the year ended december 31, 2014, our average short and long-term debt outstanding was approximately $5,372 million compared to approximately $6,465 million for the year ended december 31, 2013. our long-term debt outstanding

balance was $3,263 million at december 31, 2014 compared to $3,941 million at december 31, 2013. the following table summarizes our short-term debt activity at december 31, 2014.

credit ratingsbunge's debt ratings and outlook by major credit rating agencies at december 31, 2014 were as follows:

standard &amp; poor's   a-1         bbb   stable moody's                 p-1         baa2   negative fitch                   not rated   bbb    stable
(1)
short-term rating applies only to bunge asset funding corp., the issuer under our commercial paper program.
our debt agreements do not have any credit rating downgrade triggers that would accelerate maturity of our debt. however, credit rating downgrades would increase our borrowing costs under our credit facilities and, depending on their severity, could impede our ability to obtain credit facilities or access the capital markets in the future on competitive terms subject to prevailing market conditions. a significant increase in our borrowing costs could impair our ability to compete effectively in our business relative to competitors with higher credit ratings.
our credit facilities and certain senior notes require us to comply with specified financial covenants, including minimum net worth, minimum current ratio, a maximum debt to capitalization ratio and limitations on secured indebtedness. we were in compliance with these covenants as of december 31, 2014.
trade receivable securitization programwe initially entered into our trade receivable securitization program (the "program") in june 2011, which provides us with an additional source of liquidity. the program provides funding for up to $700 million against receivables sold and terminates on june 1, 2016. however, each committed purchaser's commitment to fund trade receivables sold under program will terminate on may 27, 2015 unless extended for additional 364-day periods in accordance with the terms of the receivables transfer agreement.
at december 31, 2014 and 2013, $599 million and $696 million, respectively, of receivables sold under the program were derecognized from our consolidated balance sheets. proceeds received in cash related to transfers of receivables under the program totaled $12,030 million and $12,596 million for the years ended december 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. in addition, cash collections from customers on receivables previously sold were $12,202 million and $12,769 million for the years ended december 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. as this is a revolving facility, cash collections from customers are reinvested to fund new receivable sales. gross receivables sold under the program for the years ended december 31, 2014 and 2013 were $12,179 million and $12,779 million, respectively. these sales resulted in discounts of $7 million for the year ended december 31, 2014, $7 million for the year ended december 31, 2013 and $8 million for the year ended december 31, 2012, which were included in sg&a in the consolidated statements of income. servicing fees under the program were not significant in any period.
our risk of loss following the sale of the trade receivables is limited to the deferred purchase price receivable ("dpp"), which at december 31, 2014 and 2013 had a fair value of $78 million and $96 million, respectively, and is included in other current assets in our consolidated balance sheets (see note 18 to our consolidated financial statements). the dpp will be repaid in cash as receivables are collected, generally within 30 days. delinquencies and credit losses on trade receivables sold under the program during the years ended december 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012 were insignificant. bunge has reflected all cash flows under the program as operating cash flows in the consolidated statements of cash flows for the years ended december 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012.
interest rate swap agreementswe may use interest rate swaps as hedging instruments and record the swaps at fair value in the consolidated balance sheets with changes in fair value recorded
53
contemporaneously in earnings. additionally, the carrying amount of the associated debt is adjusted through earnings for changes in the fair value due to changes in benchmark interest rates. ineffectiveness, as defined in asc topic 815 derivatives and hedging, is recognized to the extent that these two adjustments do not offset.
equitytotal equity was $8,690 million at december 31, 2014, as set forth in the following table:

convertible perpetual preference shares                            $690               $690

total equity                                                       $8,690             $10,088
total bunge shareholders' equity decreased to $8,690 million at december 31, 2014 from $10,088 million at december 31, 2013. the change in equity was due primarily to cumulative translation losses of $1,411 million, resulting from the devaluation of global currencies relative to the u.s. dollar in 2014, and declared dividends to common and preferred shareholders of $192 million and $34 million, respectively, partially offset by net income attributable to bunge for the year ended december 31, 2014 of $515 million.
noncontrolling interest increased to $244 million at december 31, 2014 from $231 million at december 31, 2013 primarily due to capital contributions to two of our noncontrolling interests in brazil and argentina.
at december 31, 2014, we had 6,900,000 4.875% cumulative convertible perpetual preference shares outstanding with an aggregate liquidation preference of $690 million. each convertible perpetual preference share has an initial liquidation preference of $100, which will be adjusted for any accumulated and unpaid dividends. the convertible perpetual preference shares carry an annual dividend of $4.875 per share payable quarterly. as a result of adjustments made to the initial conversion price because cash dividends paid on bunge limited's common shares exceeded certain specified thresholds, each convertible perpetual preference share is convertible, at the holder's option, at any time into 1.1220 bunge limited common shares, based on the conversion price of $89.1299 per share, subject to certain additional anti-dilution adjustments (which represents 7,741,800 bunge limited common shares at december 31, 2014). at any time on or after december 1, 2012, if the closing price of our common shares equals or exceeds 130% of the conversion price for 20 trading days during any consecutive 30 trading days (including the last trading day of such period), we may elect to cause the convertible perpetual preference shares to be automatically converted into bunge limited common shares at the then-prevailing conversion price. the convertible perpetual preference shares are not redeemable by us at any time.
cash flows our cash flow from operations varies depending on, among other items, the market prices and timing of the purchase and sale of our inventories. generally, during periods when commodity prices are rising, our agribusiness operations require increased use of cash to support working capital to acquire inventories and fund daily settlement requirements on exchange traded futures that we use to minimize price risk related to our inventories.
54
2014 compared to 2013in 2014, our cash and cash equivalents decreased by $380 million reflecting the net effect of cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities. for the year ended december 31, 2013, our cash and cash equivalents increased by $173 million.
cash provided by our operating activities was $1,399 million for the year ended december 31, 2014 compared to $2,225 million for the year ended december 31, 2013. net cash inflows from operating activities for the year ended december 31, 2014 were principally due to net income, including adjustments for non-cash items. the decrease in net operating assets and liabilities is primarily due to lower working capital levels than at december 31, 2013, resulting from on average lower global commodity prices, which effect was partially offset by the impact of the depreciation from certain currencies, including the brazilian real, argentine peso, ukrainian hryvnia and european euro relative to the u.s. dollar. the net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended december 31, 2013 resulted from a combination of net income adjusted for non-cash charges and lower average commodity prices during the year. non-cash charges in 2013 included an income tax valuation allowance of $464 million related to our industrial sugar and bioenergy business in brazil.
certain of our non-u.s. operating subsidiaries are primarily funded with u.s. dollar-denominated debt, while currency risk is hedged with u.s. dollar denominated assets. the functional currency of our operations is generally the local currency. also, certain of our u.s. dollar functional operating subsidiaries outside the united states are partially funded with local currency borrowings, while the currency risk is hedged with local currency denominated assets. the financial statements of our subsidiaries are calculated in the functional currency, and when the local currency is the functional currency translated into u.s. dollar. u.s. dollar-denominated loans are remeasured into their respective functional currencies at exchange rates at the applicable balance sheet date. local currency loans are remeasured into u.s. dollar at the exchange rate at the applicable balance sheet date. the resulting gain or loss is included in our consolidated statements of income as foreign exchange gains or losses. for the years ended december 31, 2014 and december 31, 2013, we recorded foreign exchange gains of $215 million and $48 million, respectively, which were included as adjustments to reconcile net income to cash used for operating activities in the line item "foreign exchange loss (gain) on debt" in our consolidated statements of cash flows. this adjustment is required because the cash flow impacts of these gains or losses are recognized as financing activities when the subsidiary repays the underlying debt and therefore, have no impact on cash flows from operations.
cash used for investing activities was $685 million for the year ended december 31, 2014 compared to cash used of $429 million for the year ended december 31, 2013. during 2014, payments were made for capital expenditures of $839 million, including investments in sugar cane planting and maintenance on mills in our sugar and bioenergy business in brazil, the construction of a port terminal and a wheat milling facility in brazil, construction and expansion of edible oil refining and packaging facilities in the united states and mexico, one of our canola processing facilities in canada and construction of a port facility and oilseed processing plant in ukraine, an oilseed processing plant in asia and a port facility in australia. payments made for capital expenditures in 2014 were lower, compared to $1,042 million in 2013, which was driven by management's reallocation of capital and generally lower capital expenditures in our industrial sugar and bioenergy operations in brazil, as part of the strategic review of these activities. we also acquired a fertilizer plant with port facilities for $24 million in argentina and the assets of a corn flour producer in the united states for $12 million, all amounts net of cash acquired. for the year ended december 31, 2013, cash used for investing activities included cash proceeds of $750 million from the sale of our brazilian fertilizer distribution business to yara, the sale of our 50% ownership interest in our morocco fertilizer business for $37 million and the sale of property from our consolidated investment funds of $48 million. in addition, cash used for investing activities in 2013 included cash payments for the acquisitions of a wheat milling business in mexico for $310 million, a wheat mill in brazil for $35 million and two biodiesel facilities in europe for $11 million, all amounts net of cash acquired. proceeds from and payments for investments
55
for both the years 2014 and 2013 included primarily the sales of assets in funds in our asset management business and the purchases and sales of certain marketable securities and other short-term investments. investments in affiliates in 2014 included primarily an additional investment in solazyme bunge produtos renovaveis ltda. ("sb oils"), our joint venture with solazyme, inc. to produce renewable oils in brazil. investments in 2013 included primarily investments in sb oils and a corn wet milling and port facility in argentina.
cash used for financing activities was $1,058 million in the year ended december 31, 2014 compared to $1,565 million for the year ended december 31, 2013. for both years, financing activities reflected reduced financing requirements due to a declining global commodity price environment. in connection with our common share repurchase program, in 2014 we purchased 3,780,987 of our common shares resulting in a cash outflow of approximately $300 million. there were no share repurchases in the year ended december 31, 2013.
2013 compared to 2012in 2013, our cash and cash equivalents increased by $173 million reflecting the net effect of cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities. for the year ended december 31, 2012, our cash and cash equivalents decreased by $266 million.
cash provided by our operating activities was $2,225 million for the year ended december 31, 2013 compared to cash used of $457 million for the year ended december 31, 2012. the cash flow provided by operating activities for the year ended december 31, 2013 resulted from a combination of net income adjusted for non-cash charges and lower average commodity prices during the year, which reduced working capital requirements. non-cash charges in 2013 included an income tax valuation allowance of $464 million related to our industrial sugar business in brazil. the net cash outflows for operating activities for the year ended december 31, 2012 were principally due to significant increases in commodity prices during that period as a result of the 2012 drought in the united states.
certain of our operating subsidiaries are primarily funded with u.s. dollar denominated debt. the functional currency of our operating subsidiaries is generally the local currency and the financial statements are calculated in the functional currency and translated into u.s. dollars. u.s. dollar denominated loans funding certain short-term borrowing needs of our operating subsidiaries are remeasured into their respective functional currencies at exchange rates at the applicable balance sheet date. the resulting gain or loss is included in our consolidated statements of income as foreign exchange gains or losses. for the years ended december 31, 2013 and december 31, 2012, we recorded foreign exchange gains of $48 million and $74 million, respectively, on debt denominated primarily in u.s. dollars at our subsidiaries, which were included as adjustments to reconcile net income to cash used for operating activities in the line item "foreign exchange loss (gain) on debt" in our consolidated statements of cash flows. this adjustment is required because the cash flow impacts of these gains or losses are recognized as financing activities when the subsidiary repays the underlying debt and therefore, have no impact on cash flows from operations.
cash used for investing activities was $429 million for the year ended december 31, 2013 compared to cash used of $967 million for the year ended december 31, 2012. the significantly lower utilization for investing activities in the 2013 period resulted from $750 million of cash proceeds from the sale of our brazilian fertilizer distribution business to yara, the sale of our 50% ownership interest in our morocco fertilizer business for $37 million and the sale of property from our consolidated investment funds of $48 million. these proceeds offset capital expenditures during the period as well as our purchases of a wheat milling business in mexico for $310 million, a wheat mill in brazil for $35 million, and two biodiesel facilities adjacent to our plants in europe from our joint venture for $11 million (all amounts net of cash acquired).
for the year ended december 31, 2012, cash used for investing activities primarily included investments in property, plant and equipment related to the expansion of our sugar business in brazil, investments in an edible oil refining and packaging facility in the united states and canada,
56
construction of a refining facility in india and construction of a port terminal in brazil. in addition to capital expenditures, we acquired an edible oils and fats business in india for $94 million net of cash acquired consisting of $77 million in cash and debt acquired of $17 million. in addition, we acquired an asset management company for $9 million net of cash acquired, a controlling interest in a north american wheat milling business for $102 million net of cash acquired, and redeemable noncontrolling interest of $8 million, intellectual property assets for $22 million and sugarcane milling related biological assets and equipment for $61 million and controlling interest in a european oilseed processing and biodiesel joint venture for $54 million consisting of $17 million in cash and redeemable noncontrolling interest of $37 million. finally, we acquired a margarine business in poland for $7 million in cash. cash used for the year ended december 31, 2012 was net of $448 million proceeds received from the sale of our interest in solae, a soy ingredients joint venture. we also received a special cash dividend of $35 million from solae in connection with the sale of our investment.
investments in affiliates in 2013 included primarily additional investments in a corn wet milling entity and investments in a port operation, both in argentina, and investments in our sb oils joint venture to produce vegetable oil from sugar produced in one of our mills in brazil. investments in 2012 involved activities related to the construction of an oilseed processing plant in paraguay, construction of a corn wet milling plant in argentina, an investment in a palm plantation joint venture in indonesia and an additional investment in a north american corn ethanol joint venture.
cash used for financing activities was $1,565 million in the year ended december 31, 2013 compared to cash provided by of $1,206 million for the year ended december 31, 2012. for the year ended december 31, 2013, operating cash inflows reflected a declining commodity price environment and the cash collected from the sale of our brazilian fertilizer distribution business, both of which reduced our financing requirements. in 2012, we had a net increase of $1,368 million in borrowings due to increased working capital requirements related to higher commodity prices. dividends paid to our common shareholders in the years ended december 31, 2013 and 2012 were $167 million and $151 million, respectively. dividends paid to holders of our convertible preference shares were $34 million for the years ended december 31, 2013 and 2012. there were no shares repurchased under our share repurchase program during either of the years ended december 31, 2013 or 2012.
brazilian farmer credit backgroundwe advance funds to farmers, primarily in brazil, through secured advances to suppliers and prepaid commodity purchase contracts. these activities are generally intended to be short-term in nature. the ability of our customers and suppliers to repay these amounts is affected by agricultural economic conditions in the relevant geography, which are, in turn, affected by commodity prices, currency exchange rates, crop input costs and crop quality and yields. as a result, these arrangements are typically secured by the farmer's crop and, in many cases, the farmer's land and other assets. upon farmer default, we generally initiate legal proceedings to recover the defaulted amounts. however, the legal recovery process through the judicial system is a long-term process, generally spanning a number of years. as a result, once accounts have been submitted to the judicial process for recovery, we may also seek to renegotiate certain terms with the defaulting farmer in order to accelerate recovery of amounts owed. in addition, we have tightened our credit policies to reduce exposure to higher risk accounts and have increased collateral requirements for certain customers.
because brazilian farmer credit exposures are denominated in local currency, reported values are impacted by movements in the value of the brazilian  real when translated into u.s. dollars. from december 31, 2013 to december 31, 2014, the brazilian  real devalued by approximately 13%, decreasing the reported farmer credit exposure balances when translated into u.s. dollars.
we periodically evaluate the collectability of our trade accounts receivable and record allowances if we determine that collection is doubtful. we base our determination of the allowance on analyses of
57
credit quality of individual accounts, considering also the economic and financial condition of the farming industry and other market conditions as well as the value of any collateral related to amounts owed. we continuously review defaulted farmer receivables for impairment on an individual account basis. we consider all accounts in legal collections processes to be defaulted and past due. for such accounts, we determine the allowance for uncollectible amounts based on the fair value of the associated collateral, net of estimated costs to sell. for all renegotiated accounts (current and past due), we consider changes in farm economic conditions and other market conditions, our historical experience related to renegotiated accounts and the fair value of collateral in determining the allowance for doubtful accounts.
secured advances to suppliers and prepaid commodity contractswe purchase soybeans through prepaid commodity purchase contracts (advance cash payments to suppliers against contractual obligations to deliver specified quantities of soybeans in the future) and secured advances to suppliers (advances to suppliers against commitments to deliver soybeans in the future), primarily in brazil. these financing arrangements are typically secured by the farmer's future crop and mortgages on the farmer's land, buildings and equipment, and are generally settled after the farmer's crop is harvested and sold.
interest earned on secured advances to suppliers of $37 million, $32 million and $27 million for the years ended december 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively, is included in net sales in the consolidated statements of income.
the table below shows details of prepaid commodity contracts and secured advances to suppliers outstanding at our brazilian operations as of the dates indicated. see notes 6 and 12 of the notes to our consolidated financial statements for more information.

total                                        $255
(1)
we issued guarantees to certain financial institutions related to debt of certain of our unconsolidated joint ventures. the terms of the guarantees are equal to the terms of the related financings which have maturity dates in 2015 through 2018. there are no recourse provisions or collateral that would enable us to recover any amounts paid under these guarantees. at december 31, 2014, we had no outstanding recorded obligation related to these guarantees.
(2)
we issued guarantees to certain financial institutions which are party to certain operating lease arrangements for railcars and barges. these guarantees provide for a minimum residual value to be received by the lessor at the conclusion of the lease term. these leases expire at various dates from 2016 through 2019. at december 31, 2014, our recorded obligation related to these guarantees was $6 million.
in addition, bunge limited has provided full and unconditional parent level guarantees of the outstanding indebtedness under certain senior credit facilities and senior notes entered into or issued by its 100% owned subsidiaries. at december 31, 2014, debt with a carrying amount of $3,284 million related to these guarantees is included in our consolidated balance sheet. this debt includes the senior notes issued by two of our 100% owned finance subsidiaries, bunge limited finance corp. and bunge n.a. finance l.p. there are no significant restrictions on the ability of bunge limited finance corp., bunge n.a. finance l.p. or any other of our subsidiaries to transfer funds to bunge limited.

in the ordinary course of business, we enter into purchase commitments for time on ocean freight vessels and freight service on railroad lines for the purpose of transporting agricultural commodities. in addition, we sell time on these ocean freight vessels when excess freight capacity is available. payments to be received by us under such relet agreements are anticipated to be approximately $11 million in 2015 and $7 million in 2016-2017. these agreements range from two months to approximately seven years in the case of ocean freight vessels and 5 to 17 years in the case of railroad services. actual amounts paid under these contracts may differ due to the variable components of these agreements and the amount of income earned by us on the sale of excess capacity. the railroad freight services agreements require a minimum monthly payment regardless of the actual level of freight services used by us. the costs of our freight supply agreements are typically passed through to our customers as a component of the prices we charge for our products. however, changes in the market value of freight compared to the rates at which we have contracted for freight may affect margins on the sales of agricultural commodities.
(4)
does not include estimated payments of liabilities associated with uncertain income tax positions. as of december 31, 2014, bunge had gross related tax liabilities of $83 million, including interest and penalties. at this time, we are unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the timing of payments in individual years in connection with these tax liabilities; therefore, such amounts are not included in the above contractual obligation table. see note 14 to our consolidated financial statements.
(5)
does not include obligations for pension and postretirement benefits for which we expect to make employer contributions of $23 million in 2015. we also expect to make a significant contribution to our plans in future years.
in addition, we have entered into partnership agreements for the production of sugarcane. these agreements have an average remaining life of six years and cover approximately 230,000 hectares of land under cultivation. amounts owed under these agreements are dependent on several variables including the quantity of sugarcane produced per hectare, the total recoverable sugar ("atr") per ton of sugarcane produced and the price for each kilogram of atr as determined by consecana, the são paulo state sugarcane and sugar and ethanol council. in the years ended december 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, bunge made payments related to these agreements of $162 million, $169 million and $181 million, respectively. of these amounts $95 million, $107 million and $127 million for the years ended december 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively, were advances for future purchases and $67 million, $62 million and $54 million were included in cost of goods sold in the consolidated statements of income for the years ended december 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively.
employee benefit plans we expect to contribute $15 million to our defined benefit pension plans and $8 million to our postretirement healthcare benefit plans in 2015.
critical accounting policies and estimates we believe that the application of the following accounting policies, which are important to our financial position and results of operations, requires significant judgments and estimates on the part of management. for a summary of all of our significant accounting policies, see note 1 to our consolidated financial statements included in part iv of this annual report on form 10-k.
allowances for uncollectible accounts accounts receivable and secured advances to suppliers are stated at the historical carrying amounts net of write-offs and allowances for uncollectible accounts. we establish an allowance for uncollectible trade accounts receivable and secured advances to farmers based on historical experience, farming, economic and other market conditions as well as specific identified customer collection issues. uncollectible accounts are written off when a settlement is reached for an amount that is less than the outstanding historical balance or when we have determined that collection of the balance is unlikely.
we follow the accounting guidance on the disclosure of the credit quality of financing receivables and the allowance for credit losses which requires information to be disclosed at disaggregated levels, defined as portfolio segments and classes. based upon an analysis of credit losses and risk factors to be
60
considered in determining the allowance for credit losses, we have determined that the long-term receivables from farmers in brazil are a single portfolio segment.
we evaluate this single portfolio segment by class of receivables, which is defined as a level of information (below a portfolio segment) in which the receivables have the same initial measurement attribute and a similar method for assessing and monitoring risk. we have identified accounts in legal collection processes and renegotiated amounts as classes of long-term receivables from farmers. valuation allowances for accounts in legal collection processes are determined by us on individual accounts based on the fair value of the collateral provided as security for the secured advance or credit sale. the fair value is determined using a combination of internal and external resources, including published information concerning brazilian land values by region. for determination of the valuation allowances for renegotiated amounts, we consider historical experience with the individual farmers, current weather and crop conditions, as well as the fair value of non-crop collateral.
for both classes, a long-term receivable from farmers in brazil is considered impaired, based on current information and events, if we determine it to be probable that all amounts due under the original terms of the receivable will not be collected. recognition of interest income on secured advances to farmers is suspended once the farmer defaults on the originally scheduled delivery of agricultural commodities as the collection of future income is determined not to be probable. no additional interest income is accrued from the point of default until ultimate recovery, where amounts collected are credited first against the receivable and then to any unrecognized interest income.
inventories and derivatives we use derivative instruments for the purpose of managing the exposures associated with agricultural commodity prices, transportation costs, foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates and energy costs and for positioning our overall portfolio relative to expected market movements in accordance with established policies and procedures. we are exposed to loss in the event of non-performance by counterparties to certain of these contracts. the risk of non-performance is routinely monitored and adjustments recorded, if necessary, to account for potential non-performance. different assumptions, changes in economic circumstances or the deterioration of the financial condition of the counterparties to these derivative instruments could result in additional fair value adjustments and increased expense reflected in cost of goods sold, foreign exchange or interest expense. we did not have significant allowances relating to non-performance by counterparties at december 31, 2014 or 2013.
our readily marketable commodity inventories, forward purchase and sale contracts, and exchange traded futures and options are primarily valued at fair value. readily marketable inventories are freely-traded, have quoted market prices, may be sold without significant additional processing and have predictable and insignificant disposal costs. we estimate fair values of commodity inventories and forward purchase and sale contracts based on exchange-quoted prices, adjusted for differences in local markets. changes in the fair values of these inventories and contracts are recognized in our consolidated statements of income as a component of cost of goods sold. if we used different methods or factors to estimate fair values, amounts reported as inventories and unrealized gains and losses on derivative contracts in the consolidated balance sheets and cost of goods sold could differ. additionally, if market conditions change subsequent to year-end, amounts reported in future periods as inventories, unrealized gains and losses on derivative contracts and cost of goods sold could differ.
recoverable taxes we evaluate the collectability of our recoverable taxes and record valuation allowances if we determine that collection is doubtful. recoverable taxes primarily represent value-added or other similar transactional taxes paid on the acquisition of raw materials and other services which can be
61
recovered in cash or as compensation of outstanding balances against income taxes or certain other taxes we may owe. management's assumption about the collectability of recoverable taxes requires significant judgment because it involves an assessment of the ability and willingness of the applicable federal or local government to refund the taxes. the balance of these allowances fluctuates depending on the sales activity of existing inventories, purchases of new inventories, percentages of export sales, seasonality, changes in applicable tax rates, cash payment by the applicable government agencies and compensation of outstanding balances against income or certain other taxes owed to the applicable governments. at december 31, 2014 and 2013, the allowance for recoverable taxes was $43 million and $70 million, respectively. we continue to monitor the economic environment and events taking place in the applicable countries and in cases where we determine that recovery is doubtful, recoverable taxes are reduced by allowances for the estimated unrecoverable amounts.
property, plant and equipment and other finite-lived intangible assets long-lived assets include property, plant and equipment and other finite-lived intangible assets. when facts and circumstances indicate that the carrying values of property, plant and equipment assets may be impaired, an evaluation of recoverability is performed by comparing the carrying value of the assets to the projected future cash flows to be generated by such assets. if it appears that the carrying value of our assets is not recoverable, we recognize an impairment loss as a charge against results of operations. our judgments related to the expected useful lives of property, plant and equipment assets and our ability to realize undiscounted cash flows in excess of the carrying amount of such assets are affected by factors such as the ongoing maintenance of the assets, changes in economic conditions and changes in operating performance. as we assess the ongoing expected cash flows and carrying amounts of our property, plant and equipment assets, changes in these factors could cause us to realize material impairment charges. bunge recorded impairment charges of $114 million for certain agricultural and industrial assets in its sugar and bioenergy segment during the year ended december 31, 2014.
contingencies we are a party to a large number of claims and lawsuits, primarily tax and labor claims in brazil and tax claims in argentina, and have accrued our estimates of the probable costs to resolve these claims. these estimates have been developed in consultation with in-house and outside counsel and are based on an analysis of potential results, assuming a combination of litigation and settlement strategies. future results of operations for any particular quarterly or annual period could be materially affected by changes in our assumptions or the effectiveness of our strategies relating to these proceedings. for more information on tax and labor claims in brazil, see "item 3. legal proceedings."
income taxes we record valuation allowances to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that we are likely to realize. we consider projections of future taxable income and prudent tax planning strategies to assess the need for and the size of the valuation allowances. if we determine that we can realize a deferred tax asset in excess of our net recorded amount, we decrease the valuation allowance, thereby increasing net income. conversely, if we determine that we are unable to realize all or part of our net deferred tax asset, we increase the valuation allowance, thereby decreasing net income.
62
we apply a "more likely than not" threshold to the recognition and de-recognition of tax benefits. the calculation of our uncertain tax positions involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations in a multitude of jurisdictions across our global operations. we recognize potential liabilities and record uncertain tax positions for anticipated tax audit issues in the united states, brazil, argentina and other tax jurisdictions based on our estimate of whether it is more likely than not additional taxes will be due. we adjust these liabilities in light of changing facts and circumstances; however, due to the complexity of some of these uncertainties, the ultimate resolution may result in a payment that is materially different from our current estimate of the tax liabilities. if our estimate of uncertain tax positions proves to be less than the ultimate assessment, an additional charge to expense would result. if payment of these amounts ultimately proves to be less than the recorded amounts, the reversal of the liabilities would result in tax benefits being recognized in the period when we determined the liabilities are no longer necessary. at december 31, 2014 and 2013, we had recorded uncertain tax positions of $83 million and $171 million, respectively, in our consolidated balance sheets.
new accounting pronouncements new accounting pronouncementsin may 2014, the fasb amended asc (topic 605) revenue recognition and created asc (topic 606) revenue from contracts with customers. the core principle of the guidance is that an entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. the standard is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after december 15, 2016. early application is not permitted. bunge is evaluating the expected impact of this standard on its consolidated financial statements.
in february 2015, the fasb issued asu (topic 810) consolidationamendments to the consolidation analysis. the standard makes targeted amendments to the current consolidation guidance and ends the deferral granted to investment companies from applying the variable interest entity (vie) guidance. the standard is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after december 15, 2015. early adoption is allowed. bunge is evaluating the expected impact of this standard on the consolidation of certain private equity and other investment funds related to our asset management business.

item 1a.    risk factors in addition to the other information in this annual report on form 10-k, the following risk factors should be considered carefully in evaluating our company and our business.
risks related to our industry we are subject to the business, financial and operating risks inherent to the hospitality industry, any of which could reduce our revenues and limit opportunities for growth.
our business is subject to a number of business, financial and operating risks inherent to the hospitality industry, including:
•significant competition from multiple hospitality providers in all parts of the world;
•the financial condition of third-party property owners, developers and joint venture partners;
•relationships with third-party property owners, developers and joint venture partners, including the risk that owners may terminate our management, franchise or joint venture contracts;
•decreases in the frequency of business travel that may result from alternatives to in-person meetings, including virtual meetings hosted online or over private teleconferencing networks;
•decreases in the availability and/or increases in the cost of capital necessary for us and third-party hotel owners to fund investments, capital expenditures and service debt obligations;
•changes in operating costs, including employee compensation and benefits, energy, insurance, food and beverage and other supplies;
•increases in costs due to inflation or other factors that may not be fully offset by increases in revenues in our business, as well as increases in overall prices and the prices of our offerings due to inflation, which could weaken consumer demand for travel and the other products we offer and adversely affect our revenues;
•changes in taxes and governmental regulations that influence or set wages, prices, interest rates or construction and maintenance procedures and costs;
•the costs and administrative burdens associated with complying with applicable laws and regulations;
•the costs or desirability of complying with local practices and customs;
•significant increases in cost for health care coverage for employees and potential government regulation with respect to health care coverage;
•shortages of labor or labor disruptions;
•the ability of third-party internet and other travel intermediaries who sell our hotel rooms to guests to attract and retain customers;
•the quality of services provided by franchisees, including ability to comply with relevant regulations and contractual requirements relating to a variety of issues including environment, human rights and labor;
•delays in or cancellations of planned or future development or refurbishment projects;
•cyclical over-building in the hospitality industry;
•changes in desirability of geographic regions of the hotels in our business, geographic concentration of our operations and customers and shortages of desirable locations for development;
•changes in the supply and demand for hotel services, including rooms, food and beverage and other products and services; and
•the costs required for climate change initiatives, including those resulting from regulatory changes or stakeholder or customer expectations.
any of these factors could increase our costs or limit or reduce the prices we are able to charge third-party hotel owners for providing management and franchise services or hotel customers for hospitality products and services, or otherwise affect our ability to maintain existing properties or develop new properties. as a result, any of these factors can reduce our revenues and limit opportunities for growth.
macroeconomic and other factors beyond our control can adversely affect and reduce demand for our products and services.
macroeconomic and other factors beyond our control can reduce demand for hospitality products and services, including demand for rooms at our hotels. these factors include, but are not limited to:
•changes in general economic conditions, including inflation, supply chain disruptions, low consumer confidence, increases in unemployment levels and depressed real estate prices resulting from the severity and duration of any downturn in the u.s. or global economy and financial markets;
•conditions that negatively shape public perception of travel or result in temporary closures or other disruption at our hotel properties, including travel-related accidents, outbreaks of pandemic or contagious diseases, such as covid-19, ebola, zika, avian flu, severe acute respiratory syndrome (sars), h1n1 (swine flu) and middle east respiratory syndrome (mers);
•geo-political activity, political and social unrest and governmental action and uncertainty resulting from u.s. and global political and social trends and policies, including potential barriers to travel, trade and immigration;
•wars, such as russia's invasion of ukraine, political instability or civil unrest, terrorist activities or threats and resulting heightened travel security measures, any of which may foreclose travel to certain locales or decrease the appeal of travel among the general population;
•the impact of u.s. federal government shutdowns and other similar governmental budgetary impasses or reductions;
•decreased corporate or government travel-related budgets and spending, as well as cancellations, deferrals or renegotiations of group business, such as industry conventions;
•statements, actions or interventions by governmental officials related to travel and corporate travel-related activities and the resulting negative public perception of such travel and activities;
•the financial and general business condition of the airline, automotive and other transportation-related industries and its effect on travel, including decreased airline capacity and routes and increased travel costs;
•perceived negative impacts of tourism on local cultures, human rights and the environment;
•cyber-attacks;
•the impact of climate change or availability of natural resources;
•natural, climate-related or man-made disasters and extreme weather conditions, including earthquakes, tsunamis, tornadoes, hurricanes, typhoons, floods, wildfires, volcanic eruptions, oil spills and nuclear incidents;
•labor shortages, which could restrict our ability to efficiently operate or grow our business and/or increase our costs;
•organized labor activities, which could cause a diversion of business from hotels involved in labor negotiations and loss of business for our hotels generally as a result of certain labor tactics; and
•other changes in the overall demand for what we offer, including the desirability of particular locations or travel patterns of customers.
any one or more of these factors could limit or reduce overall demand for our products and services or could negatively affect our revenue sources, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
contraction in the global economy or low levels of economic growth could adversely affect our revenues and profitability, as well as limit or slow our future growth.
consumer demand for our services is closely linked to the performance of the general economy and is sensitive to business and personal discretionary spending levels. decreased global or regional demand for hospitality products and services can be especially pronounced during periods of economic contraction or low levels of economic growth, and the recovery period in our industry may lag overall economic improvement. declines in demand for our products and services due to general economic conditions could negatively affect our business by limiting the amount of fee revenues we are able to generate from our managed and franchised properties and decreasing the revenues and profitability of our owned and leased properties. in addition, many of the expenses associated with our business, including personnel costs, interest, rent, property taxes, insurance and utilities, are relatively fixed. during a period of overall economic weakness, if we are unable to meaningfully decrease these costs as demand for our hotels decreases, our business operations and financial performance and results may be adversely affected.
the covid-19 pandemic negatively affected our business, financial condition and results of operations and covid-19 or other outbreaks of contagious diseases or other adverse public health developments may negatively affect future results.
the covid-19 pandemic significantly affected the global economy and strained the hospitality industry due to travel restrictions and advisories, stay-at-home directives, limitations on public gatherings and modified work arrangements, all of which resulted in cancellations and reduced travel around the world, as well as complete and partial suspensions of certain hotel operations. although distribution of approved vaccines for covid-19 continued throughout 2022, access to and acceptance of vaccines has varied across regions and within individual countries. in addition, new strains of the virus have had increased transmissibility, complicating treatment and vaccination programs. as such, the covid-19 pandemic had an adverse impact on certain of our results for the year ended december 31, 2022, when compared to prior years, and covid-19 or outbreaks of other contagious diseases or other adverse public health developments may continue to negatively affect future results. in particular, the continued impact of covid-19 and the related restrictions in china have limited demand in that market. the long-term effects of the pandemic on our business and the travel industry at large remain uncertain and will depend on future developments, including, but not limited to, the duration and severity of potential future serious illnesses, if any, the availability and public acceptance of vaccinations and other treatments to combat covid-19 and the length of time it takes for demand to stabilize and normal economic and operating conditions to fully resume. the current and uncertain future impact of the covid-19 pandemic, including its effect on the ability or desire of people to travel and use our hotel properties for lodging, food and beverage and other services, may negatively affect our results, operations, outlook, plans, growth, cash flows and liquidity.
the steps we took in 2020 to reduce operating costs for us and our owners, including temporarily reducing compensation, reducing our workforce and furloughing a substantial number of our employees, negatively affected our ability to attract and retain employees. some hotels have faced challenges restaffing to pre-pandemic levels, which in some cases negatively affected guest experience and loyalty and, in turn, certain hotel results. we could still experience long-term impacts on our operating costs as a result of attempts to counteract future outbreaks of covid-19 or other viruses through, for example, enhanced health and hygiene requirements or other such measures in one or more regions.
the covid-19 pandemic had a negative impact on our partners, including third-party owners of our properties, third-party service providers, travel agencies, suppliers and other vendors. in particular, third-party owners of our hotels experienced financing difficulties and significant declines in revenues during the pandemic, thereby making it more difficult for them to maintain their hotels and service their indebtedness.
risks related to operating our business because we operate in a highly competitive industry, our revenues or profits could be harmed if we are unable to compete effectively.
the segments of the hospitality industry in which we operate are subject to intense competition. our principal competitors are other operators of luxury, full-service and focused-service hotels, including other major hospitality chains with well-established and recognized brands. we also compete against smaller hotel chains, independent and local hotel owners and operators, home and apartment sharing services and timeshare operators. if we are unable to compete successfully, our revenues or profits may decline.
competition for hotel guests we face competition for individual guests, group reservations and conference business at our hotels. we compete for these customers based primarily on brand name recognition and reputation, as well as location, rates for hotel rooms, food and beverage and other services, property size and availability of rooms and conference and meeting space, accommodations and technology, quality of the accommodations, customer satisfaction, amenities and the ability to earn and redeem loyalty program points. our competitors may have greater commercial, financial and marketing resources and more efficient technology platforms, which could allow them to improve their properties and expand and improve their marketing efforts in ways that could affect our ability to compete for guests effectively, or they could offer a type of lodging product that customers find attractive but that we do not offer.
competition for management and franchise contracts we compete to enter into management and franchise contracts. our ability to compete effectively is based primarily on the value and quality of our management services, brand name recognition and reputation, our access to and willingness to invest capital, availability of suitable properties in certain geographic areas, the overall economic terms of our contracts and the economic advantages to the third-party hotel owner of retaining our management services and/or using our brands. if the properties that we manage or franchise perform less successfully than those of our competitors, if we are unable to offer terms as favorable as those offered by our competitors or if the availability of suitable properties is limited, we may not be able to compete effectively for new management or franchise contracts.
any deterioration in the quality or reputation of our brands could have an adverse effect on our reputation, business, financial condition or results of operations.
our brands are among our most important assets. our ability to attract and retain guests depends, in part, on the public recognition of our brands and their associated reputation. in addition, the success of our hotel owners' businesses and the amount of payments to us for the assets and services we provide them may depend on the strength and reputation of our brands. if our brands become obsolete or consumers view them as unfashionable, unsustainable or lacking in consistency and quality, we may be unable to attract guests to our hotels and may further be unable to attract or retain our hotel owners.
changes in ownership or management practices, perceptions of our esg practices, perception of guest or employee health or safety, the occurrence of accidents or injuries, cyber-attacks, security breaches, natural disasters, crime, failure of suppliers, franchisees or business partners to comply with relevant regulations and contractual requirements relating to a variety of issues including environmental, human rights and labor, individual guest, owner or employee notoriety or similar events at our hotels and resorts can harm our reputation, create adverse publicity and cause a loss of consumer confidence in our business. because of the global nature of our brands and the broad expanse of our business and hotel locations, events occurring in one location could negatively affect the reputation and operations of otherwise successful individual locations. in addition, the expansion of social media has compounded the potential scope of negative publicity by increasing the speed and expanse of information dissemination. many social media platforms publish content immediately and without filtering or verifying the accuracy of that content. a negative incident or the perception of occurrence of a negative incident at one hotel could have far-reaching effects, including lost sales, customer boycotts, loss of development opportunities and employee difficulties. such incidents have in the past and could in the future subject us to legal actions, including litigation, governmental investigations or penalties, along with the resulting additional adverse publicity. a perceived decline in the quality of our brands or damage to our reputation could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
our business is subject to risks related to doing business with third-party property owners that could adversely affect our reputation, operational results or prospects for growth.
unless we maintain good relationships with third-party hotel owners and renew or enter into new management and franchise contracts, we may be unable to maintain or expand our presence and our business, financial condition and results of operations may suffer.
our business depends on our ability to: (i) establish and maintain long-term, positive relationships with third-party hotel owners; and (ii) enter into new, and renew, management and franchise contracts. although our management and franchise contracts are typically long-term arrangements, hotel owners may be able to terminate the contracts under certain circumstances, including the failure to meet specified financial or performance criteria. our ability to meet these financial and performance criteria is subject to, among other things, risks common to the overall hospitality industry, including factors outside of our control. in addition, negative management and franchise pricing trends in the industry more broadly could adversely affect our ability to negotiate with hotel owners. if we fail to maintain and renew existing management and franchise contracts or enter into new contracts on favorable terms, we may be unable to expand our presence and our business, and our financial condition and results of operations may suffer.
our business is subject to real estate investment risks for third-party hotel owners that could adversely affect our operational results and our prospects for growth.
growth of our business is affected, and may potentially be limited, by factors influencing real estate development generally, including site availability, financing availability and cost, planning, zoning and other local approvals. in addition, market factors such as projected room occupancy, changes in growth in demand for customers compared to projected supply, geographic area restrictions in management and franchise contracts, costs and availability of construction labor and materials and anticipated room rate structure, if not managed effectively by our third-party hotel owners could adversely affect the growth of our management and franchise business.
if our third-party hotel owners are unable to repay or refinance loans secured by properties, or to obtain financing adequate to fund current operations or growth plans, our revenues, profits and capital resources could be reduced and our business could be harmed.
many of our third-party hotel owners pledged their properties as collateral for loans entered into at the time of development, purchase or refinancing. if our third-party hotel owners are unable to repay or refinance maturing indebtedness on favorable terms or at all, which could be more difficult in the current interest rate environment, their lenders could declare a default, accelerate the related debt and repossess the property and we could also be required to make cash payments for any debt that we guarantee. while we maintain certain contractual protections, repossession could result in the termination of our management or franchise contract or eliminate revenues and cash flows from the property. in addition, the owners of managed and franchised hotels depend on financing to develop or buy and improve hotels and, in some cases, fund operations during down cycles. our hotel owners' inability to obtain adequate funding or to do so at interest rates that they are willing to accept could materially adversely affect the operation, maintenance and improvement plans of existing hotels, result in the delay or stoppage of the development of our existing development pipeline and limit additional development to further expand our hotel portfolio.
hotel owners with financial difficulties have been and may continue to be unable or unwilling to pay us amounts that we are entitled to under our existing contracts on a timely basis or at all. unfavorable economic conditions also could affect our ability to enter into management and franchise contracts with potential third-party owners of our hotels, who may be unable to obtain financing or face other delays or cost pressures in developing hotel projects. as a result, some properties in our development pipeline have entered our system later than we anticipated, and new hotels have entered our pipeline at a slower rate than in the past, thereby negatively affecting our overall growth. likewise, if we or our hotel owners or franchisees are unable to access capital to make physical improvements to our hotels, the quality of our hotels may suffer, which may negatively impact our reputation and guest loyalty, and our performance may suffer as a result.
if our third-party property owners fail to make investments necessary to maintain or improve their properties, guest preference for hilton brands, hilton's reputation and performance results could suffer.
substantially all of our management and franchise contracts, as well as our license agreement with hgv, require third-party property owners to comply with quality and reputation standards of our brands, which include requirements related to the physical condition, use of technology, safety standards and appearance of the properties, as well as the service levels provided by hotel employees. these standards may evolve with customer preference, or we may introduce new requirements over time. if our property owners fail to make investments necessary to maintain or improve the properties in accordance with our standards, or based on customer demand more broadly, guest preference for our brands could diminish. in addition, if third-party property owners fail to observe standards or meet their contractual requirements, we may elect to exercise our termination rights, which would eliminate revenues from these properties and cause us to incur expenses related to terminating these contracts. we may be unable to find suitable or offsetting replacements for any individually terminated hotels or broader third-party owner relationships.
contractual and other disagreements with third-party property owners could make us liable to them or result in litigation costs or other expenses or termination of existing management or franchise contracts.
our management and franchise contracts require us and our hotel owners to comply with operational and performance conditions that are subject to interpretation and could result in disagreements. any dispute with a property owner could be very expensive for us, even if the outcome is ultimately in our favor. we cannot predict the outcome of any arbitration or litigation, the effect of any negative judgment against us or the amount of any settlement that we may enter into with any third party. furthermore, specific to our industry, some courts have applied principles of agency law and related fiduciary standards to managers of third-party hotel properties, which means that property owners may assert the right to terminate contracts even where the contracts do not expressly provide for termination. our fees from any property permitted to be terminated would be eliminated, and accordingly, may negatively affect our results of operations.
some of our existing development pipeline may not be developed into new hotels, which could materially adversely affect our growth prospects.
as of december 31, 2022, we had 2,821 hotels in our development pipeline, which we define as hotels under construction or approved for development under one of our brands. the commitments of owners and developers with whom we have contracts are subject to numerous conditions, and the eventual development and construction of our development pipeline, in particular for hotels not currently under construction, is subject to numerous risks, including, in certain cases, the owner's or developer's ability to obtain adequate financing and governmental or regulatory approvals. as a result, not every hotel in our development pipeline may develop into a new hotel that enters our system.
new hotel brands or non-hotel branded concepts that we launch in the future may not be as successful as we anticipate, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.
since 2011, we have launched ten new brands: home2 suites by hilton; curio collection by hilton; canopy by hilton; tru by hilton; tapestry collection by hilton; motto by hilton; lxr hotels & resorts; signia by hilton; tempo by hilton; and, most recently, spark by hilton. we may continue to build our portfolio by launching new hotel and non-hotel brands in the future. in addition, the hilton garden inn, doubletree by hilton and hampton by hilton brands have been expanding into new jurisdictions outside the u.s. over the past several years. we may continue to expand existing brands into new international markets. new hotel products or concepts or brand expansions may not be accepted by hotel owners, franchisees or customers and we cannot guarantee the level of acceptance any new brand will have in the development and consumer marketplaces. if new branded hotel products, non-hotel branded concepts or brand expansions are not as successful as we anticipate, we may not recover the costs we incurred in their development or expansion, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
the risks resulting from investments in owned and leased real estate could increase our costs, reduce our profits and limit our ability to respond to market conditions.
our investments in owned and leased real property (including through joint ventures) subject us to various risks that may not be applicable to managed or franchised properties, including:
•governmental regulations relating to real estate ownership or operations, including tax, environmental, zoning and eminent domain laws;
•fluctuations or loss in value of real estate or potential impairments in the value of our assets due to changes in market conditions and expectations of future hotels revenues and costs of operations in the area in which real estate or assets are located;
•increased potential civil liability for accidents or other occurrences on owned or leased properties;
•the ongoing need for capital improvements and expenditures funded by us to maintain or upgrade properties, some of which were constructed many years ago, and contractual requirements to deliver properties back to landlords in a particular state of repair and condition at the end of a lease term;
•construction delays, lack of availability of required construction materials or cost overruns (including labor and materials) related to necessary capital improvements of owned and leased properties;
•periodic total or partial closures due to renovations and facility improvements;
•risks associated with any mortgage debt, including the possibility of default, fluctuating interest rate levels, particularly in the current interest rate environment, and uncertainties in the availability of replacement financing;
•the inability to rebuild a property that has been damaged or destroyed by casualty, including a climate-related weather event, as a result of governmental regulations or other restrictions;
•the inability to renew our leases on favorable terms or at all;
•our limited ability to influence the decisions and operations of joint ventures in which we have a minority interest;
•force majeure events, including earthquakes, tornadoes, hurricanes, wildfires, floods, tsunamis, climate-related weather events, outbreaks of pandemic or contagious diseases or acts of terrorism;
•contingent liabilities that exist after we have exited a property;
•costs linked to the employment and management of staff to run and operate an owned or leased property;
•increased operating costs including energy, insurance, food and beverage, supplies and other operating costs; and
•the relative illiquidity of real estate compared to some other assets.
the negative effect on profitability and cash flow from declines in revenues is more pronounced in owned and leased properties because we, as the owner or lessee, bear the risk of the costs required to own and operate a hotel. further, during times of economic distress, declining demand and declining earnings often result in declining asset values, and we or our joint ventures may not be able to sell properties or exit leasing arrangements on favorable terms or at all. accordingly, we may not be able to adjust our owned and leased property portfolio promptly in response to changes in economic or other conditions.
failures in, material damage to or interruptions in our information technology systems, software or websites, including as a result of cyber-attacks on our systems or systems operated by third parties that provide operational and technical services to us, costs associated with protecting the integrity and security of personal data and other sensitive information and difficulties in updating our existing software or developing or implementing new software could have a material adverse effect on our business or results of operations.
we depend heavily upon our information technology systems in the conduct of our business. we develop, own and license or otherwise contract for sophisticated technology systems and services for property management, procurement, finance, human resources, reservations, distribution and the operation of the hilton honors guest loyalty program. such systems are subject to, among other things, damage or interruption from power outages, computer and telecommunications failures, computer viruses, third-party criminal activity including "ransomware" or other malware and natural and man-made disasters. although we have a cold disaster recovery site in a separate location and cloud backup processes to back up our core reservation, property management, distribution and financial systems, certain of our data center operations are currently located in a single facility or with a single cloud-based provider. although we continue to renovate and migrate portions of our operations to cloud-based providers while simultaneously building and operating new applications and services with those cloud-based providers, any loss or damage to our primary physical or cloud-based facilities could result in operational disruption and data loss as we transfer production operations to our disaster recovery site or cloud providers. damage or interruption to our information systems may require a significant investment to update, remediate or replace with alternate systems, and we may suffer interruptions in our operations as a result. in addition, costs and potential problems or interruptions associated with the implementation of new or upgraded systems and technology or with maintenance or support of existing systems could also disrupt or reduce the efficiency of our operations. any material interruptions or failures in our systems, including those that may result from our failure to adequately develop, implement and maintain a robust disaster recovery plan and backup systems could severely affect our ability to conduct normal business operations and, as a result, have a material adverse effect on our business operations and financial performance.
we rely on third parties for the performance of a significant portion of our information technology functions worldwide. in particular, our loyalty platform, property management, reservation and distribution systems rely on data communications networks and systems operated by unaffiliated third parties and cloud providers. the success of our business depends in part on maintaining our relationships with these third parties and their continuing ability to perform these functions and services in a timely and satisfactory manner. if we experience a loss or disruption in the provision of any of these functions or services, or they are not performed in a satisfactory manner, we may have difficulty in finding alternate providers on terms favorable to us, in a timely manner or at all, and our business could be adversely affected.
we rely on certain vendors for traditional software and cloud/software-as-a-service operations to maintain and periodically upgrade many of these systems and applications so that they can continue to support our business. the software programs supporting many of our systems were licensed to us by independent software developers. the inability of these developers or us to continue to maintain and upgrade these information systems and software programs would disrupt or reduce the efficiency of our operations if we were unable to convert to alternate systems in an efficient and timely manner.
we are vulnerable to various risks and uncertainties associated with our websites and mobile applications, including changes in required technology interfaces, website and mobile application downtime and other technical failures, unexpected costs and changes and issues as we upgrade our website software and mobile applications. additional risks include computer malware, changes in applicable federal, state and international regulations, security breaches, legal claims related to our website operations, e-commerce fulfillment and other consumer privacy concerns. our failure to successfully respond to these risks and uncertainties could reduce website and mobile application sales and have a material adverse effect on our business or results of operations.
cyber-attacks could have a disruptive effect on our business.
from time to time we and our third-party service providers experience cyber-attacks, attempted and actual breaches of our or their information technology systems and networks or similar events, which could result in a loss of sensitive business or customer information, systems interruption or the disruption of our operations. the techniques that are used to obtain unauthorized access, disable or degrade service or sabotage systems change frequently and may be difficult to detect for long periods of time, and despite our deployment of cyber-attack prevention and detection techniques, we are accordingly unable to anticipate and prevent all data security incidents. we have in the past been subject to cyber-attacks and expect that we will be subject to additional cyber-attacks in the future and may experience data breaches.
even if we are fully compliant with legal standards and contractual or other requirements, we still may not be able to prevent security breaches involving sensitive data. the sophistication of efforts by hackers to gain unauthorized access to information systems has continued to increase in recent years and may continue to do so. breaches, thefts, losses or fraudulent uses of customer, employee or company data could cause consumers to lose confidence in the security of our websites, mobile applications, point of sale systems and other information technology systems and, as a result of this loss in confidence, choose not to purchase from us. such security breaches also could expose us to risks of data loss, business disruption, litigation, fines, regulatory charges and other costs or liabilities, any of which could adversely affect our business.
we are exposed to risks and costs associated with protecting the integrity and security of personal data and other sensitive information.
we are subject to various risks and costs associated with the collection, handling, storage and transmission of sensitive information, including costs related to compliance with u.s. and foreign data collection and privacy laws and other contractual obligations, as well as risks associated with the compromise of our systems collecting such information. many jurisdictions, including the european union ("e.u."), the u.k., china and certain states within the u.s., have passed laws that require companies to meet specific requirements regarding the handling of personal data. we collect internal and customer data, including credit card numbers and other personally identifiable information for a variety of important business purposes, including managing our workforce, providing requested products and services and maintaining guest preferences to enhance customer service and for marketing and promotion purposes. we could be exposed to fines, penalties, restrictions, litigation, reputational harm or other expenses, or other adverse effects on our business, due to failure to protect personal data and other sensitive information or failure to maintain compliance with the various u.s. and foreign data collection and privacy laws or with credit card industry standards or other applicable data security standards.
in addition, u.s. states and the federal government have enacted additional laws and regulations to protect consumers against identity theft. these laws and similar laws in other jurisdictions have increased the costs of doing business, and failure on our part to implement appropriate safeguards or to detect and provide prompt notice of unauthorized access as required by some of these laws could subject us to potential claims for damages and other remedies. if we were required to pay any significant amounts in satisfaction of claims under these laws, or if we were forced to cease our business operations for any length of time as a result of our inability to comply fully with any such law, our business, operating results and financial condition could be adversely affected.
failure to keep pace with developments in technology could adversely affect our operations or competitive position.
the hospitality industry demands the use of sophisticated technology and systems for property management, brand assurance and compliance, procurement, reservation systems, operation of our guest loyalty programs, distribution of hotel resources to current and future customers and guest amenities. these technologies may require refinements and upgrades, and third parties may cease support of systems that are currently in use. the development and maintenance of these technologies may require significant investment by us. as various systems and technologies become outdated or new technology is required, we may not be able to replace or introduce them as quickly as needed or in a cost-effective and timely manner. in some cases, hotel owners may refuse to upgrade systems or deploy new technology to replace aging or end-of-life software and/or hardware. as a result, our business operations could be disrupted and our competitive position could decline, adversely affecting our financial performance, or we may not achieve the benefits we may have been anticipating from any new technology or system.
because third parties provide us with a number of operational and technical services, third-party security incidents could expose us to liability, harm our reputation, damage our competitiveness and adversely affect our financial performance.
third parties provide us with certain operational and technical services. these third parties may have access to our systems, provide hosting services, or otherwise process data about us or our guests, employees or partners. any third-party security incident could compromise the integrity or availability of or result in the theft of confidential or otherwise sensitive data, which could negatively impact our operations. unauthorized access to data and other confidential or proprietary information may be obtained through break-ins, network breaches by unauthorized parties, employee theft or misuse or other misconduct. we rely on the internal processes and controls of third-party software and application vendors to maintain the security of all software code provided to or used by hilton. should those vendors fail to secure their products then we are at risk of unintentionally injecting malware into our systems via compromised software code they provide. the occurrence of any of the foregoing could negatively affect our reputation, our competitive position and our financial performance, and we could face lawsuits and potential liability.
delays in service from third-party service providers could expose us to liability, harm our reputation, damage our competitiveness and adversely affect our financial performance.
from time to time, we may rely on a single or limited number of suppliers for the provision of various goods or services that we use in the operation of our business. the inability of such third parties to satisfy our or our guests' requirements could disrupt our business operations or make it more difficult for us to implement our business strategy. if any of these situations were to occur, our reputation could be harmed, we could be subject to third-party liability, including under data protection and privacy laws in certain jurisdictions, and our financial performance could be negatively affected.
failure to comply with marketing and advertising laws, including with regard to direct marketing, could result in fines or place restrictions on our business.
we rely on a variety of direct marketing techniques, including telemarketing, email and social media marketing and postal mailings, and we are subject to various laws and regulations in the u.s. and internationally that govern marketing and advertising practices. any further restrictions in laws and court or agency interpretations of such laws, such as the telephone consumer protection act of 1991, the telemarketing sales rule, the can-spam act of 2003, various u.s. state laws, such as the california privacy rights act, international data protection laws, such as the e.u. general data protection regulation ("gdpr"), and laws limiting the cross-border transfer of data that govern these activities or new laws that become effective in the future could adversely affect current or planned marketing activities and cause us to change our marketing strategy. if this occurs, we may not be able to develop adequate alternative marketing strategies, which could affect our ability to maintain relationships with our customers and acquire new customers. we also obtain access to names of potential customers from travel service providers or other companies, and we market to some individuals on these lists directly or through other companies' marketing materials. if access to these lists were prohibited or otherwise restricted, our ability to develop new customers and introduce them to products could be impaired.
the growth of internet reservation channels could adversely affect our business and profitability.
a significant percentage of hotel rooms for individual guests are booked through internet travel intermediaries, to whom we commit to pay various commissions and transaction fees for sales of our rooms through their systems. search engines and peer-to-peer inventory sources also provide online travel services that compete with our business. if these bookings increase, these hospitality intermediaries may be able to obtain higher commissions or other significant concessions from us or our franchisees. these hospitality intermediaries also may reduce bookings at our hotel properties by de-ranking our hotels in search results on their platforms, and other online providers may divert business away from our hotels. although our contracts with many hospitality intermediaries limit transaction fees for hotels, there can be no assurance that we will be able to renegotiate these contracts upon their expiration with terms as favorable as the provisions that existed before the expiration, replacement or renegotiation. moreover, hospitality intermediaries generally employ aggressive marketing strategies, including expending significant resources for online and television advertising campaigns to drive consumers to their websites. as a result, consumers may develop brand loyalties to the intermediaries' brands, websites and reservations systems rather than to the hilton brands and systems. if this happens, our business and profitability may be significantly affected over time as shifting customer loyalties divert bookings away from our websites, which increases costs to hotels in our system. internet travel intermediaries also have been subject to regulatory scrutiny, particularly in europe. the outcome of this regulatory activity may affect our ability to compete for direct bookings through our own internet channels.
in addition, although internet travel intermediaries have traditionally competed to attract individual leisure consumers or transient business rather than group business for meetings and events, in recent years they have expanded their business to include marketing to group business and also to corporate transient business. if that growth continues, it could both divert group and corporate transient business away from our hotels and also increase our cost of sales for group and corporate transient business. consolidation of internet travel intermediaries, or the entry of major internet companies into the internet travel bookings business, also could divert bookings away from our websites and increase our hotels' cost of sales.
our reservation system is an important component of our business operations and a disruption to its functioning could have an adverse effect on our performance and results.
we manage a global reservation system that communicates reservations to our branded hotels when made by individuals directly, either online, by telephone to our call centers, through devices via our mobile application, or through intermediaries like travel agents, internet travel websites and other distribution channels. the cost, speed, efficacy and efficiency of the reservation system are important aspects of our business and are important considerations of hotel owners in choosing to affiliate with our brands. any disruption to the continuity of our reservation system, including any failure to maintain or upgrade such system, may adversely affect our ability to serve customers effectively and support reservations at our hotels.
the cessation, reduction or taxation of program benefits of our hilton honors guest loyalty program could adversely affect the hilton brands and guest loyalty.
we manage the hilton honors guest loyalty program for all of the brands that we operate. program members accumulate points primarily based on eligible stays and hotel charges and redeem the points for a range of benefits including free rooms and other items of value. the program is an important aspect of our business and of the affiliation value for hotel owners under management and franchise contracts. system hotels, including, without limitation, third-party hotels under management and franchise contracts, contribute a percentage of the charges incurred by members of the loyalty program for each stay of a program member. in addition to the accumulation of points for future hotel stays at our brands, hilton honors arranges with third parties, such as airlines, other transportation services, online vendors, retailers and credit card companies, to sell hilton honors points for the use of their customers and/or to allow hilton honors members to use or exchange points for products or services made available to loyalty program members by those third parties. currently, the program benefits are not taxed as income to members. if the program awards and benefits are materially altered, curtailed or taxed such that a material number of hilton honors members choose to no longer participate in the program, our business could be adversely affected.
because we derive a portion of our revenues from operations outside the u.s., the risks of doing business internationally could lower our revenues, increase our costs, reduce our profits or disrupt our business.
we currently manage, franchise, own or lease hotels and resorts in 123 countries and territories around the world. our rooms outside the u.s. represented approximately 31 percent, 30 percent and 28 percent of our system-wide rooms for the years ended december 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. we expect that our international operations will continue to account for a material portion of our results. as a result, we are subject to the risks of doing business outside the u.s., including:
•rapid changes in governmental, economic or political policy, wars, political or civil unrest, acts of terrorism or the threat of international boycotts or u.s. anti-boycott legislation;
•increases in anti-american sentiment and the identification of our licensed brands as an american brand;
•recessionary trends or economic instability in international markets;
•changes in foreign currency exchange rates or currency restructurings and hyperinflation or deflation in the countries in which we operate;
•the effect of disruptions, including the temporary closure of hotel properties, caused by severe weather or climate-related events, natural disasters (including as a result of climate change), outbreak of disease, such as covid-19, or other events that make travel to a particular region less attractive or more difficult;
•the presence and acceptance of varying levels of business corruption in international markets and the effect of various anti-corruption and other laws;
•
•the imposition of restrictions on currency conversion or the transfer of funds or limitations on our ability to repatriate non-u.s. earnings in a tax-efficient manner;
•the ability to comply with or the effect of complying with complex and changing laws, sanctions, regulations and policies of foreign governments that may affect investments or operations, including foreign ownership restrictions, import and export controls, tariffs, embargoes, increases in taxes paid and other changes in applicable tax laws;
•the ability to comply with or the effect of complying with developing laws, regulations and policies of foreign governments with respect to human rights, including in the supply chain;
•instability or changes in a country's or region's economic, regulatory or political conditions, including inflation, recession, interest rate fluctuations and actual or anticipated military or political conflicts or any other change;
•political, economic and other uncertainty resulting from the u.k.'s exit from the e.u. (commonly known as "brexit"), the terms of which could adversely affect our business;
•uncertainties as to local laws regarding, and enforcement of, contract and ip rights;
•forced nationalization of our properties by local, state or national governments; and
•the difficulties involved in managing an organization doing business in many different countries.
these factors may adversely affect the revenues earned from our hotels and resorts (as well as the market value of properties that we own or lease) located in international markets. while these factors and the effect of these factors are difficult to predict, any one or more of them could lower our revenues, increase our costs, reduce our profits or disrupt our business operations.
failure to comply with laws and regulations applicable to our international operations may increase costs, reduce profits, limit growth or subject us to broader liability.
our business operations in countries outside the u.s. are subject to a number of laws and regulations, including restrictions imposed by the foreign corrupt practices act ("fcpa"), as well as trade sanctions administered by the office of foreign assets control ("ofac"). although we have policies in place designed to comply with applicable sanctions, rules and regulations, it is possible that hotels we manage, own or lease in the countries and territories in which we operate may provide services to or receive funds from persons subject to sanctions. where we have identified potential violations in the past, we have taken appropriate remedial action including filing voluntary disclosures to ofac. in addition, some of our operations may be subject to the laws and regulations of non-u.s. jurisdictions, including the u.k.'s bribery act 2010, which contains significant prohibitions on bribery and other corrupt business activities, and other local anti-corruption laws in the countries and territories in which we conduct operations.
if we fail to comply with these laws and regulations, we could be exposed to claims for damages, financial penalties, reputational harm and incarceration of employees or restrictions on our operation or ownership of hotels and other properties, including the termination of management, franchising and ownership rights. in addition, in certain circumstances, the actions of parties affiliated with us (including our owners, joint venture partners, employees and agents) may expose us to liability under the fcpa, u.s. sanctions or other laws. these restrictions could increase costs of operations, reduce profits or cause us to forgo development opportunities that would otherwise support growth.
in addition, we are subject to a number of modern slavery, human trafficking and forced labor reporting, training and mandatory due diligence laws in various jurisdictions and expect additional statutory regimes to combat these crimes to be enacted in the future. the impact of these laws, such as the u.k's modern slavery act 2015 and the german supply chain due diligence act, and similar legislation on hotel operations could increase costs of operations and reduce our profits.
collective bargaining activity could disrupt our operations, increase our labor costs or interfere with the ability of our management to focus on executing our business strategies.
a significant number of our employees and employees of our hotel owners are covered by collective bargaining agreements and similar agreements, including approximately 30 percent of people employed or managed by us globally. if relationships with our employees or employees of our hotel owners or the unions that represent them become adverse, the properties we manage, franchise, own or lease could experience labor disruptions such as strikes, lockouts, boycotts and public demonstrations. a number of our collective bargaining agreements are in the process of being renegotiated, and, if more employees become unionized, we may be required to negotiate additional collective bargaining agreements in the future. labor disputes, which may be more likely when collective bargaining agreements are being negotiated, could harm our relationship with our employees or employees of our hotel owners, result in increased regulatory inquiries and enforcement by governmental authorities and deter guests. further, adverse publicity related to a labor dispute could harm our reputation and reduce customer demand for our services. labor regulation and the negotiation of new or existing collective bargaining agreements could lead to higher wage and benefit costs, changes in work rules that raise operating expenses, legal costs and limitations on our ability or the ability of our third-party property owners to take cost saving measures during economic downturns. we do not have the ability to influence the negotiations of collective bargaining agreements covering unionized labor employed by third-party property owners. increased unionization of our workforce, new labor legislation or changes in regulations could disrupt our operations and our ability to promote services expected by customers, reduce our profitability or interfere with the ability of our management to focus on executing our business strategies.
labor shortages could restrict our ability to operate our properties or grow our business or result in increased labor costs that could adversely affect our results of operations.
our success depends in large part on our ability to attract, retain, train, manage and engage employees. the covid-19 pandemic has negatively affected the labor market for employers. labor shortages have affected the ability of our hotels to hire or re-hire employees during the ongoing recovery from the downturn caused by the pandemic. among the factors that caused the labor shortages are the relative reduced appeal of working in the hospitality industry in a downturn, alternatives available in other industries and perceived health and safety concerns. as of december 31, 2022, we employed or managed approximately 159,000 individuals at our managed, owned and leased hotels and corporate offices around the world. if we are unable to attract, retain, train, manage and engage skilled individuals, our ability to staff and operate the hotels that we manage, own and lease could be diminished, which could reduce customer satisfaction, and our ability to manage our corporate business could be adversely affected. in addition, the inability of our franchisees to attract, retain, train, manage and engage skilled employees for the franchised hotels could adversely affect the reputation of our brands. staffing shortages in various parts of the world also could hinder our ability to grow and expand our businesses. because payroll costs are a major component of the operating expenses at our owned, leased and managed hotels, as well as our franchised hotels, a shortage of skilled labor could also require higher wages that would increase labor costs, which could adversely affect our results of operations and the results of hotels that we manage on behalf of third-party owners. additionally, an increase in minimum wage rates could increase costs and reduce profits for us and our franchisees, which could, in turn, lower demand from third-party owners to add hotels to our system. we also face challenges with respect to retaining corporate employees. if we lost the services of one or more senior executives, this could adversely affect strategic relationships, including relationships with third-party hotel owners, significant customers, joint venture partners and vendors, and limit our ability to execute our business strategies.
any failure to protect our trademarks and other ip could reduce the value of the hilton brands and harm our business.
the recognition and reputation of our brands are important to our success. we have a significant number of trademark registrations in jurisdictions around the world for use in connection with our services, plus at any given time, a number of pending applications for trademarks and other ip. however, those trademark or other ip registrations may not be granted or the steps we take to use, control or protect our trademarks or other ip in the u.s. and other jurisdictions may not always be adequate to prevent third parties from copying or using the trademarks or other ip without authorization. we may also fail to obtain and maintain trademark protection for all of our brands in all jurisdictions. for example, in certain jurisdictions, third parties have registered or otherwise have the right to use certain trademarks that are the same as or similar to our trademarks, which could prevent us from registering trademarks and opening hotels in those jurisdictions. third parties may also challenge our rights to certain trademarks or oppose our trademark applications. defending against any such proceedings may be costly, and if unsuccessful, could result in the loss of important ip rights. obtaining and maintaining trademark protection for multiple brands in multiple jurisdictions is also expensive, and we may therefore elect not to apply for or to maintain certain trademarks.
our ip is also vulnerable to unauthorized copying or use where local law, or lax enforcement of law, may not provide adequate protection. if our trademarks or other ip are improperly used, the value and reputation of the hilton brands could be harmed. there are times where we may need to resort to litigation to enforce our ip rights. litigation of this type could be unsuccessful, costly, force us to divert our resources, lead to counterclaims or other claims against us or otherwise harm our business or reputation. in addition, we license certain of our trademarks to third parties. for example, we have granted hgv the right to use certain of our ip in its timeshare business and we grant our franchisees a right to use certain of our ip in connection with their operation of the licensed hotel property. if hgv, a franchisee or other licensee fails to maintain the quality of the goods and services used in connection with the licensed trademarks, our rights to, and the value of, our trademarks could be harmed. failure to maintain, control and protect our trademarks and other ip could likely adversely affect our ability to attract guests or third-party owners, and could adversely affect our results.
in addition, we license the right to use certain ip from unaffiliated third parties, including the right to grant sublicenses to franchisees. if we are unable to use this ip, our ability to generate revenue from such properties may be diminished.
third-party claims that we infringe ip rights of others could subject us to damages and other costs and expenses.
third parties may make claims against us for infringing their patent, trademark, copyright or other ip rights or for misappropriating their trade secrets. we have been and are currently party to a number of such claims and may receive additional claims in the future. any such claims, even those without merit, could:
•be expensive and time consuming to defend, and result in significant damages;
•force us to stop using the ip that is being challenged or to stop providing products or services that use the challenged ip;
•force us to redesign or rebrand our products or services;
•require us to enter into royalty, licensing, co-existence or other contracts to obtain the right to use a third party's ip;
•limit our ability to develop new ip; and
•limit the use or the scope of our ip or other rights.
in addition, we may be required to indemnify third-party owners of the hotels that we manage for any losses they incur as a result of any infringement claims against them. all necessary royalty, licensing or other contracts may not be available to us on acceptable terms. any adverse results associated with third-party ip claims could negatively affect our business.
exchange rate fluctuations and foreign exchange hedging arrangements could result in significant foreign currency gains and losses that affect our business results.
conducting business in currencies other than the u.s. dollar ("usd") subjects us to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates that could have a negative effect on our financial results. we earn revenues and incur expenses in foreign currencies as part of our operations outside of the u.s. as a result, fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates may significantly increase the amount of usd required for foreign currency denominated expenses or significantly decrease the usd received from foreign currency denominated revenues. we also have exposure to currency translation risk because, generally, the results of our business outside of the u.s. are reported in local currencies and then translated to usd for inclusion in our consolidated financial statements. as a result, changes between the foreign currency exchange rates and the usd will affect the recorded amounts of our foreign assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and could have a negative effect on our financial results. our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations will grow if the relative contribution of our operations outside the u.s. increases.
to mitigate foreign currency exposure, we may enter into foreign exchange derivatives with financial institutions. however, these derivatives may not eliminate foreign currency exchange rate risk entirely and involve costs and risks of their own in the form of transaction costs, credit requirements, interest rate differentials and counterparty risk.
if the insurance that we or our owners carry does not sufficiently cover damage or other potential losses or liabilities to third parties involving properties that we manage, franchise, own or lease, our profits could be reduced.
we operate in certain areas where the risk of natural or climate-related disaster or other catastrophic losses exists, and the occasional incidence of such an event could cause substantial damage to us, our owners or the surrounding area. we carry, and/or we require our owners to carry, insurance from solvent insurance carriers that we believe is adequate for foreseeable first-party and third-party losses and with terms and conditions that are reasonable and customary. nevertheless, market forces beyond our control, such as the natural, climate-related and man-made disasters that occurred in recent years, could limit the scope of the insurance coverage that we and our owners can obtain or may otherwise restrict our or our owners' ability to buy insurance coverage at reasonable rates. we anticipate increased costs of property, general liability and excess liability insurance across the portfolio in 2023 due to the significant losses that insurers suffered globally in recent years. in the event of a substantial loss, the insurance coverage that we and/or our owners carry may not be sufficient to pay the full value of our financial obligations, our liabilities or the replacement cost of any lost investment or property. additionally, certain types of losses may be uninsurable or prohibitively expensive to insure. in addition, other types of losses or risks that we may face could fall outside of the general coverage terms and limits of our policies.
the u.s. terrorism risk insurance program (the "program") provides insurance capacity for terrorist acts and is currently authorized through december 31, 2027. if the program is not extended or renewed upon its expiration in 2027, or if there are changes to the program that would negatively affect insurance carriers, premiums for terrorism insurance coverage will likely increase and/or the terms of such insurance may be materially amended to increase stated exclusions or to otherwise effectively decrease the scope of coverage available, perhaps to the point where it is effectively unavailable.
in some cases, these factors could result in certain losses being completely uninsured. as a result, we or owners of hotels that we manage or franchise could lose some or all of the capital we or they have invested in a property, as well as the anticipated future revenues, profits, management fees or franchise fees from the property.
climate change could adversely affect our business.
as an operator and franchisor of hotel properties in 123 countries, we are subject to the physical effects of climate change, including sea level rise, droughts and intensified storms and other weather events. damage to our hotels resulting from the physical effects of climate change could lower demand for travel to certain locales and affect the performance of certain of our hotels, which could in turn have a negative impact on our results of operations.
our business is subject to evolving corporate governance and public disclosure regulations and expectations, including with respect to esg matters, that could expose us to numerous risks.
we are subject to the evolving rules and regulations with respect to esg matters of a number of governmental and self-regulatory bodies and organizations, including the sec, the new york stock exchange ("nyse") and the financial accounting standards board, that could make compliance more difficult and uncertain. in addition, regulators, guests, investors, employees and other stakeholders are increasingly focused on esg matters and related disclosures. these changing rules, regulations and stakeholder expectations have resulted in, and are likely to continue to result in, increased general and administrative expenses and increased management time and attention to comply with or meet those regulations and expectations. developing and acting on esg initiatives and collecting, measuring and reporting esg related information and metrics can be costly, difficult and time consuming. further, esg related information is subject to evolving reporting standards, including the sec's proposed climate-related reporting requirements. our esg initiatives and goals could be difficult and expensive to implement, and we could be criticized for the accuracy, adequacy or completeness of our esg disclosures. further, statements about our esg related initiatives and goals, and progress against those goals, may be based on standards for measuring progress that are still developing, internal controls and processes that continue to evolve and assumptions that are subject to change in the future. in addition, we could be criticized for the scope or nature of such initiatives or goals, or for revisions to these goals. if our esg-related data, processes and reporting are incomplete or inaccurate, or if we fail to achieve progress with respect to our esg goals on a timely basis, or at all, our reputation and financial results could be adversely affected.
legal and regulatory risks governmental regulation may adversely affect the operation of our properties.
in many jurisdictions, the hospitality industry is subject to extensive foreign or u.s. federal, state and local governmental regulations, including those relating to the service of alcoholic beverages, the preparation and sale of food and those relating to building and zoning requirements. we are also subject to licensing and regulation by foreign or u.s. state and local departments relating to health, sanitation, fire and safety standards, and to laws governing our relationships with employees, including minimum wage requirements, overtime, working conditions status and citizenship requirements. these requirements are complex and subject to frequent revision, with changes at the u.s. federal level often accompanying new u.s. presidential administrations. we or our third-party owners may be required to expend funds to meet foreign or u.s. federal, state and local regulations in connection with the construction, continued operation or remodeling of certain of our properties. the failure to meet the requirements of applicable regulations and licensing requirements, or publicity resulting from actual or alleged failures, could have an adverse effect on our results of operations. for instance, in 2010, we entered into a settlement with the u.s. department of justice related to compliance with the americans with disabilities act ("ada"). although the bulk of our obligations under this settlement expired in 2015, certain managed and franchised hotels remain under an obligation to remove architectural barriers at their facilities. we have an obligation to have an independent consultant to monitor those barrier removal efforts. if we fail to comply with any of the requirements of the ada, we could be subject to fines, penalties, injunctive action, reputational harm, guest, advocacy group or employee lawsuits, and other business effects that could materially and negatively affect our performance and results of operations.
changes in u.s. federal, state and local or foreign tax law, interpretations of existing tax law or adverse determinations by tax authorities, could increase our tax burden or otherwise adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations.
we are subject to taxation at the federal, state or provincial and local levels in the u.s. and various other countries and jurisdictions. our future effective tax rate could be affected by changes in the composition of earnings in jurisdictions with differing tax rates, changes in statutory rates and other legislative changes, changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities, or changes in determinations regarding the jurisdictions in which we are subject to tax. from time to time, the u.s. federal, state and local and foreign governments make substantive changes to tax rules and their application, which could result in materially higher corporate taxes than would be incurred under existing tax law and could adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations.
we are subject to ongoing and periodic tax audits and disputes in u.s. federal and various state, local and foreign jurisdictions. in particular, our consolidated u.s. federal income tax returns for the fiscal years ended december 31, 2011 through december 31, 2018 are actively under audit by the internal revenue service ("irs"). the irs previously proposed material increases to our income tax liability related to our hilton honors guest loyalty program through the tax year ended december 31, 2013, which we resolved through a settlement. the taxation of the hilton honors program continues to be subject to audit. we may in the future be assessed tax on issues similar to those which were resolved through the 2013 tax year, and the amounts of any such future assessments may be material. an unfavorable outcome from any tax audit could result in higher tax costs, penalties and interest, thereby adversely affecting our financial condition or results of operations.
foreign or u.s. environmental laws and regulations may cause us to incur substantial costs or subject us to potential liabilities.
we are subject to certain compliance costs and potential liabilities under various foreign and u.s. federal, state and local environmental, health and safety laws and regulations. these laws and regulations govern actions including air emissions, the use, storage and disposal of hazardous and toxic substances and wastewater disposal. our failure to comply with such laws, including obtaining and maintaining any required permits or licenses, could result in substantial fines or possible revocation of our authority to conduct some of our operations. we could also be liable under such laws for the costs of investigation, removal or remediation of hazardous or toxic substances at our currently or formerly owned, leased or operated real property (including managed and franchised properties) or at third-party locations in connection with our waste disposal operations, regardless of whether or not we knew of, or caused, the presence or release of such substances. from time to time, we may be required to remediate such substances or remove, abate or manage asbestos, mold, radon gas, lead or other hazardous conditions at our properties. the presence or release of such toxic or hazardous substances could result in third-party claims for personal injury, property or natural resource damages, business interruption or other losses. such claims and the need to investigate, remediate or otherwise address hazardous, toxic or unsafe conditions could adversely affect our operations, the value of any affected real property, or our ability to sell, lease or assign our rights in any such property, or could otherwise harm our business or reputation. environmental, health and safety requirements have also become increasingly stringent, and our costs to comply with such requirements may increase as a result. new or revised laws and regulations or new interpretations of existing laws and regulations, such as those intended to lessen the impact of climate change, could affect the operation of our properties or result in significant additional expense and operating restrictions on us.
risks related to our spin-offs the spin-offs could result in substantial tax liability to us and our stockholders.
we received a private letter ruling from the irs on certain issues relevant to qualification of the spin-offs as tax-free distributions under section 355 of the internal revenue code of 1986, as amended (the "code"). although the private letter ruling generally is binding on the irs, the continued validity of the private letter ruling will be based upon and subject to the accuracy of factual statements and representations made to the irs by us. further, the private letter ruling is limited to specified aspects of the spin-offs under section 355 of the code and does not represent a determination by the irs that all of the requirements necessary to obtain tax-free treatment to holders of our common stock and to us have been satisfied. moreover, if any statement or representation upon which the private letter ruling was based was incorrect or untrue in any material respect, or if the facts upon which the private letter ruling was based were materially different from the facts that prevailed at the time of the spin-offs, the private letter ruling could be invalidated. the opinion of tax counsel we received in connection with the spin-offs regarding the qualification of the spin-offs as tax-free distributions under section 355 of the code similarly relied on, among other things, the continuing validity of the private letter ruling and various assumptions and representations as to factual matters made by each of the spun-off companies and us which, if inaccurate or incomplete in any material respect, would jeopardize the conclusions reached by counsel in its opinion. the opinion is not binding on the irs or the courts, and there can be no assurance that the irs or the courts will not challenge the conclusions stated in the opinion or that any such challenge would not prevail. additionally, recently enacted legislation denies tax-free treatment to a spin-off in which either the distributing corporation or the spun-off corporation is a reit and prevents a distributing corporation or a spun-off corporation from electing reit status for a 10-year period following a tax-free spin-off. under an effective date provision, the legislation does not apply to distributions described in a ruling request initially submitted to the irs before december 7, 2015. because our initial request for the private letter ruling was submitted before that date and because we believe the distribution has been described in that initial request, we believe the legislation does not apply to the spin-off of park. however, no ruling was obtained on that issue and thus no assurance can be given in that regard. in particular, the irs or a court could disagree with our view regarding the effective date provision based on any differences that exist between the description in the ruling request and the actual facts relating to the spin-offs. if the legislation applied to the spin-off of park, either the spin-off would not qualify for tax-free treatment or park would not be eligible to elect reit status for a 10-year period following the spin-off.
if the spin-offs and certain related transactions were determined to be taxable, the company would be subject to a substantial tax liability that would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. in addition, if the spin-offs were taxable, each holder of our common stock who received shares of park and hgv would generally be treated as receiving a taxable distribution of property in an amount equal to the fair market value of the shares received.
park or hgv may fail to perform under various transaction agreements that we executed as part of the spin-offs.
in connection with the spin-offs, we, park and hgv entered into a distribution agreement and various other agreements, including a tax matters agreement, and, as to park, management agreements, and, as to hgv, a license agreement. we are relying on park and hgv to satisfy their performance and payment obligations under these agreements. in addition, it is possible that a court would disregard the allocation agreed to between us, park and hgv and require that we assume responsibility for certain obligations allocated to park and to hgv, particularly if park or hgv were to refuse or were unable to pay or perform such obligations. in connection with the spin-offs, each of park and hgv indemnified us with respect to such parties' assumed or retained liabilities pursuant to the distribution agreement and breaches of the distribution agreement or other agreements related to the spin-offs. there can be no assurance that the indemnities from each of park and hgv will be sufficient to protect us against the full amount of these and other liabilities. third parties also could seek to hold us responsible for any of the liabilities that park and hgv have agreed to assume. even if we ultimately succeed in recovering from park or hgv any amounts for which we are held liable, we may be temporarily required to bear those losses ourselves. each of these risks could negatively affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. in addition, we agreed to indemnify each of park and hgv from certain liabilities. indemnities that we may be required to provide park and/or hgv may be significant and could negatively affect our business.
risks related to our indebtedness our substantial indebtedness and other contractual obligations could adversely affect our financial condition, our ability to raise additional capital to fund our operations, our ability to operate our business, our ability to react to changes in the economy or our industry and our ability to pay our debts, and could require us to divert our cash flows from operations to make required debt or interest payments.
we have a significant amount of indebtedness. as of december 31, 2022, our total indebtedness, excluding the deduction for unamortized deferred financing costs and discount, was approximately $8.8 billion, and our contractual debt maturities of our long-term debt for the years ending december 31, 2023, 2024 and 2025 are $39 million, $33 million and $526 million, respectively. our substantial debt and other contractual obligations could have important consequences, including:
•requiring a substantial portion of cash flow from operations to be dedicated to the payment of principal and interest on our indebtedness, thereby reducing our ability to use our cash flow to fund our operations, capital expenditures or dividends to stockholders and to pursue future business opportunities;
•increasing our vulnerability to adverse economic, industry or competitive developments;
•exposing us to increased interest expense, as our degree of leverage may cause the interest rates of any future indebtedness (whether fixed or floating rate interest) to be higher than they would be otherwise;
•exposing us to the risk of increased interest rates because certain of our indebtedness is at variable rates of interest;
•making it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations with respect to our indebtedness, and any failure to comply with the obligations of any of our debt instruments, including restrictive covenants, could result in an event of default that accelerates our obligation to repay indebtedness;
•restricting us from making strategic acquisitions or causing us to make non-strategic divestitures;
•limiting our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures, product development, satisfaction of existing debt service requirements, acquisitions and general corporate or other purposes; and
•limiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business or market conditions and placing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors who may be better positioned to take advantage of opportunities that our leverage prevents us from exploiting.
in december 2022, we amended the credit agreement that governs our senior secured credit facilities to reference the secured overnight financing rate ("sofr") as the primary benchmark rate for our variable-rate indebtedness under this agreement in lieu of the london interbank offered rate ("libor"). sofr is a relatively new reference rate with a limited history, and changes in sofr have, on occasion, been more volatile than changes in other benchmark or market rates. as a result, the amount of interest we may pay on our variable-rate indebtedness may be difficult to predict.
we are a holding company, and substantially all of our consolidated assets are owned by, and most of our business is conducted through, our subsidiaries. revenues from these subsidiaries are our primary source of funds for debt payments and operating expenses. if our subsidiaries are restricted from making distributions to us, that may impair our ability to meet our debt service obligations or otherwise fund our operations. moreover, there may be restrictions on payments by subsidiaries to their parent companies under applicable laws, including laws that require companies to maintain minimum amounts of capital and to make payments to stockholders only from profits. as a result, although a subsidiary of ours may have cash, we may not be able to obtain that cash to satisfy our obligation to service our outstanding debt or fund our operations.
servicing our indebtedness will require a significant amount of cash. our ability to generate sufficient cash depends on many factors, some of which are not within our control.
our ability to make payments on our indebtedness, to fund planned capital expenditures, to pay future dividends, if any, to our stockholders and repurchase our common stock will depend on our ability to generate cash in the future. to a certain extent, this is subject to general economic, financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control. if we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow to service our debt and meet our other commitments, we may need to restructure or refinance all or a portion of our debt, sell material assets or operations or raise additional debt or equity capital. we may not be able to effect any of these actions on a timely basis, on commercially reasonable terms or at all, and these actions may not be sufficient to meet our capital requirements. in addition, the terms of our existing or future debt arrangements may restrict us from effecting any of these alternatives.
certain of our debt agreements impose significant operating and financial restrictions on us and our subsidiaries, which may prevent us from capitalizing on business opportunities.
the indentures that govern our senior notes and the credit agreement that governs our senior secured credit facilities impose significant operating and financial restrictions on us. these restrictions limit our ability and/or the ability of our subsidiaries to, among other things:
•incur or guarantee additional debt or issue disqualified stock or preferred stock;
•pay dividends, including our subsidiaries paying dividends to us, and make other distributions on, or redeem or repurchase, capital stock;
•make certain investments;
•incur certain liens;
•enter into transactions with affiliates;
•merge or consolidate;
•enter into agreements that restrict the ability of restricted subsidiaries to make dividends or other payments to us;
•designate restricted subsidiaries as unrestricted subsidiaries; and
•transfer or sell assets.
in addition, the credit agreement requires us to maintain a consolidated secured net leverage ratio not to exceed 5.0 to 1.0 as of the last day of any period of four consecutive quarters.
as a result of these restrictions, we are limited as to how we conduct our business and we may be unable to raise additional debt or equity financing to compete effectively or to take advantage of new business opportunities. the terms of any future indebtedness we may incur could include more restrictive covenants. we may not be able to maintain compliance with these covenants in the future and, if we fail to do so, we may not be able to obtain waivers from the lenders and/or amend the covenants.
our failure to comply with the restrictive covenants described above, as well as other terms of our other indebtedness and/or the terms of any future indebtedness from time to time, could result in an event of default, which, if not cured or waived, could result in our being required to repay these borrowings before their due date. if we are forced to refinance these borrowings on less favorable terms or are unable to refinance these borrowings, our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected.
despite our current level of indebtedness, we may be able to incur substantially more debt and enter into other transactions, which could further exacerbate the risks to our financial condition described above.
we may be able to incur significant additional indebtedness, including secured debt, in the future. although the credit agreements and indentures that govern substantially all of our indebtedness contain restrictions on the incurrence of additional indebtedness and entering into certain types of other transactions, these restrictions are subject to a number of qualifications and exceptions. additional indebtedness incurred in compliance with these restrictions could be substantial. these restrictions also do not prevent us from incurring obligations, such as trade payables, that do not constitute indebtedness as defined under our debt instruments. to the extent new debt is added to our current debt levels, the substantial leverage risks described in the preceding three risk factors would increase.
risks related to ownership of our common stock although we currently pay a quarterly cash dividend to holders of our common stock, we may change our dividend policy at any time.
our dividend policy may change at any time without notice to our stockholders. as a result of the covid-19 pandemic, we suspended payment of our quarterly cash dividend to holders of our common stock beginning in 2020, but resumed our quarterly dividend payments in june 2022. the declaration and payment of any future dividends is at the discretion of our board of directors in accordance with applicable law after taking into account various factors, including our financial condition, operating results, current and anticipated cash needs, limitations imposed by our indebtedness, legal requirements and other factors that our board of directors deems relevant. if we were to cease dividend payments, you may not receive any return on an investment in our common stock unless you sell your common stock for a price greater than that which you paid for it.
anti-takeover provisions in our organizational documents and delaware law might discourage or delay acquisition attempts for us that one might consider favorable.
our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated by-laws contain provisions that may make the merger or acquisition of our company more difficult without the approval of our board of directors. among other things:
•although we do not have a stockholder rights plan, and would either submit any such plan to stockholders for ratification or cause such plan to expire within a year, these provisions would allow us to authorize the issuance of undesignated preferred stock in connection with a stockholder rights plan or otherwise, the terms of which may be established and the shares of which may be issued without stockholder approval, and which may include super voting, special approval, dividend or other rights or preferences superior to the rights of the holders of common stock;
•these provisions prohibit stockholder action by written consent unless such action is recommended by all directors then in office;
•these provisions provide that our board of directors is expressly authorized to make, alter or repeal our by-laws and that our stockholders may only amend our by-laws with the approval of 80 percent or more of all the outstanding shares of our capital stock entitled to vote; and
•these provisions establish advance notice requirements for nominations for elections to our board or for proposing matters that can be acted upon by stockholders at stockholder meetings.
further, as a delaware corporation, we are subject to provisions of delaware law, which may impair a takeover attempt that our stockholders may find beneficial. these anti-takeover provisions and other provisions under delaware law could discourage, delay or prevent a transaction involving a change in control of our company, including actions that our stockholders may deem advantageous, or negatively affect the trading price of our common stock. these provisions could also discourage proxy contests and make it more difficult for our stockholders to elect directors of their choosing and to cause us to take other corporate actions they desire.
item 7.        management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10-k.
for the discussion of the financial condition and results of operations for the year ended december 31, 2021 compared to the year ended december 31, 2020, refer to "part ii-item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations" in our annual report on form 10-k for the fiscal year ended december 31, 2021 filed with the sec on february 16, 2022, which is incorporated herein by reference.
covid-19 pandemic the covid-19 pandemic significantly affected the global economy and strained the hospitality industry beginning in 2020. since the beginning of the pandemic, the pervasiveness and severity of travel restrictions and stay-at-home directives have varied by country and state; however, as of december 31, 2022, most of the countries we operate in had eased or completely lifted such restrictions. while the pandemic negatively affected certain of our results for the years ended december 31, 2022 and 2021, we have experienced strong signs of recovery since early 2021, with comparable system-wide revpar in the third and fourth quarters of 2022 exceeding levels achieved in the same periods in 2019. although all periods included in our consolidated financial statements presented in this form 10-k were impacted by the covid-19 pandemic, none of these periods are considered comparable, and no periods affected by the pandemic are expected to be comparable to future periods.
overview our business hilton is one of the largest hospitality companies in the world, with 7,165 properties comprising 1,127,430 rooms in 123 countries and territories as of december 31, 2022. our premier brand portfolio includes: our luxury hotel brands, waldorf astoria hotels & resorts, lxr hotels & resorts and conrad hotels & resorts; our lifestyle hotel brands, canopy by hilton, curio collection by hilton, tapestry collection by hilton, tempo by hilton and motto by hilton; our full service hotel brands, signia by hilton, hilton hotels & resorts and doubletree by hilton; our focused service hotel brands, hilton garden inn, hampton by hilton and tru by hilton; our all-suites hotel brands, embassy suites by hilton, homewood suites by hilton and home2 suites by hilton; our new premium economy brand, spark by hilton, launched in january 2023; and our timeshare brand, hilton grand vacations. as of december 31, 2022, we had 152 million members in our award-winning guest loyalty program, hilton honors, a 19 percent increase from december 31, 2021.
segments and regions we analyze our operations and business by both operating segments and geographic regions. our operations consist of two reportable segments that are based on similar products and services: (i) management and franchise; and (ii) ownership. the management and franchise segment provides services, including hotel management and licensing of our ip. revenues from this segment include: (i) management and franchise fees charged to third-party hotel owners; (ii) licensing fees from our strategic partners, including co-branded credit card providers, and hgv for the right to use our ip; and (iii) fees for managing hotels in our ownership segment. as a manager of hotels, we typically are responsible for supervising or operating the hotel in exchange for management fees. as a franchisor of hotels, we charge franchise fees in exchange for the use of one of our brand names and related commercial services, such as our reservation system, marketing and information technology services, while a third party manages or operates such franchised hotels. the ownership segment primarily derives revenues from nightly hotel room sales, food and beverage sales and other services at our consolidated owned and leased hotels.
geographically, we conduct business through three distinct geographic regions: (i) the americas; (ii) emea; and (iii) asia pacific. the americas region includes north america, south america and central america, including all caribbean nations. although the u.s., which represented 69 percent of our system-wide hotel rooms as of december 31, 2022, is included in the americas region, it is often analyzed separately and apart from the americas region and, as such, it is presented separately within the analysis herein. the emea region includes europe, which represents the western-most peninsula of eurasia stretching from iceland in the west to russia in the east, and the middle east and africa ("mea"), which represents the middle east region and all african nations, including the indian ocean island nations. europe and mea are often analyzed separately and, as such, are presented separately within the analysis herein. the asia pacific region includes the eastern and southeastern nations of asia, as well as india, australia, new zealand and the pacific island nations.
system growth and development pipeline our strategic objectives include the continued expansion of our global hotel network, as well as of our fee-based business. as we enter into new management and franchise contracts, we expand our business with limited or no capital investment by us as the manager or franchisor, since the capital required to build and maintain hotels is typically provided by the third-party owner of the hotel with whom we contract to provide management services or license our ip. prior to approving the addition of new hotels to our management and franchise development pipeline, we evaluate the economic viability of the hotel based on its geographic location, the credit quality of the third-party owner and other factors. by increasing the number of management and franchise contracts with third-party owners, over time we expect to increase revenues, overall return on invested capital and cash available to support our business needs. see further discussion on our cash management policy, as detailed in "-liquidity and capital resources." while these objectives have not changed as a result of the covid-19 pandemic, the current economic environment has posed certain challenges to the execution of our growth strategy, which have included and may continue to include delays in openings and new development.
in addition to our current hotel portfolio, we are focused on the growth of our business by expanding our global hotel network through our development pipeline, which represents hotels that we expect to add to our system in the future. the following table summarizes our development activity:

principal components and factors affecting our results of operations revenues principal components we primarily derive our revenues from the following sources:
•franchise and licensing fees. represents fees earned in connection with the licensing of one of our brands, as well as fees from licensing agreements to use our ip. under our long-term franchise contracts with hotel owners, franchisees typically pay us franchise fees that include: (i) monthly royalty fees, generally based on a percentage of the hotel's monthly gross room revenue, and, in some cases, may also include a percentage of gross food and beverage revenues and other revenues, as applicable; and (ii) application, initiation and other fees for when new hotels enter the system, when there is a change of ownership of a hotel or when contracts with properties already in our system are extended. consideration provided to incentivize hotel owners to enter into franchise contracts with us is amortized over the life of the applicable contract as a reduction to franchise and licensing fees. our non-hotel licensing agreements, for which we receive licensing fees, are predominantly with strategic partners, including co-branded credit card providers, and hgv.
•base and incentive management fees. represents fees earned in connection with the management of hotels. terms of our management contracts vary, but our fees generally consist of a base fee, which is typically based on a percentage of the hotel's monthly gross revenue and, when applicable, an incentive fee, which is typically based on a percentage of the hotel's operating profits, normally over a one-calendar year period, and, in some cases, may be subject to a stated return threshold to the hotel owner. outside of the u.s., our fees are often more dependent on hotel profitability measures, either because of a single management fee structure where the entire fee is an incentive fee, or because our two-tier fee structure is more heavily weighted toward the incentive fee than the base fee. consideration provided to incentivize hotel owners to enter into management contracts with us is amortized over the life of the applicable contract as a reduction to base and other management fees.
•owned and leased hotels. represents revenues derived from the operations of our consolidated owned and leased hotels, including hotel room sales, accommodations sold in conjunction with other services, food and beverage sales and other ancillary goods and services. these revenues are primarily derived from two categories of customers: transient and group. transient guests are individual travelers who are traveling for business or leisure. group guests are traveling for group events that reserve rooms for meetings, conferences or social functions, which may be sponsored by corporate, social, military, educational, religious or other organizations or associations. group business usually includes a block of room accommodations, as well as other ancillary services, such as meetings facilities and catering and banquet services. a majority of our food and beverage sales and other ancillary goods and services are provided to customers who are also occupying rooms at our hotels. as a result, occupancy affects all components of our owned and leased hotels revenues.
•other revenues. represents revenues generated by the incidental support of hotel operations for owned, leased, managed and franchised hotels, including our purchasing operations, and other operating income.
•other revenues from managed and franchised properties. represents amounts that are contractually reimbursed to us by hotel owners, either directly as costs are incurred or indirectly through monthly program fees related to certain costs and expenses supporting the operations of the related properties. the direct reimbursements by hotel owners are primarily for payroll and related costs if the property employees are legally employed by us and certain other operating costs of the managed properties' operations. we have no legal responsibility for the employees or the liabilities associated with operating franchised properties or certain of our managed properties, predominately those located outside of the u.s. revenues and expenses for these direct reimbursements have no net effect on operating income (loss) or net income (loss). the monthly program fee that is paid by hotel franchisees and property owners of hotels that we manage is based on the underlying hotel's sales or usage, as reimbursement for the costs related to our: (i) advertising and marketing programs; (ii) internet, technology and reservation systems; and (iii) quality assurance programs. other revenues from managed and franchised properties also includes revenues related to our hilton honors guest loyalty program, which are primarily derived from payments from hotel franchisees and third-party owners of hotels we manage that participate in the program, as well as co-branded credit card providers. we are contractually required to use these fees that we collect solely for these programs.
factors affecting our revenues the following factors affect the revenues we derive from our operations:
•consumer demand and global economic conditions. consumer demand for our products and services, as well as the products and services of the third parties from which we earn licensing fees, is closely linked to the performance of the general economy and is sensitive to business and personal discretionary spending levels. among other factors, declines in consumer demand due to adverse general economic conditions, risks reducing or otherwise negatively affecting travel patterns, lower consumer confidence and adverse political conditions can reduce the amount of management and franchise fee revenues we are able to generate and/or reduce the revenues and profitability of the operations of our owned and leased hotels. further, competition for hotel guests and the supply of hotel services affect our ability to sustain or increase rates charged to customers of our hotels. as a result of the covid-19 pandemic, several of these factors, as well as health and safety concerns, had a significant effect on global economic conditions and consumer demand for our products and services; however, we have experienced significant recovery in demand during 2022. also, declines in hotel profitability during an economic downturn directly affect the incentive portion of our management fees, which is based on hotel profitability measures. as a result, changes in consumer demand and general business cycles have historically subjected, are currently subjecting and could in the future subject our revenues to significant volatility.
•contracts with third-party hotel owners and franchisees and relationships with developers. we depend on our long-term management and franchise contracts with third-party hotel owners and hotel franchisees for our management and franchise fee revenues. the success and sustainability of our management and franchise business depends on our ability to perform under our management and franchise contracts and maintain good relationships with third-party hotel owners and franchisees. our relationships with these third parties allow us to maintain our current presence as contracts mature and also generate new incremental opportunities for property development that can support our growth. growth and maintenance of our hotel system and earning fees related to hotels in development are dependent on the ability of developers and owners to access capital for the development, maintenance and renovation of properties. we believe that we generally have good relationships with our third-party hotel owners, franchisees and developers and are committed to the continued growth and development of these relationships. these relationships exist with a diverse group of owners, franchisees and developers and are not significantly concentrated with any one particular third party.
expenses principal components we primarily incur the following expenses:
•owned and leased hotels. reflects the operating expenses of our consolidated owned and leased hotels, including room expenses, food and beverage costs, other support costs and property expenses. room expenses include compensation costs for housekeeping, laundry and front desk staff, as well as supply costs for guest room amenities and laundry. food and beverage costs include costs for wait and kitchen staff and food and beverage inventory. other support expenses include: costs associated with property-level management; utilities; sales and marketing; operating hotel spas; operating telephones, parking and other guest recreation; entertainment; and other services. property expenses include property taxes, repairs and maintenance, rent and insurance.
•depreciation and amortization. these are non-cash expenses that primarily consist of: (i) amortization of intangible assets that were recorded at their fair value at the time of the 2007 transaction whereby we became a wholly owned subsidiary of affiliates of blackstone inc. (the "merger"), which primarily include values assigned to management contracts, leases and our hilton honors guest loyalty program intangible asset; (ii) amortization of capitalized software costs; and (iii) depreciation and amortization of property and equipment, including our finance lease right-of-use ("rou") assets, such as buildings and furniture and equipment that are used in corporate operations or at our consolidated owned and leased hotels.
•general and administrative. consists primarily of compensation costs for our corporate employees, including share-based compensation; professional fees, including consulting, audit and legal fees; travel and entertainment expenses; bad debt expenses for uncollectible management, franchise and other fees; and administrative and related expenses.
•other expenses. consists of expenses incurred by our purchasing operations and other ancillary businesses, along with other operating expenses of the business.
•other expenses from managed and franchised properties. represents certain costs and expenses that are contractually reimbursed to us by hotel owners for payroll and related costs for properties that we manage where the property employees are legally employed by us, or paid from program fees collected from properties for certain other operating costs of the managed properties' operations, including those related to our brands and shared services programs. we are contractually required to use these fees solely for these programs. we have no legal responsibility for the employees or the liabilities associated with operating franchised properties or certain of our managed hotels, predominately those located outside of the u.s. other expenses from managed and franchised properties also includes expenses for the operation of our hilton honors guest loyalty program.
factors affecting our costs and expenses the following are principal factors that affect the costs and expenses we incur in the course of our operations:
•fixed expenses. many of the expenses associated with owning and leasing hotels are relatively fixed. these expenses include personnel costs, rent, property taxes, insurance and utilities. if we are unable to decrease these costs significantly or rapidly when demand for our hotels decreases, the resulting decline in our revenues can have an adverse effect on our net cash flows, margins and profits. this effect can be especially pronounced during periods of economic contraction or slow economic growth, including that which resulted from the covid-19 pandemic.
economic downturns generally affect the results of our ownership segment more significantly than the results of our management and franchise segment due to the high fixed costs associated with operating an owned or leased hotel. employees at some of our owned and leased hotels are parties to collective bargaining agreements that may also limit our ability to make timely staffing or labor changes in response to declining revenues. in addition, any efforts to reduce costs, including the deferral or cancellation of capital improvements, could adversely affect the economic value of our hotels and brands. additionally, the general and administrative expenses of operating a global business also include fixed personnel costs, rent, property taxes, insurance and utilities. the effectiveness of any cost-cutting efforts related to owning and leasing hotels or corporate operations is limited by the amount of inherent fixed costs. however, we have taken steps to reduce our fixed costs to levels we believe are appropriate to maximize profitability and respond to expected future market conditions, while continuing to optimize value for the experiences of our customers, owners and hilton employees, supporting the long-term sustainability of our brands and business.
•changes in depreciation and amortization expenses. we capitalize costs associated with certain software development projects and, as those projects are completed and placed into service, amortization expense will increase. as the finite-lived intangible assets that were recorded at the merger become fully amortized, amortization expense will decrease. additionally, changes in depreciation expense may be driven by renovations of existing hotels, acquisition or development of new hotels, the disposition of existing hotels or corporate facilities through sale, closure or lease termination, lease renewals, expenditures related to our corporate facilities or changes in estimates of the useful lives of our assets. as we place new assets into service, we will be required to recognize additional depreciation expense on those assets. if we are required to recognize impairment losses related to our depreciable assets or finite-lived intangible assets, the related depreciation or amortization expense, respectively, will decrease.
other items effect of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations significant portions of our operations are conducted in functional currencies other than our reporting currency, which is usd, and we have assets and liabilities, including those that are payable or receivable by consolidated subsidiaries, denominated in a variety of foreign currencies. as a result, we are required to translate the results of those operations, assets and liabilities from their functional currency into usd at market-based foreign currency exchange rates for each reporting period. when comparing our results of operations between periods, there may be material portions of the changes in our revenues or expenses that are derived from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates experienced between those periods. we hedge foreign currency exchange-based cash flow variability of certain of our fees using forward contracts designated as hedging instruments. we also hold short-term forward contracts to offset exposure to fluctuations in certain of our foreign currency denominated cash balances and intercompany financing arrangements, and we have not currently elected to designate these forward contracts as hedging instruments.
seasonality the hospitality industry is seasonal in nature. the periods during which our properties experience higher or lower levels of demand vary from property to property, depending principally upon their location, type of property and competitive mix within the specific location. while results were less predictable as a result of covid-19 and related travel restrictions, based on historical results, we generally expect our revenues to be lower in the first quarter of each year than in each of the three subsequent quarters.
key business and financial metrics used by management comparable hotels we define our comparable hotels as those that: (i) were active and operating in our system for at least one full calendar year as of the end of the current period, and open january 1st of the previous year; (ii) have not undergone a change in brand or ownership type during the current or comparable periods reported; and (iii) have not sustained substantial property damage, business interruption, undergone large-scale capital projects or for which comparable results were not available. of the 7,085 hotels in our system as of december 31, 2022, 5,797 hotels were classified as comparable hotels. our 1,288 non-comparable hotels included 272 hotels, or less than four percent of the total hotels in our system, that were removed from the comparable group during the last twelve months because they sustained substantial property damage, business interruption, underwent large-scale capital projects or comparable results were otherwise not available.
when considering business interruption in the context of our definition of comparable hotels, no hotel that had completely or partially suspended operations on a temporary basis at any time as a result of the covid-19 pandemic was excluded from the definition of comparable hotels on that basis alone. despite these temporary suspensions of hotel operations, we believe that including these hotels within our hotel operating statistics of occupancy, average daily rate ("adr") and revenue per available room ("revpar"), if they would have otherwise been included, reflects the underlying results of our business for the years ended december 31, 2022 and 2021.
occupancy occupancy represents the total number of room nights sold divided by the total number of room nights available at a hotel or group of hotels for a given period. occupancy measures the utilization of available capacity at a hotel or group of hotels. management uses occupancy to gauge demand at a specific hotel or group of hotels in a given period. occupancy levels also help management determine achievable adr pricing levels as demand for hotel rooms increases or decreases.
adr adr represents hotel room revenue divided by the total number of room nights sold for a given period. adr measures the average room price attained by a hotel, and adr trends provide useful information concerning the pricing environment and the nature of the customer base of a hotel or group of hotels. adr is a commonly used performance measure in the industry, and we use adr to assess pricing levels that we are able to generate by type of customer, as changes in rates charged to customers have different effects on overall revenues and incremental profitability than changes in occupancy, as described above.
revpar revpar is calculated by dividing hotel room revenue by the total number of room nights available to guests for a given period. we consider revpar to be a meaningful indicator of our performance as it provides a metric correlated to two primary and key drivers of operations at a hotel or group of hotels, as previously described: occupancy and adr. revpar is also a useful indicator in measuring performance over comparable periods for comparable hotels.
references to occupancy, adr and revpar are presented on a comparable basis, based on the comparable hotels as of december 31, 2022, and references to adr and revpar are presented on a currency neutral basis, unless otherwise noted. as such, comparisons of these hotel operating statistics for the years ended december 31, 2022 and 2021 or 2019 use the foreign currency exchange rates used to translate the results of the company's foreign operations within its consolidated financial statements for the year ended december 31, 2022.
ebitda and adjusted ebitda ebitda reflects net income (loss), excluding interest expense, a provision for income tax benefit (expense) and depreciation and amortization expenses. adjusted ebitda is calculated as ebitda, as previously defined, further adjusted to exclude certain items, including gains, losses, revenues and expenses in connection with: (i) asset dispositions for both consolidated and unconsolidated investments; (ii) foreign currency transactions; (iii) debt restructurings and retirements; (iv) furniture, fixtures and equipment ("ff&e") replacement reserves required under certain lease agreements; (v) share-based compensation; (vi) reorganization, severance, relocation and other expenses; (vii) non-cash impairment; (viii) amortization of contract acquisition costs; (ix) the net effect of reimbursable costs included in other revenues and other expenses from managed and franchised properties; and (x) other items.
we believe that ebitda and adjusted ebitda provide useful information to investors about us and our financial condition and results of operations for the following reasons: (i) these measures are among the measures used by our management team to evaluate our operating performance and make day-to-day operating decisions; and (ii) these measures are frequently used by securities analysts, investors and other interested parties as a common performance measure to compare results or estimate valuations across companies in our industry. additionally, these measures exclude certain items that can vary widely across different industries and among competitors within our industry. for instance, interest expense and income taxes are dependent on company specifics, including, among other things, capital structure and operating jurisdictions, respectively, and, therefore, could vary significantly across companies. depreciation and amortization expenses, as well as amortization of contract acquisition costs, are dependent upon company policies, including the method of acquiring and depreciating assets and the useful lives that are assigned to those depreciating or amortizing assets for accounting purposes. for adjusted ebitda, we also exclude items such as: (i) ff&e replacement reserves for leased hotels to be consistent with the treatment of capital expenditures for property and equipment, where depreciation of such capitalized assets is reported within depreciation and amortization expenses; (ii) share-based compensation, as this could vary widely among companies due to the different plans in place and the usage of them; (iii) the net effect of our cost reimbursement revenues and reimbursed expenses, as we contractually do not operate the related programs to generate a profit over the terms of the respective contracts; and (iv) other items, such as amounts related to debt restructurings and debt retirements and reorganization and related severance costs, that are not core to our operations and are not reflective of our operating performance.
ebitda and adjusted ebitda are not recognized terms under u.s. generally accepted accounting principles ("gaap") and should not be considered as alternatives, either in isolation or as a substitute, for net income (loss) or other measures of financial performance or liquidity, including cash flows, derived in accordance with gaap. further, ebitda and adjusted ebitda have limitations as analytical tools, including:
•ebitda and adjusted ebitda do not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, our working capital needs;
•ebitda and adjusted ebitda do not reflect our interest expense, or the cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments, on our indebtedness;
•ebitda and adjusted ebitda do not reflect income tax expenses or the cash requirements to pay our taxes;
•ebitda and adjusted ebitda do not reflect historical cash expenditures or future requirements for capital expenditures or contractual commitments;
•ebitda and adjusted ebitda do not reflect the effect on earnings or changes resulting from matters that we consider not to be indicative of our future operations;
•although depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated and amortized will often have to be replaced in the future, and ebitda and adjusted ebitda do not reflect any cash requirements for such replacements; and
•other companies in our industry may calculate ebitda and adjusted ebitda differently, limiting their usefulness as comparative measures.
because of these limitations, ebitda and adjusted ebitda should not be considered as discretionary cash available to us to reinvest in the growth of our business or as measures of cash that will be available to us to meet our obligations.
results of operations the hotel operating statistics by region for our system-wide comparable hotels were as follows:

we experienced significant improvement in our results during the year ended december 31, 2022 with the continued recovery of the travel and hospitality industry from the covid-19 pandemic and the rebound of cross-border international travel. on a regional basis, the europe region had the most significant improvement when compared to 2021, with continental europe leading the region with meaningful increases in both adr and occupancy. further, despite the impact of the limited demand in china due to prolonged travel restrictions, the remainder of the apac region demonstrated a strong recovery, particularly during the second half of the year. overall, leisure transient was the primary driver of improved performance during the year, but all customer segments, including business and group travel, contributed to our recovery.
on a system-wide basis, our recovery was particularly strong during the second half of 2022, driven by an upward trend in both adr and occupancy. the third quarter of 2022 was the first period since the beginning of the pandemic that system-wide revpar on a comparable and currency neutral basis exceeded system-wide revpar for the same period in 2019, and system-wide revpar for the fourth quarter of 2022 also exceeded the same period in 2019. during the year ended december 31, 2022 as compared to 2019, revpar was down 1.3 percent due to a decrease in occupancy of 6.2 percentage points, partially offset by an increase in adr of 7.8 percent. all regions showed improvement in adr during the year ended december 31, 2022 when compared to 2019, with the exception of asia pacific, primarily as a result of limitations on travel in china.

during the year ended december 31, 2022, revenue recognized from fees increased primarily as a result of improved demand for travel and tourism, including the ability and desire of our customers to travel, due to the ongoing recovery that began in early 2021 from the negative impacts of the covid-19 pandemic.
accordingly, on a comparable basis, franchise and management fees increased as a result of increases in revpar of 34.8 percent and 69.0 percent at our comparable franchised and managed properties, respectively. these increases were a result of increased occupancy of 8.7 percentage points and 15.0 percentage points, respectively, and increased adr of 18.0 percent and 27.1 percent, respectively.
further, as new hotels enter our system, we expect such hotels to increase our franchise and management fees. including new development and ownership type transfers, from january 1, 2021 to december 31, 2022, we added over 670 franchised and managed properties on a net basis, providing an additional 105,300 rooms to our management and franchise segment, which also contributed to the increases in franchise and management fees.
the rise in travel and tourism and increased overall consumer spending during the year ended december 31, 2022 also contributed to a significant increase in licensing and other fees from our strategic partnerships and hgv. increased fees from our strategic partnerships resulted from new cardholder acquisitions, as well as increased cardholder spend under our co-branded credit card arrangements and increased fees from hgv resulted from increased timeshare revenues, which, in addition to the recovery from the pandemic, were attributable to the increase in timeshare properties in our system during the period.
incentive management fees increased as they are based on hotels' operating profits, which have improved from the prior year as a result of increased demand in line with the recovery from the covid-19 pandemic and higher revenues driving higher managed hotel profits.

owned and leased hotels revenues       $1,076                          $598           79.9
the increase in owned and leased hotels revenues included increases of $489 million and $74 million, on a currency neutral basis, from our comparable and non-comparable owned and leased hotels, respectively, which were partially offset by an $85 million decrease as a result of unfavorable fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. the currency neutral increase in revenues from our comparable leased hotels was primarily the result of increased revpar of 168.2 percent, due to increases in occupancy of 30.8 percentage points and adr of 34.1 percent, reflective of the ongoing recovery from the covid-19 pandemic, which was particularly strong during 2022 in europe where the majority of our leased properties are located. the currency neutral increase in revenues from our non-comparable owned and leased hotels, which also benefited from an increase in revpar, was partially offset by a $35 million decrease, on a currency neutral basis, from properties which were sold or for which the lease agreements were terminated during 2021.

the increase in owned and leased hotels expenses included increases of $358 million and $49 million, on a currency neutral basis, from our comparable and non-comparable owned and leased hotels, respectively, which were partially offset by a $87 million decrease as a result of favorable fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. the currency neutral increase in expenses from our non-comparable owned and leased hotels was net of a $30 million currency neutral decrease from properties which were sold or for which the lease agreements were terminated during 2021.
our owned and leased hotels had currency neutral increases in certain operating expenses as a result of increased occupancy, including labor costs, utilities and variable rent, which is generally based on a percentage of hotel revenues or profits, which increased in line with the recovery from the covid-19 pandemic. additionally, we incurred increased expenses related to ff&e replacement reserves, which are generally computed as a percentage of hotel revenues.

the decrease in depreciation and amortization expenses was primarily due to a decrease in amortization expense, driven by the full amortization of certain software project costs during 2021 and 2022.
the decrease in general and administrative expenses was primarily due to continued cost control and decreased share-based compensation expense, as well as costs recognized during the year ended december 31, 2021 for certain legal settlements, for which no such expenses were recognized during 2022.
the increase in other expenses was primarily due to higher volume in our purchasing operations related to improved hotel demand.

(1)fluctuation in terms of percentage change is not meaningful.
the increase in interest expense included increases related to the interest rate increase on the variable rate senior secured term loan facility (the "term loan") during the period and the amortization of previously dedesignated interest rate swaps. these increases were partially offset by a decrease related to our senior secured revolving credit facility (the "revolving credit facility"), which was partially drawn during 2021, but was fully repaid as of june 30, 2021 with no outstanding balance for the remainder of 2021 or at all during 2022, as well as a decrease resulting from the february 2021 issuance of new senior unsecured notes and the use of such proceeds for the redemption of previously outstanding senior unsecured notes, which reduced the weighted average interest rate on our outstanding senior unsecured notes. see note 8: "debt" in our consolidated financial statements for additional information on our indebtedness and the associated interest rates.
the gains and losses on foreign currency transactions included the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates on certain intercompany financing arrangements, including short-term cross-currency intercompany loans, and other transactions denominated in foreign currencies.
loss on debt extinguishment related to the february 2021 redemption of senior unsecured notes and included a redemption premium of $55 million and the accelerated recognition of unamortized deferred financing costs on those senior unsecured notes of $14 million.
other non-operating income, net consists of interest income, equity in earnings (losses) from unconsolidated affiliates, certain components of net periodic pension cost or credit related to our employee defined benefit pension plans and other non-operating gains and losses. the increase in other non-operating income, net was primarily due to an $11 million gain recognized during the year ended december 31, 2022 resulting from the remeasurement of certain investments in unconsolidated affiliates, as well as an increase in interest income due to increases in interest rates during the period.
the increase in income tax expense was primarily attributable to the increase in income before income taxes. further, during the year ended december 31, 2021, we recognized tax benefits as a result of the change in tax rate implemented as part of the united kingdom's finance act 2021. for additional information, see note 12: "income taxes" in our consolidated financial statements.

liquidity and capital resources overview as of december 31, 2022, we had total cash and cash equivalents of $1,286 million, including $77 million of restricted cash and cash equivalents. the majority of our restricted cash and cash equivalents is related to cash collateral and cash held for ff&e reserves.
our known short-term liquidity requirements primarily consist of funds necessary to pay for operating and other expenditures, including:
•costs associated with the management and franchising of hotels;
•corporate expenses;
•payroll and compensation costs;
•taxes and compliance costs;
•scheduled debt maturities and interest payments on our outstanding indebtedness, which, excluding finance lease liabilities, are estimated to be approximately $427 million in 2023;
•lease payments under our finance and operating leases, which include minimum lease payments that are estimated to be approximately $47 million and $147 million, respectively, in 2023;
•costs, other than compensation and rent as noted separately, associated with the operations of owned and leased hotels, including, but not limited to, utilities and operating supplies;
•committed contract acquisition costs;
•capital and maintenance expenditures for required renovations and maintenance at the hotels within our ownership segment;
•dividends as declared; and
•share repurchases.
our known long-term liquidity requirements primarily consist of funds necessary to pay for:
•scheduled debt maturities and interest payments on our outstanding indebtedness, which, excluding finance lease liabilities, are estimated to total an aggregate of $10.5 billion after december 31, 2023;
•lease payments under our finance and operating leases, which include minimum lease payments that are estimated to total an aggregate of $150 million and $1,068 million, respectively, after december 31, 2023;
•committed contract acquisition costs;
•capital improvements to the hotels within our ownership segment;
•corporate capital and information technology expenditures;
•dividends as declared;
•share repurchases; and
•commitments to owners in our management and franchise segment made in the normal course of business for which we are reimbursed by these owners through program fees to operate our marketing, sales and brands programs.
in march 2022, we resumed share repurchases, which we had previously suspended in an effort to preserve cash during the covid-19 pandemic. since they were resumed, as of december 31, 2022, we had repurchased approximately 12.3 million shares of our common stock for $1,608 million. as of december 31, 2022, approximately $3.1 billion remained available for share repurchases under our stock repurchase program. in june 2022, we resumed payment of regular quarterly cash dividends, which we had also previously suspended in an effort to preserve cash during the pandemic.
in circumstances where we have the opportunity to support our strategic objective of growing our global hotel network, we may provide performance or debt guarantees or loan commitments, as necessary, to owners of certain hotels that we currently or in the future will manage or franchise, as applicable, as well as letters of credit that support hotel financing or other obligations of hotel owners. see note 18: "commitments and contingencies" in our consolidated financial statements for additional information on these commitments that were outstanding as of december 31, 2022.
we have a long-term investment policy that is focused on the preservation of capital and maximizing the return on new and existing investments and returning available capital to stockholders through dividends and share repurchases. within the framework of our investment policy, we currently intend to continue to finance our business activities primarily with cash on our balance sheet as of december 31, 2022, cash generated from our operations and, as needed, the use of the available capacity of our revolving credit facility. additionally, we have continued access to debt markets and expect to be able to obtain financing as a source of liquidity as required and to extend maturities of existing borrowings, as necessary.
after considering our approach to liquidity and our available sources of cash, we believe that our cash position and sources of liquidity will meet anticipated requirements for operating and other expenditures, including corporate expenses, payroll and other compensation costs, taxes and compliance costs and other commitments for the foreseeable future based on current conditions. the objectives of our cash management policy are maintaining the availability of liquidity and minimizing operational costs.
we may from time to time issue or incur or increase our capacity to incur new debt and/or purchase our outstanding debt through underwritten offerings, open market transactions, privately negotiated transactions or otherwise. issuances or incurrence of new debt (or an increase in our capacity to incur new debt) and/or purchases or retirements of outstanding debt, if any, will depend on prevailing market conditions, liquidity requirements, contractual restrictions and other factors. the amounts involved may be material.

operating activities the increase in cash provided by operating activities was primarily due to the increase in cash inflows generated from our management and franchise segment, largely as a result of an increase in revpar at our comparable managed and franchised properties of 41.2 percent. additionally, there was a $119 million decrease in payments of contract acquisition costs based on the timing of certain strategic hotel developments supporting our net unit growth. the increase in cash provided by operating activities was partially offset by a $208 million increase in cash paid for income taxes primarily due to the increase in income before income taxes.
in april 2020, we pre-sold hilton honors points to american express and, before the end of the second quarter of 2022, all of those points had been used by american express. as such, american express resumed purchasing hilton honors points with cash in connection with a co-branded credit card arrangement with them, which contributed approximately $400 million to the increase in our operating cash flows during the year ended december 31, 2022. we expect american express to continue to purchase points with cash under the co-branded credit card arrangement in future periods.
investing activities net cash used in investing activities primarily included: (i) capitalized software costs that were related to various systems initiatives for the benefit of both our hotel owners and our overall corporate operations; (ii) capital expenditures for property and equipment related to our corporate facilities and the renovation of certain hotels in our ownership segment; and (iii) equity and debt financing that we provided to unconsolidated affiliates and owners of hotels that we currently or in the future will manage or franchise to support our strategic objectives. during the year ended december 31, 2022, net cash used in investing activities was partially offset by the net cash inflows resulting from our undesignated derivative financial instruments that we have in place to hedge against changes in foreign currency exchange rates, primarily as a result of the british pound depreciating against the usd during the year ended december 31, 2022.
financing activities net cash used in financing activities during the year ended december 31, 2022 primarily related to the return of capital to shareholders, including share repurchases, which resumed in march 2022, and quarterly dividend payments, which resumed in june 2022, after both programs were suspended in 2020. net cash used in financing activities during the year ended december 31, 2021 primarily comprised the full repayment of the $1.69 billion outstanding debt balance on our revolving credit facility, as well as the debt issuance costs and redemption premiums associated with the issuance of new senior unsecured notes and the use of such proceeds for the redemption of previously outstanding senior unsecured notes.
debt and borrowing capacity as of december 31, 2022, our total indebtedness, excluding the deduction for unamortized deferred financing costs and discount, was approximately $8.8 billion, and we had $60 million of letters of credit outstanding under our revolving credit facility, resulting in an available borrowing capacity of $1,690 million. in january 2023, we amended the credit agreement governing our revolving credit facility to increase the borrowing capacity from $1.75 billion to $2.0 billion, $250 million of which is available in the form of letters of credit, and, based on the terms of the agreement, we expect the extended maturity date to be january 2028. as of february 3, 2023, after considering $60 million letters of credit outstanding and no borrowings outstanding, we had an available borrowing capacity on the revolving credit facility of $1,940 million. for additional information on our total indebtedness, including any applicable guarantees, refer to note 8: "debt" in our consolidated financial statements.
if we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow from operations in the future to service our debt, we may be required to reduce capital expenditures or issue additional equity securities. however, we do not have any material indebtedness outstanding that matures prior to may 2025. our ability to make scheduled principal payments and to pay interest on our debt depends on our future operating performance, which is subject to general conditions in or affecting the hospitality industry that may be beyond our control.
critical accounting estimates the preparation of our consolidated financial statements in accordance with gaap requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the date of the consolidated financial statements, the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods and the related disclosures in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying footnotes. on an ongoing basis, we evaluate these estimates and judgments based on historical experiences and various other factors that we believe reflect the current circumstances. while we believe our estimates, assumptions and judgments are reasonable, they are based on information presently available. actual results may differ significantly from these estimates due to changes in judgments, assumptions and conditions as a result of unforeseen events or otherwise, which could have a material effect on our financial position or results of operations.
we believe that the following estimates, which are used in conjunction with our significant accounting policies, are critical because they involve a higher degree of judgment and are based on information that is inherently uncertain; refer to note 2: "basis of presentation and summary of significant accounting policies" in our consolidated financial statements for information on our significant accounting policies. management has discussed the development and selection of the following critical accounting estimates with the audit committee of the board of directors:
impairment of goodwill and brands intangible assets we evaluate goodwill and brands intangible assets for potential impairment on an annual basis or at other times during the year if indicators of impairment exist. our reporting units are the same as our operating segments as described in note 17: "business segments" in our consolidated financial statements.
as part of the evaluation of goodwill and brands intangible assets for potential impairment, we exercise judgment to:
•perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit or brand intangible asset is less than its carrying value. factors we consider when making this determination include assessing the overall effect of trends in the hospitality industry and the general economy, regional performance and expectations and historical experience;
•decide whether to bypass the qualitative assessment and perform a quantitative assessment. factors we consider when making this determination include changes in the company or general economic conditions since the previous quantitative assessment was performed, the amount by which the fair value exceeded the carrying value at that time and the period of time that has passed since such quantitative assessment; and
•perform a quantitative analysis to identify both the existence of impairment and the amount of the impairment loss. the estimated fair value is based on internal projections of expected future cash flows and operating plans, as well as market conditions relative to the operations of the reporting unit or brand, as applicable.
changes in the estimates and assumptions used in our impairment analysis, or changes in the factors that we consider that would affect these estimates and assumptions, such as those described above, could result in impairment losses, which could be material.
impairment of certain finite-lived assets we evaluate the carrying value of our specifically identifiable lease intangible assets, operating and finance lease rou assets and property and equipment for indicators of impairment, and, if such indicators exist, we perform an analysis to determine the recoverability of the determined asset group, by comparing the expected undiscounted future cash flows to the net carrying value of the asset group.
as part of the process, we exercise judgment to:
•determine if there are indicators of impairment present. factors we consider when making this determination include assessing the overall effect of trends in the hospitality industry and the general economy, regional performance and expectations, historical experience, capital costs and other asset-specific information;
•determine the projected undiscounted future cash flows when indicators of impairment are present. judgment is required when developing projections of future revenues and expenses based on estimated performance over the expected useful life of the asset group. forward-looking estimates of future performance are based on historical operating results, adjusted for current and expected future market conditions, as well as various internal projections and external sources; and
•determine the asset group fair value when required. in determining the fair value, we often use internally-developed discounted cash flow models, appraisals, recent similar transactions in the market and, if appropriate and available for a specific asset group, current estimated net sales proceeds from pending offers. assumptions used in the discounted cash flow models include estimating cash flows, which may require us to adjust for specific market conditions, as well as capitalization rates, which are based on location, property or asset type, market-specific dynamics and overall economic performance. the discount rate applied to forward-looking projections takes into account market-specific considerations.
changes in the estimates and assumptions used in our impairment analysis, or changes in the factors that we consider that would affect these estimates and assumptions, such as those described above, could result in impairment losses, which could be material.
hilton honors we record a point redemption liability for amounts received from properties participating in our hilton honors guest loyalty program and from strategic partners affiliated with the loyalty program, in an amount equal to the estimated cost per point of the future redemption obligation. we engage third-party actuaries annually to assist in determining the fair value of the future reward redemption obligation using a discount rate and statistical formulas that project future point redemptions based on factors that require judgment, including: (i) an estimate of points that will eventually be redeemed, which includes an estimate of breakage (i.e., points that will never be redeemed); (ii) the expectation of when such points will be redeemed; and (iii) the cost of reimbursing properties and other third parties when points are redeemed. the cost of the points expected to be redeemed includes further estimates of available room nights, occupancy rates, room rates and any changes to the hilton honors program, including devaluation or appreciation of points based on changes in the number of points required to redeem a reward. any amounts received related to the issuance of points that are in excess of the actuarial determined cost per point are recorded as deferred revenue in our consolidated balance sheets and recognized as revenue upon point redemption. we recognize revenue for point redemptions in the amount we expect to retain in excess of the cost per point, inclusive of estimated breakage, and limit the revenue recognized to an amount that is probable to not result in a significant reversal in the cumulative revenue recognized when breakage occurs.
in addition to the hilton honors fees we receive from hotel owners to operate the program, we earn fees from strategic partnerships, including co-branded credit card arrangements, for a license to use our ip and the issuance of hilton honors points. the allocation of the overall fees from the strategic partnerships between the ip license and the hilton honors points is based on their estimated standalone selling prices. the estimated standalone selling price of the ip license is determined using a relief-from-royalty valuation method incorporating statistical formulas based on factors that require significant judgment, including estimates of the usage of the strategic partner's goods or services, an appropriate royalty rate and a discount rate applied to the projected cash flows. the estimated standalone selling price of the future reward redemptions of hilton honors points under the strategic partnerships is calculated using a discounted cash flow analysis with the same assumptions as the point redemption liability discussed above, adjusted for an appropriate margin.
changes in our estimates and assumptions that are used to determine our estimated cost per point and the allocation of fees from strategic partnerships between the ip license fee and the hilton honors points could result in material changes in the balances of our liability for guest loyalty program and deferred revenues in our consolidated balance sheets. further, the estimates and assumptions used for the allocation of fees could result in material changes to our licensing fees and other revenues from managed and franchised properties recognized in our consolidated statements of operations.
income taxes we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the differences between the financial statement carrying values and the tax basis of assets and liabilities using currently enacted tax rates. we regularly review our deferred tax assets to assess their potential realization and establish a valuation allowance for portions of such assets that we believe will not be ultimately realized. in performing this review, we make estimates and assumptions regarding projected future taxable income, the expected timing of reversals of existing temporary differences and the implementation of tax planning strategies. a change in these assumptions may increase or decrease our valuation allowance resulting in an increase or decrease in our effective tax rate, which could materially affect our consolidated financial statements. refer to note 12: "income taxes" for information on the balances of our deferred tax assets and respective valuation allowances as of december 31, 2022.
we use a prescribed more-likely-than-not recognition threshold for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return if there is uncertainty in income taxes recognized in the consolidated financial statements. when determining the amount of tax benefit to be recognized, we assume, among other items, the position will be examined, the examiner will have all relevant information and the evaluation of the position will be based on its technical merits. further, estimates based on the technical merits of each evaluated tax position and the amounts we would ultimately accept in a negotiated settlement with the tax authorities are used to measure the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50 percent likely of being realized upon settlement. changes to these assumptions and estimates can lead to an additional income tax benefit (expense), which could materially affect our consolidated financial statements.
legal contingencies we are subject to various legal proceedings and claims, the outcomes of which are subject to significant uncertainty. an estimated loss from a loss contingency will be accrued as a charge to income if it is probable and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. significant judgment is required when we evaluate, among other factors, the degree of probability of an unfavorable outcome and the ability to make a reasonable estimate of the amount of loss in determining whether an accrual of an estimated loss is appropriate. changes in these factors could materially affect our consolidated financial statements.

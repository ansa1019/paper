item 1a. risk factors the company's business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows are subject to various risks, including, but not limited to, those set forth below, which could cause actual results to vary materially from recent results or from anticipated future results. these risk factors should be considered together with information included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10-k.
economic risks the covid-19 pandemic has adversely affected the company's business, financial condition and results of operations and could affect the company's liquidity. the full and long-term extent of the effects of the covid-19 pandemic or other outbreaks, pandemics, or public health crises on our business depend on future events that continue to be highly uncertain and cannot be predicted.
the covid-19 pandemic and the measures taken globally to reduce its spread have negatively impacted the global economy, disrupted consumer/customer demand and global supply chains, and created significant volatility and disruption of financial markets. the covid-19 pandemic continues to have the potential to alter demand for our products and to disrupt our supply chain as a result of shifts in demand, illness, travel restrictions, transportation disruptions, increased border controls or closures, or financial hardship. we have been able to procure the critical raw materials and components necessary to continue production, but prices for some raw materials have increased significantly and there is no guarantee that we will be able to procure critical raw materials in the future without materially adversely impacting our operating margins. a prolonged extension of the conditions resulting from the pandemic could force both customer and supplier bankruptcies, which we expect would adversely impact our results; however, given the uncertainty around the continued duration and breadth of the covid-19 pandemic, we cannot reasonably estimate the extent of these adverse effects on our operations.
the ultimate significance of the covid-19 pandemic or other outbreaks, pandemics or public health crises on our business will depend on events that are beyond our control and that we cannot predict. additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.
the company's results are impacted by global economic conditions. downturns in the markets served by the company could adversely affect its businesses, results of operations or financial condition.
the company's businesses are impacted by economic conditions around the globe. slower economic growth, financial market instability, inflation, natural disasters, public health crises (such as the covid-19 pandemic), labor market challenges, supply chain disruptions, armed conflicts (such as the russia and ukraine conflict), government deficit reduction, sequestration and other austerity measures impacting the markets the company serves can adversely affect the company's businesses by reducing demand for the company's products and services, limiting financing available to the company's customers, causing production delays, increasing order cancellations and the difficulty in collecting accounts receivable, increasing price competition, or increasing the risk that counterparties to the company's contractual arrangements will become insolvent or otherwise unable to fulfill their obligations.
rising interest rates could have a dampening effect on overall economic activity and/or the financial condition of the company's customers, either or both of which could negatively affect customer demand for the company's products and customers' ability to repay obligations to the company. rising interest rates could have an impact on the company and its customers' cost of capital.
the global nature of the company's operations subjects it to political, economic and social risks that could adversely affect its business, results of operations or financial condition.
over 50% of the company's net sales are derived from customers outside the united states, and the company currently operates in 51 countries. the risks inherent in the company's global operations include:
•fluctuation in currency exchange rates;
•limitations on ownership or participation in local enterprises;
•price controls, exchange controls and limitations on repatriation of earnings;
•transportation delays and disruptions;
•political, social and economic instability and disruptions, including political unrest and armed conflicts;
•acts of terrorism;
•the impact of widespread public health crises (such as the covid-19 pandemic);
•government embargoes, sanctions or foreign trade restrictions;
•the imposition of duties and tariffs and other trade barriers and retaliatory countermeasures;
•government actions impacting international trade agreements, including the eu-uk trade and cooperation agreement;
•import and export controls;
•social and labor unrest and current and changing regulatory environments;
•the potential for expropriation or nationalization of enterprises;
•difficulties in staffing and managing multi-national operations;
•multiple and potentially conflicting laws, regulations and policies that are subject to change;
•limitations on its ability to enforce legal rights and remedies; and
•potentially adverse tax consequences.
the global geopolitical and trade environment has resulted in raw material inflation and potential for increased escalation of domestic and international tariffs and retaliatory trade policies. further changes in u.s. trade policy (including new or additional increases in duties or tariffs) and retaliatory actions by u.s. trade partners, including sanctions against russia and developments in u.s.-china trade relations, could result in a worsening of economic conditions. if the company is unable to successfully manage the risks associated with managing and expanding its international businesses, the company's business, results of operations or financial condition may be adversely impacted.
a significant fluctuation between the u.s. dollar and other currencies could adversely impact the company's operating income.
although the company's financial results are reported in u.s. dollars, a significant portion of its sales and operating costs are realized in other currencies, with the largest concentration of foreign sales occurring in europe. the company's profitability is affected by movements of the u.s. dollar against the euro and other foreign currencies in which it generates revenues and incurs expenses. significant long-term fluctuations in relative currency values, and in particular, an increase in the value of the u.s. dollar against foreign currencies, has had and could have an adverse effect on profitability and financial condition.
business and operational risks the benefits from the company's enterprise strategy may not be as expected and the company's financial results could be adversely impacted, or the company may not meet its long-term financial performance targets.
as the company continues to execute on its enterprise strategy initiatives, it remains focused on the core principles of portfolio discipline, 80/20 front-to-back practice excellence, and organic growth. product line and customer base simplification activities, which are core elements of the company's 80/20 front-to-back process, continue to be applied by the company's operating divisions and are active elements of the enterprise strategy. although these activities are expected to improve future operating margins and organic revenue growth, they are also expected to have a negative impact on the company's overall organic revenue growth in the short term. additionally, other core activities of the enterprise strategy related to portfolio discipline and organic growth, including customer-back innovation and strategic sales excellence, may not have the desired impact on future operating results. if the company is unable to realize the expected benefits from its enterprise strategy initiatives, the company's financial results could be adversely impacted, or the company may not meet its long-term financial performance targets.
the timing and amount of the company's share repurchases are subject to a number of uncertainties.
share repurchases constitute a significant component of the company's capital allocation strategy. the company has historically funded its share repurchases with free cash flow and short-term borrowings. the amount and timing of share repurchases will be based on a variety of factors. important factors that could cause the company to limit, suspend or delay its share repurchases include unfavorable trading market conditions, the price of the company's common stock, the nature of other investment opportunities presented to the company from time to time, regulatory developments relating to share repurchase programs, the ability to obtain financing at attractive rates and the availability of u.s. cash.
if the company is unable to successfully introduce new products, its future growth may be adversely affected.
the company's ability to develop new products based on innovation can affect its competitive position and sometimes requires the investment of significant time and resources. difficulties or delays in research, development, production or commercialization of new products and services may reduce future revenues and adversely affect the company's competitive position. if the company is unable to create sustainable product differentiation, its organic growth may be adversely affected.
if the company is unable to adequately protect its intellectual property, its competitive position and results of operations may be adversely impacted.
protecting the company's intellectual property is critical to its innovation efforts. the company owns patents, trade secrets, copyrights, trademarks and/or other intellectual property rights related to many of its products, and also has exclusive and non-exclusive license rights under intellectual property owned by others. the company's intellectual property rights may be challenged or the company may be unable to maintain, renew or enter into new license agreements with third-party owners of intellectual property on reasonable terms. unauthorized use of the company's intellectual property rights by third parties, particularly in countries where property rights are not highly developed or protected, or inability to preserve existing intellectual property rights could adversely impact the company's competitive position and results of operations.
the company has significant goodwill and other intangible assets, and future impairment of these assets could have a material adverse impact on the company's financial results.
the company has recorded significant goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets on its balance sheet as a result of acquisitions, including the acquisition of the mts test & simulation business in december 2021. a number of factors may result in impairments to goodwill and other intangible assets, including significant negative industry or economic trends, disruptions to our business, increased competition and significant changes in the use of the assets. impairment charges could adversely affect the company's financial condition or results of operations in the periods recognized.
raw material price increases and supply shortages could adversely affect results.
the supply of raw materials to the company and to its component parts suppliers could be interrupted for a variety of reasons, including availability and pricing. the company and its customers have experienced supply chain disruptions related to the covid-19 pandemic and the global reaction to russia's ongoing invasion of ukraine, and continued disruptions to the supply chain could adversely affect the company's ability to meet commitments to customers. prices for raw materials necessary for production have fluctuated significantly in the past and the company has experienced upward pricing pressure on raw materials such as steel, resins and chemicals. significant price increases could adversely affect the company's results of operations and operating margins. in particular, inflation, changes in trade policies, the imposition of duties and tariffs, potential retaliatory countermeasures, public health crises (such as the covid-19 pandemic), threatened or actual military conflicts and severe weather events could adversely impact the price or availability of raw materials. the company may not be able to pass along increased raw material and components parts prices to its customers in the form of price increases or its ability to do so could be delayed. consequently, its results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected.
the company's defined benefit pension plans are subject to financial market risks that could adversely affect its results of operations and cash flows.
the performance of financial markets and interest rates impact the company's funding obligations under its defined benefit pension plans. significant changes in market interest rates, decreases in the fair value of plan assets and investment losses on plan assets may increase the company's funding obligations and adversely impact its results of operations and cash flows.
if the company is unable to protect its information technology infrastructure against service interruptions, data corruption, cyber-based attacks or network security breaches, or if there is a violation of data privacy laws, there could be a negative impact on operating results or the company may suffer financial or reputational damage.
the company relies on information technology networks and systems, including the internet, to process, transmit and store electronic information, and to manage or support a variety of business processes and activities, including procurement, manufacturing, distribution, invoicing and collection. these technology networks and systems may be susceptible to damage, disruptions or shutdowns due to failures during the process of upgrading or replacing software, databases or components; power outages; hardware failures; computer viruses; employee error or malfeasance; and attacks by computer hackers, which have continued to increase on a global scale in both magnitude and frequency, taken on novel and unprecedented forms and become more difficult to detect. minor security breaches have occurred from time to time and are expected to occur in the future. although the cyber-attacks experienced to date have not had a material impact, future security breaches of our technology networks and systems or those of our vendors and third-party service providers could result in unauthorized disclosure of confidential information or personal data belonging to our employees, partners, customers or suppliers, which could cause reputational and legal harm as we are subject to data privacy laws, including the eu general data protection regulation, in the various countries in which we operate. if our information technology systems suffer severe damage, disruption, or shutdown, and business continuity plans do not effectively resolve the issues in a timely manner, or if we violate data privacy laws, there could be a negative impact on operating results or the company may suffer financial or reputational damage.
strategic transaction risks the company's acquisition of businesses could negatively impact its profitability and returns.
the company has engaged in various acquisitions in the past, such as the acquisition of the mts test & simulation business in december 2021, and could choose to acquire additional businesses in the future. acquisitions involve a number of risks and financial, accounting, managerial and operational challenges, including the following, any of which could adversely affect the company's profitability and returns:
•the acquired business' inability to adapt to the itw business model or otherwise perform in accordance with the company's anticipated results or timetable, could cause it to under-perform relative to the company's expectations and the price paid for it.
•the acquired business could cause the company's financial results to differ from expectations in any given fiscal period, or over the long term.
•acquisition-related earnings charges could adversely impact operating results.
•the acquired business could place unanticipated demands on the company's management, operational resources and financial and internal control systems.
•the company may assume unknown liabilities, known contingent liabilities that become realized or known liabilities that prove greater than anticipated, internal control deficiencies or exposure to regulatory sanctions resulting from the activities of the acquired business. the realization of any of these liabilities or deficiencies may increase the company's expenses, adversely affect its financial position or cause noncompliance with its financial reporting obligations.
•as a result of acquisitions, the company has in the past recorded significant goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets on its balance sheet. if the company is not able to realize the value of these assets, it may recognize charges relating to the impairment of these assets.
divestitures pose the risk of retained liabilities that could adversely affect the company's financial results.
the company has had significant divestiture activity in the past in accordance with its portfolio management initiative, and it divested two businesses in the fourth quarter of 2022 as it continues portfolio refinements to maintain portfolio discipline. the company has retained certain liabilities directly or through indemnifications made to the buyers against known and unknown contingent liabilities such as lawsuits, tax liabilities, product liability claims and environmental matters, which could adversely affect the company's financial results.
tax, legal and regulatory risks unfavorable tax law changes and tax authority rulings may adversely affect results.
the company is subject to income taxes in the u.s. and in various foreign jurisdictions. domestic and international tax liabilities are based on the income and expenses in various tax jurisdictions. the company's effective tax rate could be adversely affected by changes in the mix of earnings among countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation allowance of deferred tax assets or changes in tax laws. the amount of income taxes is subject to ongoing audits by u.s. federal, state and local tax authorities and by non-u.s. authorities. if these audits result in assessments different from amounts recorded, future financial results may include unfavorable tax adjustments.
adverse outcomes in legal proceedings or enforcement actions may adversely affect results.
the company's businesses expose it to potential costs and adverse rulings associated with commercial, intellectual property, employment, toxic tort and other product liability claims and lawsuits. the company's global operations also subject it to government investigations in numerous countries. we cannot predict the outcome of claims, investigations and lawsuits and we may incur costs, judgments or fines or enter into settlements that could adversely impact our businesses, reputation or future financial results. the company currently maintains insurance programs consisting of self-insurance up to certain limits and excess insurance coverage for claims over established limits. there can be no assurance that the company will be able to obtain insurance on acceptable terms or that its insurance programs will provide adequate protection against actual losses. in addition, the company is subject to the risk that one or more of its insurers may become insolvent and become unable to pay claims that may be made in the future. even if it maintains adequate insurance programs, claims, judgments or settlements could have a material adverse effect on the company's financial condition, liquidity and results of operations and on its ability to obtain suitable, adequate or cost-effective insurance in the future.
uncertainty related to environmental regulation and industry standards, as well as physical risks of climate change, could impact the company's results of operations and financial position.
increased public awareness and concern regarding environmental risks, including global climate change, may result in more international, regional and/or federal requirements or industry standards to reduce or mitigate global warming and other environmental risks. these regulations or standards could mandate even more restrictive requirements, such as stricter limits on greenhouse gas emissions and production of single use plastics, than the voluntary commitments that the company has made or require such changes on a more accelerated time frame. there continues to be a lack of consistent climate legislation, which creates economic and regulatory uncertainty. in addition, the physical risks of climate change may impact the availability and cost of materials and natural resources, sources and supply of energy, product demand and manufacturing and could increase insurance and other operating costs, including, potentially, to repair damage incurred as a result of extreme weather events or to renovate or retrofit facilities to better withstand extreme weather events. if environmental laws or regulations or industry standards are either changed or adopted and impose significant operational restrictions and compliance requirements upon the company or its products, or the company's operations are disrupted due to physical impacts of climate change, the company's business, capital expenditures, results of operations, financial condition and competitive position could be negatively impacted.
the company may incur fines or penalties, damage to its reputation or other adverse consequences if its employees, agents or business partners violate anti-bribery, competition, export and import, trade sanctions, data privacy, environmental, human rights or other laws.
the company has a decentralized operating structure under which its individual businesses are allowed significant decision-making autonomy within the company's strategic framework and internal financial and compliance controls. the company cannot ensure that its internal controls will always protect against reckless or criminal acts committed by its employees, agents or business partners that might violate u.s. and/or non-u.s. laws, including anti-bribery, competition, export and import, trade sanctions, data privacy, environmental and human rights laws. as recent years have seen a substantial increase in the global enforcement of anti-corruption laws and adoption of new trade sanctions and human rights laws, any such improper actions could subject the company to civil or criminal investigations, could lead to substantial civil or criminal monetary and non-monetary penalties against the company or its subsidiaries, or could damage its reputation.

item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations introduction illinois tool works inc. (the "company" or "itw") is a global manufacturer of a diversified range of industrial products and equipment with 84 divisions in 51 countries. as of december 31, 2022, the company employed approximately 46,000 people.
the company's operations are organized and managed based on similar product offerings and end markets, and are reported to senior management as the following seven segments: automotive oem; food equipment; test & measurement and electronics; welding; polymers & fluids; construction products; and specialty products.
due to the large number of diverse businesses and the company's decentralized operating structure, the company does not require its businesses to provide detailed information on operating results. instead, the company's corporate management collects data on several key measurements: operating revenue, operating income, operating margin, overhead costs, number of months on hand in inventory, days sales outstanding in accounts receivable, past due receivables and return on invested capital. these key measures are monitored by management and significant changes in operating results versus current trends in end markets and variances from forecasts are discussed with operating unit management.
the itw business model the powerful and highly differentiated itw business model is the company's core source of value creation. it is the company's competitive advantage and defines how itw creates value for its shareholders. the itw business model is comprised of three unique elements:
•itw's 80/20 front-to-back process is the operating system that is applied in every itw business. initially introduced as a manufacturing efficiency tool in the 1980s, itw has continually refined, improved and expanded 80/20 into a proprietary, holistic business management process that generates significant value for the company and its customers. through the application of data driven insights generated by 80/20 practice, itw focuses on its largest and best opportunities (the "80") and eliminates cost, complexity and distractions associated with the less profitable opportunities (the "20"). 80/20 enables itw businesses to consistently achieve world-class operational excellence in product availability, quality, and innovation, while generating superior financial performance;
•customer-back innovation has fueled decades of profitable growth at itw. the company's unique innovation approach is built on insight gathered from the 80/20 front-to-back process. working from the customer back, itw businesses position themselves as the go-to problem solver for their "80" customers. itw's innovation efforts are focused on understanding customer needs, particularly those in "80" markets with solid long-term growth fundamentals, and creating unique solutions to address those needs. these customer insights and learnings drive innovation at itw and have contributed to a portfolio of approximately 19,200 granted and pending patents;
•itw's decentralized, entrepreneurial culture enables itw businesses to be fast, focused, and responsive. itw businesses have significant flexibility within the framework of the itw business model to customize their approach in order to best serve their specific customers' needs. itw colleagues recognize their unique responsibilities to execute the company's strategy and values. as a result, the company maintains a focused and simple organizational structure that, combined with outstanding execution, delivers best-in-class services and solutions adapted to each business' customers and end markets.
enterprise strategy in late 2012, itw began its strategic framework transitioning the company on its current path to fully leverage the compelling performance potential of the itw business model. the company undertook a complete review of its performance, focusing on its businesses delivering consistent above-market growth with best-in-class margins and returns, and developing a strategy to replicate that performance across its operations.
itw determined that solid and consistent above-market organic growth is the core growth engine to deliver world-class financial performance and compelling long-term returns for its shareholders. to shift its primary growth engine to organic, the company began executing a multi-step approach.
•the first step was to narrow the focus and improve the quality of itw's business portfolio. as part of the portfolio management initiative, itw exited businesses that were operating in commoditized market spaces and prioritized sustainable differentiation as a must-have requirement for all itw businesses. this process included both divesting entire businesses and exiting commoditized product lines and customers inside otherwise highly differentiated itw divisions.
as a result of this work, itw's business portfolio now has significantly higher organic growth potential. itw segments and divisions now possess attractive and differentiated product lines and end markets as they continue to improve operating margins and generate price/cost increases. the company achieved this through product line simplification, or eliminating the complexity and overhead costs associated with smaller product lines and customers, while supporting and growing the businesses' largest / most profitable customers and product lines.
•step two, business structure simplification, was implemented to simplify and scale up itw's operating structure to support increased engineering, marketing, and sales resources, and improve global reach and competitiveness, all of which were critical to driving accelerated organic growth. itw now has 84 scaled-up divisions with significantly enhanced focus on growth investments, core customers and products, and customer-back innovation.
•the strategic sourcing initiative established sourcing as a core strategic and operational capability at itw, delivering an average of one percent reduction in spend each year from 2013 through 2022 and continues to be a key contributor to the company's ongoing enterprise strategy.
•with the initial portfolio realignment and scale-up work largely complete, the company shifted its focus to preparing for and accelerating organic growth, reapplying the 80/20 front-to-back process to optimize its newly scaled-up divisions for growth, first, to build a foundation of operational excellence, and second, to identify the best opportunities to drive organic growth.
itw has clearly demonstrated superior 80/20 management, resulting in meaningful incremental improvement in margins and returns as evidenced by the company's operating margin and after-tax return on invested capital. at the same time, these 80/20 initiatives can also result in restructuring initiatives that reduce costs and improve profitability and returns.
path to full potential since the launch of the enterprise strategy, the company has made considerable progress on our path to full potential. the itw business model and unique set of capabilities are a source of strong and enduring competitive advantage, but for the company to truly reach its full potential, every one of its divisions must also be operating at its full potential. to do so, the company remains focused on its core principles:
•portfolio discipline
•80/20 front-to-back practice excellence
•full-potential organic growth portfolio discipline the company only operates in industries where it can generate significant, long-term competitive advantage from the itw business model. itw businesses have the right "raw material" in terms of market and business attributes that best fit the itw business model and have significant potential to drive above-market organic growth over the long-term.
the company focuses on high-quality businesses, ensuring it operates in markets with positive long-term macro fundamentals and with customers that have critical needs and value itw's differentiated products, services and solutions. itw's portfolio operates in highly diverse end markets and geographies which makes the company more resilient in the face of uncertain or volatile market environments.
the company routinely evaluates its portfolio to ensure it delivers sustainable differentiation and drives consistent long-term performance. this includes both implementing portfolio refinements and assessing selective high-quality acquisitions to supplement itw's long-term growth potential.
the company previously communicated its intent to explore options, including potential divestitures, for certain businesses with annual revenues totaling up to $1.0 billion. in the fourth quarter of 2019, the company completed the divestitures of three businesses. due to the covid-19 pandemic, the company chose to defer any significant divestiture activity in 2020 and 2021. the company reinitiated the divestiture process in 2022 for certain businesses with combined annual revenues of approximately $0.5 billion, subject to approval by the company's board of directors. in the second quarter of 2022, plans were approved to divest two businesses, including one business in the polymers & fluids segment and one business in the food equipment segment. in the fourth quarter of 2022, both of these businesses were divested. the business in the polymers & fluids segment was sold for $220 million, subject to certain closing adjustments, resulting in a pre-tax gain of $156 million. the business in the food equipment segment was sold for $59 million, subject to certain closing adjustments, resulting in a pre-tax gain of $41 million. operating revenue related to these divested businesses that was included in the company's results of operations for the twelve months ended december 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020 was $106 million, $115 million and $113 million, respectively. refer to note 4. divestitures in item 8. financial statements and supplementary data for further information regarding the company's divestitures.
80/20 front-to-back practice excellence the 80/20 front-to-back process is a rigorous, iterative and highly data-driven approach to identify where the company has true differentiation and the ability to drive sustainable, high-quality organic growth. the company simplifies and eliminates complexity and redesigns every aspect of its business to ensure focused execution on key opportunities, markets, customers, and products.
itw will continue to drive 80/20 front-to-back practice excellence in every division in the company, every day. driving strong operational excellence in the quality of 80/20 front-to-back practice across the company, division by division, will produce further customer-facing performance improvement in a number of divisions and additional structural margin expansion at the enterprise level.
pandemic priorities and "win the recovery"
while it was the challenges brought about by the covid-19 pandemic that dominated the company's attention starting in 2020, it was the collection of capabilities and competitive advantages that have been built and honed since 2012 through the execution of itw's enterprise strategy that provided the company with the options to respond. this, coupled with the proprietary and powerful itw business model, diversified high-quality business portfolio and diligent execution put the company in a position of strength in dealing with the global pandemic.
throughout the global pandemic, the company has focused its efforts on (1) protecting the health and supporting the well-being of itw's colleagues; (2) serving the company's customers with excellence; (3) maintaining financial strength, liquidity and strategic optionality; and (4) leveraging the company's strengths to position it to fully participate in the recovery.
"win the recovery" is an execution component of the company's enterprise strategy, not a separate initiative, with every one of the company's divisions identifying specific opportunities presented by the pandemic to capture sustainable share gains that are aligned with the itw long-term enterprise strategy. the company expects these efforts to contribute meaningfully to accelerate its progress toward full-potential organic growth. the company continues to focus on delivering strong results in any environment while executing its long-term strategy to achieve and sustain itw's full potential performance.
full-potential organic growth reaching full potential means that every division is positioned for sustainable, high-quality organic growth. the company has clearly defined action plans aimed at leveraging the performance power of the itw business model to achieve full-potential organic growth in every division, with specific focus on:
•"80" focused market penetration - fully leveraging the considerable growth potential that resides in the company's largest and most differentiated product offerings and customer relationships
•customer-back innovation - strengthening the company's commitment to serial innovation and delivering a continuous flow of differentiated new products to its key customers
•strategic sales excellence - deploying a high-performance sales function in every division as the company continues to make progress toward its full potential, the company will explore opportunities to reinforce or further expand the long-term organic growth potential of itw through the addition of selective high-quality acquisitions, such as the acquisition of the test & simulation business of mts systems corporation ("mts") from amphenol corporation on december 1, 2021. the operating results of the mts test & simulation business were reported within the company's test & measurement and electronics segment. refer to note 3. acquisitions in item 8. financial statements and supplementary data for further information regarding this acquisition.
terms used by itw management uses the following terms to describe the financial results of operations of the company:
•organic business - acquired businesses that have been included in the company's results of operations for more than 12 months on a constant currency basis.
•operating leverage - the estimated effect of the organic revenue volume changes on organic operating income, assuming variable margins remain the same as the prior period.
•price/cost - represents the estimated net impact of increases or decreases in the cost of materials used in the company's products versus changes in the selling price to the company's customers.
•product line simplification (pls) - focuses businesses on eliminating the complexity and overhead costs associated with smaller product lines and customers, and focuses businesses on supporting and growing their largest customers and product lines. in the short-term, pls may result in a decrease in revenue and overhead costs while improving operating margin. in the long-term, pls is expected to result in growth in revenue, profitability, and returns.
unless otherwise stated, the changes in financial results in the consolidated results of operations and the results of operations by segment represent the current year period versus the comparable period in the prior year.
consolidated results of operations in early 2020, an outbreak of a novel strain of coronavirus (covid-19) occurred in china and other jurisdictions. the covid-19 outbreak was subsequently declared a global pandemic by the world health organization on march 11, 2020. in response to the outbreak, governments around the globe took various actions to reduce its spread, including travel restrictions, shutdowns of businesses deemed nonessential, and stay-at-home or similar orders. the covid-19 pandemic and the measures taken globally to reduce its spread have negatively impacted the global economy, causing significant disruptions in the company's global operations starting primarily in the latter part of the first quarter of 2020 as covid-19 spread and impacted the countries in which the company operates and the markets the company serves.
throughout the global pandemic, the company has focused on the following priorities: (1) protecting the health and supporting the well-being of itw's colleagues; (2) continuing to serve the company's customers with excellence to the best of its ability; (3) maintaining financial strength, liquidity and strategic optionality; and (4) leveraging the company's strengths to position it to fully participate in the recovery. to support itw's colleagues, among its many actions and initiatives, the company redesigned production processes to ensure proper social distancing practices, adjusted shift schedules and assignments to help colleagues who have child and elder care needs, and implemented aggressive new workplace sanitation practices and a coordinated response to ensure access to personal protective equipment to minimize infection risk. to support its customers, the company worked diligently to keep its facilities open and operating safely. the company also adapted customer service systems and practices to seamlessly serve its customers under "work from home" requirements in many parts of the world.
in areas around the world where governments issued stay-at-home or similar orders, the vast majority of itw's businesses were designated as critical or essential businesses and, as such, they remained open and operational. in some cases, this was because the company's products directly impacted the covid-19 response effort. in other cases, the company's businesses were designated as critical because they played a vital role in serving and supporting industries that were deemed essential to the physical and economic health of our communities.
while the vast majority of the company's facilities remained open and operational during the pandemic, many of these facilities were operating at a reduced capacity at various times since the outset of the pandemic. despite the ongoing disruptions caused by the covid-19 pandemic, the company experienced solid recovery progress in many of its end markets during 2021 and, to a greater extent, in 2022 as vaccines became widely available and many governments reduced restrictions related to covid-19. the full extent of the covid-19 outbreak and its impact on the markets served by the company and on the company's operations and financial position continues to be highly uncertain as conditions continue to fluctuate around the world, with vaccine administration rising in certain regions, spikes in infections (including the spread of variants) continuing to be experienced and certain jurisdictions continuing to impose stay-at-home orders. the pandemic and resurgence of outbreaks could continue to adversely impact the operations of the company and its customers and suppliers. a description of the risks relating to the impact of the covid-19 outbreak on the company's business, operations and financial condition is contained in part i, item 1a. risk factors.
during the first quarter of 2022, russian military forces invaded ukraine. in response, the united states and several other countries imposed economic and other sanctions on russia. the company has four immaterial russian subsidiaries with total assets of approximately $25 million as of december 31, 2022. the revenue for these four subsidiaries for the year ended december 31, 2022 was approximately $38 million. sales to customers in russia represented less than one percent of itw's total consolidated revenue and were not material to the company's results of operations or financial position.
on december 1, 2021, the company completed the acquisition of the mts test & simulation business for a purchase price of $750 million, subject to certain closing adjustments. the mts test & simulation business had operating revenue of $46 million for the one month ended december 31, 2021 and $422 million for the twelve months ended december 31, 2022. the company expects the mts test & simulation business to improve operating margin performance in later years through the application of the company's 80/20 front-to-back process. the operating results of the mts test & simulation business were reported within the test & measurement and electronics segment. refer to note 3. acquisitions in item 8. financial statements and supplementary data for further information.
in the second quarter of 2022, plans were approved to divest two businesses, including one business in the polymers & fluids segment and one business in the food equipment segment. these two businesses were classified as held for sale beginning in the second quarter of 2022. in the fourth quarter of 2022, both of these businesses were divested. on october 3, 2022, the business in the polymers & fluids segment was sold for $220 million, subject to certain closing adjustments, resulting in a pre-tax gain of $156 million. on december 1, 2022, the business in the food equipment segment was sold for $59 million, subject to certain closing adjustments, resulting in a pre-tax gain of $41 million. the pre-tax gains were included in other income (expense) in the statement of income. income taxes on the gains were mostly offset by the utilization of capital loss carryforwards of $32 million. operating revenue related to these divested businesses that was included in the company's results of operations for the twelve months ended december 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020 was $106 million, $115 million and $113 million, respectively.

in a challenging and dynamic environment, the company delivered strong financial results in 2022 primarily due to the continued successful execution of enterprise initiatives, including the "win the recovery" actions initiated over the course of the past year, and continued focus on the highly differentiated itw business model. despite rising costs and a challenging global supply chain environment, the company generated operating revenue growth of 10.2 percent and organic revenue growth of 12.1 percent, as all seven segments achieved worldwide organic revenue growth in 2022. operating income was $3.8 billion in 2022, an increase of 9.0 percent. operating margin was 23.8 percent in 2022.

•internal investments to support organic growth and sustain core businesses;
•payment of an attractive dividend to shareholders; and
•external investments in selective strategic acquisitions that support the company's organic growth focus, such as the acquisition of the mts test & simulation business on december 1, 2021, and an active share repurchase program. refer to note 3. acquisitions in item 8. financial statements and supplementary data for further information regarding this acquisition.

after-tax return on average invested capital the company uses after-tax return on average invested capital ("after-tax roic") to measure the effectiveness of its operations' use of invested capital to generate profits. after-tax roic is not defined under u.s. generally accepted accounting principles ("gaap"). after-tax roic is a non-gaap financial measure that the company believes is a meaningful metric to investors in evaluating the company's ability to generate returns from cash invested in its operations and may be different than the method used by other companies to calculate after-tax roic. the company defines after-tax roic as operating income after taxes divided by average invested capital, which is annualized when presented in interim periods. operating income after taxes is a non-gaap measure consisting of net income before interest expense and other income (expense), on an after-tax basis, which are excluded as they do not represent returns generated by the company's operations. for comparability, the company also excluded the discrete tax benefits of $32 million in the fourth quarter of 2022 and $51 million in the second quarter of 2022 from net income and the effective tax rate for the year ended december 31, 2022. additionally, for comparability, the company excluded the discrete tax benefits of $21 million in the third quarter of 2021 and $112 million in the second quarter of 2021 from net income and the effective tax rate for the year ended december 31, 2021. total invested capital represents the net assets of the company, other than cash and equivalents and outstanding debt which do not represent capital investment in the company's operations. the most comparable gaap measure to operating income after taxes is net income. net income to average invested capital and after-tax roic for the years ended december 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020 were as follows:

critical accounting estimates the company has three accounting estimates that it believes are most important to the company's financial condition and results of operations, and which require the company to make judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain. management bases its estimates on historical experience, and in some cases on observable market information. various assumptions are also used that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances and form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. actual results may differ from these estimates.
the company's critical accounting estimates are as follows:
income taxes- the company provides deferred income tax assets and liabilities based on the estimated future tax effects of differences between the financial and tax bases of assets and liabilities based on currently enacted tax laws. the company's deferred and other tax balances are based on management's interpretation of the tax regulations and rulings in numerous taxing jurisdictions. income tax expense, assets and liabilities recognized by the company also reflect its best estimates and assumptions regarding, among other things, the level of future taxable income, the effect of the company's various tax planning strategies and uncertain tax positions. future tax authority rulings and changes in tax laws, changes in projected levels of taxable income and future tax planning strategies could affect the actual effective tax rate and tax balances recorded by the company.
goodwill and intangible assets- the company's business acquisitions typically result in recording goodwill and other intangible assets, which are a significant portion of the company's total assets and affect the amount of amortization expense and impairment charges that the company could incur in future periods. the company follows the guidance prescribed in the accounting standards to test goodwill and intangible assets for impairment. on an annual basis, or more frequently if triggering events occur, the company compares the estimated fair value of its reporting units to the carrying value of each reporting unit to determine if a potential goodwill impairment exists. if the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value, a goodwill impairment loss is recorded for the difference. in calculating the fair value of the reporting units or specific intangible assets, management relies on a number of factors, including business plans, economic projections, anticipated future cash flows, comparable transactions and other market data. there are inherent uncertainties related to these factors and management's judgment in applying them in the impairment tests of goodwill and other intangible assets.
as of december 31, 2022, the company had total goodwill and intangible assets of approximately $5.6 billion allocated to its reporting units. although there can be no assurance that the company will not incur additional impairment charges related to its goodwill and other intangible assets, the company generally believes the risk of significant impairment charges is lessened by the number of diversified businesses and end markets represented by its reporting units that have goodwill and other intangible assets. in addition, the individual businesses in many of the reporting units have been acquired over a long period of time, and in many cases have been able to improve their performance, primarily as a result of the application of the company's 80/20 front-to-back process. the amount of goodwill and other intangible assets allocated to individual reporting units ranges from approximately $212 million to $1.4 billion, with the average amount equal to $562 million. fair value determinations require considerable judgment and are sensitive to changes in the factors described above. due to the inherent uncertainties associated with these factors and economic conditions in the company's global end markets, impairment charges related to one or more reporting units could occur in future periods.
pension and other postretirement benefits- the company has various company-sponsored defined benefit retirement plans covering a number of u.s. employees and many employees outside the u.s. pension and other postretirement benefit expense and obligations are determined based on actuarial valuations. pension benefit obligations are generally based on each participant's years of service, future compensation, and age at retirement or termination. important assumptions in determining pension and postretirement expense and obligations are the discount rate, the expected long-term return on plan assets, life expectancy, and health care cost trend rates. future changes in any of these assumptions could materially affect the amounts recorded related to the company's pension and other postretirement benefit plans. see note 12. pension and other postretirement benefits in item 8. financial statements and supplementary data for additional discussion of actuarial assumptions used in determining pension and postretirement health care liabilities and expenses.
the company determines the discount rate used to measure plan liabilities as of the year-end measurement date for the u.s. primary pension plan. the discount rate reflects the current rate at which the associated liabilities could theoretically be effectively settled at the end of the year. in estimating this rate, the company looks at rates of return on high-quality fixed income investments, with similar duration to the liabilities in the plan. a 25 basis point decrease in the discount rate would increase the present value of the u.s. primary pension plan obligation by approximately $27 million. the company estimates the service and interest cost components of net periodic benefit cost by applying specific spot rates along the yield curve to the projected cash flows rather than a single weighted-average rate. see note 12. pension and other postretirement benefits in item 8. financial statements and supplementary data for information on the company's pension and other postretirement benefit plans and related assumptions.
the expected long-term return on plan assets is based on historical and expected long-term returns for similar investment allocations among asset classes. for the u.s. primary pension plan, a 25 basis point decrease in the expected return on plan assets would increase the annual pension expense by approximately $4 million.

item 1a. risk factors risks related to our operations costs and supply for inputs to our products, including raw materials and transportation, may change substantially and shortages have occurred and may continue to occur.
we have been, and may continue to be, affected by supply chain constraints and labor shortages driven by overall macroeconomic and geopolitical uncertainty, largely caused by the covid-19 pandemic and the russian invasion of ukraine. the resulting impacts on the global economy have led to supply chain disruptions and significant inflation in input costs, logistics, manufacturing and labor costs, which have impacted our results of operations in the current year and may continue to do so in the future.
our raw materials are sourced from industries characterized by a limited supply base, and their cost can fluctuate substantially. under many of our supply arrangements, the price we pay for raw materials fluctuates along with certain changes in underlying commodities costs. price increases for our raw materials have placed pressure on our costs and could continue to do so, and we may not be able to effectively hedge or pass along any such increases to our customers or consumers. furthermore, any price increases passed along to our customers or consumers could significantly reduce demand for our products and could negatively affect our business and financial performance. in addition, price decreases in commodities that we have effectively hedged could also increase our cost of goods sold for mark-to-market changes in the derivative instruments.
our principal raw materials in our coffee business include coffee beans and k-cup pod raw materials (including cups, filter paper and other ingredients) used in the manufacturing of our k-cup pods. we purchase, roast and sell high-quality whole bean coffee and related coffee products. the quality of the coffee we seek tends to trade on a negotiated basis at a premium above the "c" price of coffee. this premium depends upon the supply and demand at the time of purchase, and the amount of the premium can vary significantly. increases in the "c" coffee commodity price increase the price of high-quality coffee and also impact our ability to enter into fixed-price purchase commitments. we frequently enter into supply contracts whereby the quality, quantity, delivery period and other negotiated terms are agreed upon, but the date, and therefore price, at which the base "c" coffee commodity price component will be fixed has not yet been established. these are known as price-to-be-fixed contracts.
the supply and price of crops we purchase, such as coffee, apples, and corn, can also be affected by multiple factors in the producing countries, including weather, natural disasters, crop disease (such as coffee rust), general cost increases in farm inputs and costs of production, inventory levels and political and economic conditions, as well as the actions of certain organizations and associations that have historically attempted to influence prices of various commodities through agreements establishing export quotas or by restricting supplies.
ongoing speculation in global trading of commodities, such as coffee, has and may continue to influence prices. if we are unable to purchase sufficient quantities of our commodities due to any of the factors described herein or a worldwide or regional shortage, we may not be able to fulfill the demand for our products, which could have an adverse impact on our business and financial results.
we also have a limited number of suppliers for certain strategic raw materials critical to our operations. we may have limited leverage to negotiate with these suppliers, which could negatively affect our operations and the financial performance of our business. in addition, in order to ensure a continuous supply of high-quality raw materials, some of our inventory purchase obligations include long-term purchase commitments for certain strategic raw materials. the timing of these may not always coincide with the period in which we need the supplies to fulfill customer demand. this could lead to higher and more variable inventory levels and/or higher raw material costs for us.
if our suppliers are unable or unwilling to meet our requirements, we could suffer shortages or substantial cost increases. changing suppliers can require long lead times. the failure of our suppliers to meet our needs could occur for many reasons, including fires, natural disasters, weather, manufacturing problems, disease, widespread illness (such as the covid-19 pandemic), crop failure, strikes, transportation disruption, government regulation, political instability, cybersecurity attacks and terrorism. a failure of supply could also occur due to suppliers' financial difficulties, including bankruptcy. some of these risks may be more acute where the supplier or its plant is located in riskier or less-developed countries or regions. any significant interruption to supply or cost increase could substantially harm our business and financial performance.
some of our raw materials and finished products are sourced or manufactured overseas and shipped to the u.s. and canada. changes in the global ocean transport market, including shortages of shipping containers and availability of u.s. and canadian ports, have resulted in and may continue to result in increased costs of transportation for our raw materials and finished products, which may impact our results of operations.
in addition, we use a significant amount of energy in our business, and therefore may be significantly impacted by changes in fuel costs due to the large truck fleet we operate in our distribution business and our use of third-party carriers. an increase in the price, disruption of supply, or shortage in fuel and other energy sources could also increase our suppliers' operating costs and indirectly impact our results of operations.
table of contents we operate in intensely competitive categories.
the industry in which we operate is highly competitive and continues to evolve in response to changing consumer preferences. some of our competitors, such as coca-cola, pepsico, the kraft heinz company and nestleÃÅ s.a., are multinational corporations with significant financial resources. these competitors can use their resources and scale to rapidly respond to competitive pressures and changes in consumer preferences by introducing new products, changing their route to market, reducing prices or increasing promotional activities. we also compete with a number of smaller brands and a variety of smaller, regional and private label manufacturers. smaller companies may be more innovative, better able to bring new products to market and better able to quickly exploit and serve niche markets. we also compete for contract manufacturing with other bottlers and manufacturers. in canada, mexico and the caribbean, we compete with many of these same international companies as well as a number of regional competitors.
our sales may be negatively affected by numerous factors including our inability to maintain or increase prices, our inability to effectively promote our products, ineffective advertising and marketing campaigns, new entrants into the market, the decision of wholesalers, retailers or consumers to purchase competitors' products instead of ours, increased marketing costs and higher in-store placement and slotting fees driven by our competitors' willingness to spend aggressively. competitive pressures may also cause us to reduce prices we charge customers or may restrict our ability to increase such prices. in addition, the rapid growth of e-commerce may create additional consumer price deflation by, among other things, facilitating comparison shopping, and could potentially threaten the value of some of our legacy route-to-market strategies and thus negatively affect revenues.
a significant percentage of the coffee systems segment's financial performance is attributable to sales of k-cup pods for use with keurig brewing systems. we compete for sales of k-cup pods against local and regional brands, as well as against private label brands developed by retailers. our ability to gain or maintain share of sales in the countries in which we operate or in various local marketplaces or maintain or enhance our relationships with our partners and customers may be limited as a result of actions by competitors, including as a result of increased consolidation in the food and beverage industry and a significant increase in the number of competitive pod contract manufacturers.
continued acceptance of keurig brewers and sales of k-cup pods to an increasing installed customer base are significant factors in our coffee systems' growth plans. any substantial or sustained decline in the sale of keurig brewers, failure to continue to reduce the cost of keurig brewers, or substantial or sustained decline in the sales of k-cup pods could materially and adversely affect our business. keurig brewers compete against all sellers and types of coffeemakers. if we do not succeed in continuing to reduce the costs of manufacturing keurig brewers or differentiating keurig brewers from our competitors in the coffeemaker category, based on technology, quality of products, desired brands or otherwise, or our competitors adopt their respective strategies, our competitive position may be weakened.
concerns about the safety, quality, or health effects of our products could negatively affect our business.
the success of our business depends in part on our ability to maintain consumer confidence in the safety and quality of all of our products, including beverage products, their ingredients and packaging, and our brewers. we have various quality, environmental, health and safety supply chain standards. a failure or perceived failure to meet our quality or safety standards, including product contamination or tampering, or allegations of mislabeling, whether actual or perceived, could occur in our operations or those of our bottlers, manufacturers, distributors or suppliers. this could result in time consuming and expensive production interruptions, recalls, market withdrawals, product liability claims, and negative publicity. it could also result in the destruction of product inventory, lost sales due to the unavailability of product for a period of time, fines from applicable regulatory agencies, and higher-than-anticipated rates of warranty returns and other returns of goods. moreover, negative publicity may result from false, unfounded or nominal liability claims or limited recalls.
in addition, adverse public opinion, third-party studies or other allegations, whether or not valid, regarding the perceived or potential negative health effects of ingredients in our beverage products, or substances in our packaging materials may lead to additional government regulation, new or increased taxes on our products, actual or threatened legal action against us, and a negative consumer perception of our products, any of which could result in decreased demand for our products or reformulations of existing products to remove such ingredients or substances, which may be costly and reduce their appeal.
any or all of these events may lead to a loss of consumer confidence and trust, could damage the goodwill associated with our brands and may cause consumers to choose other products and could negatively affect our business and financial performance.
table of contents we may not effectively respond to changing consumer preferences and shopping behavior, which could impact our financial results.
consumers' preferences continually evolve due to a variety of factors, including changing demographics of the population, social trends, changes in consumer lifestyles and consumption patterns, concerns or perceptions regarding the health effects of products, concerns regarding the location of origin or source of ingredients and products, changes in consumers' spending habits, negative publicity, economic downturn or other factors. for example, consumers are increasingly concerned about health and wellness, focusing on the caloric intake associated with regular csds, the use of artificial sweeteners in diet csds, and the use of natural, organic or simple ingredients in beverages. the demand for csds has therefore decreased as consumers have shifted towards ncbs, such as water, rtd coffee and teas, and sports drinks. if we do not effectively anticipate and respond to these changing trends and consumer beverage preferences, our sales and growth could suffer.
consumers are also increasingly focused on sustainability, with particular attention to the recyclability of product packaging, reducing consumption of single-use plastics and non-recyclable materials, and the environmental impact of manufacturing operations. if we do not meet consumer demands by continuing to provide recyclable packaging options and focusing on sustainability throughout our manufacturing operations, our sales could suffer.
in addition, consumer shopping behavior is rapidly evolving due to both changes in travel, vacation and leisure activity patterns and the acceleration of e-commerce and other methods of purchasing products. if we are unable to meet the consumer where and when they desire their products or if we are unable to respond to changes in distribution channels (including e-commerce), our financial results could be adversely impacted.
we have been, and may continue to be, adversely impacted by significant reductions in demand or significant volatility in demand for one or more of our products, as a result of, among other things: the temporary inability of consumers to purchase our products due to illness, quarantine or other restrictions, store closures, or financial hardship, shifts in demand away from one or more of our higher priced products to lower priced products, or stockpiling or similar activity, reduced options for marketing and promotion of products or other restrictions in connection with widespread illness such as the covid-19 pandemic; such impacts could further increase the difficulty of operating our business during the pandemic, including accurately planning and forecasting customer demand.
if we do not innovate rapidly and successfully to respond to shifting consumer demands, our business may suffer. achieving growth depends on our successful development, introduction and marketing of innovative new products and line extensions. there are inherent risks associated with new product or packaging introductions, including uncertainties about trade and consumer acceptance or potential impacts on our existing product offerings. we may be required to increase expenditures for new product development. successful innovation depends on our ability to correctly anticipate customer and consumer acceptance, to obtain, protect, and maintain necessary intellectual property rights, and to avoid infringing upon the intellectual property rights of others. we must also be able to respond successfully to technological advances by and intellectual property rights of our competitors, and failure to do so could compromise our competitive position and impact our product sales, financial condition, and operating results.
if we do not successfully manage our investments in new business strategies or integrate and manage our acquired businesses or brands, our operating results may adversely be affected.
from time to time, we acquire businesses or brands, invest in emerging companies and/or form joint ventures, and enter into various licensing and distribution agreements to expand our product portfolio. in evaluating such endeavors, we are required to make difficult judgments regarding the value of business strategies, opportunities, technologies and other assets, and the risks and cost of potential liabilities. furthermore, we may incur unforeseen liabilities and obligations in connection with any such transaction, including in connection with the integration or management of the acquired businesses or brands and may encounter unexpected difficulties and costs in integrating them into our operating and internal control structures. we may also experience delays in extending our respective internal control over financial reporting to newly acquired businesses, which may increase the risk of failure to prevent misstatements in our financial records and in our consolidated financial statements. we also regularly pursue productivity initiatives, which are focused on cost savings and tax strategies in procurement, manufacturing, and logistics. these strategic initiatives may include investments in new technologies and optimization and relocation of our manufacturing and distribution footprint. new ventures and investments are inherently risky and may not be successful, and we may face challenges in achieving strategic objectives and other benefits expected from such investments or ventures. any acquisitions, investments or ventures may also disrupt ongoing business activity or result in the diversion of management attention and resources from other initiatives and operations.
our financial performance will depend in large part on how well we can manage and improve the performance of acquired businesses or brands and the success of our other investments and ventures. we may not achieve the strategic and financial objectives for such transactions. if we are unable to achieve such objectives, our consolidated results could be negatively affected.
table of contents our facilities and operations will require substantial investment and upgrading, and those investments may not achieve the intended financial benefits of such investment.
we continue to incur significant costs to upgrade or keep up-to-date various facilities and equipment or restructure our operations, including closing existing facilities or opening new ones. additionally, we rely on third parties for the construction and renovation of our facilities and manufacturing of our production equipment. we have ongoing programs to invest and upgrade our manufacturing, distribution and other facilities, including expansive investments in manufacturing facilities in spartanburg, south carolina; newbridge, ireland; and allentown, pennsylvania.
if our investment and restructuring costs are higher than anticipated, the investments and upgrades are not sufficient to meet our near-term future business needs, our business does not develop as anticipated to appropriately utilize new or upgraded facilities, or third parties fail to complete the construction or renovation of facilities or production equipment in a timely manner or in accordance with our specifications, our costs and financial performance could be negatively affected. as a result of the covid-19 pandemic and other business disruptions, we have experienced delays in the construction of certain of our new facilities and the production equipment contained within, and we may continue to experience such delays.
substantial disruption at our manufacturing and distribution facilities could occur.
a disruption at our manufacturing and distribution facilities could have a material adverse effect on our business. in addition, a disruption could occur at the facilities of our suppliers, bottlers, contract manufacturers or distributors. the disruption could occur for many reasons, including fire, natural disasters, weather, water scarcity, manufacturing problems, disease, widespread illness (such as the covid-19 pandemic), strikes, labor shortages, transportation or supply interruption, contractual dispute, government regulation, cybersecurity attacks or terrorism. moreover, if demand increases beyond our production capabilities, we would need to either expand our capabilities internally or acquire additional capacity. alternative facilities with sufficient capacity or capabilities may not be available, may cost substantially more than existing facilities or may take a significant time to start production, each of which could negatively affect our business and financial performance.
our intellectual property rights could be infringed or we could infringe the intellectual property rights of others, and adverse events regarding licensed intellectual property, including a third party's termination of distribution rights licensed to us, could harm our business.
we possess intellectual property that is important to our business. this intellectual property includes ingredient formulas, trademarks, copyrights, patents, business processes and other trade secrets. we and third parties, including competitors, could come into conflict over intellectual property rights. litigation could disrupt our business, divert management attention and cost a substantial amount to protect our rights or defend against claims. we cannot be certain that the steps taken to protect our rights will be sufficient or that others will not infringe or misappropriate our rights. if we are unable to protect our intellectual property rights, our brands, products and business could be harmed.
we also license various trademarks from third parties and license our trademarks to third parties. in some countries, third parties own certain trademarks or other intellectual property that we own in the u.s., canada or mexico. for example, the dr pepper trademark and formula is owned by coca-cola outside north america. adverse events affecting those third parties or their products could also negatively impact our brands.
in some cases, we license rights to distribute third-party products. the licensor may be able to terminate the license arrangement upon an agreed period of notice, in some cases without payment to us of any termination fee. the termination of any material license arrangement could adversely affect our business and financial performance.
table of contents risks related to our financial performance determinations in the future that a significant impairment of the value of our goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets has occurred could have a material adverse effect on our operating results.
as of december 31, 2022, we had $51,837 million of total assets, of which $20,072 million were goodwill and $23,183 million were other intangible assets. intangible assets include both definite and indefinite-lived intangible assets in connection with brands, trade names, acquired technology, customer relationships and contractual arrangements. we conduct impairment tests on goodwill and all indefinite-lived intangible assets annually, as of october 1, or more frequently if circumstances indicate that all or a portion of the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable.
the impairment tests require us to make an estimate of the fair value of our reporting units and other intangible assets. an impairment was recently recorded and could be recorded again as a result of changes in assumptions, estimates or circumstances, some of which are beyond our control. factors which could result in an impairment include, but are not limited to: (i) reduced demand for our products and/or the product category resulting in diminished long-term revenue growth; (ii) higher commodity or transportation prices; (iii) lower prices for our products or increased marketing as a result of increased competition; (iv) not achieving forecasted productivities; (v) significant disruptions to our operations as a result of both internal and external events; and (vi) changes in our discount rates, which could change due to factors such as movement in risk free interest rates, changes in general market interest rates and market beta volatility and changes to management's view of forecasted risk, among others. since a number of factors may influence determinations of fair value of intangible assets, we are unable to predict whether impairments of goodwill or other indefinite-lived intangibles will occur in the future. any such impairment would result in us recognizing a non-cash charge in our consolidated statements of income, which could adversely affect our results of operations and increase our effective tax rate.
our level of indebtedness could adversely affect us, including decreasing our business flexibility and increasing our interest expense.
in the future, we may be required to raise substantial additional financing to fund working capital, capital expenditures, the repayment or refinancing of our indebtedness, acquisitions or other general corporate requirements. our ability to arrange additional financing or refinancing will depend on, among other factors, our financial position and performance, as well as prevailing market conditions and other factors beyond our control. there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain additional financing or refinancing on terms acceptable to us or at all. if our financial performance does not meet current expectations, our ability to service our indebtedness may be adversely impacted.
additionally, in assessing our credit strength, credit rating agencies consider our capital structure and financial policies as well as our results of operations and financial position at the time. if our credit ratings were to be downgraded as a result of changes in our capital structure, changes in the credit rating agencies' methodologies in assessing our credit strength, the credit agencies' perception of the impact of credit market conditions on our current or future results of operations and financial position or for any other reason, our cost of borrowing could increase. furthermore, a significant downgrade in our credit ratings could limit a financial institution's willingness to participate in our accounts payable program and reduce the attractiveness of the accounts payable program to participating suppliers who may sell payment obligations from us to financial institutions. in addition, a significant downgrade in our credit ratings may reduce flexibility of our business to engage in certain transactions, such as the execution and renewal of certain leases.
we negotiate with our suppliers to extend our payment terms to decrease our cash conversion cycle and manage our working capital, and if suppliers are unwilling to meet our customary payment terms, it may limit the pool of potential suppliers. further, if a reduction in our payment terms with our suppliers occurs, our liquidity may be adversely affected.
as part of ongoing efforts to decrease our cash conversion cycle and maximize our working capital, we negotiate with our suppliers to optimize our terms and conditions, which includes the consideration of payment terms. as part of this process, we strive to seek 360 day payment terms in commercial negotiations with potential suppliers. excluding our suppliers who require cash at date of purchase or sale, our current payment terms with our suppliers generally range from 10 to 360 days.
if a potential supplier is unwilling to accept 360 day payment terms as a part of the commercial negotiation, we may remove them from consideration, which could limit the overall pool of potential suppliers for selection.
if, during the procurement process, suppliers are either replaced or a supplier's contract is renegotiated, our payment terms may be reduced. if our payment terms are reduced, our ability to maintain our cash conversion cycle to maximize our working capital, as well as our liquidity, may be adversely affected. additionally, due to these replacements or renegotiations, we may need to utilize various financing arrangements for short-term liquidity.
table of contents we cannot guarantee that our share repurchase program will be fully consummated or that our share repurchase program will enhance long-term stockholder value, and share repurchases could increase the volatility of the price of our stock and reduce our free cash flow.
in october 2021, our board of directors authorized the company to repurchase up to $4 billion of our outstanding common stock, beginning on january 1, 2022, potentially enabling us to return value to shareholders. our repurchase program does not obligate us to repurchase any specific dollar amount or to acquire any specific number of shares. our share repurchase program could affect the price of our stock and increase volatility and may be suspended or terminated at any time. we cannot guarantee that we will repurchase shares or conduct future share repurchase programs, and we cannot guarantee that any such programs will result in long-term increases to shareholder value.
additionally, significant changes in laws or regulations, including the inflation reduction act of 2022, effective august 16, 2022, which imposes a 1% excise tax on share repurchases that occur after december 31, 2022, may reduce our ability to take advantage of our share repurchase program.
the agreements that govern our indebtedness contain various covenants that impose restrictions on us and may affect our ability to operate our business.
the agreements that govern our indebtedness contain various affirmative and negative covenants that may, subject to certain significant exceptions, restrict our ability, including certain subsidiaries, to incur debt and our ability, including certain subsidiaries, to, among other things, have liens on our property, and/or merge or consolidate with any other person or sell or convey certain of our assets to any one person, and engage in certain sale and leaseback transactions. our ability, including certain subsidiaries, to comply with these provisions may be affected by events beyond our control. failure to comply with these covenants could result in an event of default, which, if not cured or waived, could accelerate our repayment obligations and could result in a default and acceleration under other agreements containing cross-default provisions. under these circumstances, we might not have sufficient funds or other resources to satisfy all of our obligations.
risks relating to labor and employment failure to recruit and retain qualified personnel, or failure to effectively manage changes in our workforce such as labor shortages, employee turnover, and increases in wages, could significantly impact our operations.
our future success depends upon the continued contributions of senior management and other key personnel and the ability to retain and motivate them. if we are unable to recruit, retain and motivate the senior management team and other key personnel sufficiently to support the projected growth and initiatives of our business, our business and financial performance may be adversely affected.
disruption in the global economy has exacerbated employee turnover and led to continued labor shortages, particularly in the market for frontline employees in the production and distribution environments. the labor force has been and may continue to be impacted by a number of factors related to macroeconomic and geopolitical uncertainty. additionally, competition in the labor marketplace for qualified employees has led to increased costs, such as higher wages in order to recruit and retain employees. a prolonged labor shortage or inflation in labor costs could have a significant impact on our business and financial performance.
we may not be able to renew collective bargaining agreements on satisfactory terms, or we could experience union activity, including labor disputes or work stoppages.
approximately 8,800 of our employees worldwide are covered by collective bargaining agreements. these agreements typically expire every three to four years at various dates. we may not be able to renew our collective bargaining agreements on satisfactory terms or at all. this could result in labor disputes, strikes or work stoppages, which could impair our ability to manufacture and distribute our products and result in a substantial loss of sales. the terms of existing, renewed or expanded agreements could also significantly increase our costs or negatively affect our ability to increase operational efficiency.
increases in our cost of employee benefits in the future could reduce our profitability.
our profitability is substantially affected by costs for employee health care, pension and other retirement programs and other benefits. in recent years, these costs have increased significantly due to factors such as increases in health care costs, declines in investment returns on pension assets and changes in discount rates used to calculate pension and related liabilities. these factors will continue to put pressure on our business and financial performance. although we will actively seek to control increases in costs, there can be no assurance that it will succeed in limiting future cost increases, and continued upward cost pressure could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial performance.
table of contents risks relating to our relationships with third parties we depend on a small number of large retailers for a significant portion of our sales.
food and beverage retailers in the u.s. have been consolidating, resulting in large, sophisticated retailers with increased buying power. they are in a better position to resist our price increases and demand lower prices and more favorable trade terms. to the extent we provide concessions or trade terms that are favorable to retailers, our respective margins would be reduced. retailers also have leverage to require us to provide increased marketing and promotional expenditures, including larger, more tailored promotional and product delivery programs, as well as to demand fines for late or incomplete product shipments. if we and our partners, including bottlers, distributors and licensees, do not successfully provide appropriate marketing, product, packaging, pricing and service to these retailers, our product availability, sales and margins could suffer. in addition, certain retailers make up a significant percentage of our products' retail volume, including volume sold by our bottlers and distributors. some retailers also offer their own private label products that compete with some of our brands. accordingly, the success of our business depends in part on our ability to maintain good relationships with key retail customers.
if we are unable to offer terms that are acceptable to our significant customers, or such customers determine that they need fewer inventories to service consumers, these customers could reduce purchases of our products or may increase purchases of products from competitors, which would harm our sales and profitability. furthermore, the loss of sales from a major retailer could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial performance.
we depend on third-party bottling and distribution companies for a significant portion of our business.
we license rights to third parties to bottle and distribute our products. net sales from our beverage concentrates segment represent sales of beverage concentrates to third-party bottling companies that we do not own. the beverage concentrates segment's operations generate a significant portion of our overall income from operations. some of these bottlers are also our direct competitors, or also bottle and distribute products for our competitors. the majority of these bottlers' business comes from selling either their own products or our competitors' products. in addition, some of the finished products we manufacture are distributed by third parties. as independent companies, these bottlers and distributors make their own business decisions. they may have the right to determine whether, and to what extent, they produce and distribute our products, our competitors' products and their own products. they may devote more resources to other products, prioritize their own products, or take other actions detrimental to our brands.
in most cases, they are able to terminate their bottling and distribution arrangements with us without cause. in some cases, the license agreements include buy-out rights that allow us to exit for a fee, and we may have additional limited termination rights. the termination of any material license arrangement could adversely affect our business and financial performance, and any disputes could be costly and divert management attention. we may need to increase support for our brands in certain territories to maintain our route to market and may not be able to pass price increases through to them. their financial condition could also be adversely affected by conditions beyond their control, and their business could suffer as a result. deteriorating economic conditions could negatively impact the financial viability of third-party bottlers.
failure to maintain strategic relationships with brand owners and private label brands could adversely impact our future growth and business, potentially resulting in the termination of those agreements.
in our coffee systems segment, we have entered into strategic relationships for the manufacturing, distribution, and sale of k-cup pods with partner customers, as well as with retailers for their private label brands. as independent companies, our strategic partners make their own business decisions which may not align with our interests. if we are unable to provide an appropriate mix of incentives to our strategic partners through a combination of premium performance and service, pricing, and marketing and advertising support, or if these strategic partners are not satisfied with our brand innovation and technological or other development efforts, they may take actions that adversely impact us, including entering into agreements with competing pod contract manufacturers or vertically integrating to manufacture their own k-cup pods. increasing competition among k-cup pod manufacturers and moving to vertical integration may result in price compression, which could have an adverse effect on our gross margins. the loss of strategic partners could also adversely impact our future profitability and growth, awareness of keurig brewers, our ability to attract additional branded or private label parties to do business with us or our ability to attract new consumers to buy keurig brewers.
in our packaged beverages segment, we have entered into strategic relationships for the manufacture and/or distribution of products from partner brand owners in emerging or fast-growing segments in which we may not currently have a brand presence. we are subject to a risk of our partner brands terminating their agreements with us, which could negatively affect our business and financial performance. within each distribution agreement, we have certain protections in case the partner brands terminate their agreements, such as a one-time termination payment.
table of contents we rely on the performance of a limited number of suppliers, manufacturers and order fulfillment companies for our brewers.
a small number of companies, located primarily in asia, manufacture the vast majority of our brewers, with a majority of the brewers we sell procured from one third-party brewer manufacturer. if these manufacturers are not able to perform, whether as a result of natural disaster, information technology failure, commercial or international trade dispute, or otherwise, or are not able to scale their manufacturing operations to match increasing consumer demand for our brewers at competitive costs, our overall results will be negatively affected.
general risk factors our financial results may be negatively impacted by recession, financial and credit market disruptions and other economic conditions.
changes in economic and financial conditions in the u.s., canada, mexico or other geographies where we do business may negatively impact consumer confidence and consumer spending, which could result in a reduction in our sales volume and/or switching to lower price offerings. we may be impacted by consumer price sensitivity associated with many of our products. similarly, disruptions in financial and credit markets worldwide may impact our ability to manage normal commercial relationships with customers, suppliers and creditors. these disruptions could have a negative impact on the ability of our customers to timely pay their obligations, thus reducing our cash flow, or the ability of our vendors to supply materials timely. additionally, these disruptions could have a negative effect on our ability to raise capital through the issuance of unsecured commercial paper or senior notes.
although we have no operations in russia or ukraine, we have experienced supply chain constraints and inflation in input costs, logistics, manufacturing and labor costs due to the impact of the conflict on the global economy. if continued, the conflict between russia and ukraine could result in additional supply chain disruptions, volatility in fuel and commodity prices, and significant fluctuations in foreign exchange rates and interest rates, any of which could adversely impact our results of operations.
we also face counterparty risk for our cash investments and derivative instruments. declines in the securities and credit markets could also affect our marketable securities and pension fund, which in turn could increase funding requirements.
deterioration of general macro-economic conditions could have a negative impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations and liquidity due to impacts on our suppliers, customers and operating costs.
our business depends on developing and maintaining close relationships with our suppliers and on our suppliers' ability and willingness to sell quality products to us at favorable prices and terms. many factors outside our control may harm these relationships and the ability or willingness of these suppliers to sell us products on favorable terms. such factors include a general decline in the economy and economic conditions and prolonged recessionary conditions. these events could negatively affect our suppliers' operations and make it difficult for them to obtain the credit lines or loans necessary to finance their operations in the short-term or long-term and meet our product requirements.
financial or operational difficulties that some of our suppliers may face, including their ability to access working capital, could also increase the cost of the products we purchase from them, the timing of settlement for our obligation to the supplier or our ability to source product from them. we might not be able to pass our increased costs onto our customers and, to the extent these difficulties impact the timing of settlement for our obligation to the supplier, we may have a decrease in our cash flow from operations and may have to use our various financing arrangements for short-term liquidity needs.
fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates may adversely affect our operating results.
while our operations are predominately in the u.s., we are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk with respect to our sales, expenses, profits, assets and liabilities denominated in the mexican peso, the canadian dollar and the euro, as well as other foreign currencies in which we transact business. as a result, our financial performance may be affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates. moreover, any favorable or unfavorable impacts to gross profit, gross margin and income from operations from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates are likely to be inconsistent year over year.
weather, natural disasters, water availability, and climate change or related legislation could adversely affect our business.
unseasonable or unusual weather, natural disasters or long-term climate changes could add volatility to commodity prices and have the potential to disrupt the availability of raw materials, energy and fuel, our ability to produce our products and may result in reduced demand for our products, which may have a negative effect on our business and financial performance.
table of contents global climate change poses a threat to communities, businesses, farmers and ecosystems across the world. climate change is already affecting the agricultural sector, and disruptions to crop growing conditions are expected to increase with extreme weather events, increasing temperatures, and changing water availability. water is the main ingredient in substantially all of our products. climate change may cause water scarcity and a deterioration of water quality in areas where we maintain operations. the competition for water among domestic, agricultural and manufacturing users is increasing in the countries where we operate, and as water becomes scarcer or the quality of the water deteriorates, we may incur increased production costs or face manufacturing constraints which could negatively affect our business and financial performance. even where water is widely available, water purification and waste treatment infrastructure limitations could increase costs or constrain our operations.
we are also faced with the impact of disruptions to crop growing conditions as a result of changing weather patterns, which can cause changes in geographical ranges of crops, as well as weeds, diseases and pests that affect those crops. these impacts may limit availability or increase the price volatility of key agricultural commodities, such as coffee, corn and tea, which are important sources of ingredients for our products.
concern over climate change, including global warming, has led to legislative and regulatory initiatives directed at limiting greenhouse gas emissions. for example, proposals that would impose mandatory requirements on greenhouse gas emissions continue to be considered by policy makers in the countries in which we will operate. laws enacted that directly or indirectly affect our production, distribution, packaging, cost of raw materials, fuel, ingredients and water could all negatively impact our business and financial results.
u.s. and international laws and regulations could adversely affect our business.
our products are subject to a variety of federal, state and local laws and regulations in the u.s., canada, mexico and other countries in which we conduct business. these laws and regulations apply to many aspects of our business including the manufacture, safety, sourcing, labeling, storing, transportation, marketing, advertising, distribution and sale of our products. other laws and regulations that may impact our business relate to competition, the environment, relations with distributors and retailers, employment, privacy, health and trade practices. our expanding international business will also expose us to economic factors, regulatory requirements, increasing competition and other risks associated with doing business in foreign countries. our international business is also subject to u.s. laws, regulations and policies, including anti-corruption and export laws and regulations.
violations of these laws or regulations in the manufacturing, safety, sourcing, labeling, storing, transportation, advertising, distribution and sale of our products could damage our reputation and/or result in criminal, civil or administrative actions with substantial financial penalties and operational limitations. in addition, any significant change in such laws or regulations or their interpretation, or the introduction of higher standards or more stringent laws or regulations, could result in increased compliance costs or capital expenditures or significant challenges to our ability to continue to produce and sell products that generate a significant portion of our sales and profits. for example, changes in laws related to packaging materials or the use or disposal of plastics or special taxes on soft drinks or ingredients could increase our costs. in addition, changes in legislation imposing tariffs on or restricting the importation of our products or raw materials required to make our products, restricting the sale of k-cup pods, requiring compostability of k-cup pods, limiting the ability of consumers to put k-cup pods into municipal waste or recycling streams could, at least for some period of time, cut off a significant source of our sales and profits. changes in bottle deposit and recycling laws, including requiring manufacturers of k-cup pods to pay responsible producer or other fees to either governmental or non-governmental entities in connection with the collection, recycling, or disposition of k-cup pods, may support our corporate responsibility objectives and goals, but could increase our costs.
we depend on key information systems and third-party service providers.
we depend on key information systems to accurately and efficiently transact our business, provide information to management and prepare financial reports. we rely on third-party providers for a number of key information systems and business processing services, including hosting, collecting, storing and transmitting our primary data center and processing various accounting and transactional services. an offshore shared service center managed by third parties provides lower cost services to conduct our business, including a number of accounting, tax, it programming and monitoring services, and computing functions. if any of these third-party service providers or vendors do not perform effectively, or if we fail to adequately monitor their performance (including compliance with service level agreements or regulatory or legal requirements), we may have to incur additional costs to correct errors made by such service providers, our reputation could be harmed or we could be subject to litigation, claims, legal or regulatory proceedings, inquiries or investigations. in addition, the management of multiple third-party service providers increases operational complexity and decreases our control.
our information systems contain proprietary and other confidential information related to our business. these systems and services are vulnerable to interruptions or other failures resulting from, among other things, natural disasters, terrorist attacks, software, equipment or telecommunications failures, processing errors, computer viruses, other security issues or supplier defaults. security, backup and disaster recovery measures may not be adequate or implemented properly to avoid such disruptions or failures. any disruption or failure of these systems or services could cause substantial errors, processing inefficiencies, security breaches, inability to use the systems or process transactions, loss of customers or other business disruptions, all of which could negatively affect our business and financial performance.
table of contents in addition, because we primarily accept debit and credit cards for payment in our e-commerce channel, we are subject to the pci standard, issued by the payment card industry security standards council. the pci standard contains compliance guidelines with regard to our security surrounding the physical and electronic storage, processing and transmission of cardholder data. we are in compliance with the pci standard. however, complying with the pci standard and implementing related procedures, technology and information security measures requires significant resources and ongoing attention. costs and potential problems and interruptions associated with the implementation of new or upgraded systems and technology, or the maintenance and support of existing systems and technology, to maintain compliance with the pci standard could also disrupt or reduce the efficiency of our operations. further, even though we are compliant with the pci standard, we still may not be able to prevent security breaches. any material interruptions or failures in our payment-related systems could negatively affect our business and financial performance.
in addition, some of our commercial partners may receive or store information provided by us or our users through their websites, including information entrusted to them by customers. if we or these third-party commercial partners fail to adopt or adhere to adequate information security practices, or fail to comply with their respective online policies, or in the event of a breach of our networks, our users' data and customer information may be improperly accessed, used or disclosed.
as cybersecurity attacks continue to evolve and increase, our information systems and those of our third party service providers have been and may in the future be penetrated or compromised by internal and external parties intent on extracting confidential information, disrupting business processes or corrupting information. these risks could arise from external parties or from acts or omissions of internal or service provider personnel. such unauthorized access could disrupt our business and could result in the loss of assets, litigation, regulatory actions or investigations, remediation costs, damage to our reputation and failure to retain or attract customers following such an event, which could adversely affect our business.
our use of information technology and third party service providers exposes us to cybersecurity breaches and other business disruptions that could adversely affect us.
we use information technology and third party service providers to support our global business processes and activities, including supporting critical business operations; communicating with our suppliers, customers and employees; maintaining financial information and effective accounting processes and financial and disclosure controls; engaging in mergers and acquisitions and other corporate transactions; conducting research and development activities; meeting regulatory, legal and tax requirements; and executing various digital marketing and consumer promotion activities. global shared service centers managed by third parties provide an increasing amount of services to conduct our business, including a number of accounting, internal control, information technology, human resources and computing functions.
continuity of business applications and services has been, and may in the future be, disrupted by events such as infection by viruses or malware. our continuity of business applications and operations has been, and may in the future be, also disrupted by other cybersecurity attacks; issues with or errors in systems' maintenance or security; migration of applications to the cloud; power outages; hardware or software failures; denial of service; telecommunication failures; natural disasters; terrorist attacks; and other catastrophic occurrences. further, cybersecurity breaches of our or third party systems, whether from circumvention of security systems, denial-of-service attacks or other cyberattacks, hacking, phishing attacks, computer viruses, ransomware or malware, employee or insider error, malfeasance, social engineering, physical breaches or other actions may cause confidential information belonging to us or our employees, customers, consumers, partners, suppliers, or governmental or regulatory authorities to be misused or breached. when risks such as these materialize, the need for us to coordinate with various third party service providers and for third party service providers to coordinate amongst themselves might make it more challenging to resolve the related issues. additionally, in the event of a cybersecurity breach, confidential information that we process and maintain about our employees or consumers through our e-commerce platform could potentially be exposed. if our controls, disaster recovery and business continuity plans or those of our third party providers do not effectively respond to or resolve the issues related to any such disruptions in a timely manner, our product sales, financial condition and results of operations may be materially and adversely affected, and we might experience delays in reporting our financial results, loss of intellectual property, breach of confidential information and damage to our reputation or brands.
we continue to devote resources to network security, backup and disaster recovery, upgrading systems and networks, enhanced training and other security measures to protect our systems and data; we are also in the process of enhancing the monitoring and detection of threats in our environment. however, security measures cannot provide absolute security or guarantee that we will be successful in preventing or responding to every breach or disruption on a timely basis. in addition, due to the constantly evolving nature of security threats, we cannot predict the form and impact of any future incident, and the cost and operational expense of implementing, maintaining and enhancing protective measures to guard against increasingly complex and sophisticated cyber threats could increase significantly. although we maintain insurance coverage that may, subject to policy terms and conditions, cover certain aspects of a breach or disruption, such insurance coverage may be insufficient to cover all losses.
table of contents we regularly move data across national borders to conduct our operations and consequently are subject to a variety of continuously evolving and developing laws and regulations in numerous jurisdictions regarding privacy, data protection and data security, including those related to the collection, storage, handling, use, disclosure, transfer and security of personal data. privacy and data protection laws may be interpreted and applied differently from country to country and may create inconsistent or conflicting requirements. our efforts to comply with privacy and data protection laws may impose significant costs and challenges that are likely to increase over time, and we could incur substantial penalties or litigation related to violation of existing or future data privacy laws and regulations.
litigation or legal proceedings could expose us to significant liabilities and damage our reputation.
we have been, and in the future may be, a party to various litigation claims and legal proceedings that may include employment, tort, real estate, antitrust, environmental, recycling/sustainability, intellectual property, commercial, securities, false advertising, packaging, product labeling, consumer protection, discriminatory pricing and other claims. we have been, and in the future may be, a defendant in class action litigation, including litigation regarding employment practices, product labeling, including under california's "proposition 65," public statements and disclosures under securities laws, antitrust, advertising, consumer protection and wage and hour laws. plaintiffs in class action litigation may seek to recover amounts that are large and may be indeterminable for some period of time. we evaluate litigation claims and legal proceedings to assess the likelihood of unfavorable outcomes and estimate, if possible, the amount of potential losses. we will establish a reserve as appropriate based upon assessments and estimates in accordance with our accounting policies. we will base our assessments, estimates and disclosures on the information available to us at the time and rely on legal and management judgment. actual outcomes or losses may differ materially from assessments and estimates. costs to defend litigation claims and legal proceedings and the cost and any required actions arising out of actual settlements, judgments or resolutions of these claims and legal proceedings may negatively affect our business and financial performance. any adverse publicity resulting from allegations made in litigation claims or legal proceedings may also adversely affect our reputation, which in turn could adversely affect our results of operations.
fluctuations in our effective tax rate may result in volatility in our financial results.
we are subject to income taxes and non-income-based taxes in many u.s. and certain foreign jurisdictions. income tax expense includes a provision for uncertain tax positions. at any one time, many tax years are subject to audit by various taxing jurisdictions. as these audits and negotiations progress, events may occur that change our expectation about how the audit will ultimately be resolved. as a result, there could be ongoing variability in our quarterly and/or annual tax rates as events occur that cause a change in our provision for uncertain tax positions. in addition, our effective tax rate in any given financial statement period may be significantly impacted by changes in the mix and level of earnings or by changes to existing accounting rules, tax regulations or interpretations of existing law. further, tax legislation may be enacted in the future, domestically or abroad, that impacts our effective tax rate. changes in tax laws, regulations, related interpretations, and tax accounting standards in the u.s. and various foreign jurisdictions in which we operate may impact our effective tax rate and adversely affect our financial results.
failure to comply with applicable transfer pricing and similar regulations could harm our business and financial results.
in many countries, including the u.s., we are subject to transfer pricing and other tax regulations designed to ensure that appropriate levels of income are reported as earned and are taxed accordingly. although we believe that we are in substantial compliance with all applicable regulations and restrictions, we are subject to the risk that governmental authorities could audit our transfer pricing and related practices and assert that additional taxes are owed. in the event that the audits or assessments are concluded adversely to our positions, we may or may not be able to offset or mitigate the consolidated effect of foreign income tax assessments through the use of u.s. foreign tax credits. because the laws and regulations governing u.s. foreign tax credits are complex and subject to periodic legislative amendment, we cannot be sure that we will in fact be able to take advantage of any foreign tax credits in the future.

executive summary financial overview as reported, in millions (except diluted eps)
as adjusted, in millions (except diluted eps)
on october 6, 2022, we announced a strategic partnership with red bull, the iconic global energy brand, to sell and distribute red bull energy drink products in mexico, which began in the fourth quarter of 2022.
on november 9, 2022, we invested $51 million, inclusive of incremental third-party costs, in exchange for equity interests in athletic brewing, a leading non-alcoholic craft beer maker in the u.s.
on december 8, 2022, we announced a strategic partnership with nutrabolt, a global active health and wellness company, to sell and distribute c4 energy rtd beverages in the vast majority of our company-owned dsd territories. we invested $871 million, inclusive of incremental third-party costs, in exchange for an approximately 30% ownership interest in the company and expect to begin distributing c4 energy rtd beverages in early 2023.
as a result of our quarterly triggering events assessment and our annual impairment assessment, we recorded non-cash impairment charges of $472 million on indefinite-lived brands during the year ended december 31, 2022, led by bai and schweppes. refer to note 3 of the notes to our consolidated financial statements for further information.
uncertainties and trends affecting our business we believe the north american beverage market is influenced by certain key trends and uncertainties. refer to item 1a, risk factors, as well as the uncertainties and trends affecting liquidity section below, for more information about risks and uncertainties facing us.
some of these items, such as the ongoing covid-19 pandemic and the invasion of ukraine by russia, and the resulting impacts on the global economy, including supply chain constraints and labor shortages, have led to inflation in input costs, logistics, manufacturing and labor costs, which has further led to fluctuation in interest rates. during the year ended december 31, 2022, we have experienced supply chain disruptions and a significant inflationary impact compared to the prior year. these impacts have created headwinds for our industry that we expect to continue into 2023.
as a result of these inflationary pressures, we have increased the pricing on a number of our products across our portfolio. consequently, we may incur a reduction of volume or net sales, which, combined with the inflationary pressures, could impact our margins and operating results.
refer to note 5 of the notes to our consolidated financial statements and item 7a, quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk for management's discussion of how we manage our exposure to commodity risk.
impact of covid-19 on our financial statements the following table sets forth our reconciliation of significant covid-19-related expenses. employee compensation expense and employee protection costs, which impact our sg&a expenses and cost of sales, are included as the covid-19 item affecting comparability and are excluded in our adjusted financial measures. in addition, reported amounts under u.s. gaap also include additional costs, not included as the covid-19 item affecting comparability, as presented in tables below.

net sales. net sales increased $1,374 million, or 10.8%, to $14,057 million for the year ended december 31, 2022 compared to $12,683 million in the prior year. this performance reflected favorable net price realization across all segments totaling 10.6% and volume/mix growth of 0.5%. these benefits were slightly offset by unfavorable fx translation of 0.3%.
gross profit. gross profit increased $346 million, or 5.0%, to $7,323 million for the year ended december 31, 2022 compared to $6,977 million in the prior year. this performance primarily reflected the strong growth in net sales and the benefit of productivity, partially offset by broad-based inflation and an unfavorable change in unrealized commodity mark-to-market impacts of $152 million. gross margin decreased 290 bps versus the year ago period to 52.1%.
selling, general and administrative expenses. sg&a expenses increased $492 million, or 11.8%, to $4,645 million for the year ended december 31, 2022 compared to $4,153 million in the prior year. the increase reflected higher logistics costs, driven by both inflation and volume/mix impacts, increases in labor and other operating expenses, and an unfavorable comparison of unrealized mark-to-market losses of $55 million on commodity contracts.
impairment of intangible assets. impairment of intangible assets reflected non-cash impairment charges of $477 million primarily driven by bai and schweppes. refer to note 3 of the notes to our consolidated financial statements for further information.
gain on litigation settlement. gain on litigation settlement reflects the portion of the settlement payment from bodyarmor which was allocated to the gain on the full settlement of the existing claims against bodyarmor in the first quarter of 2022. refer to note 12 of the notes to our consolidated financial statements for further information.
other operating income, net. other operating income, net increased $35 million for the year ended december 31, 2022 compared to the prior year, primarily driven by the portion of the settlement payment from bodyarmor which was allocated to the recovery of legal fees incurred during the litigation process and a business interruption insurance recovery.
income from operations. income from operations decreased $289 million, or 10.0%, to $2,605 million for the year ended december 31, 2022 compared to $2,894 million in the prior year, primarily driven by the non-cash impairment charges of $477 million, which was partially offset by the gain on the litigation settlement. other factors include higher sg&a expenses, partially offset by increased gross profit. operating margin decreased 430 bps versus the year ago period to 18.5%.
interest expense. interest expense increased $193 million, or 38.6%, to $693 million for the year ended december 31, 2022 compared to $500 million for the prior year. this change was primarily driven by the unfavorable comparison of unrealized mark-to-market losses of $255 million on interest rate contracts, which was partially offset by reduced interest expense on our senior unsecured notes as a result of our strategic refinancing initiatives.
loss on early extinguishment of debt. loss on early extinguishment of debt reflected an unfavorable change of $112 million, with a loss of $217 million during the year ended december 31, 2022 related to our 2022 strategic refinancing and our early retirement of our 2038 notes, the 2021 364-day credit agreement and the kdp revolver, as compared to a loss of $105 million in the prior year associated with our 2021 strategic refinancing.
gain on sale of equity method investment. for the years ended december 31, 2022 and 2021 we recorded $50 million and $524 million, respectively, for the sale of our equity method investment in bodyarmor. the amount recorded in 2022 represents the portion of the settlement payment from bodyarmor that was allocated to the satisfaction of the holdback amount owed to us. refer to note 12 of the notes to our consolidated financial statements for further information.
impairment of investments and note receivable. impairment on investments and note receivable reflected non-cash impairment charges of $12 million and $17 million for the years ended december 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, associated with the wind-down of bedford. refer to note 12 of the notes to our consolidated financial statements for further information.
effective tax rate. the effective tax rate decreased 680 bps to 16.5% for the year ended december 31, 2022, compared to 23.3% in the prior year, primarily driven by the revaluation of state deferred tax liabilities due to legislative changes and the favorable mix of our incremental income in low tax jurisdictions in the year.
net income attributable to kdp. net income attributable to kdp decreased $710 million, or 33.1%, to $1,436 million for the year ended december 31, 2022 as compared to $2,146 million in the prior year, primarily driven by the unfavorable change in gain on sale of our equity method investment in bodyarmor, lower income from operations, increased interest expense, and the unfavorable change in loss on early extinguishment of debt, partially offset by the decrease in our effective tax rate.
diluted eps. diluted eps decreased 32.7% to $1.01 per diluted share as compared to $1.50 in the prior year.

net sales. net sales increased 5.6% to $4,982 million for the year ended december 31, 2022 compared to $4,716 million in the prior year, driven by favorable net price realization of 7.0%, partially offset by volume/mix declines of 0.8% and unfavorable fx translation of 0.6%.
income from operations. income from operations decreased $130 million, or 9.0%, to $1,316 million for the year ended december 31, 2022, compared to $1,446 million in the prior year, as a result of broad-based inflation, particularly in green coffee and packaging and increases in other operating expenses. these decreases were partially offset by the benefits of net sales growth, productivity, favorable asset sale-leaseback activity of $44 million in the coffee systems segment associated with our strategic asset investment program and a business interruption insurance recovery. operating margin declined 430 bps versus the prior year to 26.4%, primarily due to the aforementioned inflationary headwinds.

net sales. net sales increased 12.3% to $6,607 million in the year ended december 31, 2022, compared to $5,882 million in the prior year, driven by favorable net price realization of 12.1% and volume/mix growth of 0.3%, slightly offset by unfavorable fx translation of 0.1%.
income from operations. income from operations decreased $9 million, or 0.9%, to $1,014 million for the year ended december 31, 2022 compared to $1,023 million for the prior year, primarily driven by the $316 million non-cash impairment charges in the segment, predominantly related to bai, which were partially offset by the gain on the settlement of litigation with bodyarmor of $271 million. other offsetting factors included the benefits of net sales growth, productivity, and reduced restructuring and integration expense, partially offset by broad-based inflation, higher costs to serve the ongoing strong consumer demand, and the unfavorable year-over-year comparison in the packaged beverages segment of asset sale-leaseback activity associated with our strategic asset investment program. operating margin declined 210 bps versus the prior year to 15.3%.

net sales. net sales grew 24.0% to $743 million for the year ended december 31, 2022, compared to $599 million in the prior year, reflecting favorable net price realization of 13.9%, volume/mix growth of 9.1%, and favorable fx translation of 1.0%.
income from operations.  income from operations increased $25 million, or 18.8%, to $158 million for the year ended december 31, 2022 compared to $133 million in the prior year, driven by the benefits of net sales growth and productivity, partially offset by the impacts of broad-based inflation, logistics and operating costs associated with incremental volumes, and increased marketing expense. operating margin decreased 90 bps versus the prior year to 21.3%.
liquidity and capital resources overview we believe our financial condition and liquidity remain strong. we continue to manage all aspects of our business, including, but not limited to, monitoring the financial health of our customers, suppliers and other third-party relationships, implementing cost management strategies through our productivity initiatives, and developing new opportunities for growth such as innovation and agreements with partners to distribute brands that are accretive to our portfolio.
the following summarizes our cash activity for the years ended december 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020:
cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents decreased $33 million from december 31, 2021 to december 31, 2022 primarily as a result of our investment in nutrabolt, offset by proceeds from the cash settlement with bodyarmor.
cash generated by our foreign operations is generally repatriated to the u.s. periodically as working capital funding requirements where allowed. we do not expect restrictions or taxes on repatriation of cash held outside the u.s. to have a material effect on our overall business, liquidity, financial condition or results of operations for the foreseeable future .

additionally, in april 2022, we chose to undertake our 2022 strategic refinancing, issuing approximately $3 billion of senior unsecured notes and using the net proceeds to voluntarily prepay and retire several tranches of existing senior unsecured notes with higher interest rates, which reduced our overall interest payments and our annual cash requirements. as part of this transaction, we additionally unwound approximately $1.5 billion of notional amount of our outstanding designated forward starting swaps and received cash proceeds of approximately $125 million. refer to note 4 of the notes to our consolidated financial statements for further information about the 2022 strategic refinancing initiative.
principal sources of capital resources our principal sources of liquidity are our existing cash and cash equivalents, cash generated from our operations and borrowing capacity currently available under our 2022 revolving credit agreement. additionally, we have an uncommitted commercial paper program where we can issue unsecured commercial paper notes on a private placement basis. based on our current and anticipated level of operations, we believe that our operating cash flows will be sufficient to meet our anticipated obligations for the next twelve months. to the extent that our operating cash flows are not sufficient to meet our liquidity needs, we may utilize cash on hand or amounts available under our financing arrangements, if necessary.
sources of liquidity - operations net cash provided by operating activities decreased $37 million for the year ended december 31, 2022, as compared to the year ended december 31, 2021, driven by the decrease in net income adjusted for non-cash items and the impact of the change in working capital.
cash conversion cycle our cash conversion cycle is defined as dio and dso less dpo. the calculation of each component of the cash conversion cycle is provided below:
component         calculation (on a trailing twelve month basis)
dio               (average inventory divided by cost of sales) * number of days in the period dso               (accounts receivable divided by net sales) * number of days in the period dpo               (accounts payable * number of days in the period) divided by cost of sales and sg&amp;a expenses the following table summarizes our cash conversion cycle.
december 31,
2022                      2021
dio                                         68                        58
dso                                         39                        33
dpo                                        167                       160
cash conversion cycle                     (60)                      (69)
our cash conversion cycle increased 9 days to approximately (60) days as of december 31, 2022 as compared to (69) days as of december 31, 2021. the increases in dso and dpo were primarily driven by rising inflation during the year, and the increase in dio reflects our efforts to restore inventory to meet customer service levels.
accounts payable program as part of our ongoing efforts to improve our cash flow and related liquidity, we work with our suppliers to optimize our terms and conditions, which include the extension of payment terms. excluding our suppliers who require cash at date of purchase or sale, our current payment terms with our suppliers generally range from 10 to 360 days. we also enter into agreements with third party administrators to allow participating suppliers to track payment obligations from us, and if voluntarily elected by the supplier, sell payment obligations from us to financial institutions. suppliers can sell one or more of our payment obligations at their sole discretion and our rights and obligations to our suppliers are not impacted. we have no economic interest in a supplier's decision to enter into these agreements and no direct financial relationship with the financial institutions. our obligations to our suppliers, including amounts due and scheduled payment terms, are not impacted.
we have been informed by the third party administrators that as of december 31, 2022 and december 31, 2021, $3,839 million and $3,194 million, respectively, of our outstanding payment obligations were voluntarily elected by the supplier and sold to financial institutions. the amounts settled through the program and paid to the financial institutions were $3,935 million, $3,331 million and $2,770 million for the years ended december 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively.
impact of the cares act beginning in the second quarter of 2020, we deferred payments of employer-related payroll taxes as allowed under the cares act. payment of at least 50% of the deferred amount was due on january 3, 2022, with the remainder due by january 3, 2023. we deferred a total of $59 million in such payments since the cares act was implemented, and we timely paid approximately $30 million as of january 3, 2022 and the remainder as of january 3, 2023.
sources of liquidity - financing in february 2022, we terminated our 2021 364-day credit agreement and our kdp revolver and replaced them with the 2022 revolving credit agreement, which provides for a $4 billion revolving credit facility.
in april 2022, we undertook our 2022 strategic refinancing and issued a $3 billion aggregate face value of notes, consisting of the 2029 notes, the 2032 notes, and the 2052 notes. the proceeds from the issuance were used to voluntarily prepay and retire the remaining 2023 merger notes and to tender portions of the 2025 merger notes, the 2028 merger notes, the 2038 merger notes, and the 2048 merger notes.
we have a commercial paper program, under which we may issue unsecured commercial paper notes on a private placement basis up to a maximum aggregate amount outstanding at any time of $2,400 million. as of december 31, 2022, we had borrowings of $399 million outstanding.
we also have an active shelf registration statement, filed with the sec on august 19, 2022, which allows us to issue an indeterminate number or amount of common stock, preferred stock, debt securities and warrants from time to time in one or more offerings at the direction of our board of directors.
refer to note 4 of the notes to our consolidated financial statements for management's discussion of our financing arrangements.
sources of liquidity - asset sale-leaseback transactions we have leveraged our strategic asset investment program to create value from certain assets to enable reinvestment in kdp. these transactions are accounted for as sale-leaseback transactions. we received $168 million, $102 million, and $200 million of net cash proceeds from our strategic asset investment program during the years ended december 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively, which are included in proceeds from sales of property, plant and equipment in the consolidated statements of cash flows.
debt ratings as of december 31, 2022, our credit ratings were as follows:
rating agency        long-term debt rating         commercial paper rating       outlook        date of last change moody's              baa2                          p-2                           stable         february 26, 2021

these debt and commercial paper ratings impact the interest we pay on our financing arrangements. a downgrade of one or both of our debt and commercial paper ratings could increase our interest expense and decrease the cash available to fund anticipated obligations. as of december 31, 2022, we were in compliance with all debt covenants and we have no reason to believe that we will be unable to satisfy these covenants.
libor considerations in 2017, the u.k. financial conduct authority announced that libor will no longer be published after 2021. in the u.s., the alternative reference rates committee selected the sofr as the preferred alternative reference rate to libor. certain libor tenors will continue to be published through june 30, 2023.
we have a number of financing arrangements which incorporate libor as a benchmark rate and which extend past 2022. the agreements related to such financing arrangements use libor tenors which will continue to be published through june 30, 2023. additionally, these agreements contain provisions for alternative reference rates. we do not expect a significant change to our cost of debt as a result of the transition from libor to an alternative reference rate.
principal uses of capital resources over the past several years, our principal uses of our capital resources were deleveraging, providing shareholder return to our investors through regular quarterly dividends, and investing in kdp to capture market share and drive growth through innovation and routes to market.
now that we have met our post-merger goals, we plan to further reduce our leverage ratio. we also plan to invest in inorganic value creation through m&a, including portfolio expansion, distribution scale, geographic expansion, and new capabilities. in addition to m&a, we have repurchased shares of our outstanding common stock, as described below.
deleveraging and other debt repayments during the year ended december 31, 2022, we made net debt repayments of $115 million, primarily driven by the redemption and retirement of the remainder of our 2023 merger notes and 2038 notes, as well as the tender of portions of the 2025 merger notes, the 2028 merger notes, the 2038 merger notes, and the 2048 merger notes.
regular quarterly dividends for the year ended december 31, 2022, we have declared total dividends of $0.775 per share, versus $0.7125 per share for the year ended december 31, 2021.
repurchases of common stock our board authorized a four-year share repurchase program of up to $4 billion of our outstanding common stock potentially enabling us to return value to shareholders. we repurchased and retired $379 million of common stock during the year ended december 31, 2022.
capital expenditures we are investing in state-of-the-art manufacturing and warehousing facilities, including expansive investments in facilities in newbridge, ireland; spartanburg, south carolina; and allentown, pennsylvania, in 2022 and 2021, in order to optimize our supply chain network.
purchases of property, plant and equipment were $353 million, $423 million and $461 million for the years ended december 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. capital expenditures, which includes both purchases of property, plant and equipment and amounts included in accounts payable and accrued expenses, for the years ended december 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020 primarily related to the manufacturing and warehousing facilities discussed above. capital expenditures included in accounts payable and accrued expenses were $213 million, $189 million and $280 million for the years ended december 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively, which primarily related to these investments.
investments in unconsolidated affiliates from time to time, we expect to invest in beverage startup companies or in brand ownership companies to grow our presence in certain product categories, or enter into various licensing and distribution agreements to expand our product portfolio. our investments in beverage startup companies generally involve acquiring a minority interest in equity securities of a company, in certain cases with a protected path to ownership at our future option. during the year ended december 31, 2022, we invested $972 million in exchange for equity interests in nutrabolt, tractor and athletic brewing.
purchases of intangible assets we have invested in the expansion of our dsd network through transactions with strategic independent bottlers to ensure competitive distribution scale for our brands. from time to time, we additionally acquire brand ownership companies to expand our portfolio. these transactions are generally accounted for as an asset acquisition, as the majority of the transaction price represents the acquisition of an intangible asset. purchases of intangible assets were $45 million, $32 million and $56 million for the years ended december 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively.
residual value guarantees we have a number of leasing arrangements and one licensing arrangement with special purpose entities associated with the same sponsor. each one of these arrangements contain a residual value guarantee. as of december 31, 2022, we have not recorded any liabilities as it is not probable that we will have to make any payments required under the residual value guarantee. refer to note 19 of the notes to our consolidated financial statements for further information.
uncertainties and trends affecting liquidity and capital resources disruptions in financial and credit markets, including those caused by inflation due to global economic uncertainty and the associated rise in interest rates, may impact our ability to manage normal commercial relationships with our customers, suppliers and creditors. these disruptions could have a negative impact on the ability of our customers to timely pay their obligations to us, thus reducing our cash flow, or the ability of our vendors to timely supply materials.
customer and consumer demand for our products may also be impacted by the risk factors discussed under "risk factors" in part 1, item 1a of our annual report, as well as subsequent filings with the sec, that could have a material effect on production, delivery and consumption of our products, which could result in a reduction in our sales volume.
we believe that the following events, trends and uncertainties may also impact liquidity:
‚Ä¢our ability to either repay existing debt maturities through cash flow from operations or refinance through future issuances of senior unsecured notes;
‚Ä¢our ability to access and/or renew our committed financing arrangements;
‚Ä¢a significant downgrade in our credit ratings could limit i) our ability to issue debt at terms that are favorable to us, or ii) a financial institution's willingness to participate in our accounts payable program and reduce the attractiveness of the accounts payable program to participating suppliers who may sell payment obligations from us to financial institutions, which could impact our accounts payable program;
‚Ä¢our continued payment of regular quarterly dividends;
‚Ä¢future opportunistic repurchases of our common stock or special dividends to drive total shareholder return;
‚Ä¢our continued capital expenditures;
‚Ä¢future equity investments;
‚Ä¢seasonality of our operating cash flows, which could impact short-term liquidity;
‚Ä¢our ability to issue unsecured uncommitted commercial paper notes on a private placement basis up to a maximum aggregate amount outstanding at any time of $2,400 million;
‚Ä¢future mergers or acquisitions, which may include brand ownership companies, regional bottling companies, distributors and/or distribution rights to further extend our geographic coverage; and
‚Ä¢fluctuations in our tax obligations.
critical accounting estimates the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements in conformity with u.s. gaap requires the use of estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses. critical accounting estimates are both fundamental to the portrayal of a company's financial condition and results and require difficult, subjective or complex estimates and assessments. these estimates and judgments are based on historical experience, future expectations and other factors and assumptions we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. the most significant estimates and judgments are reviewed on an ongoing basis and revised when necessary. we have not made any material changes in the accounting methodology we use to assess or measure our critical accounting estimates. we have identified the items described below as our critical accounting estimates. we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions we use in our critical accounting estimates. however, if actual results are not consistent with our estimates or assumptions, we may be exposed to gains or losses that could be material to our consolidated financial statements. see note 2 of the notes to our consolidated financial statements for a discussion of these and other accounting policies.
goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets we conduct tests for impairment of our goodwill and our other indefinite lived intangible assets annually, as of october 1, or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate the carrying amount may not be recoverable. we use present value and other valuation techniques to make this assessment. if the carrying amount of goodwill or an intangible asset exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess. for purposes of impairment testing, we assign goodwill to the reporting unit that benefits from the synergies arising from each business combination, and we also assign indefinite lived intangible assets to our reporting units.
effective january 1, 2021, we modified our internal reporting and operating segments to reflect changes in the executive leadership team to further enhance speed-to-market and decision effectiveness. although this did not change our reportable segments, our reporting units and operating segments were redefined. for 2022 and 2021, we defined our six reporting units as follows:
reportable segments           reporting units packaged beverages            dsd wd coffee systems                coffee systems beverage concentrates         branded concentrates fountain foodservice latin america beverages       latin america beverages for both goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets, we have the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether the fair value of either the reporting unit or indefinite lived intangible asset is "more likely than not" less than its carrying value, also known as a step 0 analysis. if a quantitative analysis is required, the following would be required:
‚Ä¢the impairment test for indefinite lived intangible assets encompasses calculating a fair value of an indefinite lived intangible asset and comparing the fair value to its carrying value. if the carrying value exceeds the estimated fair value, impairment is recorded.
‚Ä¢the impairment tests for goodwill include comparing fair value of the respective reporting unit with its carrying value, including goodwill and considering any indefinite lived intangible asset impairment charges.
as of october 1, 2022, we performed a quantitative analysis for goodwill and certain indefinite lived brand assets, whereby we used an income approach, or in some cases a combination of income and market based approaches, to determine the fair value of our assets, as well as an overall consideration of market capitalization and enterprise value. we performed a qualitative step 0 analysis for other indefinite lived intangible assets, including certain brands, trade names, contractual arrangements, and distribution rights. these types of analyses contain uncertainties because they require management to make assumptions and to apply judgment to estimate industry and economic factors and the profitability of future business strategies. these assumptions could be negatively impacted by various risks discussed in item 1a, risk factors, in this annual report on form 10-k.
critical assumptions for quantitative analyses include revenue growth and profit performance over the next five year period, as well as an appropriate discount rate and long-term growth rate, as applicable. discount rates are based on a weighted average cost of equity and cost of debt, adjusted with various risk premiums. long-term growth rates are based on the long-term inflation forecast, industry growth and the long-term economic growth potential.
the following table provides the range of rates used in the analysis as of october 1, 2022:
rate                                   minimum                      maximum discount rates                7.3                %                10.3    %

revenue recognition we recognize revenue when performance obligations under the terms of a contract with the customer are satisfied. accruals for customer incentives, sales returns and marketing programs are established for the expected payout based on contractual terms, volume-based metrics and/or historical trends.
our customer incentives, sales returns and marketing accrual methodology contains uncertainties because it requires management to make assumptions and to apply judgment regarding our contractual terms in order to estimate our customer participation and volume performance levels which impact the expense recognition. our estimates are based primarily on a combination of known or historical transaction experiences. differences between estimated expenses and actual costs are normally insignificant and are recognized to earnings in the period differences are determined.
additionally, judgment is required to ensure the classification of the spend is correctly recorded as either a reduction from gross sales or advertising and marketing expense, which is a component of our sg&a expenses.
a 10% change in the accrual for our customer incentives, sales returns and marketing programs would have affected our income from operations by $50 million for the year ended december 31, 2022.
income taxes we establish income tax liabilities to remove some or all of the income tax benefit of any of our income tax positions based upon one of the following:
‚Ä¢the tax position is not "more likely than not" to be sustained,
‚Ä¢the tax position is "more likely than not" to be sustained, but for a lesser amount, or
‚Ä¢the tax position is "more likely than not" to be sustained, but not in the financial period in which the tax position was originally taken.
our liability for uncertain tax positions contains uncertainties because management is required to make assumptions and to apply judgment to estimate the exposures associated with our various tax positions.
our income tax returns, like those of most companies, are periodically audited by domestic and foreign tax authorities. these audits include questions regarding our tax positions, including the timing and amount of deductions and the allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions. as these audits progress, events may occur that cause us to change our liability for uncertain tax positions. to the extent we prevail in matters for which a liability for uncertain tax positions has been established, or are required to pay amounts in excess of our established liability, our effective tax rate in a given financial statement period could be materially affected. an unfavorable tax settlement generally would require use of our cash and may result in an increase in our effective tax rate in the period of resolution. a favorable tax settlement may be recognized as a reduction in our effective tax rate in the period of resolution.
we also assess the likelihood of realizing our deferred tax assets. valuation allowances reduce deferred tax assets to the amount more likely than not to be realized. we base our judgment of the recoverability of our deferred tax assets primarily on historical earnings, our estimate of current and expected future earnings and prudent and feasible tax planning strategies.
if results differ from our assumptions, a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets may be increased or decreased which would impact our effective tax rate.
business combinations we record acquisitions using the purchase method of accounting. all of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed are recorded at fair value as of the acquisition date. the excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair values of the net tangible and intangible assets acquired is recorded as goodwill.
the application of the purchase method of accounting for business combinations requires management to make significant estimates and assumptions in the determination of the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed, in order to properly allocate purchase price consideration between assets that are depreciated and amortized from goodwill. the fair value assigned to tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed are based on management's estimates and assumptions, as well as other information compiled by management, including valuations that utilize customary valuation procedures and techniques. significant assumptions and estimates include, but are not limited to, the cash flows that an asset is expected to generate in the future, the appropriate weighted-average cost of capital, and the cost savings expected to be derived from acquiring an asset, if applicable.
if the actual results differ from the estimates and judgments used in these estimates, the amounts recorded in the consolidated financial statements may be exposed to potential impairment of the intangible assets and goodwill, as discussed in the goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets critical accounting estimate section above.

non-gaap financial measures to supplement the consolidated financial statements presented in accordance with u.s. gaap, we have presented for certain constant currency adjusted or adjusted financial measures for the years ended december 31, 2022 and 2021, which are considered non-gaap financial measures. the non-gaap financial measures provided should be viewed in addition to, and not as an alternative for, results prepared in accordance with u.s. gaap. the non-gaap financial measures presented may differ from similarly titled non-gaap financial measures presented by other companies, and other companies may not define these non-gaap financial measures in the same way. the non-gaap financial measures are not substitutes for their comparable u.s. gaap financial measures, such as income from operations, net income, diluted eps or other measures prescribed by u.s. gaap, and there are limitations to using non-gaap financial measures. we use these non-gaap financial measures, in addition to u.s. gaap financial measures, to evaluate our operating and financial performance and to compare such performance to that of prior periods and to the performance of our competitors. additionally, we use these non-gaap financial measures in making operational and financial decisions and in our budgeting and planning process. we believe that providing these non-gaap financial measures to investors helps investors evaluate our operating performance, profitability and business trends in a way that is consistent with how management evaluates such performance and consistent with guidance previously provided by us. the non-gaap measures are defined as follows:
adjusted: defined as certain financial statement captions and metrics adjusted for certain items affecting comparability.
items affecting comparability: defined as certain items that are excluded for comparison to prior year periods, adjusted for the tax impact as applicable. tax impact is determined based upon an approximate rate for each item. for each period, management adjusts for (i) the unrealized mark-to-market impact of derivative instruments not designated as hedges in accordance with u.s. gaap that do not have an offsetting risk reflected within the financial results, as well as the unrealized mark-to-market impact of our vita coco investment; (ii) the amortization associated with definite-lived intangible assets; (iii) the amortization of the deferred financing costs associated with the dps merger; (iv) the amortization of the fair value adjustment of the senior unsecured notes obtained as a result of the dps merger; (v) stock compensation expense and the associated windfall tax benefit attributable to the matching awards made to employees who made an initial investment in kdp; (vi) non-cash changes in deferred tax liabilities related to goodwill and other intangible assets as a result of tax rate or apportionment changes; and (vii) other certain items that are excluded for comparison purposes to prior year periods.

constant currency adjusted results of operations year ended december 31, 2022 compared to year ended december 31, 2021
the following discussion of our results for the year ended december 31, 2022 is presented on a constant currency adjusted basis. these adjusted financial results are calculated on a constant currency basis by converting our current-period local currency financial results using the prior-period fx rates.
consolidated operations constant currency net sales. constant currency net sales increased 11.1% in the year ended december 31, 2022 compared to the prior year, driven by favorable net price realization of 10.6% and volume/mix growth of 0.5%.
constant currency adjusted income from operations. constant currency adjusted income from operations increased 3.7% compared to the prior year, primarily driven by the strong growth in net sales and the benefit of productivity. these benefits were partially offset by the impact of broad-based inflation and increases in other operating costs.
constant currency adjusted interest expense. constant currency adjusted interest expense decreased 11.9% compared to the prior year, driven by reduced interest expense on our senior unsecured notes as a result of our strategic refinancing initiatives.
constant currency adjusted effective tax rate. the constant currency adjusted effective tax rate was 22.6% for the year ended december 31, 2022 compared to 22.7% for the prior year, primarily driven by our incremental income in low tax jurisdictions in the current year, mostly offset by the unfavorable comparison to the tax benefit received in the prior year from the release of our valuation allowance against our u.s. foreign tax credit carryforwards.
constant currency adjusted net income attributable to kdp. constant currency adjusted net income attributable to kdp increased 5.4% compared to the prior year, primarily driven by income from operations growth and lower interest expense.
constant currency adjusted diluted eps. constant currency adjusted diluted eps increased approximately 5.0% over the prior year.
results of operations by segment coffee systems constant currency net sales. constant currency net sales increased 6.2%, driven by higher net price realization of 7.0%, partially offset by unfavorable volume/mix of 0.8%.
constant currency adjusted income from operations.  constant currency adjusted income from operations for the year ended december 31, 2022 decreased 7.5% compared to the prior year period, as a result of broad-based inflation, particularly in green coffee and increases in other operating expenses. these decreases were partially offset by the benefits of net sales growth, productivity, favorable asset sale-leaseback activity in the coffee systems segment associated with our strategic asset investment program and a business interruption insurance recovery.
packaged beverages constant currency net sales. constant currency net sales increased 12.4%, reflecting favorable net price realization of 12.1% and volume/mix growth of 0.3%.
constant currency adjusted income from operations. constant currency adjusted income from operations for the year ended december 31, 2022 increased 1.2% compared to the prior year period, driven by the benefits of net sales growth and increased productivity. these benefits were partially offset by broad-based inflation, higher costs to serve the ongoing strong consumer demand, and the unfavorable year-over-year comparison in the packaged beverages segment of asset sale-leaseback activity associated with our strategic asset investment program.
beverage concentrates constant currency net sales. constant currency net sales increased 16.4%, reflecting higher net price realization of 14.7% and volume/mix growth of 1.7%.
constant currency adjusted income from operations. constant currency adjusted income from operations for the year ended december 31, 2022 increased 16.9% compared to the prior year period. this performance reflected the impact of net sales growth, partially offset by costs associated with the operation of our new manufacturing facility in newbridge, ireland.
latin america beverages constant currency net sales. constant currency net sales increased 23.0%, driven by favorable net price realization of 13.9% and volume/mix growth of 9.1%.
constant currency adjusted income from operations. constant currency adjusted income from operations for the year ended december 31, 2022 increased 18.5% compared to the prior year period, driven by the benefits of net sales growth and productivity, partially offset by the impacts of broad-based inflation, logistics and operating costs associated with incremental volumes, and increased marketing expense.

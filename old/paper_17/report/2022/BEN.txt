item 1a.    risk factors.
pandemic-related risks our business and operations are subject to adverse effects from the outbreak and spread of contagious diseases such as covid-19, which adverse effects may continue.
the outbreak and spread of contagious diseases such as covid-19 has adversely affected, and may continue to adversely affect, our business, financial condition and results of operations. the covid-19 pandemic resulted in a widespread global public health crisis. such infectious illness outbreaks or other adverse public health developments in countries where we operate, as well as local, state and/or national government restrictive measures implemented to control such outbreaks, could adversely affect the economies of many nations or the entire global economy, the financial condition of individual issuers or companies and capital markets, in ways that cannot necessarily be foreseen, and such impacts could be significant and long term. such extraordinary events and their aftermaths can cause investor fear and panic, which can further adversely affect the operations and performance of companies, sectors, nations, regions and financial markets in general and in ways that cannot necessarily be foreseen.
in order to remain competitive, we must continue to perform our asset management and related business responsibilities for our clients and investors properly and effectively, which, among other matters, is dependent on the health and safety of our personnel, the ability of our personnel to work remotely successfully, and our ability to continue to have our personnel return to work at our offices safely and effectively in compliance with applicable requirements. moreover, since implementing broad work-from-home measures during the pandemic, we have an increased dependency on remote equipment and connectivity infrastructure to access critical business systems that may be subject to failure, disruption or unavailability that could negatively impact our business operations. further, we, like many others, have been subject to increased phishing and other social engineering attempts by malicious actors to manipulate individuals into divulging confidential or personal information. if our cybersecurity diligence and efforts to offset the increased risks associated with greater reliance on mobile, collaborative and remote technologies are not effective or successful, we will be at increased risk for cybersecurity or data privacy incidents.
it is not possible to predict the full extent to which the pandemic may continue to evolve and/or adversely impact our business, liquidity, capital resources, financial results and operations, which impacts will depend on numerous developing factors that remain uncertain and subject to change.
market and volatility risks volatility and disruption of our business and financial markets and adverse changes in the global economy may significantly affect our results of operations and put pressure on our financial results.
we derive substantially all of our operating revenues and income from providing investment management and related services to investors in jurisdictions worldwide through our investment products, which include our funds, as well as institutional and high-net-worth separate accounts, retail separately managed account programs, sub-advised products, and other investment vehicles. related services include fund administration, sales and distribution, and shareholder servicing. we may perform services directly or through third parties. the asset management industry continues to experience disruption and challenges, including increased fee pressure, regulatory changes, an increasing and changing role of technology in asset management services, the continuous introduction of new products and services, and the consolidation of financial services firms through mergers and acquisitions. further, financial markets have currently and in the past experienced and may continue, from time to time, to experience volatility and disruption worldwide. declines in global economic conditions have currently and in the past resulted, and may continue to result, in significant decreases in our aum, revenues and income, and future declines may further negatively impact our financial results. such declines have had, and may in the future have, a material adverse impact on our business. we may need to modify our business, strategies or operations and we may be subject to additional constraints or costs in order to compete in a changing global economy and business environment.
individual financial, equity, debt and commodity markets may be adversely affected by financial, economic, political, electoral, diplomatic or other instabilities that are particular to the country or region in which a market is located, including without limitation local acts of terrorism, economic crises, political protests, war, insurrection or other business, social or political crises. for example, the russian invasion of ukraine, and the threat that russia's military aggression may expand beyond ukraine, has significantly impacted the global economy and financial markets, which has had, and may continue to have, an adverse effect on our investment performance and flows in certain products. global economic conditions, exacerbated by war, terrorism, social, civil or political unrest, natural disasters, public health crises, such as epidemics or pandemics, or financial crises, changes in the equity, debt or commodity marketplaces, changes in currency exchange rates, interest rates, inflation rates, the yield curve, defaults by trading counterparties, bond defaults, revaluation and bond market liquidity risks, geopolitical risks, the imposition of economic sanctions and other factors that are difficult to predict, affect the mix, market values and levels of our aum. changing market conditions could also cause an impairment to the value of our goodwill and other intangible assets.
the amount and mix of our aum are subject to significant fluctuations, and a shift in our asset mix toward lower-fee products may negatively impact our revenues and income.
fluctuations in the amount and mix of our aum may be attributable in part to market conditions outside of our control that have had, and in the future could have, a negative impact on our revenues and income. the level of our revenues depends largely on the level and relative mix of aum. our investment management fee revenues are based primarily on a percentage of aum and vary with the nature and strategies of our products. any decrease in the value or amount of our aum because of market volatility or other factors, such as asset outflows or a decline in the price of stocks, in particular market segments or in the securities market generally, negatively impacts our revenues and income. changing market conditions and investor preferences may cause a shift in our asset mix toward certain lower fee products, such as fixed income products and etfs, and away from higher fee equity and multi-asset products, which may cause a related decline in our revenues and income. in addition, increases in interest rates, particularly if rapid, as well as uncertainty in the future direction of interest rates, may have a negative impact on our fixed income products and decrease the total return on bond investments due to lower market valuations of existing bonds. moreover, we generally derive higher investment management and distribution fees from our international products than from our u.s. products, and higher sales fees from our u.s. products than from our international products. changing market conditions may cause a shift in our asset mix between international and u.s. products, potentially resulting in a decline in our revenues and income depending upon the nature of our aum and the level of fees we earn on that aum.
our funds may be subject to liquidity risks or an unanticipated large number of redemptions and fund closures.
due to market volatility or other events or conditions described above, our funds may need to sell securities or instruments that they hold, possibly at a loss, or draw on any available lines of credit, to obtain cash to maintain sufficient liquidity or settle these redemptions, or settle in-kind with securities held in the applicable fund. while we have no legal or contractual obligation to do so, we have in the past provided, and may in the future at our discretion provide, financial support to our funds to enable them to maintain sufficient liquidity in any such event. changes in investor preferences regarding our more popular products have in the past caused, and could in the future cause, sizable redemptions and lower the value of our aum, which would result in lower revenue and operating results. increased market volatility and changes in investor preferences also increase the risk of fund closures. any decrease in the level of our aum resulting from market declines, credit or interest rate volatility or uncertainty, increased redemptions or other factors could negatively impact our revenues and income.
we may not effectively manage risks associated with the replacement of benchmark indices.
the withdrawal and replacement of widely used benchmark indices such as the london interbank offered rate ("libor") with alternative benchmark rates may introduce a number of risks for our business, our clients and the financial services industry more widely. these include financial risks arising from changes in the valuation of financial instruments linked to benchmark indices, pricing and operational risks, and legal implementation and revised documentation risks. the global transition away from libor is continuing to progress, with libor being replaced by the secured overnight financing rate and other alternatives as of june 30, 2023, subject to libor's ongoing phase-out. the ongoing withdrawal and replacement of libor may pose financial risks and uncertainties to our business. we also may face operational challenges adopting successor benchmarks.
investment performance and reputational risks poor investment performance of our products could reduce the level of our aum or affect our sales, and negatively impact our revenues and income.
our investment performance, along with achieving and maintaining superior distribution and client service, is critical to the success of our business. strong investment performance often stimulates sales of our products. poor investment performance, as currently experienced by certain of our products, as compared to third-party benchmarks or competitive products, has led, and could in the future lead, to a decrease in sales of our products and stimulate redemptions from existing products, generally lowering the overall level of aum and reducing the management fees we earn. we can provide no assurance that past or present investment performance in our products will be indicative of future performance. if we fail, or appear to fail, to address successfully and promptly the underlying causes of poor investment performance, our future business prospects would likely be negatively affected.
harm to our reputation may negatively impact our revenues and income.
our reputation is critical to the success of our business. we believe that our brand names have been, and continue to be, well received both in our industry and with our clients, reflecting the fact that our brands, like our business, are based in part on trust and confidence. if our brands or reputation are harmed, existing clients may reduce amounts held in, or withdraw entirely from, our products, or our clients and products may terminate their management agreements with us, which could reduce the amount of our aum and cause us to suffer a corresponding loss in our revenues and income. in addition, reputational harm may prevent us from attracting new clients or developing new business. moreover, esg topics and activities have been the subject of increased focus by certain investors and regulators in the asset management industry, and any inability to meet applicable requirements or expectations may adversely impact our reputation and business.
global operational risks we may review and pursue strategic transactions that could pose risks to our business and global operations.
as part of our global business strategy, we regularly consider, and have discussions with respect to, potential strategic transactions, including acquisitions, dispositions, consolidations, joint ventures or similar transactions, some of which may be deemed material. there can be no assurance that we will find suitable candidates for strategic transactions at acceptable prices, have sufficient capital resources to accomplish our strategy, or be successful in entering into agreements for desired transactions. in addition, such transactions typically involve a number of risks and present financial, managerial and operational challenges. acquisitions and related transactions pose the risk that any business we acquire may result in the loss of clients, customers or personnel or could underperform relative to expectations. we also may not realize the anticipated benefits of an acquisition, including with respect to revenue, tax benefits, financial benefits or returns, and expense and other synergies. we could also experience financial or other setbacks if transactions encounter unanticipated problems, including problems related to execution or integration. entries into material transactions typically are announced publicly even though they may remain subject to numerous closing conditions, contingencies and approvals, and there is no assurance that any announced transaction will actually be consummated. future transactions also may further increase our leverage or, if we issue equity securities to pay for acquisitions, dilute the holdings of our existing stockholders.
in addition, from time to time, we enter into joint ventures or take minority stakes in companies in which we typically do not have control. these investments may involve risks, including the risk that the controlling stakeholder or joint venture partner may have business interests, strategies or goals that are inconsistent with ours. the business decisions or other actions or omissions of the controlling stakeholder, joint venture partner or the entity itself may result in liability to us or harm to our reputation, or adversely affect the value of our investment in the entity.
our business operations are complex and a failure to perform operational tasks properly or comply with applicable regulatory requirements could have an adverse effect on our revenues and income.
through our subsidiaries, we provide investment management and related services to investors globally. further, we outsource various administration, technology, transfer agency and other services for our funds to third-party providers who may serve as a sub-agent or delegate. in order to be competitive and comply with our agreements, we must properly perform our fund and portfolio administration and related responsibilities, including portfolio recordkeeping and accounting, security pricing, corporate actions, investment restrictions compliance, daily net asset value computations, account reconciliations, and required distributions to fund shareholders. many of our operations are complex and dependent on our ability, and the ability of our third-party providers, to process and monitor a large number of transactions effectively, which may occur across numerous markets and currencies at high volumes and frequencies. although we expend considerable resources on internal controls, supervision, technology and training in an effort to ensure that such transactions do not violate applicable guidelines, rules and regulations or adversely affect our clients, counterparties or us, our operations are ultimately dependent on our personnel, as well as others involved in our business, such as third-party vendors, providers and other intermediaries, and subject to potential human errors. our personnel and others involved in our business may, from time to time, make mistakes that are not always immediately detected, which may disrupt our operations, cause losses, lead to regulatory fines or sanctions, litigation, or otherwise damage our reputation. in addition, any misrepresentation of our services and products in advertising materials, public relations information, social media or other external communications could also adversely affect our reputation and business prospects. our investment management fees, which represent a significant portion of our revenues, are dependent on fees earned under investment management agreements that we have with our products and clients. our revenues could be adversely affected if such agreements representing a significant portion of our aum are terminated. further, certain of our subsidiaries may act as general partner for various investment partnerships, which may subject them to liability for the partnerships' liabilities. if we fail to perform and monitor our operations properly, our business could suffer and our revenues and income could be adversely affected.
failure to establish adequate controls and risk management policies, or the circumvention of controls and policies, could have an adverse effect on our global operations, reputation and financial position.
although we have adopted risk management, operational and financial controls and compliance policies, procedures and programs that are subject to regular review and update, we cannot ensure that these measures will enable us effectively to identify and manage internal and external risks including those related to fraudulent activity and dishonesty. we are subject to the risk that our personnel, contractors, vendors and other third parties may deliberately or recklessly circumvent or violate our controls to commit fraud against our business, products and/or client accounts, pay or solicit bribes, or otherwise act in ways inconsistent with our controls, policies, workplace culture and business principles. continued attempts to circumvent our policies and controls or repeated incidents involving violation of controls and policies, fraud or conflicts of interests could negatively impact our business and reputation and result in adverse publicity, regulatory investigations and actions, legal proceedings and losses and adversely affect our operations, reputation, aum and financial results.
we face risks, and corresponding potential costs and expenses, associated with conducting operations and growing our business in numerous countries.
we sell our products and offer our strategies and investment management and related services in many different regulatory jurisdictions around the world, and intend to continue to expand our operations internationally. as we do so, we will continue to face challenges to the adequacy of our resources, procedures and controls to operate our business consistently and effectively. in order to remain competitive, we must be proactive and prepared to implement necessary resources when growth opportunities present themselves, whether as a result of a business acquisition or rapidly increasing business activities in particular markets or regions. local regulatory environments may vary widely in terms of scope, adequacy and sophistication. similarly, local distributors, and their policies and practices as well as financial viability, may vary widely and they may be inconsistent or less developed or mature than other more internationally focused distributors. growth of our international operations has involved and may continue to involve near-term increases in expenses, as well as additional capital costs, such as information systems and technology costs, and costs related to compliance with particular regulatory or other local requirements or needs. local requirements or needs also may place additional demands on sales and compliance personnel and resources, such as meeting local language requirements, while also integrating personnel into an organization with a single operating language. finding, hiring and retaining additional, well-qualified personnel and crafting and adopting policies, procedures and controls to address local or regional requirements remain challenges as we expand our operations internationally.
moreover, regulators in non-u.s. jurisdictions could also change their policies or laws in a manner that might restrict or otherwise impede our ability to distribute or authorize products or maintain their authorizations in their respective markets. any of these local requirements, activities or needs could increase the costs and expenses we incur in a specific jurisdiction without any corresponding increase in revenues and income from operating in the jurisdiction. certain laws and regulations both inside and outside the u.s. have extraterritorial application. this may lead to duplicative or conflicting legal or regulatory burdens and additional costs and risks.
our focus on international markets as a source of investments and sales of our products subjects us to increased exchange rate and market-specific political, economic or other risks that may adversely impact our revenues and income generated overseas.
while we maintain a significant portion of our operations in the u.s., we also provide services and earn revenues in asia-pacific; europe, middle east and africa; latin america; and canada. as a result, we are subject to foreign currency exchange risk through our non-u.s. operations. fluctuations in the exchange rates to the u.s. dollar have affected, and may in the future affect, our financial results from one period to the next. while we have taken steps to reduce our exposure to foreign exchange risk, for example, by denominating a significant amount of our transactions in u.s. dollars, our situation may change in the future. appreciation of the u.s. dollar could in the future moderate revenues from managing our products internationally, or could affect relative investment performance of certain of our products invested in non-u.s. securities. in addition, we have risk associated with the foreign exchange revaluation of u.s. dollar balances held by certain non-u.s. subsidiaries for which the local currency is the functional currency. separately, management fees that we earn tend to be higher in connection with non-u.s. aum than with u.s. aum. consequently, downturns in international markets have in the past had, and could in the future have, a significant effect on our revenues and income. moreover, our emerging market portfolios and revenues derived from managing these portfolios are subject to significant risks of loss from financial, economic, political and diplomatic developments, currency fluctuations, social instability, changes in governmental policies, expropriation, nationalization, asset confiscation and changes in legislation related to non-u.s. ownership. international trading markets, particularly in some emerging market countries, are often smaller, less liquid, less regulated and significantly more volatile than those in the u.s. any ongoing and future business, economic, political or social unrest affecting these markets, in addition to any direct consequences such unrest may have on our personnel and facilities located in the affected area, also may have a lasting impact on the long-term investment climate in these and other areas and, as a result, our aum and the corresponding revenues and income that we generate from them may be negatively affected.
competition and distribution risks failure to properly address the increased transformative pressures affecting the asset management industry could negatively impact our business.
the asset management industry is facing transformative pressures and trends from a variety of different sources including increased fee pressure; a continued shift away from actively managed core equities and fixed income strategies towards alternative, passive and smart beta strategies; increased demands from clients and distributors for client engagement and services; a trend towards institutions developing fewer relationships and partners and reducing the number of investment managers they work with; increased regulatory activity and scrutiny of many aspects of the asset management industry, including esg practices and related matters, transparency/unbundling of fees, inducements, conflicts of interest, capital, liquidity, solvency, leverage, operational risk management, controls and compensation; addressing the key emerging markets in the world, such as china and india, which often have populations with different needs, preferences and horizons than the more developed u.s. and european markets; and advances in technology and digital wealth and distribution tools and increasing client interest in interacting digitally with their investment portfolios. as a result of the trends and pressures discussed above, the asset management industry is facing an increased level of disruption. if we are unable to adapt our strategy and business to address adequately these trends and pressures, we may be unable to meet client needs satisfactorily, our competitive position may weaken, and our business results and operations may be adversely affected.
strong competition from numerous and sometimes larger companies with competing offerings and products could limit or reduce sales of our products, potentially resulting in a decline in our market share, revenues and income.
we compete with numerous investment management companies, securities brokerage and investment banking firms, insurance companies, banks and other financial institutions. our products also compete with products offered by these competitors, as well as with real estate investment trusts, hedge funds and other products. the periodic establishment of new investment management companies and other competitors increases the competition that we face. at the same time, consolidation in the financial services industry has created stronger competitors with greater financial resources and broader distribution channels than our own. competition is based on various factors, including, among others, business reputation, investment performance, product mix and offerings, esg strategies and considerations, service quality and innovation, distribution relationships, and fees charged. further, although we may offer certain types of etfs, to the extent that there is a trend among existing or potential clients in favor of lower-fee index and other etfs, it may favor our competitors who may offer such products that are more established or on a larger scale than we do. additionally, competing securities broker-dealers and banks, upon which we rely to distribute and sell certain of our funds and other products, also may sell their own proprietary funds and products, which could limit the distribution of our products. to the extent that existing or potential clients, including securities broker-dealers, decide to invest in or distribute the products of our competitors, the sales of our products as well as our market share, revenues and income could decline. our ability to attract and retain aum is also dependent on the relative investment performance of our products, offering a mix of products and strategies that meets investor demands, and our ability to maintain our investment management fees and pricing structure at competitive levels.
increasing competition and other changes in the third-party distribution and sales channels on which we depend could reduce our revenues and income and hinder our growth.
we primarily derive our fund sales through third-party broker-dealers, banks, investment advisers and other financial intermediaries. because we rely on third-party distribution and sales channels to sell our products, we do not control the ultimate investment recommendations given by them to clients. such financial intermediaries may recommend competing products. increasing competition for these distribution and sales channels, and regulatory changes and initiatives, have caused our distribution costs to rise and could cause further cost increases in the future, or could otherwise negatively impact the distribution of our products. higher distribution costs lower our revenues and income, and consolidations in the broker-dealer or banking industries could also adversely impact our revenues and income. a failure to maintain our third-party distribution and sales channels, or a failure to maintain strong business relationships with our distributors and other intermediaries, may impair our distribution and sales operations. any inability to access and successfully sell our products to clients through such third-party channels could have a negative effect on our level of aum and adversely impact our business.
moreover, we can provide no assurance that we will continue to have access to the third-party financial intermediaries that currently distribute our products, or that we will continue to have the opportunity to offer all or some of our existing products through them. if several of the major financial advisers that distribute our products were to cease operations or limit or otherwise end the distribution of our products, it could have a significant adverse impact on our revenues and income.
further, the standards of conduct and disclosure and reporting requirements, with respect to fees, products, services and possible conflicts of interest, applicable to broker-dealers and other financial intermediaries in the u.s., remain subject to change and enhancement pursuant to business and regulatory developments and requirements, including with respect to investor suitability obligations, enhanced investor protections for retail customers, and increased compliance requirements.
in addition, canada, the u.k., the netherlands and the eu, through mifid ii, have adopted regimes that ban, or may limit, the payment of commissions and other inducements to intermediaries in relation to certain sales to retail customers in those jurisdictions, and similar regimes are under consideration in several other jurisdictions. depending on their exact terms, such regimes may result in existing flows of business moving to less profitable channels or even to competitors providing substitutable products outside the regime. arrangements with non-independent advisers will also be affected as narrower rules related to the requirement that commissions reflect an enhancement of the service to customers come into effect, along with a prescriptive list of permissible non-monetary benefits. the interpretation of the inducements rules has also resulted in major changes to how fund managers, including us, finance investment research with many firms, by opting to pay for third-party investment research for client accounts covered by mifid ii.
third-party risks any failure of our third-party providers to fulfill their obligations, or our failure to maintain good relationships with our providers, could adversely impact our business.
we currently, and may in the future, depend on a number of third-party providers to support various operational, administrative, technology, transfer agency, market data, distribution, and other business needs of our company. further, we outsource various administration, technology, transfer agency and other services for our funds to third-party providers. in addition, we may, from time to time, transfer vendor contracts and services from one provider to another. if our third-party providers fail to deliver required services on a timely basis, or if we experience other negative service quality or relationship issues with our providers, we may be exposed to significant costs and/or operational difficulties, and our ability to conduct and grow our business may be impaired. such administrative and functional changes are costly and complex, and may expose us to heightened operational risks. any failure to mitigate such risks could result in reputational harm to us, as well as financial losses to us and our clients. the failure of any key provider or vendor to fulfill its obligations to us could result in outcomes inconsistent with our or our clients' objectives and requirements, result in legal liability and regulatory issues for us, and otherwise adversely impact us.
we may be adversely affected if any of our third-party providers is subject to a successful cyber or security attack.
due to our interconnectivity with third-party vendors, advisors, central agents, exchanges, clearing organizations and other financial institutions, we may be adversely affected if any of them is subject to a successful cyber attack or other privacy or information security event, including those arising due to the use of mobile technology or a third-party cloud environment. most of the software applications that we use in our business are licensed from, and supported, upgraded and maintained by, third-party vendors. our third-party applications include enterprise cloud storage and cloud computing application services provided and maintained by third-party vendors. any breach, suspension or termination of certain of these licenses or the related support, upgrades and maintenance could cause temporary system delays or interruption that could adversely impact our business. our third-party applications may include confidential and proprietary data provided by vendors and by us, including personal employee and/or client data.
technology and security risks our ability to manage and grow our business successfully can be impeded by systems and other technological limitations.
our continued success in effectively managing and growing our business depends on our ability to integrate our varied accounting, financial, information, and operational systems on a global basis. moreover, adapting or developing the existing technology systems we use to meet our internal needs, as well as client needs, industry demands and new regulatory requirements, is also critical for our business. the introduction of new technologies presents new challenges to us. on an ongoing basis, we need to upgrade and improve our technology, including our data processing, financial, accounting, shareholder servicing and trading systems. further, we also must be proactive and prepared to implement new technology when growth opportunities present themselves, whether as a result of a business acquisition or rapidly increasing business activities in particular markets or regions. these needs could present operational issues or require significant capital spending, and may require us to reevaluate the current value and/or expected useful lives of the technology we use, which could negatively impact our results of operations. in addition, technology is subject to rapid advancements and changes and our competitors may, from time to time, implement newer technologies or more advanced platforms for their services and products, including digital advisers, digital wealth and distribution tools and other advanced electronic systems, which could adversely affect our business if we are unable to remain competitive.
any significant limitation, failure or security breach of our information and cyber security infrastructure, software applications, technology or other systems that are critical to our operations could disrupt our business and harm our operations and reputation.
we are highly dependent upon the use of various proprietary and third-party information and security technology, software applications and other technology systems to operate our business. we are also dependent on the continuity and effectiveness of our information and cyber security infrastructure, management oversight and reporting framework, policies, procedures and capabilities to protect our computer and telecommunications systems and the data that reside on or are transmitted through them and contracted third-party systems. we use technology on a daily basis in our business to, among other things, support our business continuity and operations, process and transmit confidential communications, store and maintain data, obtain securities pricing information, process client transactions, and provide reports and other services to our clients. any disruptions, inaccuracies, delays, theft, systems failures, data security or privacy breaches, cyber attacks or cyber-related fraud, or other security breaches in these and other processes could subject us to significant client dissatisfaction and losses and damage our reputation. we have been, and expect to continue to be, the subject of these types of risks, breaches and/or attacks, as well as attempts to co-opt our brand. although we take protective measures, including measures to secure and protect information through system security technology and our internal security procedures, we can provide no assurance that any of these measures will prove effective or comply with evolving information security standards. the technology systems we use remain vulnerable to denial of service attacks, unauthorized access, computer viruses, potential human errors and other events and circumstances that may have a security impact, such as an external or internal hacker attack by one or more cyber criminals (including through the use of phishing attacks, malware, ransomware and other methods and activities maliciously designed to obtain and exploit confidential information and to cause system and service disruption and other damage) or our personnel or vendors inadvertently or recklessly causing us to release confidential information, which could materially harm our operations and reputation.
potential system disruptions, failures or breaches of the technology we use or the security infrastructure we rely upon, including the third-party applications we use, could result in: (i) material financial loss or costs, (ii) delays in clients' ability to access account information or in our ability to process transactions, (iii) the unauthorized disclosure or modification of sensitive or confidential client and business information, (iv) loss of valuable information, (v) breach of client and vendor contracts, (vi) liability for stolen assets, information or identity, (vii) remediation costs to repair damage caused by the failure or breach, (viii) additional security and organizational costs to mitigate against future incidents, (ix) reputational harm, (x) loss of confidence in our business and products, (xi) liability for failure to review and disclose applicable incidents or provide relevant updated disclosure properly and timely, (xii) regulatory investigations or actions, and/or (xiii) legal claims, litigation, and liability costs, any one or more of which may be material. moreover, loss or unauthorized disclosure or transfer of confidential and proprietary data or confidential customer identification information could further harm our reputation and subject us to liability under laws that protect confidential data and personal information, resulting in increased costs or a decline in our revenues or common stock price. further, although we take precautions to password protect and encrypt our laptops and sensitive information on our other mobile electronic devices, if such devices are stolen, misplaced or left unattended, they may become vulnerable to hacking or other unauthorized use, creating a possible security risk, which may require us to incur additional administrative costs and/or take remedial actions. in addition, failure to manage and operate properly the data centers and third-party cloud storage and computing application services we use could have an adverse impact on our business. although we have in place certain disaster recovery plans, we may experience system delays and interruptions as a result of natural disasters, power failures, acts of war, and third-party failures.
our inability to recover successfully, should we experience a disaster or other business continuity problem, could cause material financial loss, regulatory actions, legal liability, and/or reputational harm.
should we experience a local or regional disaster or other business continuity problem, such as an earthquake, hurricane, tsunami, terrorist attack, public health crisis, pandemic or other natural or man-made disaster, our continued success will depend, in part, on the safety and availability of our personnel, our office facilities and infrastructure, and the proper functioning of our technology, computer, telecommunication and other systems and operations that are critical to our business. while our operational size, the diversity of locations from which we operate, and our various back-up systems provide us with an advantage, should we experience a local or regional disaster or other business continuity event, we could still experience operational challenges, in particular depending upon how such a local or regional event may affect our personnel across our operations or with regard to particular aspects of our operations, such as key executives or personnel in our technology groups. moreover, as we grow our operations in new geographic regions, the potential for particular types of natural or man-made disasters, political, economic or infrastructure instabilities, information, technology or security limitations or breaches, or other country- or region-specific business continuity risks increases. past disaster recovery efforts have demonstrated that even seemingly localized events may require broader disaster recovery efforts throughout our operations and, consequently, we regularly assess and take steps to improve upon our existing business continuity plans. however, a disaster on a significant scale or affecting certain of our key operating areas within or across regions, or our inability to recover successfully following a disaster or other business continuity problem, could adversely impact our business and operations.
human capital risks we depend on key personnel and our financial performance could be negatively affected by the loss of their services.
the success of our business will continue to depend upon our key personnel, including our portfolio managers, investment analysts, investment advisers, sales and management personnel and other professionals as well as our executive officers and business unit heads. competition for qualified, motivated, and highly-skilled executives, professionals and other key personnel in the investment management industry remains significant. our success depends to a substantial degree upon our ability to find, attract, retain and motivate qualified individuals, including through competitive compensation packages, and upon the continued contributions of these people. global and/or local laws and regulations could impose restrictions on compensation paid by financial institutions, which could restrict our ability to compete effectively for qualified professionals. as our business develops, we may need to increase the number of individuals that we employ. moreover, in order to retain certain key personnel, we may be required to increase compensation to such individuals and increase our key management succession planning, resulting in additional expense without a corresponding increase in potential revenues. there is no assurance that we will be successful in finding, attracting and retaining qualified individuals, and the departure of key investment personnel, in particular, could cause us to lose clients, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and business prospects. in addition, due to the global nature of our business, our key personnel may, from time to time, have reasons to travel to regions susceptible to higher risk of civil unrest, organized crime or terrorism, and we may be unable to ensure the safety of our personnel traveling to such regions.
cash management risks our ability to meet cash needs depends upon certain factors, including the market value of our assets, our operating cash flows and our perceived creditworthiness.
if we are unable to obtain cash, financing or access to the capital markets in a timely manner, we may be forced to incur unanticipated costs or revise our business plans, and our business could be adversely impacted. further, our access to the capital markets depends significantly on our credit ratings. a reduction in our long- or short-term credit ratings could increase our borrowing costs and limit our access to the capital markets. volatility in the global financing markets also may impact our ability to access the capital markets should we seek to do so, and may have an adverse effect on investors' willingness to purchase our securities, interest rates, credit spreads and/or the valuation levels of equity markets.
we are dependent on the earnings of our subsidiaries.
substantially all of our operations are conducted through our subsidiaries. as a result, our cash flow and our ability to fund operations are dependent upon the earnings of our subsidiaries and the distribution of earnings, loans or other payments by our subsidiaries. our subsidiaries are separate and distinct legal entities and have no obligation to fund our payment obligations, whether by dividends, distributions, loans or other payments. any payments to us by our subsidiaries could be subject to statutory or contractual restrictions and are contingent upon our subsidiaries' earnings and business considerations. certain of our subsidiaries are subject to regulatory restrictions that may limit their ability to transfer assets to their parent companies. our financial condition could be adversely affected if certain of our subsidiaries are unable to distribute assets to us.
legal and regulatory risks for a more extensive discussion of certain laws, regulations (including certain pending regulatory reforms) and regulators to which we are subject, as well as certain defined terms referenced below, see "item 1 - business - regulation" in part i of this annual report.
we are subject to extensive, complex, overlapping and frequently changing rules, regulations, policies, and legal interpretations.
there is uncertainty associated with the regulatory and compliance environments in which we operate. our business is subject to extensive and complex, overlapping and/or conflicting, and frequently changing and increasing rules, regulations, policies and legal interpretations, around the world. political and electoral changes, developments and conflicts have in the past introduced, and may in the future introduce, additional uncertainty. our regulatory and compliance obligations impose significant operational and cost burdens on us and cover a broad range of requirements related to financial reporting and other disclosure matters, securities and other financial instruments, investment and advisory matters, accounting, tax, compensation, ethics, intellectual property, data protection, privacy, sanctions programs, and escheatment requirements. we may be adversely affected by a failure to comply with applicable laws, regulations and changes in the countries in which we operate.
we may be adversely affected as a result of new or revised legislation or regulations or by changes in the interpretation of existing laws and regulations, in the u.s. and other jurisdictions.
the laws and regulations applicable to our business generally involve restrictions and requirements in connection with a variety of technical, specialized, and expanding matters and concerns. over the years, the u.s. federal corporate governance and securities laws, and laws in other jurisdictions, have been augmented substantially and made significantly more complex by various legislation. as we continue to address our legal and regulatory requirements or focus on meeting new or expanded requirements, we may need to continue to expend a substantial amount of additional time, costs and resources. regulatory reforms may add further complexity to our business and operations and could require us to alter our investment management services and related activities, which could be costly, impede our growth and adversely impact our aum, revenues and income. regulatory reforms also may impact our clients, which could cause them to change their investment strategies or allocations in a manner adverse to our business. certain key regulatory reforms in the u.s. and other jurisdictions that may impact or relate to our business, and may cause us to incur additional obligations, include regulatory matters related to systemically important financial institutions, derivatives and other financial products, privacy and data protection, retail and other investor protections, esg topics and disclosure, and other asset management disclosure and compliance requirements. the impacts of these and other regulatory reforms on us, now and in the future, could be significant. we expect that the regulatory requirements and developments applicable to us will cause us to continue to incur additional compliance and administrative burdens and costs. any inability to meet applicable requirements within the required timeframes may subject us to sanctions or other restrictions by governments and/or regulators that could adversely impact our broader business objectives.
global regulatory and legislative actions and reforms have made compliance in the regulatory environment in which we operate more costly and future actions and reforms could adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations.
as in the u.s., regulatory and legislative actions outside the u.s. have been augmented substantially and made more complex by measures such as the eu's alternative investment fund managers directive and mifid ii. further, ongoing changes in the eu's regulatory framework applicable to our business, including changes related to brexit and any other changes in the composition of the eu's member states, may add further complexity to our global risks and operations.
moreover, the adoption of new laws, regulations or standards and changes in the interpretation or enforcement of existing laws, regulations or standards have directly affected, and will continue to affect, our business. with new laws and changes in interpretation of existing requirements, the associated time we must dedicate to and related costs we must incur in meeting the regulatory complexities of our business have increased. we may be required to continue to invest significant additional management time and resources to address new and changing regulations pursuant to mifid ii and other laws. for example, mifid ii requires the unbundling of research and execution charges for trading. outlays associated with meeting regulatory complexities have also increased as we expand our business into new jurisdictions.
the eu's gdpr strengthened and unified data protection rules for individuals within the eu and addresses export of personal data outside the eu. the failure to comply properly with gdpr rules on a timely basis and to maintain ongoing compliance with such rules may subject us to enforcement proceedings and significant fines and costs. for example, a failure to comply with gdpr could result in fines up to 4% of our annual global revenues.
compliance activities to address these and other new legal requirements have required, and will continue to require, us to expend additional time and resources, and, consequently, we are incurring increased costs of doing business, which potentially negatively impacts our profitability and future financial results. finally, any further regulatory and legislative actions and reforms affecting the investment management industry, including compliance initiatives, may negatively impact revenues by increasing our costs of accessing or operating in financial markets or by making certain investment offerings less favorable to our clients.
failure to comply with the laws, rules or regulations in any of the jurisdictions in which we operate could result in substantial harm to our reputation and results of operations.
as with all investment management companies, our activities are highly regulated in almost all countries in which we conduct business. failure to comply with the applicable laws, rules, regulations, codes, directives, notices or guidelines in any of our jurisdictions could result in regulatory enforcement, civil liability, criminal liability and/or the imposition of a range of sanctions or orders against us, including, as applicable, monetary damages, injunctions, disgorgements, fines, penalties, cease and desist orders, censures, reprimands, and the revocation, cancellation, suspension or restriction of licenses, registration status or approvals held by us or our business in a jurisdiction or market, any of which could adversely affect our reputation and operations. moreover, any potential accounting or reporting errors, whether financial or otherwise, if material, could damage our reputation and adversely affect our business. while management has focused attention and resources on our compliance policies, procedures and practices, the regulatory environments of the jurisdictions where we conduct our business, or where our products are organized or sold, are complex, uncertain and subject to change. local regulatory environments may vary widely and place additional demands on our sales, investment, legal and compliance personnel. in recent years, the regulatory environments in which we operate have seen significant increased and evolving regulations, which have imposed and may continue to impose additional compliance and operational requirements and costs on us in the applicable jurisdictions. regulators could also change their policies or laws in a manner that might restrict or otherwise impede our ability to offer our services and products in their respective markets, or we may be unable to keep up with, or adapt to, the ever changing, complex regulatory requirements in such jurisdictions or markets, which could further negatively impact our business.
changes in tax laws or exposure to additional income tax liabilities could have a material impact on our financial condition, results of operations and liquidity.
we are subject to complex tax regimes, changing tax laws, income taxes, non-income-based taxes, and ongoing tax audits, in the various jurisdictions in which we operate. tax authorities may disagree with certain positions we have taken and assess additional taxes. we regularly assess the likely outcomes of these audits in order to determine the appropriateness of our tax provision. however, there can be no assurance that we will accurately predict the outcomes of these audits and the actual outcomes could have a material impact on our financial condition. changes in tax laws or rulings, including corporate tax rate increases, capital gains rate increases for fund investors and other tax rate increases impacting our clients and their willingness to invest in our products, may at times materially impact our financial condition.
regulatory and governmental examinations and/or investigations, litigation and the legal risks associated with our business, could adversely impact our aum, increase costs and negatively impact our profitability and/or our future financial results.
we operate in a highly regulated industry and routinely receive and respond to regulatory and governmental requests for documents or other information, subpoenas, examinations and, in some instances, investigations in connection with our business activities. further, regulatory or governmental examinations or investigations that have been inactive could become active. in addition, we are named as a party in litigation in the ordinary course of business. even if claims made against us are without merit, they can result in reputational harm and responding to such matters typically is an expensive process. risks associated with legal liability often are difficult to assess or quantify and their existence and magnitude can remain unknown for significant periods of time. regulatory enforcement and civil litigation matters can result in the imposition of a range of sanctions or orders against us, including, as applicable, monetary damages, injunctions, disgorgements, fines, penalties, cease and desist orders, censures, reprimands, and the revocation, cancellations, suspension or restriction of licenses, registration status or approvals held by us or our business. in addition, we may be obligated, and under our certificate of incorporation, bylaws and standard form of director indemnification agreement are obligated under certain conditions, or may choose, to indemnify directors, officers or personnel against liabilities and expenses they may incur in connection with such matters to the extent permitted under applicable law. eventual financial exposures from and expenses incurred relating to any examinations, investigations, enforcement actions, litigation, and/or settlements could adversely impact our aum, increase costs, and negatively impact our reputation, profitability, and revenue any of which could have a material negative impact on our financial results. for a discussion of certain legal proceedings and regulatory matters in which we are involved, see the "legal proceedings" section in note 15 - commitments and contingencies in the notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8 of part ii of this annual report.
our contractual obligations may subject us to indemnification costs and liability to third parties.
in the ordinary course of business, we enter into contracts with third parties, including, without limitation, clients, vendors, and other service providers, that contain a variety of representations and warranties and that provide for indemnifications by us in certain circumstances. pursuant to such contractual arrangements, we may be subject to indemnification costs and liability to third parties if, for example, we breach any material obligations under the agreements or agreed standards of care, or in the event such third parties have certain legal claims asserted against them. the terms of these indemnities vary from contract to contract, and future indemnification claims against us could negatively impact our financial condition.
failure to protect our intellectual property may negatively impact our business.
although we take steps to safeguard and protect our intellectual property, including but not limited to our trademarks, patents, copyrights and trade secrets, there can be no assurance that we will be able effectively to protect our rights. if our intellectual property rights were violated, we could be subject to economic and reputational harm that could negatively impact our business and competitiveness in the marketplace. conversely, while we take efforts to avoid infringement of the intellectual property of third parties, if we are deemed to infringe on a third party's intellectual property rights it could expose us to litigation risks, license fees, liability and reputational harm.
item 7.    management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations.
forward-looking statements the following discussion and analysis of the results of operations and financial condition of franklin resources, inc. ("franklin") and its subsidiaries (collectively, the "company") should be read in conjunction with the "forward-looking statements" disclosure set forth in part i and the "risk factors" set forth in item 1a of part i of this annual report on form 10‐k (this "annual report") and in any more recent filings with the u.s. securities and exchange commission (the "sec"), each of which describe our risks, uncertainties and other important factors in more detail.
overview franklin is a holding company with subsidiaries operating under our franklin templeton® and/or subsidiary brand names. we are a global investment management organization that derives operating revenues and net income from providing investment management and related services to investors in jurisdictions worldwide. we deliver our investment capabilities through a variety of investment products, which include our sponsored funds, as well as institutional and high-net-worth separate accounts, retail separately managed account programs, sub-advised products, and other investment vehicles. related services include fund administration, sales and distribution, and shareholder servicing. we may perform services directly or through third parties. we offer our services and products under our various distinct brand names, including, but not limited to, franklin®, templeton®, legg mason®, alcentra®, benefit street partners®, brandywine global investment management®, clarion partners®, clearbridge investments®, fiduciary trust internationaltm, franklin bissett®, franklin mutual series®, k2®, lexington partners®, martin currie®, o'shaughnessy® asset management, royce® investment partners and western asset management company®. we offer a broad product mix of fixed income, equity, alternative, multi-asset, and cash management asset classes and solutions that meet a wide variety of specific investment goals and needs for individual and institutional investors. we also provide sub-advisory services to certain investment products sponsored by other companies which may be sold to investors under the brand names of those other companies or on a co-branded basis.
the level of our revenues depends largely on the level and relative mix of assets under management ("aum"). as noted in the "risk factors" section set forth above in item 1a of part i of this annual report, the amount and mix of our aum are subject to significant fluctuations that can negatively impact our revenues and income. the level of our revenues also depends on the fees charged for our services, which are based on contracts with our funds and customers, fund sales, and the number of shareholder transactions and accounts. these arrangements could change in the future.
during the fiscal year ended september 30, 2022 ("fiscal year 2022"), global equity markets experienced significant declines driven by the economic impacts of inflationary pressures, interest rate increases by the federal reserve and other developed market central banks in an effort to combat inflation, central banks' tightened monetary policies, the russian invasion of ukraine, and concerns about the risk of recession. the s&p 500 index and msci world index decreased 15.5% and 19.3% for the fiscal year. the global bond markets also declined as the bloomberg barclays global aggregate index decreased 20.4% for the fiscal year driven by the interest rate increases.
our total aum was $1,297.4 billion at september 30, 2022, which was 15% lower than at september 30, 2021 driven by the negative impact of $269.0 billion of net market change, distributions and other, $27.8 billion of long-term net outflows and $0.8 billion of cash management net outflows, partially offset by $64.9 billion from acquisitions. simple monthly average aum ("average aum") decreased 2% during fiscal year 2022.
on april 1, 2022, we acquired all of the outstanding ownership interests in lexington partners l.p. ("lexington"), a leading global manager of secondary private equity and co-investment funds, for cash consideration of $1.0 billion and additional payments totaling $750.0 million to be paid in cash over the next three years. in connection with the acquisition, we granted a 25% ownership stake in lexington and performance-based cash retention awards to certain employees that vest over approximately five years. on december 31, 2021, we acquired all of the outstanding ownership interest in o'shaughnessy asset management, llc ("osam"), a leading quantitative asset management firm, for cash consideration paid of approximately $300 million, excluding future payments to be made subject to the attainment of certain performance measures.
the business and regulatory environments in which we operate globally remain complex, uncertain and subject to change. we are subject to various laws, rules and regulations globally that impose restrictions, limitations, registration, reporting and disclosure requirements on our business, and add complexity to our global compliance operations.
uncertainties regarding the global economy remain for the foreseeable future. as we continue to confront the challenges of the current economic and regulatory environments, we remain focused on the investment performance of our products and on providing high quality service to our clients. we continuously perform reviews of our business model. while we remain focused on expense management, we will also seek to attract, retain and develop personnel and invest strategically in systems and technology that will provide a secure and stable environment. we will continue to seek to protect and further our brand recognition while developing and maintaining broker-dealer and client relationships. the success of these and other strategies may be influenced by the factors discussed in the "risk factors" section.

aum decreased $232.7 billion or 15% during fiscal year 2022 due to the negative impact of $269.0 billion of net market change, distributions and other, $27.8 billion of long-term net outflows and $0.8 billion of cash management net outflows, partially offset by acquisitions of $64.9 billion. net market change, distributions and other primarily consists of $199.2 billion of market depreciation, $48.7 billion of long-term distributions and a $21.1 billion decrease from foreign exchange revaluation. the market depreciation occurred in all asset classes with the exception of the alternative asset class. foreign exchange revaluation from aum in products that are not u.s. dollar denominated was primarily due to a stronger u.s. dollar compared to the japanese yen, euro, pound sterling and australian dollar.
long-term inflows decreased 12% to $320.4 billion, as compared to the prior year, driven by lower inflows in fixed income institutional separate accounts, open-end funds, and retail separately managed accounts, as well as equity open-end funds, partially offset by higher alternative inflows for private funds. long-term outflows decreased 11% to $348.2 billion due to lower outflows in fixed income institutional separate accounts, equity and multi-asset open-end funds, and equity sub-advised mutual funds, partially offset by higher equity outflows in retail separately managed accounts and multi-asset sub-advised mutual funds.

aum increased $111.2 billion or 8% during fiscal year 2021 due to the positive impact of $148.0 billion of net market change, distributions and other, and $3.5 billion from an acquisition, partially offset by $25.2 billion of long-term net outflows and $15.1 billion of cash management net outflows. net market change, distributions and other primarily consists of $176.3 billion of market appreciation, partially offset by $29.1 billion of long-term distributions. the market appreciation occurred in all asset classes, most significantly in the equity and multi-asset classes and reflected positive returns in global equity markets.
long-term inflows increased 100% to $364.7 billion, as compared to the prior year, and long-term outflows increased 60% to $389.9 billion due to higher inflows and outflows in all long-term asset classes primarily due to the acquisition of legg mason. long-term net outflows included outflows of $35.7 billion from sixteen institutional products, including two fixed income redemptions of $5.9 billion and $2.0 billion and two equity redemptions of $3.7 billion and
$2.2 billion, $12.5 billion from seven fixed income funds, including $3.3 billion from five india credit funds that were non-management fee earning which are in the process of winding up, $5.4 billion from a 529 plan redemption, $3.9 billion from two equity funds and $3.1 billion from a multi-asset fund, partially offset by inflows of $12.3 billion in three fixed income funds, $6.7 billion in three institutional products, $3.7 billion in an equity fund, $3.1 billion in a multi-asset fund and $3.0 billion in two alternative funds.

investment performance overview a key driver of our overall success is the long-term investment performance of our investment products. a measure of the performance of these products is the percentage of aum exceeding peer group medians and benchmarks. we compare the relative performance of our mutual funds against peers, and of our strategy composites against benchmarks.

mutual fund performance is sourced from morningstar and measures the percent of ranked aum in the top two quartiles versus peers. total mutual fund aum measured for the 1-, 3-, 5- and 10-year periods represents 36%, 36%, 36% and 34% of our total aum as of september 30, 2022.
strategy composite performance measures the percent of composite aum beating its benchmark. the benchmark comparisons are based on each account's/composite's (strategy composites may include retail separately managed accounts and mutual fund assets managed as part of the same strategy) return as compared to a market index that has been selected to be generally consistent with the asset class of the account/composite. total strategy composite aum measured for the 1-, 3-, 5- and 10-year periods represents 64%, 63%, 63% and 59% of our total aum as of september 30, 2022.
total mutual fund aum includes performance of our alternative and multi-asset funds, and total strategy composite aum includes performance of our alternative composites. alternative and multi-asset aum represent 17% and 10% of our total aum at september 30, 2022.
mutual fund performance data includes u.s. and cross-border domiciled mutual funds and exchange-traded funds, and excludes cash management and fund of funds. these results assume the reinvestment of dividends, are based on data available as of october 7, 2022 and are subject to revision.
past performance is not indicative of future results. for aum included in institutional and retail separately managed accounts and investment funds managed in the same strategy as separate accounts, performance comparisons are based on gross-of-fee performance. for investment funds which are not managed in a separate account format, performance comparisons are based on net-of-fee performance. these performance comparisons do not reflect the actual performance of any specific separate account or investment fund; individual separate account and investment fund performance may differ. the information in this presentation is provided solely for use in connection with this document, and is not directed toward existing or potential clients of franklin.

investment management fees investment management fees are generally calculated under contractual arrangements with our investment products and the products for which we provide sub-advisory services as a percentage of aum. annual fee rates vary by asset class and type of services provided. fee rates for products sold outside of the u.s. are generally higher than for u.s. products.
investment management fees increased $75.2 million in fiscal year 2022 primarily due to higher performance fees, partially offset by a 2% decrease in average aum. the decrease in average aum occurred primarily in the fixed income and equity asset classes, partially offset by an increase in the alternative asset class that includes the acquisition of lexington.
investment management fees increased $2,559.9 million in fiscal year 2021 primarily due to the acquisition of legg mason, a 5% increase in average aum and higher performance fees. the increase in average aum occurred primarily in the equity and multi-asset asset classes, partially offset by a decrease in the fixed income asset class.
our effective investment management fee rate excluding performance fees (investment management fees excluding performance fees divided by average aum) was 41.6, 41.8 and 47.3 basis points for fiscal years 2022, 2021 and 2020. the rate decrease in fiscal year 2022 was primarily due to a shift in assets from higher-fee products to lower-fee products in the fixed income and equity asset classes. the rate decrease in fiscal year 2021 was primarily due to the legg mason acquisition, as legg mason generally had a lower overall effective fee rate due to a higher mix of institutional and fixed income aum.
performance-based investment management fees were $498.2 million, $258.6 million and $44.0 million for fiscal years 2022, 2021 and 2020. the increase in fiscal year 2022 was primarily due to strong performance by our alternative specialist investment managers, while the increase in fiscal year 2021 was primarily due to the acquisition of legg mason as well as strong performance.
our product offerings and global operations are diverse. as such, the impact of future changes in aum on investment management fees will be affected by the relative mix of asset class, geographic region, distribution channel and investment vehicle of the assets.
sales and distribution fees sales and distribution fees primarily consist of upfront sales commissions and ongoing distribution fees. sales commissions are earned from the sale of certain classes of sponsored funds at the time of purchase ("commissionable sales") and may be reduced or eliminated depending on the amount invested and the type of investor. therefore, sales fees generally will change with the overall level of gross sales, the size of individual transactions, and the relative mix of sales between different share classes and types of investors.
our sponsored mutual funds generally pay us distribution fees in return for sales, marketing and distribution efforts on their behalf. the majority of our u.s. mutual funds, with the exception of certain money market funds and certain other funds specifically designed for purchase through separately managed account programs, have adopted distribution plans under rule 12b-1 (the "rule 12b-1 plans") promulgated under the investment company act of 1940. the rule 12b-1 plans permit the funds to pay us for marketing, marketing support, advertising, printing and sales promotion services relating to the distribution of their shares, subject to the rule 12b-1 plans' limitations on amounts based on daily average aum. we
37
earn distribution fees from our non-u.s. funds based on daily average aum.
contingent sales charges are earned from investor redemptions within a contracted period of time. substantially all of these charges are levied on certain shares sold without a front-end sales charge, and vary with the mix of redemptions of these shares.
we pay substantially all of our sales and distribution fees to the financial advisers, broker-dealers and other intermediaries that sell our funds on our behalf. see the description of sales, distribution and marketing expenses below.
sales and distribution fees by revenue driver are presented below.

1    includes impact of gains and losses on investments related to deferred compensation plans and seed investments, which is offset in investment and other income (losses), net; minority interests in certain subsidiaries, which is offset in net income (loss) attributable to redeemable noncontrolling interests; special termination benefits; and acquisition-related performance-based investment management fees which are passed through as compensation and benefits expense.
salaries, wages and benefits decreased $2.2 million in fiscal year 2022 primarily due to a $16.8 million decrease in termination benefits and the impact of headcount reductions which were substantially offset by increases due to annual salary adjustments and the acquisitions of lexington and osam. salaries, wages and benefits increased $365.9 million in fiscal year 2021, primarily due to the acquisition of legg mason.
incentive compensation increased $196.6 million in fiscal year 2022, primarily due to higher performance fees and the acquisition of lexington. incentive compensation increased $753.9 million in fiscal year 2021, primarily due to the acquisition of legg mason.
acquisition-related retention expenses increased $3.5 million in fiscal year 2022, primarily due to acquisition of lexington and decreased $32.1 million in fiscal year 2021 primarily due to lower costs associated with the acquisition of legg mason.
other compensation and benefits were $(4.3) million, $75.1 million, and $65.4 million for fiscal years 2022, 2021, and 2020. the changes for fiscal years 2022 and 2021 were primarily related to market adjustments on investments related to our deferred compensation plans and compensation related to minority interests. special termination benefits also decreased $18.9 million and $27.7 million in fiscal years 2022 and 2021 primarily due to workforce optimization initiatives related to the acquisition of legg mason.
we expect to incur acquisition-related retention expenses of approximately $230 million during the fiscal year ending september 30, 2023 ("fiscal year 2023"), and decreasing over the following two fiscal years by approximately $30 million and $70 million. at september 30, 2022, our global workforce had decreased to approximately 9,800 employees from approximately 10,300 at september 30, 2021.

we continue to place a high emphasis on our pay for performance philosophy. as such, any changes in the underlying performance of our investment products or changes in the composition of our incentive compensation offerings could have an impact on compensation and benefits expenses going forward. however, in order to attract and retain talented individuals, our level of compensation and benefit expenses may increase more quickly or decrease more slowly than our revenue.
sales, distribution and marketing sales, distribution and marketing expenses primarily relate to services provided by financial advisers, broker-dealers and other intermediaries to our sponsored funds, including marketing support services. substantially all distribution expenses are incurred from assets that generate distribution fees and are determined as a percentage of aum. substantially all sales expenses are incurred from the same commissionable sales transactions that generate sales fee revenues and are determined as a percentage of sales. marketing support expenses are based on aum, sales or a combination thereof. also included is the amortization of deferred sales commissions related to upfront commissions on shares sold without a front-end sales charge. the deferred sales commissions are amortized over the periods in which commissions are generally recovered from related revenues.
sales, distribution and marketing expenses by cost driver are presented below.

see note 1 - significant accounting policies and note 5 - investments in the notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8 of part ii of this annual report for information on investment accounting classifications.
total cash and cash equivalents and investments includes $3,602.0 million held for operational activities, including investments in sponsored funds and other products, and $216.4 million necessary to comply with regulatory requirements.
total cash and cash equivalents and investments includes $296.3 million attributable to employee-owned and other third-party investments made through partnerships which are offset in nonredeemable noncontrolling interests.
taxes on income our effective income tax rate for fiscal year 2022 was 22.9% as compared to 14.3% in fiscal year 2021 and 22.7% in fiscal year 2020. the rate increase in fiscal year 2022 was primarily due to the release of a tax reserve in the prior year following the close of an irs audit of the u.s. taxation of deemed foreign dividends for fiscal year 2018, net losses on investments held by cips for which there are no related tax benefits, as compared to net gains in fiscal year 2021, and a decrease in foreign earnings. the rate decrease in fiscal year 2021 was primarily due the release of the tax reserve mentioned above and net income attributable to noncontrolling interests as compared to a net loss in fiscal year 2020.
our effective income tax rate reflects the relative contributions of earnings in the jurisdictions in which we operate, which have varying tax rates. changes in our pre-tax income mix, tax rates or tax legislation in such jurisdictions may affect our effective income tax rate and net income.
supplemental non-gaap financial measures as supplemental information, we are providing performance measures for "adjusted operating income," "adjusted operating margin," "adjusted net income" and "adjusted diluted earnings per share," each of which is based on methodologies other than generally accepted accounting principles ("non-gaap measures"). management believes these non-gaap measures are useful indicators of our financial performance and may be helpful to investors in evaluating our relative performance against industry peers.
"adjusted operating income," "adjusted operating margin," "adjusted net income" and "adjusted diluted earnings per share" are defined below, followed by reconciliations of operating income, operating margin, net income attributable to franklin resources, inc. and diluted earnings per share on a u.s. gaap basis to these non-gaap measures. non-gaap measures should not be considered in isolation from, or as substitutes for, any financial information prepared in accordance with u.s. gaap, and may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies. additional reconciling items may be added in the future to these non-gaap measures if deemed appropriate.
adjusted operating income we define adjusted operating income as operating income adjusted to exclude the following:
•elimination of operating revenues upon consolidation of investment products.
•acquisition-related items:
◦acquisition-related retention compensation.
◦other acquisition-related expenses including professional fees, technology costs and fair value adjustments related to contingent consideration assets and liabilities.
◦amortization of intangible assets.
◦impairment of intangible assets and goodwill, if any.
•special termination benefits related to workforce optimization initiatives related to past acquisitions and certain initiatives undertaken by the company.
•impact on compensation and benefits expense from gains and losses on investments related to deferred compensation plans, which is offset in investment and other income (losses), net.
•impact on compensation and benefits expense related to minority interests in certain subsidiaries, which is offset in net income (loss) attributable to redeemable noncontrolling interests.
adjusted operating margin we calculate adjusted operating margin as adjusted operating income divided by adjusted operating revenues. we define adjusted operating revenues as operating revenues adjusted to exclude the following:
•elimination of operating revenues upon consolidation of investment products.
•acquisition-related performance-based investment management fees which are passed through as compensation and benefits expense.
•sales and distribution fees and a portion of investment management fees allocated to cover sales, distribution and marketing expenses paid to the financial advisers and other intermediaries who sell our funds on our behalf.
adjusted net income and adjusted diluted earnings per share we define adjusted net income as net income attributable to franklin resources, inc. adjusted to exclude the following:
•activities of cips.
•acquisition-related items:
◦acquisition-related retention compensation.
◦other acquisition-related expenses including professional fees, technology costs and fair value adjustments related to contingent consideration assets and liabilities.
◦amortization of intangible assets.
◦impairment of intangible assets and goodwill, if any.
◦write off of noncontrolling interests related to the wind down of an acquired business.
◦interest expense for amortization of legg mason debt premium from acquisition-date fair value adjustment.
•special termination benefits related to workforce optimization initiatives related to past acquisitions and certain initiatives undertaken by the company.
•net gains or losses on investments related to deferred compensation plans which are not offset by compensation and benefits expense.
•net compensation and benefits expense related to minority interests in certain subsidiaries not offset by net income (loss) attributable to redeemable noncontrolling interests.
•unrealized investment gains and losses.
•net income tax expense of the above adjustments based on the respective blended rates applicable to the adjustments.
we define adjusted diluted earnings per share as diluted earnings per share adjusted to exclude the per share impacts of the adjustments applied to net income in calculating adjusted net income.
in calculating our non-gaap measures, we adjust for the impact of cips because it is not considered reflective of our underlying results of operations. acquisition-related items and special termination benefits are excluded to facilitate comparability to other asset management firms. we adjust for compensation and benefits expense related to funded deferred compensation plans because it is partially offset in other income (expense), net. we adjust for compensation and benefits expense and net income (loss) attributable to redeemable noncontrolling interests to reflect the economics of certain profits interest arrangements. sales and distribution fees and a portion of investment management fees generally cover sales, distribution and marketing expenses and, therefore, are excluded from adjusted operating revenues. in addition, when calculating adjusted net income and adjusted diluted earnings per share we exclude unrealized investment gains and losses included in investment and other income (losses) because the related investments are generally expected to be held long term.
the calculations of adjusted operating income, adjusted operating margin, adjusted net income and adjusted diluted earnings per share are as follows:

net cash provided by operating activities increased in fiscal year 2022 primarily due to lower net purchases of investments by cips, higher net income adjusted for non-cash items and timing differences in the cash settlement of operating assets and liabilities. net cash used in investing activities increased as compared to the prior year primarily due to cash paid for acquisitions in the current year, partially offset by net liquidations of our investments as compared to net purchases in the prior year. net cash provided by financing activities decreased as compared to the prior year primarily due to proceeds from issuance of debt in the prior year, partially offset by higher net proceeds from debt of cips.
net cash provided by operating activities increased in fiscal year 2021 primarily due to higher net income, a higher adjustment for amortization of intangible assets and increases in accrued compensation and benefits, partially offset by a lower change in investments, net, adjustments for gains of cips as compared to losses in the prior year, increases in receivables and other assets and income from investments in equity method investees as compared to losses in the prior year. net cash used in investing activities decreased as compared to the prior year primarily due to lower cash paid for acquisitions, partially offset by net deconsolidation of cips as compared to net consolidation in the prior year, higher net purchases of investments by clos and net purchases of investments as compared to net liquidations in the prior year. net cash provided by financing activities increased as compared to the prior year primarily due to proceeds from debt of cips, proceeds from issuance of debt and higher net subscriptions in cips by noncontrolling interests, partially offset by higher payments on debt by cips and debt.
the assets and liabilities of cips attributable to third-party investors do not impact our liquidity and capital resources. we have no right to the cips' assets, other than our direct equity investment in them and investment management and other fees earned from them. the debt holders of the cips have no recourse to our assets beyond the level of our direct investment, therefore we bear no other risks associated with the cips' liabilities. accordingly, the assets and liabilities of cips, other than our direct investments in them, are excluded from the amounts and discussion below.
our liquid assets and debt consisted of the following:

liability debt                                            $3,376.4                  $3,399.4                     $3,017.1
liquidity liquid assets consist of cash and cash equivalents, receivables and certain investments. cash and cash equivalents at september 30, 2022 primarily consist of money market funds and deposits with financial institutions. liquid investments consist of investments in sponsored and other funds, direct investments in redeemable cips, other equity and debt securities, and time deposits with maturities greater than three months.
we utilize a significant portion of our liquid assets to satisfy operational and regulatory requirements and fund capital contributions to sponsored and other products. certain of our subsidiaries are required by our internal policy or regulation to maintain minimum levels of cash and/or capital, and may be restricted in their ability to transfer cash to their parent companies. should we require more capital than is available for use, we could elect to reduce the level of discretionary activities, such as share repurchases or investments in sponsored and other products, we could raise capital through debt or equity issuances, or utilize existing or new credit facilities. these alternatives could result in increased interest expense, decreased dividend or interest income, or other dilution to our earnings.
capital resources we believe that we can meet our present and reasonably foreseeable operating cash needs and future commitments through existing liquid assets, continuing cash flows from operations, amounts available under the credit facility discussed below, the ability to issue debt or equity securities and borrowing capacity under our uncommitted commercial paper private placement program.
on september 15, 2022, we repaid all of the outstanding $300.0 million 2.800% senior notes due in september 2022 issued by franklin resources, inc. at the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest of $4.2 million.
on september 8, 2022, we entered into a term loan credit agreement with several financial institutions to establish a 3-year term loan with an aggregate commitment of $300.0 million.
on january 10, 2022, we entered into a bi-lateral credit agreement with bank of america, n.a. to establish a 364- day revolving credit facility with an aggregate commitment of $500.0 million. on september 8, 2022, we amended and restated the credit facility to, among other things, extend its maturity to september 7, 2023. as of the time of this filing, there were no amounts outstanding.
in prior fiscal years, we issued senior unsecured unsubordinated notes for general corporate purposes and to redeem outstanding notes. at september 30, 2022, franklin's outstanding senior notes had an aggregate principal amount due of $1,600.0 million. the notes have fixed interest rates from 1.600% to 2.950% with interest paid semi-annually and have an aggregate carrying value, inclusive of unamortized discounts and debt issuance costs, of $1,583.3 million. at september 30, 2022, legg mason's outstanding senior notes had an aggregate principal amount due of $1,250.0 million. the notes have fixed interest rates from 3.950% to 5.625% with interest paid semi-annually and have an aggregate carrying value, inclusive of unamortized premium, of $1,493.1 million. effective august 2, 2021, franklin agreed to unconditionally and irrevocably guarantee all of the outstanding notes issued by legg mason.
the senior notes contain an optional redemption feature that allows us to redeem each series of notes prior to maturity in whole or in part at any time, at a make-whole redemption price. the indentures governing the senior notes contain limitations on our ability and the ability of our subsidiaries to pledge voting stock or profit participating equity interests in our subsidiaries to secure other debt without similarly securing the notes equally and ratably. in addition, the indentures include requirements that must be met if we consolidate or merge with, or sell all of our assets to, another entity. the 364-day revolving credit facility and term loan credit agreement contain a financial performance covenant requiring that the company maintains a consolidated net leverage ratio, measured as of the last day of each fiscal quarter, of no greater than 3.00 to 1.00. we were in compliance with all debt covenants at september 30, 2022.
at september 30, 2022, we had $500.0 million of short-term commercial paper available for issuance under an uncommitted private placement program which has been inactive since 2012 and is unrated.
our ability to access the capital markets in a timely manner depends on a number of factors, including our credit rating, the condition of the global economy, investors' willingness to purchase our securities, interest rates, credit spreads and the valuation levels of equity markets. if we are unable to access capital markets in a timely manner, our business could be adversely impacted.
uses of capital we expect that our main uses of cash will be to invest in and grow our business including through acquisitions, pay stockholder dividends, invest in our products, pay income taxes and operating expenses of the business, enhance technology infrastructure and business processes, repurchase shares of our common stock, and repay and service debt. while we expect to continue to repurchase shares to offset dilution from stock-based compensation, and expect to continue to repurchase shares opportunistically from time to time, we will likely spend more of our post-dividend free cash flow investing in our business, including seed capital and acquiring resources to help grow our investment teams and operations.
in the ordinary course of business, we enter into contracts or purchase obligations with third parties whereby the third parties provide goods or services to or on behalf of the company. purchase obligations include contractual amounts that will be due to purchase goods and services to be used in our operations and are recorded as liabilities in the consolidated financial statements when services are provided. at september 30, 2022, we had $706.6 million of purchase obligations.
we typically declare cash dividends on a quarterly basis, subject to approval by our board of directors. we declared regular dividends of $1.16 per share ($0.29 per share per quarter) in fiscal year 2022, and of $1.12 per share ($0.28 per share per quarter) in fiscal year 2021. we currently expect to continue paying comparable regular dividends on a quarterly basis to holders of our common stock depending upon earnings and other relevant factors.
we maintain a stock repurchase program to manage our equity capital with the objective of maximizing shareholder value. our stock repurchase program is effected through open-market purchases and private transactions in accordance with applicable laws and regulations, and is not subject to an expiration date. the size and timing of these purchases will depend on business conditions, price, market and other factors. during fiscal years 2022 and 2021, we repurchased 6.5 million and 7.3 million shares of our common stock at a cost of $180.8 million and $208.2 million. at september 30, 2022, 24.4 million shares remained available for repurchase under the authorization of 80.0 million shares approved by our board of directors in april 2018.
we routinely make cash investments in the course of launching sponsored funds. at september 30, 2022, we had $227.6 million of committed capital contributions which relate to discretionary commitments to invest in sponsored funds and other investment products and entities, including cips. these unfunded commitments are not recorded in the consolidated balance sheet.
we invested $109.2 million, net of redemptions, into our sponsored products during fiscal year 2022, and invested $182.2 million, net of redemptions, during fiscal year 2021.
on september 27, 2022 we entered into a lease agreement for office space in new york city located at one madison avenue with occupancy expected to begin in early fiscal year 2024 with an aggregate expected commitment of $766.7 million over 16 years. this is part of an initiative to consolidate our existing office space in new york city.
on november 1, 2022, we acquired all of the outstanding ownership interests in bny alcentra group holdings, inc. from the bank of new york mellon corporation for cash consideration of approximately $587.3 million paid at closing, including $188.3 million related to investments, and up to $350.0 million in contingent consideration to be paid upon on the achievement of certain performance thresholds over the next four years. we paid the purchase price from our existing cash.
on april 1, 2021, we acquired all of the outstanding ownership interests in lexington, a leading global manager of secondary private equity and co-investment funds, for cash consideration of approximately $1.0 billion and additional payments totaling $750.0 million to be paid in cash over the next three years. in connection with the acquisition, we granted a 25% profits interest in lexington and performance-based cash retention awards to certain employees that vest over approximately five years. we paid the purchase price from our existing cash.
on december 31, 2021, we acquired all of the outstanding ownership interests in osam, a leading quantitative asset management firm, for cash consideration of approximately $300.0 million, excluding future payments to be made subject to the attainment of certain performance measures. we paid the purchase price from our existing cash.
the funds that we manage have their own resources available for purposes of providing liquidity to meet shareholder redemptions, including securities that can be sold or provided to investors as in-kind redemptions, and lines of credit. increased liquidity risks and redemptions have required, and may continue to require, increased cash in the form of loans or other lines of credit to help settle redemptions and for other related purposes. while we have no legal or contractual obligation to do so, we have in certain instances voluntarily elected to provide the funds with direct or indirect financial support based on our business objectives. we did not provide financial or other support to our sponsored funds during fiscal year 2022 or 2021.
critical accounting policies our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america, which require the use of estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented. these estimates, judgments and assumptions are affected by our application of accounting policies. further, concerns about the global economic outlook and the risk of recession as well as the ongoing covid-19 pandemic have adversely affected and may continue to adversely affect, our business, financial condition and results of operations including the estimates and assumptions made by management. actual results could differ from the estimates. described below are the accounting policies that we believe are most critical to understanding our financial position and results of operations. for additional information about our accounting policies, see note 1 - significant accounting policies in the notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8 of part ii of this annual report.
consolidation we consolidate our subsidiaries and investment products in which we have a controlling financial interest. we have a controlling financial interest when we own a majority of the voting interest in a voting interest entity ("voe") or are the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity ("vie").
a vie is an entity in which the equity investment holders have not contributed sufficient capital to finance its activities or do not have defined rights and obligations normally associated with an equity investment. the assessment of whether an entity is a vie or voe involves judgment and analysis on a structure by structure basis. when performing the assessment, we consider factors such as the entity's legal organization, design and capital structure, the rights of the equity investment holders and our contractual involvement with and ownership interest in the entity. our vies are primarily investment products and our variable interests consist of our equity ownership interests in and investment management fees earned from these products.
we are the primary beneficiary of a vie if we have the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the vie's economic performance and the obligation to absorb losses of or right to receive benefits from the vie that could potentially be significant to the vie. investment management fees earned from vies are excluded from the primary beneficiary determination if they are deemed to be at market and commensurate with service. the key assumption used in the analysis includes the amount of aum. these estimates and assumptions are subject to variability. for example, aum is impacted by market volatility and the level of sales, redemptions, distributions to investors and reinvested distributions. there is judgment involved in assessing whether we have the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact vies' economic performance and the obligation to absorb losses of or right to receive benefits from vies that could potentially be significant to the vies. as of september 30, 2022, we were the primary beneficiary of 53 investment product vies.
business combinations business combinations are accounted for by recognizing the acquired assets, including separately identifiable intangible assets, and assumed liabilities at their acquisition-date estimated fair values. any excess of the purchase consideration over the acquisition-date fair values of these identifiable assets and liabilities is recognized as goodwill. determining the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions. during the measurement period, which is not to exceed one year from the acquisition date, we may record adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, with the corresponding offset to goodwill. upon the conclusion of the measurement period, any subsequent adjustments are recorded in earnings.
intangible assets acquired in business combinations consist primarily of investment management contracts and trade names. the fair values of the acquired management contracts are based on the net present value of estimated future cash flows attributable to the contracts, which include significant assumptions about forecasts of the aum growth rate, pre-tax profit margin, discount rate, average effective fee rate and effective tax rate. the fair value of trade names is determined using the relief from royalty method based on net present value of estimated future cash flows, which include significant assumptions about royalty rate, revenue growth rate, discount rate and effective tax rate. our estimates are based on assumptions believed to be reasonable, but are inherently uncertain and unpredictable and, as a result, may differ from actual results.
our management contract intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives, which range from three to sixteen years, using the straight-line method, unless the asset is determined to have an indefinite useful life. indefinite-lived intangible assets represent contracts to manage investment assets for which there is no foreseeable limit on the contract period. trade names are amortized over their estimated useful lives which range from five to twenty years using the straight-line method.
goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are tested for impairment annually and when an event occurs or circumstances change that more likely than not reduce the fair value of the related reporting unit or indefinite-lived intangible asset below its carrying value. we have one reporting unit, investment management and related services, consistent with our single operating segment, to which all goodwill has been assigned. we make significant estimates and assumptions when evaluating goodwill and other intangible assets for impairment.
we may first assess goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for qualitative factors to determine whether it is necessary to perform a quantitative impairment test. the qualitative analysis considers entity-specific and macroeconomic factors and their potential impact on key assumptions used in the determination of the fair value of the reporting unit or indefinite-lived intangible asset. a quantitative impairment test is performed if the results of the qualitative assessment indicate that it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value or an indefinite-lived intangible asset is impaired, or if a qualitative assessment is not performed. quantitative tests compare the fair value of the asset to its carrying value.
the fair values of the reporting unit and indefinite-lived intangible assets are based on the net present value of estimated future cash flows, which include significant assumptions about the aum growth rate, pre-tax profit margin, discount rate, average effective fee rate and effective tax rate. the most relevant of these assumptions to the determination of estimated fair value are the aum growth rate, pre-tax profit margin and the discount rate.
we performed a qualitative annual impairment test for goodwill and all indefinite-lived intangible assets as of august 1, 2022 and concluded it is more likely than not that the fair values of the reporting unit and the indefinite-lived intangible assets exceed their carrying values.
we subsequently monitored market conditions and their potential impact on the assumptions used in the annual assessment to determine whether circumstances have changed that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of the reporting unit below its carrying value, or indicate that the other indefinite-lived intangible assets might be impaired. we considered, among other things, changes in our aum and weighted-average cost of capital by assessing whether these changes would impact the reasonableness of our impairment assessment as of august 1, 2022. we also monitored fluctuations of our common stock per share price to evaluate our market capitalization relative to the reporting unit as a whole. subsequent to august 1, 2022, there were no impairments of goodwill or indefinite-lived intangible assets as no events occurred or circumstances changed that would indicate these assets might be impaired.
we test definite-lived intangible assets for impairment quarterly. impairment is indicated when the carrying value of an asset is not recoverable and exceeds its fair value. recoverability is evaluated based on estimated undiscounted future cash flows using assumptions about the aum growth rate, pre-tax profit margin, average effective fee rate and expected useful life as well as royalty rate for trade name intangible assets. the most relevant of these assumptions to determine future cash flows is the aum growth rate. if the carrying value of an asset is not recoverable through undiscounted cash flows, impairment is recognized in the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the asset's fair value, as determined by discounted cash flows or other methods as appropriate for the asset type. there were no impairments of definite-lived intangible assets during fiscal year 2022.
while we believe that the assumptions used to estimate fair value in our impairment tests are reasonable and appropriate, future changes in the assumptions could result in recognition of impairment.
fair value measurements our investments are primarily recorded at fair value or amounts that approximate fair value on a recurring basis. we use a three-level fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value based on whether the inputs to those valuation techniques are observable or unobservable. the assessment of the hierarchy level of the assets or liabilities measured at fair value is determined based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety. see note 1 - significant accounting policies in the notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8 of part ii of this annual report for more information on the fair value hierarchy.
as of september 30, 2022, level 3 assets represented 12% of total assets measured at fair value, substantially all of which related to cips' investments in equity and debt securities, and real estate. there were $5.8 million of transfers into and $9.3 million of transfers out of level 3 during fiscal year 2022.
the following are descriptions of the significant assets measured at fair value and their fair value methodologies.
sponsored funds and separate accounts consist primarily of investments in nonconsolidated sponsored funds and to a lesser extent, separate accounts. changes in the fair value of the investments are recognized as gains and losses in earnings. the fair values of fund products are determined based on their published nav or estimated using nav as a practical expedient. the fair values of the underlying investments in the separate accounts are determined using quoted market prices, or independent third-party broker or dealer price quotes if quoted market prices are not available.
investments related to long-term incentive plans consist primarily of investments in sponsored funds related to certain compensation plans that have certain vesting provisions. changes in fair value are recognized as gains and losses in earnings. the fair values of the investments are determined based on the fund products' published nav or estimated using nav as a practical expedient.
other equity and debt securities consist of other equity investment securities and debt securities carried at fair value. changes in the fair value are recognized as gains and losses in earnings. the fair values of equity securities, excluding fund products, and debt securities are determined using independent third-party broker or dealer price quotes or based on either a market-based or income-based approach using significant unobservable inputs. the fair values of fund products are determined based on their published nav or estimated using nav as a practical expedient.
investments of cips consist of marketable debt and equity securities and other investments that are not generally traded in active markets. changes in the fair value of the investments are recognized as gains and losses in earnings. the fair values of marketable securities are determined using quoted market prices, or independent third-party broker or dealer price quotes if quoted market prices are not available. the investments that are not generally traded in active markets consist of loans, other equity and debt securities of entities in emerging markets, fund products and real estate. the fair values are determined using significant unobservable inputs in either a market-based or income-based approach, except for fund products, for which fair values are estimated using nav as a practical expedient.
noncontrolling interests consist of third-party equity interests in cips and minority interests in certain subsidiaries. noncontrolling interests that are redeemable or convertible for cash or other assets at the option of the noncontrolling interest holders and are classified as temporary equity at fair value, except when the fair value is less than the issuance date fair value, the reported amount is the issuance date fair value. changes in fair value of redeemable noncontrolling interest is recognized as an adjustment to retained earnings. nonredeemable noncontrolling interests do not permit the noncontrolling interest holders to request settlement, are reported at their issuance value and undistributed net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests.
the fair value of third-party equity interests in cips are determined based on the published nav or estimated using nav a practical expedient. the fair values of redeemable noncontrolling interests related to minority interest in certain subsidiaries are determined using discounted cash flows and guideline public company methods, which include significant assumptions about forecasts of the aum growth rate, pre-tax profit margin, discount rate and public company earnings multiples.
revenues we earn revenue primarily from providing investment management and related services to our customers, which are generally investment products or investors in separate accounts. related services include fund administration, sales and distribution, and shareholder servicing. revenues are recognized when our obligations related to the services are satisfied and it is probable that a significant reversal of the revenue amount would not occur in future periods. the obligations are satisfied over time as the services are rendered, except for the sales and distribution obligations for the sale of shares of sponsored funds, which are satisfied on trade date. multiple services included in customer contracts are accounted for separately when the obligations are determined to be distinct.
fees from providing investment management and fund administration services ("investment management fees"), other than performance-based investment management fees, are determined based on a percentage of aum, primarily on a monthly basis using daily average aum, and are recognized as the services are performed over time. performance-based investment management fees are generated when investment products' performance exceeds targets established in customer contracts. these fees are recognized when significant reversal of the amount is no longer probable and may relate to investment management services that were provided in prior periods.
sales and distribution fees primarily consist of upfront sales commissions and ongoing distribution fees. sales commissions are based on contractual rates for sales of certain classes of sponsored funds and are recognized on trade date. distribution service fees are determined based on a percentage of aum, primarily on a monthly basis using daily average aum. as the fee amounts are uncertain on trade date, they are recognized over time as the amounts become known and may relate to sales and distribution services provided in prior periods.
aum is generally based on the fair value of the underlying securities held by investment products and is calculated using fair value methods derived primarily from unadjusted quoted market prices, unadjusted independent third-party broker or dealer price quotes in active markets, or market prices or price quotes adjusted for observable price movements after the close of the primary market. the fair values of securities for which market prices are not readily available are valued internally using various methodologies which incorporate significant unobservable inputs as appropriate for each security type. pricing of the securities is governed by our global valuation and pricing policy, which defines valuation and pricing conventions for each security type, including practices for responding to unexpected or unusual market events.
as substantially all of our aum is valued based on observable market prices or inputs, market risk is the most significant risk underlying the valuation of our aum.
income taxes deferred tax assets and liabilities are recorded for temporary differences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and the reported amounts in the consolidated financial statements using the statutory tax rates in effect for the year when the reported amount of the asset or liability is expected to be recovered or settled, respectively. the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income tax expense in the period that includes the enactment date. a valuation allowance is recorded to reduce the carrying values of deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized. in assessing whether a valuation allowance should be established against a deferred income tax asset, we consider all positive and negative evidence, which includes timing of expiration, projected sources of taxable income, limitations on utilization under the statute and the effectiveness of prudent and feasible tax planning strategies among other factors. for each tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return, we utilize significant judgment related to the range of possible favorable or unfavorable outcomes to determine whether it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination based on the technical merits of the position, including resolution of any related appeals or litigation. a tax position that meets the more likely than not recognition threshold is measured at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50% likely of being realized upon settlement.
we operate in numerous countries, states and other taxing jurisdictions. the income tax laws are complex and subject to different interpretations by the taxpayer and the relevant taxing authorities. significant judgment is required in the determination of our annual income tax provisions, which includes the assessment of deferred tax assets and uncertain tax positions, as well as the interpretation and application of existing and newly enacted tax laws, regulation changes, and new judicial rulings. we repatriate foreign earnings that are in excess of regulatory, capital or operational requirements of all of our non-u.s. subsidiaries.
it is possible that actual results will vary from those recognized in our consolidated financial statements due to changes in the interpretation of applicable guidance or as a result of examinations by taxing authorities.
loss contingencies we are involved in various lawsuits and claims encountered in the normal course of business. when such a matter arises and periodically thereafter, we consult with our legal counsel and evaluate the merits of the claims based on the facts available at that time. in management's opinion, an adequate accrual has been made as of september 30, 2022 to provide for any probable losses that may arise from such matters for which we could reasonably estimate an amount. see also note 15 - commitments and contingencies in the notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8 of part ii of this annual report.

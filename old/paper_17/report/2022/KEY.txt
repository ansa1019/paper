risk factors, there continues to be uncertainty associated with, but not limited to, potential imprecision in the estimation process due to the inherent time lag of obtaining information and normal variations between estimates and actual outcomes. we provide additional reserves that are designed to provide coverage for losses attributable to such risks. the alll also includes factors that may not be directly measured in the determination of individual or collective reserves. such qualitative factors may include:
• the nature and volume of the institution's financial assets;
• the existence, growth, and effect of any concentrations of credit;
• the volume and severity of past due financial assets, the volume of nonaccrual assets, and the volume and severity of adversely classified or graded assets;
• the value of the underlying collateral for loans that are not collateral dependent;
• the institution's lending policies and procedures, including changes in underwriting standards and practices for collections, write-offs, and recoveries;
• the quality of the institution's credit review function;
• the experience, ability, and depth of the institution's lending, investment, collection, and other relevant management and staff;
• the effect of other external factors such as the regulatory, legal and technological environments; competition;
and events such as natural disasters; and
• actual and expected changes in international, national, regional, and local economic and business conditions and developments in which the institution operates that affect the collectability of financial assets.
liability for credit losses on lending-related commitments the liability for credit losses on lending-related commitments, such as letters of credit and unfunded loan commitments, is included in "accrued expense and other liabilities" on the balance sheet. expected credit losses are estimated over the contractual period in which we are exposed to credit risk via a contractual obligation unless that obligation is unconditionally cancellable by us. the liability for credit losses on lending-related commitments is
108
table of contents adjusted as a provision for credit losses. the estimate includes consideration of the likelihood that funding will occur and an estimate of expected credit losses on commitments expected to be funded over its estimated useful life. consistent with our estimation process on our loan and lease portfolio, we use a non-dcf factor-based approach to estimate expected credit losses that include component pd/lgd/ead models as well as less complex estimation methods for smaller portfolios.
allowance for credit losses on other financial assets the allowance for credit losses on other financial assets, such as other receivables and servicing advances, is determined based on historical loss information and other available indicators. if such information does not indicate any expected credit losses, key may estimate the allowance for credit losses on other financial assets to be zero or close to zero.
fair value measurements fair value is defined as the price to sell an asset or transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants in the principal market. therefore, fair value represents an exit price at the measurement date. we value our assets and liabilities based on the principal or most advantageous market where each would be sold (in the case of assets) or transferred (in the case of liabilities). in the absence of observable market transactions, we consider liquidity valuation adjustments to reflect the uncertainty in pricing the instruments.
valuation inputs can be observable or unobservable. observable inputs are assumptions based on market data obtained from an independent source. unobservable inputs are assumptions based on our own information or assessment of assumptions used by other market participants in pricing the asset or liability. our unobservable inputs are based on the best and most current information available on the measurement date.
all inputs, whether observable or unobservable, are ranked in accordance with a prescribed fair value hierarchy that gives the highest ranking to quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (level 1) and the lowest ranking to unobservable inputs (level 3). fair values for level 2 assets and liabilities are based on one or a combination of the following factors: (i) quoted market prices for similar assets or liabilities; (ii)
observable inputs, such as interest rates or yield curves; or (iii) inputs derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data. the level in the fair value hierarchy ascribed to a fair value measurement in its entirety is based on the lowest level input that is significant to the measurement. assets and liabilities may transfer between levels based on the observable and unobservable inputs used at the valuation date.
assets and liabilities are recorded at fair value on a recurring or nonrecurring basis. nonrecurring fair value adjustments are typically recorded as a result of the application of lower of cost or fair value accounting; or impairment. at a minimum, we conduct our valuations quarterly.
additional information regarding fair value measurements and disclosures is provided in note 6 ("fair value measurements").
short-term investments short-term investments consist of segregated, interest-bearing deposits due from banks, the federal reserve, and certain non-u.s. banks as well as reverse repurchase agreements and united states treasury bills with an original maturity of three months or less.
trading account assets trading account assets are debt and equity securities, as well as commercial loans, that we purchase and hold but intend to sell in the near term. these assets are reported at fair value. realized and unrealized gains and losses on trading account assets are reported in "other income" on the income statement.
109
table of contents securities securities available for sale. debt securities that we intend to hold for an indefinite period of time but that may be sold in response to changes in interest rates, prepayment risk, liquidity needs, or other factors are classified as available-for-sale and reported at fair value. realized gains and losses resulting from sales of securities using the specific identification method, are included in "other income" on the income statement. unrealized holding gains are recorded through other comprehensive income. unrealized losses in fair value below the amortized cost basis are assessed to determine whether the impairment gets recorded through other comprehensive income or through earnings using a valuation allowance.
for available-for-sale securities in an unrealized loss position, we first assess whether we intend to sell, or it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis.
if either of these criteria regarding intent or requirement to sell is met, the security's amortized cost basis is written down to fair value in "other income" on the income statement. for debt securities that do not meet the aforementioned criteria, we evaluate whether the decline in fair value has resulted from credit losses or other factors. in making this assessment, management considers the extent to which fair value is less than amortized costs, the nature of the security, the underlying collateral, and the financial condition of the issuers, among other factors. if this assessment indicates a credit loss exists, the present value of cash flows expected to be collected from the security are compared to the amortized cost basis of the security. if the present value of the cash flows expected to be collected is less than the amortized cost basis, a credit loss exists and an allowance for available-for-sale securities is recorded for the credit loss, limited by the amount that the fair value is less than the amortized costs basis. any impairment that has not been recorded through an allowance for available-
for-sale securities is recognized in other comprehensive income.
changes in the allowance for available-for-sale securities are recorded as provision for (or reversal of) credit loss. losses are charged against the allowance for available-for-sale securities when management believes the uncollectibility of an available-for-sale security is confirmed or when either criteria regarding intent or requirement to sell is met.
"other securities" held in the available-for-sale portfolio consist of convertible preferred stock of privately held companies. for additional information, refer to note 7 ("securities").
held-to-maturity securities. debt securities that we have the intent and ability to hold until maturity are classified as held-to-maturity and are carried at cost and adjusted for amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts using the interest method. this method produces a constant rate of return on the adjusted carrying amount.
the held-to-maturity portfolio is classified by the following major security types: agency residential collateralized mortgage obligations, agency residential mortgage-backed securities, agency commercial mortgage-
backed securities, asset backed securities, and other. "other securities" held in the held-to-maturity portfolio consist of foreign bonds and capital securities. management measures expected credit losses on held-to-maturity securities on a collective basis by major security type. the estimate of expected losses considers historical credit loss information that is adjusted for current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts. we do not measure expected credit losses on held-to-maturity securities in which historical credit loss information adjusted for current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts results in an expectation that nonpayment of the amortized cost basis is zero.
all of our mortgage-backed securities are issued by u.s. government-sponsored enterprises or gnma, are highly rated by major rating agencies and have a long history of no credit losses. our asset backed securities consist primarily of senior notes from the sale and securitization of our indirect auto portfolio. other securities are comprised of state of israel bonds denominated and paid in u.s. dollars. israel bonds have a long history of no credit losses.
additionally, as of december 31, 2022, the state of israel's credit rating is "stable" or "positive" among fitch, moody's, and s&p (a+, a1, aa-).
other investments other investments include equity and mezzanine instruments as well as other types of investments that generally are carried at the alternative cost method. the alternative cost method results in these investments being recorded at cost, less any impairment, plus or minus changes resulting from observable market transactions. adjustments are
110
table of contents included in "other income" on the income statement. at each reporting period, we assess if these investments continue to qualify for this measurement alternative.
derivatives and hedging all derivatives are recognized on the balance sheet at fair value in "accrued income and other assets" or " accrued expense and other liabilities." the net increase or decrease in derivatives is included in "other operating activities, net" within the statement of cash flows. accounting for changes in fair value (i.e., gains or losses)
of derivatives differs depending on whether the derivative has been designated and qualifies as part of a hedge relationship, and on the type of hedge relationship. for derivatives that are not in a hedge relationship, any gain or loss, as well as any premium paid or received, is recognized immediately in earnings in "corporate services income" or "other income" on the income statement, depending whether the derivative is for customer accommodation or risk management, respectively. a derivative that is designated and qualifies as a hedging instrument must be designated as a fair value hedge, a cash flow hedge, or a hedge of a net investment in a foreign operation. changes in the fair value of a hedging instrument are reflected in the same income statement line as the earnings effect of the change in fair value of the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk.
a fair value hedge is used to limit exposure to changes in the fair value of existing assets, liabilities, and commitments caused by changes in interest rates or other economic factors. the change in the fair value of an instrument designated as a fair value hedge is recorded in earnings at the same time as a change in fair value of the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk.
a cash flow hedge is used to minimize the variability of future cash flows that is caused by changes in interest rates or other economic factors. the gain or loss on a cash flow hedge is recorded as a component of aoci on the balance sheet and reclassified to earnings in the same period in which the hedged transaction affects earnings
(e.g., when we incur variable-rate interest on debt, earn variable-rate interest on loans, or sell commercial real estate loans).
a net investment hedge is used to hedge the exposure of changes in the carrying value of investments as a result of changes in the related foreign exchange rates. the gain or loss on a net investment hedge is recorded as a component of aoci on the balance sheet when the terms of the derivative match the notional and currency risk being hedged. the amount in aoci is reclassified into income when the hedged transaction affects earnings (e.g., when we dispose or liquidate a foreign subsidiary).
hedge "effectiveness" is determined by the extent to which changes in the fair value of a derivative instrument offset changes in the fair value, cash flows, or carrying value attributable to the risk being hedged. if the relationship between the change in the fair value of the derivative instrument and the change in the hedged item falls within a range considered to be the industry norm, the hedge is considered "highly effective" and qualifies for hedge accounting. a hedge is "ineffective" if the relationship between the changes falls outside the acceptable range. in that case, hedge accounting is discontinued on a prospective basis. hedge effectiveness is tested at least quarterly.
we take into account the impact of bilateral collateral and master netting agreements that allow us to settle all derivative contracts held with a single counterparty on a net basis, and to offset the net derivative position with the related cash collateral when recognizing derivative assets and liabilities. as a result, we could have derivative contracts with negative fair values included in derivative assets on the balance sheet and contracts with positive fair values included in derivative liabilities. derivative assets and derivative liabilities are recorded within "accrued income and other assets" and "accrued expense and other liabilities," respectively.
additional information regarding the accounting for derivatives is provided in note 8 ("derivatives and hedging activities").
loan sales and securitizations we sell and at times may securitize loans and other financial assets. we recognize the sale and securitization of loans or other financial assets when the transferred assets are legally isolated from our creditors and the appropriate accounting criteria are met. when we securitize loans or other financial assets, we may retain a portion of the securities issued, including senior interests, subordinated interests, interest-only strips, servicing rights, and other interests, all of which are considered retained interests in the transferred assets.
the interests are initially measured at fair value which is based on independent third party market prices or market prices for similar assets.
111
table of contents if market prices are not available, fair value is estimated based on the present value of expected future cash flows using assumptions as to discount rates, interest rates, prepayment speeds, and credit losses. loans sold or securitized are removed from the balance sheet and a net gain or loss is recorded depending on the fair value of the loans sold and the retained interests at the date of sale. the net gain or loss is recognized in "other income," "consumer mortgage income," or "investment banking and debt placement fees" at the time of sale.
servicing assets we service commercial real estate and residential mortgage loans. servicing assets and liabilities purchased or retained are initially measured at fair value and are recorded as a component of "accrued income and other assets"
on the balance sheet. when no ready market value (such as quoted market prices, or prices based on sales or purchases of similar assets) is available to determine the fair value of servicing assets, fair value is determined by calculating the present value of future cash flows associated with servicing the loans. this calculation is based on a number of assumptions, including the market cost of servicing, the discount rate, the prepayment rate, and the default rate.
we account for our servicing assets using the amortization method. the amortization of servicing assets is determined in proportion to, and over the period of, the estimated net servicing income and recorded in either
"consumer mortgage income" or "commercial mortgage servicing fees" on the income statement.
servicing assets are evaluated quarterly for possible impairment. this process involves stratifying the assets based upon one or more predominant risk characteristics and determining the fair value of each class. the characteristics may include financial asset type, size, interest rate, date of origination, term and geographic location. if the evaluation indicates that the carrying amount of the servicing assets exceeds their fair value, the carrying amount is reduced by recording a charge to income in the amount of such excess and establishing a valuation reserve allowance. if impairment is determined to be other-than-temporary, a direct write-off of the carrying amount would be recorded.additional information pertaining to servicing assets is included in note 9
("mortgage servicing assets").
leases for leases where key is the lessee that have initial terms greater than one year, right-of-use assets and corresponding lease liabilities are reported on the balance sheet. leases with an initial term of less than one year are not recorded on the balance sheet. our leases where key is the lessee are primarily classified as operating leases. operating lease expense is recognized in "net occupancy" and "equipment" on a straight-line basis over the lease term.for additional information, see note 10 ("leases").
premises and equipment premises and equipment, including leasehold improvements, are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization. we determine depreciation of premises and equipment using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the particular assets. leasehold improvements are amortized using the straight-line method over the shorter of their useful lives or terms of the leases. premises and equipment are evaluated for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable.
goodwill and other intangible assets goodwill represents the amount by which the cost of net assets acquired in a business combination exceeds their f air value. goodwill is assigned to reporting units as of the acquisition date based on the expected benefit to such reporting unit from the synergies of the business combination. goodwill is not amortized. goodwill is tested at the reporting unit level for impairment, at least annually as of october 1, or when indicators of impairment exist.
we may elect to perform a qualitative analysis to determine whether or not it is more-likely-than-not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. when conducting a qualitative analysis, we evaluate both internal and external factors, including recent performance, updated projections, stock prices and economic conditions. if we elect to bypass this qualitative analysis, or conclude via qualitative analysis that it is more-
likely-than-not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value, a quantitative goodwill impairment test is performed. if the fair value is less than the carrying value, an impairment charge is recorded for the difference.
112
table of contents beginning january 1, 2021, the amount of capital being allocated to our reporting units as a proxy for the carrying value is based on a combination of regulatory and economic equity. fair values are estimated using a combination of market and income approaches. the market approach incorporates comparable public company multiples along with data related to recent merger and acquisition activity. the income approach consists of discounted cash flow modeling that utilizes internal forecasts and various other inputs and assumptions. a multi-year internal forecast is prepared for each reporting unit and a terminal growth rate is estimated for each one based on market expectations of inflation and economic conditions in the financial services industry. earnings projections for reporting units are adjusted for after tax cost savings expected to be realized by a market participant. the discount rate applied to our cash flows is derived from the capm. the buildup to the discount rate includes a risk-free rate, 5-year adjusted beta based on peer companies, a market equity risk premium, a size premium and a company specific risk premium. the discount rates differ between our reporting units as they have different levels of risk. a sensitivity analysis is typically performed on key assumptions, such as the discount rates and cost savings estimates.
other intangible assets with finite lives are amortized on either an accelerated or straight-line basis. we monitor for impairment indicators for goodwill and other intangible assets on a quarterly basis.additional information pertaining to goodwill and other intangible assets is included in note 12 ("goodwill and other intangible assets").
business combinations we account for our business combinations using the acquisition method of accounting. under this accounting method, the acquired company's assets and liabilities are recorded at fair value at the date of acquisition, except as provided for by the applicable accounting guidance, and the results of operations of the acquired company are combined with key's results from the date of acquisition forward. acquisition costs are expensed when incurred. the difference between the purchase price and the fair value of the net assets acquired (including identifiable intangible assets) is recorded as goodwill. our accounting policy for intangible assets is summarized in this note under the heading "goodwill and other intangible assets."
additional information regarding acquisitions is provided in note 15 ("acquisitions and discontinued operations").
securities financing activities we enter into repurchase agreements to finance overnight customer sweep deposits. we also enter into repurchase and reverse repurchase agreements to settle other securities obligations. we account for these securities financing agreements as collateralized financing transactions. repurchase and reverse repurchase agreements are recorded on the balance sheet at the amounts that the securities will be subsequently sold or repurchased. securities borrowed transactions are recorded on the balance sheet at the amounts of cash collateral advanced. while our securities financing agreements incorporate a right of set off, the assets and liabilities are reported on a gross basis.
reverse repurchase agreements and securities borrowed transactions are included in "short-term investments" on the balance sheet; repurchase agreements are included in "federal funds purchased and securities sold under repurchase agreements." fees received in connection with these transactions are recorded in interest income; fees paid are recorded in interest expense.
additional information regarding securities financing activities is included in note 16 ("securities financing activities").
contingencies and guarantees we recognize liabilities for the fair value of our obligations under certain guarantees issued. these liabilities are included in "accrued expense and other liabilities" on the balance sheet. if we receive a fee for a guarantee requiring liability recognition, the amount of the fee represents the initial fair value of the "stand ready"
obligation. if there is no fee, the fair value of the stand ready obligation is determined using expected present value measurement techniques, unless observable transactions for comparable guarantees are available. the subsequent accounting for these stand ready obligations depends on the nature of the underlying guarantees. we account for our release from risk under a particular guarantee when the guarantee expires or is settled, or by a systematic and rational amortization method, depending on the risk profile of the guarantee. contingent aspects of certain guarantees are assessed a reserve under cecl if required.
113
table of contents contingent liabilities may result from litigation, claims and assessments, loss or damage to key. we recognize liabilities from contingencies when a loss is probable and can be reasonably estimated.
additional information regarding contingencies and guarantees is included in note 22 ("commitments, contingent liabilities, and guarantees").
revenue recognition we recognize revenues as they are earned based on contractual terms, as transactions occur, or as services are provided and collectability is reasonably assured. our principal source of revenue is interest income from loans and investments. we also earn noninterest income from various banking and financial services offered through both the commercial and consumer banks.
interest income. the largest source of revenue for us is interest income. interest income is primarily recognized on an accrual basis according to nondiscretionary formulas in written contracts, such as loan agreements or securities contracts.
noninterest income. we earn noninterest income through a variety of financial and transaction services provided to commercial and consumer clients. revenue is recorded for noninterest income based on the contractual terms for the service or transaction performed. in certain circumstances, noninterest income is reported net of associated expenses.
trust and investment services income. trust and investment services revenues include brokerage commissions trust and asset management commissions.
revenue from trade execution and brokerage services is earned through commissions from trade execution on behalf of clients. revenue from these transactions is recognized at the trade date. any ongoing service fees are recognized on a monthly basis as services are performed.
trust and asset management services include asset custody and investment management services provided to individual and institutional customers. revenue is recognized monthly based on a minimum annual fee, and the market value of assets in custody. additional fees are recognized for transactional activity at a point in time.
investment banking and debt placement fees. investment banking and debt placement fees consist of syndication fees, debt and equity underwriting fees, financial advisor fees, gains on sales of commercial mortgages, and agency origination fees. revenues for these services are recorded at a point in time, upon completion of a contractually identified transaction, or when an advisory opinion is provided. investment banking and debt placement costs are reported on a gross basis within other expense on the income statement.
service charges on deposit accounts. revenue from service charges on deposit accounts is earned through cash management, wire transfer, and other deposit-related services as well as overdraft, non-sufficient funds, account management and other deposit-related fees. revenue is recognized for these services either over time, corresponding with deposit accounts' monthly cycle, or at a point in time for transactional related services and fees. certain reward costs are netted within revenues from service charges on deposits.
corporate services income. corporate services income includes various ancillary service revenue including letter of credit fees, loan fees, certain non-hedging derivatives gains and losses, and certain capital market fees. revenue from these fees is recorded in a manner that reflects the timing of when transactions occur, and as services are provided.
cards and payments income. cards and payments income consists of debit card, consumer and commercial credit card, and merchant services income. revenue sources include interchange fees from credit and debit cards processed through card association networks, merchant services, and other card related services. interchange rates are generally set by the credit card associations and based on purchase volumes and other factors. interchange fees are recognized as transactions occur. certain card network costs and reward costs are netted within interchange revenues. merchant services income represents account management fees and transaction fees charged to merchants for the processing of card association network transactions. merchant services revenue is recognized as transactions occur, or as services are performed.
114
table of contents corporate-owned life insurance income. income from corporate-owned life insurance primarily represents changes in the cash surrender value of life insurance policies held on certain key employees. revenue is recognized in each period based on the change in the cash surrender value during the period.
stock-based compensation stock-based compensation is measured using the fair value method of accounting on the grant date. the measured cost is recognized over the period during which the recipient is required to provide service in exchange for the award.
we estimate expected forfeitures when stock-based awards are granted and record compensation expense only for awards that are expected to vest. compensation expense related to awards granted to employees is recorded in
"personnel expense" on the consolidated statements of income while compensation expense related to awards granted to directors is recorded in "other expense."
we recognize compensation expense for stock-based, mandatory deferred incentive compensation awards using the accelerated method of amortization over a period of approximately 5years (the current year performance period and a four-yearvesting period, which generally starts in the first quarter following the performance period).
we estimate the fair value of options granted using the black-scholes option-pricing model, as further described in note 17 ("stock-based compensation"). employee stock options typically become exercisable at the rate of 25% per year, beginning one year after the grant date. options expire no later than 10years after their grant date. we recognize stock-based compensation expense for stock options with graded vesting using an accelerated method of amortization.
we use shares repurchased under our annual capital plan submitted to our regulators (treasury shares) for share issuances under all stock-based compensation programs.
income taxes deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on temporary differences between financial statement asset and liability amounts and their respective tax bases, and are measured using enacted tax laws and rates that are expected to apply in the periods in which the deferred tax assets or liabilities are expected to be realized.
deferred tax assets are also recorded for any tax attributes, such as tax credit and net operating loss carryforwards. the net balance of deferred tax assets and liabilities is reported in "accrued income and other assets" or "accrued expense and other liabilities" in the consolidated balance sheets, as appropriate. subsequent changes in the tax laws require adjustment to these assets and liabilities with the cumulative effect included in the provision for income taxes for the period in which the change is enacted. a valuation allowance is recognized for a deferred tax asset if, based on the weight of available evidence, it is more-likely-than-not that some portion or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized.
earnings per share basic net income per common share is calculated using the two-class method. the two-class method is an earnings allocation formula that determines earnings per share for each share of common stock and participating securities according to dividends declared (distributed earnings) and participation rights in undistributed earnings.
distributed and undistributed earnings are allocated between common and participating security shareholders based on their respective rights to receive dividends. nonvested share-based payment awards that contain nonforfeitable rights to dividends or dividend equivalents are considered participating securities (e.g., nonvested service-based restricted stock units). undistributed net losses are not allocated to nonvested restricted shareholders, as these shareholders do not have a contractual obligation to fund the incurred losses. net income attributable to common shares is then divided by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the period.
diluted net income per common share is calculated using the more dilutive of either the treasury method or the two-
class method. the dilutive calculation considers the potential dilutive effect of common stock equivalents determined under the treasury stock method. common stock equivalents include stock options and service- and performance-based restricted stock and stock units granted under our stock plans. net income attributable to common shares is then divided by the total of weighted-average number of common shares and common stock equivalents outstanding during the period.

3. restrictions on cash, dividends, and lending activities capital distributions from keybank and other subsidiaries are our principal source of cash flows for paying dividends on our common and preferred shares, servicing our debt, and financing corporate operations. federal banking law limits the amount of capital distributions that a bank can make to its holding company without prior regulatory approval. a national bank's dividend-paying capacity is affected by several factors, including net profits (as defined by statute) for the previous two calendar years and for the current year, up to the date the dividend is declared.
during 2022, keybank paid $ 475million in dividends to keycorp. at january 1, 2023, keybank had regulatory capacity to pay $ 2.3billion in dividends to keycorp without prior regulatory approval. at december 31, 2022, keycorp held $
3.2billion in cash and short-term investments, which can be used to pay dividends to shareholders, service debt, and finance corporate operations.

(a) excludes a provision related to reserves on lending-related commitments of $ 56million.
as described in note 1 ("basis of presentation and accounting policies"), we estimate the alll using relevant available information, from internal and external sources, relating to past events, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts. in our estimation of expected credit losses, we use a two year reasonable and supportable period across all products. following this two year period in which supportable forecasts can be generated, for all modeled loan portfolios, we revert expected credit losses to a level that is consistent with our historical information by reverting the macroeconomic variables (model inputs) to their long run average. we revert to historical loss rates for less complex estimation methods for smaller portfolios. a 20 year fixed length look back period is used to calculate the long run average of the macroeconomic variables. a four quarter reversion period is used where the macroeconomic variables linearly revert to their long run average following the two year reasonable and supportable period.
we develop our reasonable and supportable forecasts using relevant data including, but not limited to, changes in economic output, unemployment rates, property values, and other factors associated with the credit losses on financial assets. some macroeconomic variables apply to all portfolio segments, while others are more portfolio specific. the following table discloses key macroeconomic variables for each loan portfolio.

(a) variables include all transformations and interactions with other risk drivers. additionally, variables may have varying impacts at different points in the economic cycle.
in addition to macroeconomic drivers, portfolio attributes such as remaining term, outstanding balance, risk ratings, utilization, fico, ltv, and delinquency also drive alll changes. our alll models were designed to capture the correlation between economic and portfolio changes. as such, evaluating shifts in individual portfolio attributes and macroeconomic variables in isolation may not be indicative of past or future performance.

table of contents economic outlook as of december 31, 2022, the outlook is for slow, but positive economic growth over the forecasting horizon.
unemployment is increasing modestly, as job growth moderates, but remains at relatively low levels from an historical perspective. inflation in the united states is starting to ease as the restrictive monetary policy and higher interest rates are making an impact. asset prices, including residential and commercial real estate values, are expected to come under pressure. we utilized the moody's november 2022 consensus forecast as our baseline forecast to estimate our expected credit losses as of december 31, 2022. we determined such forecast to be a reasonable view of the outlook for the economy given all available information at year end.
the baseline scenario reflects slow economic growth over the next two years in markets in which we operate. u.s.
gdp is expected to contract by 0.1% annualized rate in the fourth quarter of 2022, but grow at an annual rate of approximately 0.4% and 1.4% for 2023 and 2024, respectively. the national unemployment rate forecast is 3.7% in the fourth quarter of 2022, and is expected to increase gradually to 4.5% in the fourth quarter of 2023 and throughout
2024 due to labor supply constraints. the u.s. consumer price index (cpi) annualized rate is expected to decrease to 3.9% in 2023 and further decline to 2.5% in 2024. the national home price index is expected to decline approximately 5% over 2023 and then grow 3% over 2024.
to the extent we identified credit risk considerations that were not captured by the third-party economic forecast, we addressed the risk through management's qualitative adjustments to the alll.
commercial loan portfolio the commercial alll increased by $ 176million, or 25.6%, from december 31, 2021, through december 31, 2022. the increase is driven by the change in the economic outlook and loan growth. asset quality remained strong as of december 31, 2022.
the declining economic outlook primarily contributed to the reserve increase year-over-year. the economic environment was impacted by interest rate increases, lower commercial real estate values, and expectations of lower gdp growth in the second half of the year. as a result, such factors led to a higher commercial reserve at december
31, 2022, than the prior year. in addition, key's strong loan growth in 2022 was a contributing factor to the reserve change.
consumer loan portfolio the consumer alll increased $ 100million, or 26.8%, from december 31, 2021, through december 31, 2022. the overall increase in the allowance is primarily driven by loan growth and economic forecast changes, partly offset by reductions in qualitative reserves as pandemic-related pressures ease.
reserve levels reflect the overall declining economic outlook year-over-year. the most meaningful change to the economic forecast is the deterioration in the home price index outlook and elevated interest rates, which contribute to reserve increases for both the residential mortgage and home equity segments. in addition, deterioration in the unemployment rate outlook impacts all consumer portfolios. as it relates to the changes in the alll due to portfolio factors, increases are largely driven by targeted growth in the residential mortgage portfolio.
credit risk profile the prevalent risk characteristic for both commercial and consumer loans is the risk of loss arising from an obligor's inability or failure to meet contractual payment or performance terms. evaluation of this risk is stratified and monitored by the loan risk rating grades assigned for the commercial loan portfolios and the refreshed fico score assigned for the consumer loan portfolios. the internal risk grades assigned to loans follow our definitions of pass and criticized, which are consistent with published definitions of regulatory risk classifications. loans with a pass rating represent those loans not classified on our rating scale for credits, as minimal credit risk has been identified. criticized loans are those loans that either have a potential weakness deserving management's close attention or have a well-defined weakness that may put full collection of contractual cash flows at risk. borrower fico scores provide information about the credit quality of our consumer loan portfolio as they provide an indication as to the likelihood that a debtor will repay its debts. the scores are obtained from a nationally recognized consumer rating agency and are presented in the tables below at the dates indicated.

table of contents most extensions of credit are subject to loan scoring. loan grades are assigned at the time of origination, verified by credit risk management, and periodically re-evaluated thereafter. this risk rating methodology blends our judgment with quantitative modeling. commercial loans generally are assigned two internal risk ratings. the first rating reflects the probability that the borrower will default on an obligation; the second rating reflects expected recovery rates on the credit facility. default probability is determined based on, among other factors, the financial strength of the borrower, an assessment of the borrower's management, the borrower's competitive position within its industry sector, and our view of industry risk in the context of the general economic outlook.
types of exposure, transaction structure, and collateral, including credit risk mitigants, affect the expected recovery assessment.

table of contents collateral-dependent financial assets we classify financial assets as collateral-dependent when our borrower is experiencing financial difficulty, and we expect repayment to be provided substantially through the operation or sale of the collateral. our commercial loans have collateral that includes cash, accounts receivable, inventory, commercial machinery, commercial properties, commercial real estate construction projects, enterprise value, and stock or ownership interests in the borrowing entity. when appropriate we also consider the enterprise value of the borrower as a repayment source for collateral-dependent loans. our consumer loans have collateral that includes residential real estate, automobiles, boats, and rvs.
there were no significant changes in the extent to which collateral secures our collateral-dependent financial assets during 2022.
tdrs we classify loan modifications as tdrs when a borrower is experiencing financial difficulties and we have granted a concession without commensurate financial, structural, or legal consideration. our loan modifications are handled on a case-by-case basis and are negotiated to achieve mutually agreeable terms that maximize loan collectability and meet the borrower's financial needs.

basis at fair value
(a) certain investments that are measured at fair value using the net asset value per share (or its equivalent)
practical expedient have not been classified in the fair value hierarchy. the fair value amounts presented in this table are intended to permit reconciliation of the fair value hierarchy to the amounts presented in the consolidated balance sheet.
(b) netting adjustments represent the amounts recorded to convert our derivative assets and liabilities from a gross basis to a net basis in accordance with the applicable accounting guidance. the net basis takes into account the impact of bilateral collateral and master netting agreements that allow us to settle all derivative contracts with a single counterparty on a net basis and to offset the net derivative position with the related cash collateral. total derivative assets and liabilities include these netting adjustments.

table of contents qualitative disclosures of valuation techniques the following table describes the valuation techniques and significant inputs used to measure the classes of assets and liabilities reported at fair value on a recurring basis, as well as the classification of each within the valuation hierarchy.
asset/liability class                 valuation technique                    valuation hierarchy classification(s)
fair value of level 1 securities is determined by:
•  quoted market prices available in an active market for identical securities. this includes exchange-traded equity securities.
fair value of level 2 securities is determined by:
•  pricing models (either by a third party pricing service or internally).  inputs include:
yields, benchmark securities, bids, offers, actual trade data (i.e., spreads, credit ratings, and interest rates) for comparable assets, spread tables, matrices, high-grade scales, and option-adjusted spreads.
•  observable market prices of similar securities.
fair value of level 3 securities is determined by:
•  internally developed valuation techniques, principally discounted cash flow methods (income approach).
•  revenue multiples of comparable public companies (market approach).
for level 3 securities, increases
(decreases) in the discount rate and marketability discount used in the discounted cash flow models would have resulted in lower
(higher) fair value measurements.
higher volatility factors would have further magnified changes in fair value.
the valuations provided by the third-party pricing service are based on observable market inputs, which include benchmark yields, reported trades, issuer spreads, securities (includes trading          benchmark securities, bids, offers, account                               and reference data obtained from assets securities available for       market research publications.          level 1, 2, and 3 (primarily level sale,                                 inputs used by the third-party         2)
and u.s. treasury bills classified    pricing service in valuing cmos and as                                    other mortgage-backed securities short-term investments)               also include new issue data, monthly payment information, whole loan collateral performance, and
"to be announced" prices. in valuations of securities issued by state and political subdivisions, inputs used by the third-party pricing service also include material event notices. we regularly validate the pricing methodologies of valuations derived from a third-party pricing service to ensure the fair value determination is consistent with applicable accounting guidance and that our assets are properly classified in the fair value hierarchy. to perform this validation, we:
•review documentation received from our third-party pricing service regarding the inputs used in its valuations and determine a level assessment for each category of securities;
•substantiate actual inputs used for a sample of securities by comparing the actual inputs used by our third-party pricing service to comparable inputs for similar securities; and
•substantiate the fair values determined for a sample of securities by comparing the fair values provided by our third-party pricing service to prices from other independent sources for the same and similar securities.
we analyze variances and conduct additional research with our third-party pricing service and take appropriate steps based on our findings.
fair value is based on:
•  observable market price spreads commercial loans (trading account     for similar loans. valuations          level 2
assets)                               reflect prices   within the bid-ask spread that are most representative of fair value.
direct principal investments consist of equity and debt instruments of private companies made by our principal investing entities. fair value is determined using:
•  operating performance and market multiples of comparable businesses
•  other unique facts and circumstances related to each individual investment principal investments (direct)        direct principal investments are       level 3
accounted for as investment companies in accordance with the applicable accounting guidance, whereby each investment is adjusted to fair value with any net realized or unrealized gain/loss recorded in the current period's earnings.
we are in the process of winding down our direct principal investment portfolio. as of december 31, 2022, the balance is less than $1million.

table of contents valuation technique indirect principal investments include primary and secondary investments in private equity funds engaged mainly in venture- and growth-oriented investing. these investments do not have readily determinable fair values and qualify for the practical expedient to estimate fair value based upon net asset value per share (or its equivalent, such as member units or an ownership interest in partners'

indirect principal investments are also accounted for as investment companies, whereby each investment is adjusted to fair value with any net realized or unrealized gain/loss recorded in the current period's earnings.

(a) our indirect investments consist of buyout funds, venture capital funds, and fund of funds. these investments are generally not redeemable. instead, distributions are received through the liquidation of the underlying investments of the fund. an investment in any one of these funds typically can be sold only with the approval of the fund's general partners. at december 31, 2022, no significant liquidation of the underlying investments has been communicated to key. the purpose of funding our capital commitments to these investments is to allow the funds to make additional follow-on investments and pay fund expenses until the fund dissolves. we, and all other investors in the fund, are obligated to fund the full amount of our respective capital commitments to the fund based on our and their respective ownership percentages, as noted in the applicable limited partnership agreement.

fair value is determined using:
• discounted cash flows
• operating  performance and market/exit  multiples  of comparable businesses
• other unique facts and circumstances related to each individual investment for level 3 securities, increases other direct equity investments     in the discount rate applied in the    level 1 and 3
discounted cash flow models would negatively affect the fair value.
increases in valuation multiples of comparable companies would positively affect the fair value.
level 1 investments reflect the quoted market prices of the investments available in an active market.
certain direct and indirect investments do not have readily determinable fair values and other direct and indirect equity    qualify for the practical expedient    nav investments (nav)                   in the accounting guidance that allows us to estimate fair value based upon net asset value per share.

residential mortgage loans held for sale are accounted for at fair value.  fair values are based on:
• quoted market prices, where available
• prices for other traded mortgage loans with similar characteristics
• purchase commitments and bid information received from market participants prices are adjusted as necessary to include:
• the embedded servicing value in the loans
• the specific characteristics of certain loans that are priced based on the pricing of similar loans.
(these adjustments represent unobservable inputs to the valuation but are not considered significant given the relative insensitivity of the value to loans held for sale and held for    changes in these inputs to the fair investment (residential)            value of the loans.)                   level 1, 2 and 3 (primarily level 2)
residential loans held for investment: certain residential loans held for sale contain salability exceptions that make them  unable to be sold into the performing loan sales market.
loans in this category are transferred to the held to maturity loan portfolio and are included in
"loans, net of unearned income" on the balance sheet. this type of loan is classified as level 3 in the valuation hierarchy as transaction details regarding sales of this type of loan are often unavailable.
fair value is based upon:
•  unobservable bid information from brokers and investors higher (lower) unobservable bid information would have resulted in higher (lower) fair value measurements.
exchange-traded derivatives are valued using quoted prices in active markets and, therefore, are classified as level 1 instruments.
the majority of our derivative positions are level 2 and are valued using internally developed models based on market convention and observable market inputs.
these derivative contracts include interest rate swaps, certain options, floors, cross currency swaps, credit default swaps, and forward mortgage loan sale commitments. significant inputs used in the valuation models include:
•   libor, sofr and overnight index swap (ois) curves, index pricing curves, foreign currency curves
•  volatility surfaces (a three-dimensional graph of implied volatility against strike price and maturity)
we have customized derivative instruments and risk participations that are classified as level 3
instruments.  these derivative positions are valued using internally developed models, with      level 1, 2, and 3 (primarily level derivatives                         inputs consisting of available         2)
market data, including:
•   credit spreads and interest rates the unobservable internally derived assumptions include:
•   loss given default
•   internal risk assessments of customers the fair value represents an estimate of the amount that the risk participation counterparty would need to pay/receive as of the measurement date based on the probability of customer default on the swap transaction and the fair value of the underlying customer swap.  therefore, for sold risk participation agreements, a higher loss probability and a lower credit rating would negatively affect the fair value of the risk participations and a lower loss probability and higher credit rating would positively affect the fair  value of the risk participations. (for purchased risk participation agreements, higher loss probabilities and lower credit ratings would positively affect the fair value.)

we use interest rate lock commitments for our residential mortgage business, which are classified as level 3 instruments.  the significant components of the valuation model include:
•   interest rates observable in the market
•   investor supplied prices for similar loans and securities
• the probability of the loan closing
(i.e. the "pull-through" amount, a significant unobservable input).
increases (decreases) in the probability of the loan closing would have resulted in higher (lower) fair derivatives (continued)          value measurements.                      level 1, 2, and 3 (primarily level 2)
valuation of residential mortgage forward sale commitments utilizes observable market prices of comparable commitments and mortgage securities (level 2).
the fair values of our derivatives include a credit valuation adjustment related to both counterparty and our own creditworthiness.  the credit component considers master netting and collateral agreements and is determined by the individual counterparty based on potential future exposures, expected recovery rates, and market-implied probabilities of default.
this includes fixed income securities held by our broker dealer in its trading inventory. fair value of level 1 securities is determined by:
•  quoted market prices available in an active market for identical liability for short positions    securities                               level 1 and 2
fair value of level 2 securities is determined by:
•  observable market prices of similar securities
•  market activity, spreads, credit ratings and interest rates for each security type we also make liquidity valuation adjustments to the fair value of certain assets to reflect the uncertainty in the pricing and trading of the instruments when we are unable to observe recent market transactions for identical or similar instruments. liquidity valuation adjustments are based on the following factors:
• the amount of time since the last relevant valuation;
• whether there is an actual trade or relevant external quote available at the measurement date; and
• volatility associated with the primary pricing components.
changes in level 3 fair value measurements the following table shows the change in the fair values of our level 3 financial instruments measured at fair value on a recurring basis for the years ended december 31, 2022, and december 31, 2021.

assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis certain assets and liabilities are measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis in accordance with gaap. the adjustments to fair value generally result from the application of accounting guidance that requires assets and liabilities to be recorded at the lower of cost or fair value, or assessed for impairment. there were noliabilities measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis at december 31, 2022, and december 31, 2021.

valuation of lihtc, htc and nmtc involves measuring the present value of future tax benefits and comparing that value against the current carrying value of the investment. expected future tax lihtc, htc, and nmtc                  benefits are discounted to their       level 3

we have other investments in equity securities that do not have readily determinable fair values and do not qualify for the practical expedient to measure the investment using a net asset value per share.  we have elected to measure these securities at cost less impairment plus or minus adjustments due to observable orderly transactions. impairment is recorded when there is evidence that the expected fair value of the other equity investments              investment has declined to below       level 3
the recorded cost. at each reporting period, we assess if these investments continue to qualify for this measurement alternative.
at december 31, 2022, and december
31, 2021, the carrying amount of equity investments recorded under this method was $249million and
$173million, respectively.noimpairment was recorded for the year ended december 31, 2022.

table of contents valuation methods and assumptions
(a) fair value equals or approximates carrying amount. the fair value of deposits with no stated maturity does not take into consideration the value ascribed to core deposit intangibles.
(b) information pertaining to our methodology for measuring the fair values of these assets and liabilities is included in the sections entitled "qualitative disclosures of valuation techniques" and "assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis" in this note. investments accounted for under the cost method (or cost less impairment adjusted for observable price changes for certain equity investments) are classified as level
3 assets. these investments are not actively traded in an open market as sales for these types of investments are rare. the carrying amount of the investments carried at cost are adjusted for declines in value if they are considered to be other-than-temporary (or due to observable orderly transactions of the same issuer for equity investments eligible for the cost less impairment measurement alternative). these adjustments are included in
"other income" on the income statement.
(c) fair values of held-to-maturity securities are determined by using models that are based on security-specific details, as well as relevant industry and economic factors. the most significant of these inputs are quoted market prices, interest rate spreads on relevant benchmark securities, and certain prepayment assumptions. we review the valuations derived from the models to ensure that they are reasonable and consistent with the values placed on similar securities traded in the secondary markets.
(d) the fair value of loans is based on the present value of the expected cash flows. the projected cash flows are based on the contractual terms of the loans, adjusted for prepayments and use of a discount rate based on the relative risk of the cash flows, taking into account the loan type, maturity of the loan, liquidity risk, servicing costs, and a required return on debt and capital. in addition, an incremental liquidity discount is applied to certain loans, using historical sales of loans during periods of similar economic conditions as a benchmark. the fair value of loans includes lease financing receivables at their aggregate carrying amount, which is equivalent to their fair value.
(e) fair values of time deposits and long-term debt are based on discounted cash flows utilizing relevant market inputs.
(f) netting adjustments represent the amounts recorded to convert our derivative assets and liabilities from a gross basis to a net basis in accordance with the applicable accounting guidance. the net basis takes into account the impact of bilateral collateral and master netting agreements that allow us to settle all derivative contracts with a single counterparty on a net basis and to offset the net derivative position with the related cash collateral. total derivative assets and liabilities include these netting adjustments.
(g) derivative assets-hedging and derivative liabilities-hedging includes both cash flow and fair value hedges.
additional information regarding our accounting policies for cash flow and fair value hedges is provided in note 1
("summary of significant accounting policies") under the heading "derivatives and hedging."
we determine fair value based on assumptions pertaining to the factors that a market participant would consider in valuing the asset. a substantial portion of our fair value adjustments are related to liquidity. during 2022 and
2021, the fair values of our loan portfolios generally remained stable, primarily due to sustained liquidity in the loan markets. if we were to use different assumptions, the fair values shown in the preceding table could change.
also, because the applicable accounting guidance for financial instruments excludes certain financial instruments and all nonfinancial instruments from its disclosure requirements, the fair value amounts shown in the table above do not, by themselves, represent the underlying value of our company as a whole.
discontinued assets - education lending business . our discontinued assets include government-guaranteed and private education loans originated through our education lending business that was discontinued in september 2009.
this portfolio consists of loans recorded at carrying value with appropriate valuation reserves and loans recorded at fair value. all of these loans were excluded from the table above as follows:
• loans at carrying value, net of allowance, of $ 434million ($ 357million at fair value) at december 31, 2022, and
$ 567million ($ 486million at fair value) at december 31, 2021; and
• loans at fair value of $ 1million at december 31, 2022, and $ 2million at december 31, 2021.
these loans are classified as level 3 because we rely on unobservable inputs when determining fair value since observable market data is not available.
short-term financial instruments. for financial instruments with a remaining average life to maturity of less than six months, carrying amounts were used as an approximation of fair values.
7. securities the amortized cost, unrealized gains and losses, and approximate fair value of our securities available for sale and held-to-maturity securities are presented in the following tables. gross unrealized gains and losses represent the difference between the amortized cost and the fair value of securities on the balance sheet as of the dates indicated. accordingly, the amount of these gains and losses may change in the future as market conditions change.

(a) at december 31, 2022, gross unrealized losses totaled less than $ 1million for other securities held to maturity with a loss duration of less than 12 months.
(b) at december 31, 2021, gross unrealized losses totaled less than $ 1million for other securities held to maturity and agency residential collateralized mortgage obligations held-to-maturity with a loss duration of less than 12 months. at december 31, 2021, gross unrealized losses totaled less than $ 1million for asset backed securities held to maturity with a loss duration greater than 12 months or longer.
based on our evaluation at december 31, 2022, an allowance for credit losses has not been recorded nor have unrealized losses been recognized into income. the issuers of the securities are of high credit quality and have a history of no credit losses, management does not intend to sell and it is likely that management will not be required to sell the securities prior to their anticipated recovery, and the decline in fair value is largely attributed to changes in interest rates and other market conditions. the issuers continue to make timely principal and interest payments.

table of contents at december 31, 2022, securities available-for-sale and held-to-maturity securities totaling $ 12.9billion were pledged to secure securities sold under repurchase agreements, to secure public and trust deposits, to facilitate access to secured funding, and for other purposes required or permitted by law.
the following table shows securities by remaining maturity. cmos, other mortgage-backed securities, and asset-
backed securities in the available for sale portfolio and held-to-maturity portfolio are presented based on their expected average lives . the remaining securities, in both the available-for-sale and held-to-maturity portfolios, are presented based on their remaining contractual maturity. actual maturities may differ from expected or contractual maturities since borrowers have the right to prepay obligations with or without prepayment penalties.

8. derivatives and hedging activities we are a party to various derivative instruments, mainly through our subsidiary, keybank. the primary derivatives that we use are interest rate swaps, caps, floors, forwards and futures; foreign exchange contracts; commodity derivatives; and credit derivatives. generally, these instruments help us manage exposure to interest rate risk, mitigate the credit risk inherent in our loan portfolio, hedge against changes in foreign currency exchange rates, and meet client financing and hedging needs. as further discussed in this note:
• interest rate risk is the risk that the eve or net interest income will be adversely affected by fluctuations in interest rates;
• credit risk is the risk of loss arising from an obligor's inability or failure to meet contractual payment or performance terms; and
• foreign exchange risk is the risk that an exchange rate will adversely affect the fair value of a financial instrument.
at december 31, 2022, after taking into account the effects of bilateral collateral and master netting agreements, we had $ 97million of derivative assets and $ 3million of derivative liabilities that relate to contracts entered into for hedging purposes. as of the same date, after taking into account the effects of bilateral collateral and master netting agreements and a reserve for potential future losses, we had derivative assets of $ 927million and derivative liabilities of $ 1.5billion that were not designated as hedging instruments. these positions are primarily comprised of derivative contracts entered into for client accommodation purposes.
additional information regarding our accounting policies for derivatives is provided in note 1 ("summary of significant accounting policies") under the heading "derivatives and hedging."
derivatives designated in hedge relationships net interest income and the eve change in response to changes in the mix of assets, liabilities, and off-balance sheet instruments and the associated interest rates tied to each instrument. in addition, differences in the repricing and maturity characteristics of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities cause net interest income and the eve to fluctuate. we utilize derivatives that have been designated as part of a hedge relationship in accordance with the applicable accounting guidance to manage net interest income and eve to within our stated risk tolerances. the primary derivative instruments used to manage interest rate risk are interest rate swaps.
we designate certain "receive fixed/pay variable" interest rate swaps as fair value hedges. these contracts convert certain fixed-rate long-term debt into variable-rate obligations, thereby modifying our exposure to changes in interest rates. as a result, we receive fixed-rate interest payments in exchange for making variable-rate payments over the lives of the contracts without exchanging the notional amounts.
137
table of contents similarly, we designate certain "receive fixed/pay variable" interest rate swaps as cash flow hedges. these contracts effectively convert certain floating-rate loans into fixed-rate loans to reduce the potential adverse effect of interest rate decreases on future interest income. again, we receive fixed-rate interest payments in exchange for making variable-rate payments over the lives of the contracts without exchanging the notional amounts.
we designate interest rate floors as cash flow hedges. interest rate floors also reduce the potential adverse effect of interest rate decreases on future interest income. we receive interest payments when the strike price specified in the contracts falls below a reference rate in exchange for an upfront premium.
we designate certain "pay fixed/receive variable" interest rate swaps as fair value hedges. these swaps convert certain fixed-rate securities into floating rate securities. the swaps reduce the potential adverse effects from higher interest rates on valuations and future interest income.
we designate certain "pay fixed/receive variable" interest rate swaps as cash flow hedges. these swaps convert certain floating-rate debt into fixed-rate debt. we also use these swaps to manage the interest rate risk associated with anticipated sales of certain commercial real estate loans and certain student loans originated through our laurel road digital lending business. the swaps protect against the possible short-term decline in the value of the loans that could result from changes in interest rates between the time they are originated and the time they are sold.
derivatives not designated in hedge relationships we may enter into interest rate swap contracts to manage economic risks but do not designate the instruments in hedge relationships. excluding contracts addressing customer exposures, the amount of derivatives hedging risks on an economic basis at december 31, 2022, was not significant.
like other financial services institutions, we originate loans and extend credit, both of which expose us to credit risk. we actively manage our overall loan portfolio and the associated credit risk in a manner consistent with asset quality objectives and concentration risk tolerances to mitigate portfolio credit risk. purchasing credit protection through default swaps enables us to transfer to a third party a portion of the credit risk associated with a particular extension of credit, including situations where there is a forecasted sale of loans. we purchase credit default swaps to reduce the credit risk associated with the debt securities held in our trading portfolio.
we also enter into derivative contracts for other purposes, including:
• interest rate swap, cap, and floor contracts entered into generally to accommodate the needs of commercial loan clients;
• energy and base metal swap and option contracts entered into to accommodate the needs of clients;
• foreign exchange forward and option contracts entered into primarily to accommodate the needs of clients; and
• futures contracts and positions with third parties that are intended to offset or mitigate the interest rate or market risk related to client positions discussed above.
fair values, volume of activity, and gain/loss information related to derivative instruments the following table summarizes the fair values of our derivative instruments on a gross and net basis as of december 31, 2022, and december 31, 2021. the change in the notional amounts of these derivatives by type from december 31, 2021, to december 31, 2022, indicates the volume of our derivative transaction activity during 2022.
the notional amounts are not affected by bilateral collateral and master netting agreements. the derivative asset and liability balances are presented on a gross basis, prior to the application of bilateral collateral and master netting agreements. total derivative assets and liabilities are adjusted to take into account the impact of legally enforceable master netting agreements that allow us to settle all derivative contracts with a single counterparty on a net basis and to offset the net derivative position with the related cash collateral. where master netting agreements are not in effect or are not enforceable under bankruptcy laws, we do not adjust those derivative assets and liabilities with counterparties. securities collateral related to legally enforceable master netting agreements is not offset on the balance sheet. our derivative instruments are included in "accrued income and other assets" or
"accrued expenses and other liabilities" on the consolidated balance sheets, as indicated in the following table:

amounts
(a) we take into account bilateral collateral and master netting agreements that allow us to settle all derivative contracts held with a single counterparty on a net basis, and to offset the net derivative position with the related cash collateral when recognizing derivative assets and liabilities. as a result, we could have derivative contracts with negative fair values included in derivative assets and contracts with positive fair values included in derivative liabilities.
(b) other derivatives include interest rate lock commitments related to our residential mortgage banking activities, forward sales commitments related to our residential mortgage banking activities, forward purchase and sales contracts consisting of contractual commitments associated with "to be announced" securities and when-issued securities, and other customized derivative contracts.
(c) netting adjustments represent the amounts recorded to convert our derivative assets and liabilities from a gross basis to a net basis in accordance with the applicable accounting guidance.
(d) other collateral represents the amount that cannot be used to offset our derivative assets and liabilities from a gross basis to a net basis in accordance with the applicable accounting guidance. the other collateral consists of securities and is exchanged under bilateral collateral and master netting agreements that allow us to offset the net derivative position with the related collateral. the application of the other collateral cannot reduce the net derivative position below zero. therefore, excess other collateral, if any, is not reflected above.
fair value hedges. during the year ended december 31, 2022, we did not exclude any portion of these hedging instruments from the assessment of hedge effectiveness.
the following tables summarize the amounts that were recorded on the balance sheet as of december 31, 2022 and december 31, 2021, related to cumulative basis adjustments for fair value hedges.

(a) the carrying amount represents the portion of the asset or liability designated as the hedged item.
(b) basis adjustments related to de-designated hedges that no longer qualify as fair value hedges reduced the hedge accounting basis adjustment by $ 6million and $ 7million at december 31, 2022 and december 31, 2021, respectively.
(c) these amounts are designated as fair value hedges under the last-of-layer method. the carrying amount represents the amortized costs basis of the prepayable financial assets used to designate hedging relationships in which the hedged item is the last layer expected to be remaining at the end of the hedging relationship. at december 31, 2022 and december 31, 2021 the amortized cost of the closed portfolios used in these hedging relationships was $ 708million an d $ 7.7billion, respectively.
cash flow hedges. during the year ended december 31, 2022, we did not exclude any portion of these hedging instruments from the assessment of hedge effectiveness.
considering the interest rates, yield curves, and notional amounts as of december 31, 2022, we expect to reclassify an est imated $ 665million of after-tax net losses on derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges from aoci to income during the next 12months. in addition, we expect to reclassify approximately $ 3million of pre-tax net losses related to terminated cash flow hedges from aoci to income during the next 12months. these reclassified amounts could differ from actual amounts recognized due to changes in interest rates hedge de-designations and the addition of other hedges subsequent to december 31, 2022 . as of december 31, 2022, the maximum length of time over which we hedge forecasted transactions is 5.01years.

counterparty credit risk we use several means to mitigate and manage exposure to credit risk on derivative contracts. we enter into bilateral collateral and master netting agreements that provide for the net settlement of all contracts with a single counterparty in the event of default. additionally, we monitor counterparty credit risk exposure on each contract to determine appropriate limits on our total credit exposure across all product types. we review our collateral positions on a daily basis and exchange collateral with our counterparties in accordance with standard isda documentation, central clearing rules, and other related agreements. we hold collateral in the form of cash and highly rated securities issued by the u.s. treasury, government-sponsored enterprises, or gnma. cash collateral netted against derivative assets on the balance s heet totaled $ 10million at december 31, 2022, and $ 100million at december 31, 2021. the cash collateral netted against derivative liabilities totaled $ 626million at december
31, 2022, and $ 1.1billion at december 31, 2021.
the following table summarizes the fair value of our derivative assets by type at the dates indicated. these assets represent our gross exposure to potential loss after taking into account the effects of bilateral collateral and master netting agreements and other means used to mitigate risk.

we enter into derivative transactions with two primary groups: broker-dealers and banks, and clients. since these groups have different economic characteristics, we have different methods for managing counterparty credit exposure and credit risk.
we enter into transactions with broker-dealers and banks for various risk management purposes. these types of transactions are primarily high dollar volume. we enter into bilateral collateral and master netting agreements with these counterparties. we clear certain types of derivative transactions with these counterparties, whereby central clearing organizations become the counterparties to our derivative contracts. in addition, we enter into derivative contracts through swap execution facilities. swap clearing and swap execution facilities reduce our exposure to counterparty credit risk. at december 31, 2022, we had gross exposure of $ 355million to broker-dealers and banks. we had net exposure of $ 213million after the application of master netting agreements and cash collateral, where such qualifying agreements exist. we had net exposure of $ 212million after considering $
1million of additional collateral held in the form of securities.
we enter into transactions using master netting agreements with clients to accommodate their business needs. in most cases, we mitigate our credit exposure by cross-collateralizing these transactions to the underlying loan collateral. for transactions that are not clearable, we mitigate our market risk by buying and selling u.s.
treasuries and eurodollar futures or entering into offsetting positions. due to the cross-collateralization to the underlying loan, we typically do not exchange cash or marketable securities collateral in connection with these transactions. to address the risk of default associated with these contracts, we have established a cva reserve
(included in "accrued income and other assets") in the amoun t of $ 3million at december 31, 2022. the cva is calculated from potential future exposures, expected recovery rates, and market-implied probabilities of default.
at december 31, 2022, we had gross exposure of $ 968million to client counterparties and other entities that are not broker-dealers or banks for derivatives that have associated master netting agreements. we had net exposure of
$ 812million on our derivatives with these counterparties after the application of master netting agreements, collateral, and the related reserve.
credit derivatives we are a buyer and, under limited circumstances, may be a seller of credit protection through the credit derivative market. we purchase credit derivatives to manage the credit risk associated with specific commercial lending and swap obligations as well as exposures to debt securities. our credit derivative portfolio was in a net liability position of $ 2million as of december 31, 2022, and $ 11million as of december 31, 2021.
our credit derivative portfolio may consist of the following:
• single-name credit default swap : a bilateral contract whereby the seller agrees, for a premium, to provide protection against the credit risk of a specific entity (the "reference entity") in connection with a specific debt obligation. the protected credit risk is related to adverse credit events, such as bankruptcy, failure to make payments, and acceleration or restructuring of obligations, identified in the credit derivative contract.
• traded credit default swap index: represents a position on a basket or portfolio of reference entities.
• risk participation agreement: a transaction in which the lead participant has a swap agreement with a customer.
the lead participant (purchaser of protection) then enters into a risk participation agreement with a counterparty
(seller of protection), under which the counterparty receives a fee to accept a portion of the lead participant's credit risk. if the customer defaults on the swap contract, the counterparty to the risk participation agreement must reimburse the lead participant for the counterparty's percentage of the positive fair value of the customer swap as of the default date. if the customer swap has a negative fair value, the counterparty has no reimbursement requirements. if the customer defaults on the swap contract and the
142
table of contents seller fulfills its payment obligations under the risk participation agreement, the seller is entitled to a pro rata share of the lead participant's claims against the customer under the terms of the swap agreement.
the following table provides information on the types of credit derivatives sold by us and held on the balance sheet at december 31, 2022, and december 31, 2021. the notional amount represents the amount that the seller could be required to pay. the payment/performance risk shown in the table represents a weighted average of the default probabilities for all reference entities in the respective portfolios. these default probabilities are implied from observed credit indices in the credit default swap market, which are mapped to reference entities based on key's internal risk rating.

sold credit risk contingent features we have entered into certain derivative contracts that require us to post collateral to the counterparties when these contracts are in a net liability position. the amount of collateral to be posted is based on the amount of the net liability and thresholds generally related to our long-term senior unsecured credit ratings with moody's and s&p. collateral requirements also are based on minimum transfer amounts, which are specific to each credit support annex (a component of the isda master agreement) that we have signed with the counterparties. in a limited number of instances, counterparties have the right to terminate their isda master agreements with us if our ratings fall below a certain level, usually investment-grade level (i.e., "baa3" for moody's and "bbb-" for s&p). at december 31, 2022, keybank's rating w as " a3 " with moody's and " a- " with s&p, and keycorp's rating was "baa1"
with moody's and "bbb+" with s&p. as of december 31, 2022, the aggregate fair value of all derivative contracts with credit risk contingent features (i.e., those containi ng collateral posting or termination provisions based on our ratings) held by keybank that were in a net liability position to taled $ 612million, which includes $
243million in derivative assets, $ 1.3billion in derivative liabilities and associated collateral posted. we had $
534million in cash and securities collateral posted to cover those positions as of december 31, 2022. there were noderivative contracts with credit risk contingent features held by keycorp at december 31, 2022.
the following table summarizes the additional cash and securities collateral that keybank would have been required to deliver under the isda master agreements had the credit risk contingent features been triggered for the derivative contracts in a net liability position as of december 31, 2022, and december 31, 2021. the additional collateral amounts were calculated based on scenarios under which keybank's ratings are downgraded one, two, or three ratings as of december 31, 2022, and december 31, 2021, and take into account all collateral already posted.
a similar calculation was performed for keycorp, and noadditional collateral would have been required at december
31, 2022, or december 31, 2021. for more information about the credit ratings for keybank and keycorp, see the discussion under the heading "factors affecting liquidity" in the section entitled "liquidity risk management" in item 7 of this report.

9. mortgage servicing assets we originate and periodically sell commercial and residential mortgage loans but continue to service those loans for the buyers. we also may purchase the right to service commercial mortgage loans for other lenders. we record a servicing asset if we purchase or retain the right to service loans in exchange for servicing fees that exceed the going market servicing rate and are considered more than adequate compensation for servicing. additional information pertaining to the accounting for mortgage and other servicing assets is included in note 1 ("summary of significant accounting policies") under the heading "servicing assets."
commercial changes in the carrying amount of commercial mortgage servicing assets are summarized as follows:

the fair value of commercial mortgage servicing assets is determined by calculating the present value of future cash flows associated with servicing the loans. this calculation uses a number of assumptions that are based on current market conditions. the range and weighted-average of the significant unobservable inputs used to determine fair value our commercial mortgage servicing assets at december 31, 2022, and december 31, 2021, along with the valuation techniques, are shown in the following table:

rate if these economic assumptions change or prove incorrect, the fair value of commercial mortgage servicing assets may also change. expected credit losses, escrow earn rates, and discount rates are critical to the valuation of commercial mortgage servicing assets. estimates of these assumptions are based on how a market participant would view the respective rates and reflect historical data associated with the commercial mortgage loans, industry trends, and other considerations. actual rates may differ from those estimated due to changes in a variety of economic factors. a decrease in the value assigned to the escrow earn rates would cause a decrease in the fair value of our commercial mortgage servicing assets. an increase in the assumed default rates of commercial mortgage loans or an increase in the assigned discount rates would cause a decrease in the fair value of our commercial mortgage servicing assets. prepayment activity on commercial serviced loans does not significantly impact the valuation of our commercial mortgage servicing assets. unlike residential mortgages, commercial mortgages experience significantly lower prepayments due to certain contractual restrictions impacting the borrower's ability to prepay the mortgage.
the amortization of commercial mortgage servicing assets is determined in proportion to, and over the period of, the estimated net servicing income. the amortization of commercial servicing assets for each period, as shown in the table at the beginning of this note, is recorded as a reduction to contractual fee income. the contractual fee income from servicing commercial mortgage loans totaled $ 292million for the year ended december 31, 2022, $
264million for the year ended december 31, 2021, and $ 214million for the year ended december 31, 2020. this fee income was partially offset by $ 125million of amortization for the year ended december 31, 2022, $ 120million for the year ended december 31, 2021, and $ 117million for the year ended december 31, 2020. both the contractual fee income and the amortization are recorded, net, in "commercial mortgage servicing fees" on the income statement.

the amortization of residential mortgage servicing assets for december 31, 2022, as shown in the table above, is recorded as a reduction to contractual fee income. the contractual fee income from servicing residential mortgage loans totaled $ 35million for the year ended december 31, 2022, $ 42million for the year ended december 31, 2021, and $ 34million for the year ended december 31, 2020. this fee income was offset by $ 11million of amortization for the year ended december 31, 2022, $ 18million for the year ended december 31, 2021, and $ 14million for the year ended december 31, 2020. both the contractual fee income and the amortization are recorded, net, in "consumer mortgage income" on the income statement.
10. leases as a lessee, we enter into leases of land, buildings, and equipment. our real estate leases primarily relate to bank branches and office space. the leases of equipment principally relate to technology assets for data processing and data storage. as a lessor, we primarily provide financing through our equipment leasing business.
lessee our leases are classified as either operating or financing and have remaining terms ranging from 1to 20years with the exception of certain ground leases that have terms over 30years. for leases with initial terms greater than one year, a lease liability, measured as the present value of unpaid lease payments, and a corresponding right-of-use asset for the right to use the leased properties are reported on the balance sheet. lease payments are discounted using key's incremental borrowing rate, consistent with what key would pay to borrow on a collateralized basis over a term similar to each lease. leases with an initial term of less than one year are not recorded on the balance sheet. the related expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
145
table of contents certain leases contain options to extend the lease term for up to five years. some leases give us the option to terminate, for a penalty or at the lessor's discretion. leases with variable payments are primarily based on adjustments for inflation over the term of the lease based on a contractually defined index. certain atm leases include variable payments based on volume of transactions.
operating lease expense is recognized in "net occupancy" and "equipment" on the income statement. the components of lease expense are summarized as follows:

depreciation and amortization expense related to premises and equipment for the years ended december 31, 2022, december 31, 2021, and december 31, 2020 was $ 96million, $ 107million, and $ 115million, respectively. this includes amortization of assets under capital leases.
software eligible costs related to computer software developed or obtained for internal use that add functionality, improve efficiency or extend the useful life of a system are capitalized. amortization of capitalized software begins when it is ready for its intended use, which is after all substantial testing is completed. capitalized costs are amortized using the straight-line or accelerated method over its useful life. balances are included in "accrued income and other assets".
key had capitalized software assets, including internally-developed and purchased software and costs associated with certain cloud computing arrangements of $ 447million and $ 321million and related accumulated amortization of

13. variable interest entities a vie is a partnership, limited liability company, trust, or other legal entity that meets any one of the following criteria:
• the entity does not have sufficient equity to conduct its activities without additional subordinated financial support from another party.
• the entity's investors lack the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the entity's economic performance.
• the entity's equity at risk holders do not have the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive residual returns.
• the voting rights of some investors are not proportional to their economic interests in the entity, and substantially all of the entity's activities involve, or are conducted on behalf of, investors with disproportionately few voting rights.
our significant vies are summarized below. we define a "significant interest" in a vie as a subordinated interest that exposes us to a significant portion, but not the majority, of the vie's expected losses or residual returns, even
149
table of contents though we do not have the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the entity's economic performance.
lihtc investments. through kcdc, we have made investments directly and indirectly in lihtc operating partnerships formed by third parties. as a limited partner in these operating partnerships, we are allocated tax credits and deductions associated with the underlying properties. we have determined that we are not the primary beneficiary of these investments because the general partners have the power to direct the activities that most significantly influence the economic performance of their respective partnerships and have the obligation to absorb expected losses and the right to receive residual returns. as we are not the primary beneficiary of these investments, we do not consolidate them.
through kcic, formed as a wholly-owned subsidiary of keybank national association, we create funds that hold interests in lihtc investments. kcic is the managing member of the fund. we have determined that we are not the primary beneficiary of the fund because although we have the power to direct the activities that most significantly influence its economic performance, we do not have benefits that could potentially be deemed significant to the fund. therefore, we do not consolidate the fund.
our maximum exposure to loss in connection with these partnerships consists of our unamortized investment balance plus any unfunded equity commitments and tax credits claimed but subject to recapture. we had $ 1.9billion and $
1.6billion of investments in lihtc operating partnerships at december 31, 2022, and december 31, 2021, respectively. these investments are recorded in "accrued income and other assets" on our consolidated balance sheets. we do not have any loss reserves recorded related to these investments because we believe the likelihood of any loss is remote. for all legally binding unfunded equity commitments, we increase our recognized investment and recognize a liability. as of december 31, 2022, and december 31, 2021, we had liabilities of $ 957million and $
675million, respectively, related to investments in qualified affordable housing projects, which are recorded in
"accrued expense and other liabilities" on our consolidated balance sheets. we continue to invest in these lihtc operating partnerships.
the assets and liabilities presented in the table below convey the size of kcdc's direct and indirect investments at december 31, 2022, and december 31, 2021. as these investments represent unconsolidated vies, the assets and liabilities of the investments themselves are not recorded on our consolidated balance sheets.

we amortize our lihtc investments over the period that we expect to receive the tax benefits. in 2022, we recognized $ 190million of amortization and $ 187million of tax credits associated with these investments within
"income taxes" on our income statement. in 2021, we recognized $ 192million of amortization and $ 184million of tax credits associated with these investments within "income taxes" on our income statement.
principal investments. through our principal investing entity, kcc, we have made investments in private equity funds engaged in venture- and growth-oriented investing. as a limited partner to these funds, kcc records these investments at fair value and receives distributions from the funds in accordance with the funds' partnership agreements. we are not the primary beneficiary of these investments as we do not hold the power to direct the activities that most significantly affect the funds' economic performance. such power rests with the funds' general partners. in addition, we neither have the obligation to absorb the funds' expected losses nor the right to receive their residual returns. our voting rights are also disproportionate to our economic interests, and substantially all of the funds' activities are conducted on behalf of investors with disproportionately few voting rights.
because we are not the primary beneficiary of these investments, we do not consolidate them.
our maximum exposure to loss associated with indirect principal investments consists of the investments' fair value plus any unfunded equity commitments. the fair value of our indirect principal investments totaled $ 34million and
$ 45million at december 31, 2022, and december 31, 2021, respectively. these investments are recorded in "other investments" on our consolidated balance sheets. additional information on indirect principal investments is

through our principal investing entities, we have formed and funded operating entities that provide management and other related services to our investment company funds, which directly invest in portfolio companies. in return for providing services to our direct investment funds, these entities' receive a minority equity interest in the funds.
this minority equity ownership is recorded at fair value on the entities' financial statements. additional information on our direct principal investments is provided in note 6 ("fair value measurements"). while other equity investors manage the daily operations of these entities, we retain the power, through voting rights, to direct the activities of the entities that most significantly impact their economic performance. in addition, we have the obligation to absorb losses and the right to receive residual returns that could potentially be significant to these entities. as a result, we have determined that we are the primary beneficiary of these funds and have consolidated them since formation. the entities had noliabilities at december 31, 2022, and december 31,
2021, and other equity investors have no recourse to our general credit.
other unconsolidated vies. we are involved with other various entities in the normal course of business which we have determined to be vies. we have determined that we are not the primary beneficiary of these vies because we do not have the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact their economic performance or hold a variable interest that could potentially be significant. the table below shows our assets and liabilities associated with these unconsolidated vies at december 31, 2022, and december 31, 2021. these assets are recorded in
"accrued income and other assets," "other investments," "securities available for sale," "held-to-maturity securities," and "loans, net of unearned income" on our consolidated balance sheets. these liabilities are recorded in "accrued expenses and other liabilities" on our consolidated balance sheets. of the total balance as of december
31, 2022, $ 1.4billion related to the purchase of senior notes from a securitization collateralized by sold indirect auto loans. in addition, where we only have a lending arrangement in the normal course of business with unconsolidated vies we present the balances related to the lending arrangements in note 5 ("asset quality").

we conduct quarterly assessments of all available evidence to determine the amount of deferred tax assets that are more-likely-than-not to be realized, and therefore recorded. the available evidence used in connection with these assessments includes taxable income in prior periods, projected future taxable income, potential tax-planning strategies, and projected future reversals of deferred tax items. these assessments involve a degree of subjectivity and may undergo significant change.
at december 31, 2022, we had net capital loss carryforwards of $ 11million for which we have recorded $ 11million of valuation allowances. the capital loss carryforward if not utilized, will expire in 2025. realization of this tax benefit is dependent upon key's ability to generate sufficient capital gain in an appropriate tax year to offset the capital loss carryforward. currently, generation of sufficient gain income is uncertain.
at december 31, 2022, we had federal net operating loss carryforwards of $ 14million and federal credit carryforwards of $ 1million. the federal net operating loss carryforwards are from prior acquisitions by first niagara and are subject to annual limitations under the tax code and, if not utilized, will expire in the years beginning 2027. the federal credit carryforward consists of general business credits which expire in 2027, under the internal revenue code. we currently expect to fully utilize these losses and credits.
we had state net operating loss carryforwards of $ 18million, resulting in a net state deferred tax asset of $
1million.

each quarter, we review the amount of unrecognized tax benefits recorded in accordance with the applicable accounting guidance. any adjustment to unrecognized tax benefits is recorded in income tax expense. the amount of unrecognized tax benefits that, if recognized, would affect our effective tax rate was $ 40million at december 31,
2022, and $ 50million at december 31, 2021. it is reasonably possible that the balance of unrecognized tax benefits could decrease in the next twelve months due to examinations by various tax authorities or the expiration of statutes of limitations.
as permitted under the applicable accounting guidance, it is our policy to record interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense. we recorded net interest benefit of $ 1.5million, $ 0.1million, and $ 0.2million in 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively. we did not recover any state tax penalties in 2022, 2021, or 2020. at december 31, 2022, we had noaccrued interest payable, compared to $ 2million at december 31, 2021.
there was noliability for accrued state tax penalties at december 31, 2022, and december 31, 2021.
there were nounrecognized tax benefits presented in the financial statements as a reduction to a deferred tax asset for a net operating loss carryforward, a similar tax loss or a tax credit carryforward, at december 31, 2022 and december 31, 2021, respectively.
we file federal income tax returns, as well as returns in various state and foreign jurisdictions. we are subject to income tax examination by the irs for the tax years 2016, and 2019 and forward. currently, we are under irs audit for tax year 2016. we are not subject to income tax examinations by other tax authorities for years prior to
2014.
pre-1988 bank reserves acquired in a business combination retained earnings of keybank included approximately $ 92million of allocated bad debt deductions for which no income taxes have been recorded. under current federal law, these reserves are subject to recapture into taxable income if keybank, or any successor, fails to maintain its bank status under the internal revenue code or makes non-dividend distributions or distributions greater than its accumulated earnings and profits. no deferred tax liability has been established as these events are not expected to occur in the foreseeable future.
15. acquisitions and discontinued operations acquisitions xup payments . on november 19, 2021, keybank acquired xup payments, a b2b focused digital platform. the acquisition was accounted for as a business combination. as a result of the acquisition, we recognized goodwill of $
20.6million and no separately identified intangible assets were recorded. other acquired assets and liabilities of xup were immaterial. the valuation was final as of march 31, 2022.
gradfin. on may 2, 2022, keybank acquired gradfin, a public service loan forgiveness counseling provider. the acquisition was accounted for as a business combination. consideration paid totaled $ 72million consisting of $
62million in cash and $ 10million in contingent consideration. as a result of the acquisition, we recognized goodwill of $ 58million and other intangible assets of $ 12million, with remaining assets acquired consisting primarily of cash. other acquired assets and liabilities of gradfin were immaterial. the valuation was final as of september 30, 2022.

(a) netting adjustments take into account the impact of master netting agreements that allow us to settle with a single counterparty on a net basis.
(b) these adjustments take into account the impact of bilateral collateral agreements that allow us to offset the net positions with the related collateral. the application of collateral cannot reduce the net position below zero.
therefore, excess collateral, if any, is not reflected above.
(c) repurchase agreements are collateralized by mortgaged-backed agency securities and are contracted on an overnight or continuous basis.
as of december 31, 2022, the carrying amount of assets pledged as collateral against repurchase agreements totaled
$ 110million. assets pledged as collateral are reported in "available for sale" and "held-to-maturity" securities on the consolidated balance sheets. at december 31, 2022, the liabilities associated with collateral pledged were solely comprised of customer sweep financing activity and had a carrying value of $ 63million. the collateral pledged under customer sweep repurchase agreements is posted to a third-party custodian and cannot be sold or repledged by the secured party. the risk related to a decline in the market value of collateral pledged is minimal given the collateral's high credit quality and the overnight duration of the repurchase agreements.
like other financing transactions, securities financing agreements contain an element of credit risk. to mitigate and manage credit risk exposure, we generally enter into master netting agreements and other collateral arrangements that give us the right, in the event of default, to liquidate collateral held and to offset receivables and payables with the same counterparty. additionally, we establish and monitor limits on our counterparty credit risk exposure by product type. for the reverse repurchase agreements, we monitor the value of the underlying securities we received from counterparties and either request additional collateral or return a portion of the collateral based on the value of those securities. we generally hold collateral in the form of highly rated securities issued by the u.s. treasury and fixed income securities. in addition, we may need to provide collateral to counterparties under our repurchase agreements. with the exception of collateral pledged against customer sweep repurchase agreements, the collateral we pledge and receive can generally be sold or repledged by the secured parties.
17. stock-based compensation we mainta in several stock-based compensation plans, which are described below. total compensation expense for these plans was $ 120million for 2022, $ 104million for 2021, and $ 101million for 2020. the total income tax benefit recognized in the income statement for these plans was $ 29million for 2022, $ 25million for 2021, and $
24million for 2020.
our compensation plans allow us to grant stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock, restricted stock units, performance shares, performance units, or other awards which may be denominated or payable in or valued by reference to our common shares or other factors, discounted stock purchases, and deferred compensation to eligible employees and directors. at december 31, 2022, we had 22,313,039common shares available for future grant under our compensation plans. in accordance with a resolution adopted by the compensation and
154
table of contents organization committee of keycorp's board of directors, we may not grant options to purchase common shares, restricted stock or other shares under any long-term compensation plan in an aggregate amount that exceeds 6% of our outstanding common shares in any rolling three-yearperiod.
stock options stock options granted to employees generally become exercisable at the rate of 25% per year. no option granted by keycorp will be exercisable less than one yearafter, or expire later than ten yearsfrom, the grant date. the exercise price is 100- 110% of the closing price of our common shares on the grant date (or the prior busi ness day if the grant date is not a business day).
we determine the fair value of options granted using the black-scholes option-pricing model. this model was originally developed to determine the fair value of exchange-traded equity options, which (unlike employee stock options) have no vesting period or transferability restrictions. because of these differences, the black-scholes model does not precisely value an employee stock option, but it is commonly used for this purpose. the model assumes that the estimated fair value of an option is amortized as compensation expense over the option's vesting period.
the black-scholes model requires several assumptions, which we developed and update based on historical trends and current market observations. our determination of the fair value of options is only as accurate as the underlying assumptions. the assumptions pertaining to options issued during 2022, 2021, and 2020 are shown in the following table.

in 2019, shareholders approved the 2019 equity compensation plan, under which 71,600,000shares may be issued as equity awards. the compensation and organization committee has authority to approve all stock option grants but may delegate some of its authority to grant awards from time to time. the committee has delegated to our chief executive officer the authority to grant equity awards, including stock options, to any employee who is not designated an "officer" for purposes of section 16 of the exchange act. no more than 3,000,000com mon shares may be issued under this authority.

(a) the intrinsic value of a stock option is the amount by which the fair value of the underlying stock exceeds the exercise price of the option.
the weighted-average gr ant-date fair value of options was $ 5.78for options granted during 2022, $ 3.38for options granted during 2021, and $ 2.96for options granted during 2020. stock option exercises numbered 484,521in 2022,

22million for 2021, and $ 5million for 2020. as of december 31, 2022, unrecognized compensation cost related to nonvested options under the plans totaled $ 1million. we expect to recognize this cost over a weighted-average period of 2.3years.
cash received from options exercised was $ 6million, $ 27million, and $ 8million in 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively. the actual tax benefit realized for the tax deductions from options exercised was less than $
1million in 2022 and $ 1million in 2021.

table of contents long-term incentive compensation program our long-term incentive compensation program (the "program") rewards senior executives and other employees critical to our long-term financial success. awards are granted annually in a variety of forms:
• deferred cash payments that generally vest and are payable at the rate of 25% per year;
• time-lapsed (service condition) restricted stock units payable in stock, which generally vest at the rate of 25%
per year;
• performance units payable in stock, which vest at the end of the three-yearperformance cycle and will not vest unless key attains defined performance levels and the service condition is met; and
• performance units payable in cash, which vest at the end of the three-yearperformance cycle and will not vest unless key attains defined performance levels and the service condition is met.
during 2022, 30,055performance units vested that were payable in stock and 2,224,127performance units vested that were payable in cash. the total fair value of the performance units that vested in stock and cash during 2022
totaled $ 1million and $ 55million, respectively. during 2021, no performance units vested that were payable in stock and 1,278,629performance units vested that were payable in cash. the payable in cash fair value of the performance units totaled $ 23million .

the compensation cost of time-lapsed and performance-based restricted stock or unit awards granted under the program is calculated using the closing trading price of our common shares on the grant date (or the prior business day if the grant date is not a business day).
unlike time-lapsed and performance-based restricted stock or units, we do not pay dividends during the vesting period for performance shares or units that may become payable in excess of targeted performance.
the weighted-average grant-date fair value of award s granted under the program was $ 23.39during 2022, $
20.06during 2021, and $ 18.68during 2020. as of december 31, 2022, unrecognized compensation cost related to nonvested shares under the program totaled $ 101million. we expect to recognize this cost over a weighted-average period of 2.4years. the total fair value of shares vested was $ 144million in 2022, $ 105million in 2021, and $
89million in 2020.
deferred compensation and other restricted stock awards our deferred compensation arrangements include voluntary and mandatory deferral programs for common shares awarded to certain employees and directors. mandatory deferred incentive awards vest at the rate of 25% pe r year beginning one year after the deferral date. deferrals under the voluntary programs are immediately vested.
we also may grant, upon approval by the compensation and organization committee (or our chief executive officer with respect to their delegated authority), other time-lapsed restricted stock or unit awards under various programs to recognize outstanding performance.

16.22 during 2020. as of december 31, 2022, unrecognized compensation cost related to nonvested shares granted under our deferred compensation plans and the other restricted stock or unit award programs totaled $ 21million. we expect to recognize this cost over a weighted-average period of 2.6years. the total fair value of shares vested was
$ 21million in 2022, $ 16million in 2021, and $ 18million in 2020.
discounted stock purchase plan our discounted stock purchase plan provides employees the opportunity to purchase our common shares at a 10%
discount through payroll deductions. purchases are limited to $ 10,000in any month and $ 50,000in any calendar year, and are immediately vested. to accommodate employee purchases, we issue treasury shares on or around the fifteenth day of the month following the month employee payments are received. we issued 422,844common shares at a weighted-average cost to employees of $ 17.46during 2022, 335,951common shares at a weighted-average cost to employees of $ 19.28during 2021, and 500,508common shares at a weighted-average cost to employees of $ 11.76during

information pertaining to our method of accounting for stock-based compensation is included in note 1 ("summary of significant accounting policies") under the heading "stock-based compensation."
18. employee benefits pension plans key maintains a cash balance pension plan and other defined benefit plans. these plans are frozen and closed to new employees. we continue to credit participants' existing account balances for interest until they receive their plan benefits. plans provide benefits based upon length of service and compensation levels.
key utilizes its fiscal year-end as the measurement date for its pension and other postretirement employee benefit plans. actuarial gains and losses are deferred and amortized over the future service periods of active employees.
we determine the expected return on plan assets using a calculated market-related value of plan assets. gain or loss amounts in aoci are only amortized to the extent that they exceed 10% of the greater of the market-related value or the projected benefit obligation.

at december 31, 2022, our primary qualified cash balance pension plan was sufficiently funded under the requirements of erisa. consequently, we are not required to make a minimum contribution to that plan in 2023. we also do not expect to make any significant discretionary contributions during 2023.
at december 31, 2022, we expect to pay the benefits from all funded and unfunded pension plans as follows: 2023 - $
92million; 2024- $ 90million; 2025 - $ 88million; 2026 - $ 85million; 2027 - $ 82million and $ 368million in the aggregate from 2028 through 2032.

we estimate that we will recogniz e $ 12million in net pension cost for 2023.
we estimate that a 25basis point increase or decrease in the expected return on plan assets would change our net pension cost for 2023 by approximately $ 2million. pension cost also is affected by an assumed discount rate. we estimate that a 25basis point change in the assumed discount rate would change net pension cost for 2023 by approximately $ 2million.
the expected return on plan assets is determined by considering a number of factors, the most significant of which are:
• our expectations for returns on plan assets over the long term, weighted for the investment mix of the assets.
these expectations consider, among other factors, historical capital market returns of equity, fixed income, convertible, and other securities, and forecasted returns that are modeled under various economic scenarios.
• historical returns on our plan assets. based on an annual reassessment of current and expected future capital market returns, our expected return on plan assets was 4.5% for 2022, 2.75% for 2021 and 3.75% for 2020. we deemed a rate of 4.50% to be appropriate in estimating 2022 pension cost.
the investment objectives of the pension fund are developed to reflect the characteristics of the plan, such as pension formulas, cash lump sum distribution features, and the liability profiles of the plan's participants. an executive oversight committee reviews the plan's investment performance at least quarterly, and compares performance against appropriate market indices. the pension fund's investment objectives are to balance total return objectives with a continued management of plan liabilities, and to minimize the mismatch between assets and liabilities. the following table shows the asset target allocations prescribed by the pension fund's investment policies based on the plan's funded status at december 31, 2022.
target allocation asset class                   2022

investments consist of mutual funds, collective investment funds, insurance investments and other assets that invest in underlying assets in accordance with the target asset allocations shown above.
although the pension funds' investment policies conditionally permit the use of derivative contracts, we have not entered into any such contracts, and we do not expect to employ such contracts in the future.
the valuation methodologies used to measure the fair value of pension plan assets vary depending on the type of asset, as described below. for an explanation of the fair value hierarchy, see note 1 ("summary of significant accounting policies") under the heading "fair value measurements."
mutual funds. exchange-traded mutual funds listed or traded on securities exchanges are valued at the closing price on the exchange or system where the security is principally traded. these securities are classified as level 1
159
table of contents because quoted prices for identical securities in active markets are available. non exchange-traded mutual funds are classified as level 2.
collective investment funds. investments in collective investment funds are valued using the net asset value practical expedient and are not classified within the fair value hierarchy. fair value is determined based on key's proportionate share of total net assets in the fund.
insurance investment contracts and pooled separate accounts. deposits under insurance investment contracts and pooled separate accounts with insurance companies do not have readily determinable fair values and are valued using a methodology that is consistent with accounting guidance that allows the plan to estimate fair value based upon net asset value per share (or its equivalent, such as member units or an ownership in partners' capital to which a proportionate share of net assets is attributed); thus, these investments are not classified within the fair value hierarchy.
other assets. other assets include an investment in a multi-strategy investment fund and an investment in a limited partnership. these investments do not have readily determinable fair values and are valued using a methodology consistent with accounting guidance that allows the plan to estimate fair value based upon net asset value per share (or its equivalent, such as member units or an ownership in partners' capital to which a proportionate share of net assets is attributed); thus, these investments are not classified within the fair value hierarchy.

other postretirement benefit plans we sponsor a retiree healthcare plan in which all employees age 55with five yearsof service (or employees age
50with 15years of service who are terminated under conditions that entitle them to a severance benefit) are eligible to participate. participant contributions are adjusted annually. key may provide a subsidy toward the cost of coverage for certain employees hired before 2001 with a minimum of 15years of service at the time of termination. we use a separate veba trust to fund the retiree healthcare plan.

the postretirement plans were fully funded at december 31, 2022, and december 31, 2021. ther efore, no liabilities were recognized on our consolidated balance sheets.
there are no regulations that require contributions to the veba trust that funds our retiree healthcare plan, so there is no minimum funding requirement. we are permitted to make discretionary contributions to the veba trust, subject to certain irs restrictions and limitations. we anticipate that our discretionary contributions in 2023, if any, will be minimal.
at december 31, 2022, we expect to pay the benefits from other postretirement plans as follows: 2023 - $ 5million;
2024 - $ 5million; 2025 - $ 5million; 2026 - $ 5million; 2027 - $ 4million; and $ 20million in the aggregate from

table of contents the realized net investment income for the postretirement healthcare plan veba trust is subject to federal income taxes, which are reflected in the weighted-average expected return on plan assets shown above.
assumed healthcare cost trend rates do not have a material impact on net postretirement benefit cost or obligations since the postretirement plan has cost-sharing provisions and benefit limitations.
we expect to recognize a $ 2million credit in net postretirement benefit cost for 2023.
we estimate the expected returns o n plan assets for the veba trust much the same way we estimate returns on our pension funds. the primary investment objectives of the veba trust are to obtain a market rate of return, take into consideration the safety and/or risk of the investment, and to diversify the portfolio in order to satisfy the trust's anticipated liquidity requirements. the following table shows the asset target allocations prescribed by the trust's investment policy.

the medicare prescription drug, improvement and modernization act of 2003 introduced a prescription drug benefit under medicare and prescribes a federal subsidy to sponsors of retiree healthcare benefit plans that offer prescription drug coverage that is "actuarially equivalent" to the benefits under medicare part d. based on our application of the relevant regulatory formula, we determined that the prescription drug coverage related to our retiree healthcare benefit plan is not actuarially equivalent to the medicare benefit for the vast majority of retirees. for the years ended december 31, 2022, and december 31, 2021, we did not receive federal subsidies.

table of contents employee 401(k) savings plan a substantial number of our employees are covere d under a savings plan that is qualified under section 401(k) of the internal revenue code. the plan permits employees to contribute from 1% to 100% of eligible compensation, with up to 6% being eligible for matching contributions in 2022. the plan also permits us to provide a discretionary annual profit sharing contribution to eligible employees who have at least one yearof service. we did not accrue a profit sharing contribution for 2022. we made contributions of 1% for both 2021 and 2020, on eligible compensation for employees eligible on the last business day of the respective plan years. we also maintain a deferred savings plan that provides certain employees with benefits they otherwise would not have been eligible to receive under the qualified plan once their compensation for the plan year reached the irs contribution limits. total expense associated with the above plans was $ 82million in 2022, $ 119million in 2021, and $ 106million in 2020.

as described below and in note 20 ("long-term debt"), keycorp and keybank have a number of programs and facilities that support our short-term financing needs. certain subsidiaries maintain credit facilities with third parties, which provide alternative sources of funding. keycorp is the guarantor of some of the third-party facilities.
short-term credit facilities. we maintain cash on deposit in our federal reserve account, which has reduced our need to obtain funds through various short-term unsecured money market products. this account, which was maintained at $ 2.2billion at december 31, 2022 , and the unpledged securities in our investment portfolio provide a buffer to address unexpected short-term liquidity needs. we also have secured borrowing facilities at the fhlb and the federal reserve bank of cleveland to satisfy short-term liquidity requirements. as of december 31, 2022, our unused secured borrowing capacity was $ 33.8billion at the federal r eserve bank of cleveland an d $ 6.7billion a t the fhlb.

20. long-term debt the following table presents the components of our long-term debt, net of unamortized discounts and adjustments related to hedging with derivative financial instruments. we use interest rate swaps and caps, which modify the repricing characteristics of certain long-term debt, to manage interest rate risk. for more information about such financial instruments, see note 8 ("derivatives and hedging activities").

dollars. amounts outstanding under the program and any prior bank note programs are classified as "long-term debt"
on our consolidated balance sheets.
in 2020, keybank issued the following notes under the 2018 bank note program: on march 10, 2020, $ 700million of
1.25% senior bank notes due march 10, 2023; and on december 16, 2020, $ 750million fixed-to-floating rate senior bank notes due january 3, 2024 and $ 350million floating rate senior bank notes due january 3, 2024.

table of contents in 2021, keybank issued the following notes under the 2018 bank note program: on june 16, 2021, $ 800million fixed-
to-floating rate senior bank notes due june 14, 2024, and $ 400million floating rate senior bank notes due june 14,
2024.
on september 29, 2021, keybank updated its bank note program authorizing the issuance of up to $ 20billion of notes. under the program, keybank is authorized to issue notes with original maturities of seven daysor more for senior notes or five yearsor more for subordinated notes. notes will be denominated in u.s. dollars. amounts outstanding under the program and any prior bank note programs are classified as "long-term debt" on our consolidated balance sheets.

21. trust preferred securities issued by unconsolidated subsidiaries we own the outstanding common stock of business trusts formed by us that issued corporation-obligated mandatorily redeemable trust preferred securities. the trusts used the proceeds from the issuance of their trust preferred securities and common stock to buy debentures issued by keycorp. these debentures are the trusts' only assets; the interest payments from the debentures finance the distributions paid on the mandatorily redeemable trust preferred securities. the outstanding common stock of these business trusts is recorded in "other investments" on our consolidated balance sheets. we unconditionally guarantee the following payments or distributions on behalf of the trusts:
• required distributions on the trust preferred securities;
• the redemption price when a capital security is redeemed; and
• the amounts due if a trust is liquidated or terminated.
the regulatory capital rules require us to treat our mandatorily redeemable trust preferred securities as tier 2
capital.

(b) we have the right to redeem these debentures. if the debentures purchased by keycorp capital i, hnc statutory trust iii, willow grove statutory trust i, hnc statutory trust iv, westbank capital trust ii, or westbank capital trust iii are redeemed before they mature, the redemption price will be the principal amount, plus any accrued but unpaid interest. if the debentures purchased by keycorp capital ii or keycorp capital iii are redeemed before they mature, the redemption price will be the greater of: (i) the principal amount, plus any accrued but unpaid interest, or (ii) the sum of the present values of principal and interest payments discounted at the treasury rate
(as defined in the applicable indenture), plus 20basis points for keycorp capital ii or 25basis points for keycorp capital iii or 50basis points in the case of redemption upon either a tax or a capital treatment event for either keycorp capital ii or keycorp capital iii, plus any accrued but unpaid interest. the principal amount of certain debentures includes debt issuance costs and basis adjustments related to fair value hedges totaling $ 17million at december 31, 2022, and $ 52million at december 31, 2021. see note 8 for an explanation of fair value hedges. the principal amount of debentures, net of discounts, is included in "long-term debt" on the balance sheet.
(c) the interest rates for the trust preferred securities issued by keycorp capital ii and keycorp capital iii are fixed. the trust preferred securities issued by keycorp capital i have a floating interest rate, equal to three-
month libor plus 74basis points, that reprices quarterly. the trust preferred securities issued by hnc statutory trust iii have a floating interest rate, equal to three-month libor plus 140basis points, that reprices quarterly.
the trust preferred securities issued by willow grove statutory trust i have a floating interest rate, equal to three-month libor plus 131basis points, that reprices quarterly. the trust preferred securities issued by hnc statutory trust iv have a floating interest rate, equal to three-month libor plus 128basis points, that reprices quarterly. the trust preferred securities issued by westbank capital trust ii and westbank capital trust iii each have a floating interest rate, equal to three-month libor plus 219basis points, that reprices quarterly. the total interest rates are weighted-average rates.
22. commitments, contingent liabilities, and guarantees commitments to extend credit or funding loan commitments provide for financing on predetermined terms as long as the client continues to meet specified criteria. these agreements generally carry variable rates of interest and have fixed expiration dates or termination clauses. we typically charge a fee for our loan commitments. since a commitment may expire without resulting in a loan, our aggregate outstanding commitments may significantly exceed our eventual cash outlay.
loan commitments involve credit risk not reflected on our consolidated balance sheets. we mitigate exposure to credit risk with internal controls that guide how we review and approve applications for credit, establish credit limits and, when necessary, demand collateral. in particular, we evaluate the creditworthiness of each prospective borrower on a case-by-case basis and, when appropriate, adjust the allowance for credit losses on lending-related commitments. additional information pertaining to this allowance is included in note 1 ("summary of significant accounting policies") under the heading "liability for credit losses on lending-related commitments," and in note 5
("asset quality").
we also provide financial support to private equity investments, including existing direct portfolio companies and indirect private equity funds, to satisfy unfunded commitments. these unfunded commitments are not recorded on our consolidated balance sheets. additional information on principal investing commitments is provided in note 6 ("fair value measurements"). other unfunded equity investment commitments at december 31, 2022, and december 31, 2021, related to tax credit investments and were primarily attributable to lihtc investments. unfunded tax credit investment commitments are recorded on our consolidated balance sheets in "other liabilities." additional information on lihtc commitments is provided in note 13 ("variable interest entities").
the following table shows the remaining contractual amount of each class of commitment related to extending credit or funding principal investments as of december 31, 2022, and december 31, 2021. for loan commitments and commercial letters of credit, this amount represents our maximum possible accounting loss on the unused commitment if the borrower were to draw upon the full amount of the commitment and subsequently default on payment for the total amount of the then outstanding loan.

legal proceedings litigation. from time to time, in the ordinary course of business, we and our subsidiaries are subject to various litigation, investigations, and administrative proceedings. private, civil litigation may range from individual actions involving a single plaintiff to putative class action lawsuits with potentially thousands of class members.
investigations may involve both formal and informal proceedings, by both government agencies and self-regulatory bodies. these matters may involve claims for substantial monetary relief. at times, these matters may present novel claims or legal theories. due to the complex nature of these various other matters, it may be years before some matters are resolved. while it is impossible to ascertain the ultimate resolution or range of financial liability, based on information presently known to us, we do not believe there is any matter to which we are a party, or involving any of our properties that, individually or in the aggregate, would reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on our financial condition. we continually monitor and reassess the potential materiality of these litigation matters. we note, however, that in light of the inherent uncertainty in legal proceedings there can be no assurance that the ultimate resolution will not exceed established reserves. as a result, the outcome of a particular matter, or a combination of matters, may be material to our results of operations for a particular period, depending upon the size of the loss or our income for that particular period.
guarantees we are a guarantor in various agreements with third parties. the following table shows the types of guarantees that we had outstanding at december 31, 2022. information pertaining to the basis for determining the liabilities recorded in connection with these guarantees is included in note 1 ("summary of significant accounting policies")
under the heading "contingencies and guarantees."

(a) the maximum potential undiscounted future payments represent notional amounts of derivatives qualifying as guarantees.
we determine the payment/performance risk associated with each type of guarantee described below based on the probability that we could be required to make the maximum potential undiscounted future payments shown in the preceding table. we use a scale of low ( 0% to 30% probability of payment), moderate (greater than 30% to 70%
probability of payment), or high (greater than 70% probability of payment) to assess the payment/performance risk, and have determined that the payment/performance risk associated with each type of guarantee outstanding at december 31, 2022, is low.
standby letters of credit. keybank issues standby letters of credit to address clients' financing needs. these instruments obligate us to pay a specified third party when a client fails to repay an outstanding loan or debt instrument or fails to perform some contractual nonfinancial obligation. any amounts drawn under standby letters of credit are treated as loans to the client; they bear interest (generally at variable rates) and pose the same credit risk
167
table of contents to us as a loan. at december 31, 2022, our standby letters of credit had a remaining weighted-average life of
1.8years, with remaining actual lives ranging from less than 1year to as many as 11.9years.
recourse agreement with fnma. at december 31, 2022, the outstanding commercial mortgage loans in this program had a weighted-average remaining term of 7.5years, and the unpaid principal balance outstanding of loans sold by us as a participant was $ 22.0billion. the maximum potential amount of undiscounted future payments that we could be required to make under this program, as shown in the preceding table, is equal to approximately 31% of the principal balance of loans outstanding at december 31, 2022. fnma delegates responsibility for originating, underwriting, and servicing mortgages, and we assume a limited portion of the risk of loss during the remaining term on each commercial mortgage loan that we sell to fnma. we maintain a reserve for such potential losses in an amount that we believe approximates the fair value of our liability in addition to the expected credit loss for the guarantee as described in note 5 ("asset quality").
residential mortgage banking. we often originate and sell residential mortgage loans and retain the servicing rights. our loan sales activity is generally conducted through loan sales in a secondary market sponsored by fnma and fhlmc and through the issuance of gnma mortgage backed securities. subsequent to the sale of mortgage loans, we do not typically retain any interest in the underlying loans except through our relationship as the servicer of the loans.
as is customary in the mortgage banking industry, we, or banks we have acquired, have made certain representations and warranties related to the sale of residential mortgage loans (including loans sold with servicing rights released) and to the performance of our obligations as servicer. the breach of any such representations or warranties could result in losses for us. our maximum exposure to loss is equal to the outstanding principal balance of the sold loans; however, any loss would be reduced by any payments received on the loans or through the sale of collateral.
at december 31, 2022, the unpaid principal balance outstanding of loans sold by us was $ 11.0billion. the maximum potential amount of undiscounted future payments that we could be required to make under this program, as shown in the preceding table, is equal to approximately 30% of the principal balance of loans outstanding at december 31,
2022.
our liability for estimated repurchase obligations on loans sold, which is included in other liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets, was $ 13million at december 31, 2022.
written put options. in the ordinary course of business, we "write" put options for clients that wish to mitigate their exposure to changes in interest rates and commodity prices. at december 31, 2022, our written put options had an average life of 1.8years. these instruments are considered to be guarantees, as we are required to make payments to the counterparty (the client) based on changes in an underlying variable that is related to an asset, a liability, or an equity security that the client holds. we are obligated to pay the client if the applicable benchmark interest rate or commodity price is above or below a specified level (known as the "strike rate"). these written put options are accounted for as derivatives at fair value, as further discussed in note 8 ("derivatives and hedging activities"). we mitigate our potential future payment obligations by entering into offsetting positions with third parties.
written put options where the counterparty is a broker-dealer or bank are accounted for as derivatives at fair value but are not considered guarantees since these counterparties typically do not hold the underlying instruments. in addition, we are a purchaser and seller of credit derivatives, which are further discussed in note
8.
other off-balance sheet risk other off-balance sheet risk stems from financial instruments that do not meet the definition of a guarantee as specified in the applicable accounting guidance, and from other relationships.
indemnifications provided in the ordinary course of business. we provide certain indemnifications, primarily through representations and warranties in contracts that we execute in the ordinary course of business in connection with loan and lease sales and other ongoing activities, as well as in connection with purchases and sales of businesses. we maintain reserves, when appropriate, with respect to liability that reasonably could arise as a result of these indemnities.
168
table of contents intercompany guarantees. keycorp, keybank, and certain of our affiliates are parties to various guarantees that facilitate the ongoing business activities of other affiliates. these business activities encompass issuing debt, assuming certain lease and insurance obligations, purchasing or issuing investments and securities, and engaging in certain leasing transactions involving clients.

24. shareholders' equity comprehensive capital plan as part of our previous 2021 capital plan, which was effective through the third quarter of 2022, the board had authorized the repurchase of up to $ 1.5billion of our common shares. in september 2022, the board approved the extension of the previous authorization through the third quarter of 2023. as of december 31, 2022, approximately $
790million remained available for repurchase under the authorization.
during 2021 , we repurchased a total of $ 1.1billion of common share under our previous capital plan authorizations. of the total common shares repurchased throughout 2021, $ 585million were part of an asr program entered into with goldman sachs & co. llc (goldman sachs) and $ 559million were repurchased in the open market. in addition, $ 32million in repurchase activity was related to employee equity compensation programs.
under the asr program, we made a cash payment of $ 585million to goldman sachs and received an initial delivery of
23.6million shares of our common stock from goldman sachs based on the then current market price of $ 19.87as of september 10, 2021. as previously reported during the third quarter of 2021, there was a $ 117million reduction to our capital surplus balance, which reflected the value of common stock held back by goldman sachs pending final settlement of the asr program. on december 21, 2021, we received a final delivery of 2.5million of our common shares from goldman sachs based on the volume-weighted average share price of our common stock during the term of the asr agreement, less a discount, and other adjustments provided for by the agreement. the volume-weighted share price less discount totaled $ 22.48for the total 26million common shares purchased between the up front delivery and the final settlement.
during 2022, nocommon shares were repurchased under the previous or current authorization. activity was limited to
$ 44million in repurchases related to employee equity compensation programs.
consistent with our capital plan, the board declared a quarterly dividend of $ .195per common share for the first three quarters in 2022. during the fourth quarter of 2022, the board declared a dividend of $ .205per common share.
these quarterly dividend payments brought our annual dividend to $ .79per common share for 2022.

h capital adequacy keycorp and keybank (consolidated) must meet specific capital requirements imposed by federal banking regulators.
sanctions for failure to meet applicable capital requirements may include regulatory enforcement actions that restrict dividend payments, require the adoption of remedial measures to increase capital, terminate fdic deposit insurance, and mandate the appointment of a conservator or receiver in severe cases. in addition, failure to maintain a "well capitalized" status affects how regulators evaluate applications for certain endeavors, including acquisitions, continuation and expansion of existing activities, and commencement of new activities, and could make clients and potential investors less confident. as of december 31, 2022, keycorp and keybank (consolidated) met all regulatory capital requirements.
keybank (consolidated) qualified for the "well capitalized" prompt corrective action capital category at december
31, 2022, because its capital and leverage ratios exceeded the prescribed threshold ratios for that capital category and
170
table of contents it was not subject to any written agreement, order, or directive to meet and maintain a specific capital level for any capital measure. since that date, we believe there has been no change in condition or event that has occurred that would cause the capital category for keybank (consolidated) to change.
bhcs are not assigned to any of the five prompt corrective action capital categories applicable to insured depository institutions. if, however, those categories applied to bhcs, we believe that keycorp would satisfy the criteria for a "well capitalized" institution at december 31, 2022, and since that date, we believe there has been no change in condition or event that has occurred that would cause such capital category to change.
because the regulatory capital categories under the prompt corrective action regulations serve a limited supervisory function, investors should not use them as a representation of the overall financial condition or prospects of keybank or keycorp.

table of contents commercial bank the commercial bank is an aggregation of our institutional and commercial operating segments. the commercial operating segment is a full-service corporate bank focused principally on serving the borrowing, cash management, and capital markets needs of middle market clients within key's 15-state branch footprint. it is also a significant, national, commercial real estate lender and third-party servicer of commercial mortgage loans and a special servicer of cmbs. the institutional operating segment operates nationally in providing lending, equipment financing, and banking products and services to large corporate and institutional clients. the industry coverage and product teams have established expertise in the following sectors: consumer, energy, healthcare, industrial, public sector, real estate, and technology. the operating segment includes the kbcm platform which provides a broad suite of capital markets products and services including syndicated finance, debt and equity capital markets, derivatives, foreign exchange, financial advisory, and public finance. additionally, kbcm provides fixed income and equity sales and trading services to investor clients .
other other includes various corporate treasury activities such as management of our investment securities portfolio, long-term debt, short-term liquidity and funding activities, and balance sheet risk management, our principal investing unit, and various exit portfolios as well as reconciling items, which primarily represent the unallocated portion of nonearning assets of corporate support functions. charges related to the funding of these assets are part of net interest income and are allocated to the business segments through noninterest expense. reconciling items also include intercompany eliminations and certain items that are not allocated to the business segments because they do not reflect their normal operations.
the table on the following page shows selected financial data for our major business segments for the years ended december 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020.
the information was derived from the internal financial reporting system that we use to monitor and manage our financial performance. gaap guides financial accounting, but there is no authoritative guidance for "management accounting" - the way we use our judgment and experience to make reporting decisions. consequently, the line of business results we report may not be comparable to line of business results presented by other companies.
the selected financial data is based on internal accounting policies designed to compile results on a consistent basis and in a manner that reflects the underlying economics of the businesses. in accordance with our policies:
• net interest income is determined by assigning a standard cost for funds used or a standard credit for funds provided based on their assumed maturity, prepayment, and/or repricing characteristics.
• indirect expenses, such as computer servicing costs and corporate overhead, are allocated based on assumptions regarding the extent that each line of business actually uses the services.
• the consolidated provision for credit losses is allocated among the lines of business primarily based on their actual net loan charge-offs, adjusted periodically for loan growth and changes in risk profile. the amount of the consolidated provision is based on the methodology that we use to estimate our consolidated alll. this methodology is described in note 1 ("summary of significant accounting policies") under the heading "allowance for loan and lease losses."
• capital is assigned to each line of business based on economic equity.
developing and applying the methodologies that we use to allocate items among our lines of business is a dynamic process. accordingly, financial results may be revised periodically to reflect enhanced alignment of expense base allocation drivers, changes in the risk profile of a particular business, or changes in our organizational structure.

results of operations earnings overview the following chart provides a reconciliation of net income from continuing operations attributable to key common shareholders for the year ended december 31, 2021, to the year ended december 31, 2022 (dollars in millions):
(a) includes preferred dividends.
net interest income one of our principal sources of revenue is net interest income. net interest income is the difference between interest income received on earning assets (such as loans and securities) and loan-related fee income, and interest expense paid on deposits and borrowings. there are several factors that affect net interest income, including:
•the volume, pricing, mix, and maturity of earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities;
•the volume and value of net free funds, such as noninterest-bearing deposits and equity capital;
•the use of derivative instruments to manage interest rate risk;
•interest rate fluctuations and competitive conditions within the marketplace;
•asset quality; and
•fair value accounting of acquired earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities.
to make it easier to compare both the results among several periods and the yields on various types of earning assets (some taxable, some not), we present net interest income in this discussion on a "te basis" (i.e., as if all income were taxable and at the same rate). for example, $100 of tax-exempt income would be presented as $126, an amount that, if taxed at the statutory federal income tax rate of 21%, would yield $100.
table of contents net interest income (te) for 2022 was $4.6 billion, and the net interest margin was 2.64%. compared to 2021, net interest income (te) increased $456 million and the net interest margin increased by 14 basis points. net interest income (te) benefited from higher earning asset balances, higher interest rates, and a favorable balance sheet mix. net interest income (te) and the net interest margin were negatively impacted by the sale of the indirect auto loan portfolio in the third quarter of 2021, higher interest-bearing deposit costs, and lower loan fees from ppp.
average loans totaled $111.3 billion for 2022, compared to $100.3 billion in 2021. commercial loans increased $6.5 billion, reflecting core commercial and industrial loan growth and an increase in commercial mortgage real estate loans, which mitigated the impact of a $4.7 billion decline in ppp balances. consumer loans increased $4.6 billion driven by key's consumer mortgage business and student loan originations from laurel road, partly offset by the sale of the indirect auto loan portfolio in the third quarter of 2021.
average deposits totaled $146.9 billion for 2022, an increase of $1.8 billion compared to 2021. the increase reflects growth from consumer and commercial relationships, partially offset by a decline in time deposits and non-operating commercial deposit balances.
figure 1 shows the various components of our balance sheet that affect interest income and expense and their respective yields or rates over the past five years. this figure also presents a reconciliation of te net interest income to net interest income reported in accordance with gaap for each of those years. the net interest margin, which is an indicator of the profitability of our earning assets less the cost of funding, is calculated by dividing taxable-equivalent net interest income by average earning assets.

provision for credit losses our provision for credit losses was a net charge of $502 million for 2022, compared to a $418 million net benefit for 2021. the increase in our provision for credit losses was a result of reserve increases largely driven by changes in the economic outlook and loan growth, offset somewhat by lower net charge-offs. in 2021, our provision for credit losses was a net benefit due to reserve releases as the economic stress and uncertainty in the u.s. and globally caused by covid-19 eased, along with significantly lower net loan charge-offs and improved asset quality. in 2023 we expect net charge-offs to average loans to be in the range of 25 to 30 bps.
table of contents noninterest income noninterest income for 2022 was $2.7 billion, compared to $3.2 billion during 2021. noninterest income represented 37% of total revenue for 2022 and 44% of total revenue for 2021. in 2023, we expect noninterest income to be down 1% to 3% compared to 2022.
the following discussion explains the composition of certain elements of our noninterest income and the factors that caused those elements to change.
figure 3. noninterest income
(a)other noninterest income includes operating lease income and other leasing gains, corporate services income, corporate-owned life insurance income, consumer mortgage income, commercial mortgage servicing fees, and other income. see the "consolidated statements of income" in part ii, item 8. financial statements and supplementary data of this report.
table of contents trust and investment services income trust and investment services income consists of brokerage commissions, trust and asset management commissions, and insurance income. the assets under management or administration that primarily generate these revenues are shown in figure 4. for 2022, trust and investment services income decreased $4 million, or 0.8%. this was primarily due to an increase in commissions based revenue offset by decreases in fees associated with lower assets under management.
a significant portion of our trust and investment services income depends on the value and mix of assets under management. at december 31, 2022, our bank, trust, and registered investment advisory subsidiaries had assets under management or administration of $51.3 billion, compared to $55.8 billion at december 31, 2021. the decrease from 2021 to 2022 was primarily attributable to movements in the equity markets.

investment banking and debt placement fees investment banking and debt placement fees consist of syndication fees, debt and equity underwriting fees, merger and acquisition and financial advisor fees, gains on sales of commercial mortgages, and agency origination fees. for 2022, investment banking and debt placement fees decreased $299 million, or 31.9%, from the prior year reflecting the slowdown in capital markets activity.
service charges on deposit accounts service charges on deposit accounts increased $13 million, or 3.9%, in 2022 compared to the prior year. this increase stemmed from account analysis services and overdraft fees, specifically over the first three quarters of the year. beginning late in the third quarter, key implemented new fee terms which eliminated nsf fees and introduced key coverage zonetm for overdraft fees resulting in expected reductions in fees in the fourth quarter.
cards and payments income cards and payments income, which consists of debit card, consumer and commercial credit card, and merchant services income, decreased $74 million, or 17.8%, in 2022 compared to 2021. this decrease was primarily due to reduced prepaid card activity as customers rolled off government support programs during the year with a slight offset from an increase in merchant services income.
other noninterest income other noninterest income includes operating lease income and other leasing gains, corporate services income, corporate-owned life insurance income, consumer mortgage income, commercial mortgage servicing fees, and other income. other noninterest income decreased $112 million, or 11.5%, in 2022 compared to 2021, driven by decreases in consumer mortgage income from lower gain on sale margins and lower saleable volume. decreases also occurred within operating lease income and other leasing gains from declining operating lease balances. these decreases were slightly offset by an increase in corporate services income from higher derivatives income.
noninterest expense noninterest expense for 2022 was $4.4 billion, compared to $4.4 billion for 2021. figure 5 gives a breakdown of our major categories of noninterest expense as a percentage of total noninterest expense for the twelve months ended december 31, 2022. in 2023, we expect noninterest expense to be relatively stable compared to 2022.

personnel as shown in figure 6, personnel expense, the largest category of our noninterest expense, increased by $5 million, or 0.2%, in 2022 compared to 2021. activity for the year was driven by higher salaries from higher merits and contract tech labor, with an offset from decreased incentive compensation costs from lower revenue generation in our variable expense businesses.

non-personnel expense in total, other non-personnel expense decreased $24 million, or 1.3%, in 2022 compared to 2021 stemming from declines in business services and professional fees and operating expense, with a slight offset from an increase in computer processing costs.
table of contents income taxes we recorded a tax provision from continuing operations of $422 million for 2022, compared to $642 million for 2021. the effective tax rate, which is the provision for income taxes as a percentage of income from continuing operations before income taxes, was 18.1% for 2022 and 19.7% for 2021. in 2023, we expect our gaap tax rate to be approximately 20%.
in 2022, our federal tax expense and effective tax rate differ from the amount that would be calculated using the federal statutory tax rate primarily due to investments in tax-advantaged assets, such as corporate-owned life insurance, tax credits associated with energy related projects and low-income housing investments, and periodic adjustments to our tax reserves as described in note 14 ("income taxes").
business segment results this section summarizes the financial performance of our two major business segments (operating segments): consumer bank and commercial bank. note 25 ("business segment reporting") describes the products and services offered by each of these business segments and provides more detailed financial information pertaining to the segments. dollars in the charts are presented in millions.
consumer bank segment imperatives
•simplification and digitalization to drive growth and operating leverage
•relationship-based strategy with a focus on financial wellness as a differentiator
•omni-channel approach in delivering products and services market and business overview as the banking industry moves forward, so do our clients. anticipating our clients' needs not only today, but for tomorrow and into the future, has become one of the biggest challenges for the banking industry. we view these challenges as an opportunity to help our current client base meet their own goals, as well as attract new and diverse clients. in an increasingly digital world focused on specialized convenience, we have made meaningful steps to meet those demands through new digital portals including the rollout of our national digital affinity bank, laurel road for doctors. these platforms place us in a strong position to develop long lasting and meaningful relationships with our current and prospective clients. financial wellness is a core tenet of our customer relationships and we see it in three different ways: diagnose, enhance, and sustain. our goal is to get our clients to a place where they can comfortably sustain their current financial position so we can be there for them when they are ready to grow. clients no longer go to a branch to conduct transactions only, they go to seek advice and gain new perspectives on issues they may be facing.

commercial bank segment imperatives
•solve complex client needs through a differentiated product set of banking and capital markets capabilities
•drive targeted scale through distinct product capabilities delivered to a broad set of clients
•utilize industry expertise and broad capabilities to build relationships with narrowly targeted client sets table of contents market and business overview building relationships and delivering complex solutions for middle market clients requires a distinctive operating model that understands their business and can provide a broad set of product capabilities. as competition for these clients intensifies, we have positioned the business to maintain and grow our competitive advantage by building targeted scale in businesses and client segments. strong market share in businesses such as real estate loan servicing and equipment finance highlights our ability to successfully meet customer needs through targeted scale in distinct product capabilities. clients expect us to understand every aspect of their business. our seven industry verticals are aligned to drive targeted scale in segments where we have a breadth of industry expertise. our business model is positioned to meet our client needs because our focus is not on being a universal bank, but rather being the right bank for our clients.

in the event of default by a borrower, we are subject to recourse with respect to approximately $6.8 billion of the $504.2 billion of loans administered or serviced at december 31, 2022. additional information about this recourse arrangement is included in note 22 ("commitments, contingent liabilities, and guarantees") under the heading "recourse agreement with fnma."
we derive income from several sources when retaining the right to administer or service loans that are sold. we earn noninterest income (recorded as "consumer mortgage income" and "commercial mortgage servicing fees") from fees for servicing or administering loans. this fee income is reduced by the amortization of related servicing assets. in addition, we earn interest income from investing funds generated by escrow deposits collected in connection with the servicing loans. additional information about our mortgage servicing assets is included in note 9 ("mortgage servicing assets").

table of contents securities available for sale the majority of our securities available-for-sale portfolio consists of federal agency cmos and mortgage-backed securities. cmos are debt securities secured by a pool of mortgages or mortgage-backed securities. these mortgage securities generate interest income, serve as collateral to support certain pledging agreements, and provide liquidity value under regulatory requirements.
we periodically evaluate our securities available-for-sale portfolio in light of established a/lm objectives, changing market conditions that could affect the profitability of the portfolio, the regulatory environment, and the level of interest rate risk to which we are exposed. these evaluations may cause us to take steps to adjust our overall balance sheet positioning.
in addition, the size and composition of our securities available-for-sale portfolio could vary with our needs for liquidity and the extent to which we are required (or elect) to hold these assets as collateral to secure public funds and trust deposits. although we generally use debt securities for this purpose, other assets, such as securities purchased under resale agreements or letters of credit, are used occasionally when they provide a lower cost of collateral or more favorable risk profiles.
our investing activities continue to complement other balance sheet developments and provide for our ongoing liquidity management needs. our actions to not reinvest the monthly security cash flows at various times served to provide the liquidity necessary to address our funding requirements. these funding requirements included ongoing loan growth and occasional debt maturities. at other times, we may make additional investments that go beyond the replacement of maturities or mortgage security cash flows as our liquidity position and/or interest rate risk management strategies may require. lastly, our focus on investing in high quality liquid assets, including gnma-related securities, is related to liquidity management strategies to satisfy regulatory requirements.

table of contents deposits and other sources of funds figure 18. breakdown of deposits at december 31, 2022
deposits are our primary source of funding. at december 31, 2022, our deposits totaled $142.6 billion, a decrease of $10.0 billion, compared to december 31, 2021. the decrease reflects declines in retail balances and non-operating commercial deposit balances.
wholesale funds, consisting of short-term borrowings and long-term debt, totaled $28.8 billion at december 31, 2022, compared to $12.8 billion at december 31, 2021. the increase reflects loan growth and a decline in deposit balances.
uninsured deposits totaled $67.1 billion and $77.6 billion at december 31, 2022 and december 31, 2021, respectively. uninsured amounts are estimated based on the portion of account balances, including allocated interest payable amounts, in excess of fdic insurance limits.
figure 19 shows the maturity distribution of uninsured time deposits.

capital the objective of management of capital is to maintain capital levels consistent with our risk appetite and sufficient in size to operate within a wide range of operating environments. we have identified three primary uses of capital:
1.investing in our businesses, supporting our clients, and loan growth;
2.    maintaining or increasing our common share dividend; and
3.    returning capital in the form of common share repurchases to our shareholders.
the following sections discuss certain ways we have deployed our capital. for further information, see the consolidated statements of changes in equity and note 24 ("shareholders' equity").

(a)common share repurchases were suspended during the second quarter of 2020 in response to the covid-19 pandemic and resumed in the first quarter of 2021.
dividends consistent with our capital plans, the board declared a quarterly dividend of $.195 per common share for the first three quarters of 2022 and $.205 per common share for the fourth quarter of 2022. these quarterly dividend payments brought our annual dividend to $.79 per common share for 2022.
common shares outstanding our common shares are traded on the nyse under the symbol key with 29,727 holders of record at december 31, 2022. our book value per common share was $11.79 based on 933.3 million shares outstanding at december 31, 2022, compared to $16.76 based on 928.9 million shares outstanding at december 31, 2021. at december 31, 2022, our tangible book value per common share was $8.75, compared to $13.72 at december 31, 2021.

during 2022, common shares outstanding increased by 4.5 million shares, primarily driven by issuances under employee compensation plans. for more information on share repurchases activity, see note 24 ("shareholders' equity").
at december 31, 2022, we had 323.4 million treasury shares, compared to 327.9 million treasury shares at december 31, 2021. going forward, we expect to reissue treasury shares as needed in connection with stock-based compensation awards and for other corporate purposes.
capital adequacy capital adequacy is an important indicator of financial stability and performance. all of our capital ratios remained in excess of regulatory requirements at december 31, 2022. our capital and liquidity levels are intended to position us to weather an adverse operating environment while continuing to serve our clients' needs, as well as to meet the regulatory capital rules described in the "supervision and regulation" section of item 1 of this report. our shareholders' equity to assets ratio was 7.09% at december 31, 2022, compared to 9.36% at december 31, 2021. our tangible common equity to tangible assets ratio was 4.37% at december 31, 2022, compared to 6.95% at december 31, 2021. the minimum capital and leverage ratios under the regulatory capital rules together with the estimated ratios of keycorp at december 31, 2022, calculated on a fully phased-in basis, are set forth under the heading "basel iii" in the "supervision and regulation" section in item 1 of this report.

(b)amount reflects our decision to adopt the cecl transitional provision.
(c)the alll included in tier 2 capital is limited by regulation to 1.25% of the institution's standardized total risk-weighted assets (excluding its standardized market risk-weighted assets). the alll includes $21 million and $28 million of allowance classified as "discontinued assets" on the balance sheet at december 31, 2022, and december 31, 2021, respectively.
(d)this ratio is tier 1 capital divided by average quarterly total assets as defined by the federal reserve less: (i) goodwill, (ii) the disallowed intangible and deferred tax assets, and (iii) other deductions from assets for leverage capital purposes.
off-balance sheet arrangements off-balance sheet arrangements we are party to various types of off-balance sheet arrangements, which could lead to contingent liabilities or risks of loss that are not reflected on the balance sheet.
variable interest entities in accordance with the applicable accounting guidance for consolidations, we consolidate a vie if we have: (i) a variable interest in the entity; (ii) the power to direct activities of the vie that most significantly impact the entity's economic performance; and (iii) the obligation to absorb losses of the entity or the right to receive benefits from the entity that could potentially be significant to the vie (i.e., we are considered to be the primary beneficiary). additional information regarding the nature of vies and our involvement with them is included in note 1 ("summary of significant accounting policies") under the heading "principles of consolidation and basis of presentation" and in note 13 ("variable interest entities").
table of contents commitments to extend credit or funding loan commitments provide for financing on predetermined terms as long as the client continues to meet specified criteria. these commitments generally carry variable rates of interest and have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses. we typically charge a fee for our loan commitments. since a commitment may expire without resulting in a loan or being fully utilized, the total amount of an outstanding commitment may significantly exceed any related cash outlay. further information about our loan commitments at december 31, 2022, is presented in note 22 ("commitments, contingent liabilities, and guarantees") under the heading "commitments to extend credit or funding."
other off-balance sheet arrangements other off-balance sheet arrangements include financial instruments that do not meet the definition of a guarantee in accordance with the applicable accounting guidance, and other relationships, such as liquidity support provided to asset-backed commercial paper conduits, indemnification agreements and intercompany guarantees. information about such arrangements is provided in note 22 under the heading "other off-balance sheet risk."
guarantees we are a guarantor in various agreements with third parties. as guarantor, we may be contingently liable to make payments to the guaranteed party based on changes in a specified interest rate, foreign exchange rate or other variable (including the occurrence or nonoccurrence of a specified event). these variables, known as underlyings, may be related to an asset or liability, or another entity's failure to perform under a contract. additional information regarding these types of arrangements is presented in note 22 ("commitments, contingent liabilities, and guarantees") under the heading "guarantees."
risk management overview like all financial services companies, we engage in business activities and assume the related risks. the most significant risks we face are credit, compliance, operational, liquidity, market, reputation, strategic, and model risks. our risk management activities are shown in the following chart, and we manage such risks across the entire enterprise to maintain safety and soundness and maximize profitability. certain of these risks are defined and discussed in greater detail in the remainder of this section.
federal banking regulators continue to emphasize with financial institutions the importance of relating capital management strategy to the level of risk at each institution. we believe our internal risk management processes help us achieve and maintain capital levels that are commensurate with our business activities and risks, and table of contents conform to regulatory expectations. the table below depicts our risk management hierarchy and associated responsibilities and activities of each group.

market risk management market risk is the risk that movements in market risk factors, including interest rates, foreign exchange rates, equity prices, commodity prices, credit spreads, and volatilities will reduce key's income and the value of its portfolios. these factors influence prospective yields, values, or prices associated with the instrument. we are exposed to market risk both in our trading and nontrading activities, which include asset and liability management activities. our risk management activities are focused on ensuring that we properly identify, measure, and manage such risks across the entire enterprise to maintain safety and soundness, and to maximize profitability. information regarding our fair value policies, procedures, and methodologies is provided in note 1 ("summary of significant accounting policies") under the heading "fair value measurements" and note 6 ("fair value measurements") in this report.
table of contents trading market risk key incurs market risk as a result of trading activities that are used in support of client facilitation and hedging activities, principally within our investment banking and capital markets businesses. key has exposures to a wide range of risk factors including interest rates, equity prices, foreign exchange rates, credit spreads, and commodity prices, as well as the associated implied volatilities and spreads. our primary market risk exposures are a result of trading and hedging activities in the derivative and fixed income markets, including securitization exposures. at december 31, 2022, we did not have any re-securitization positions. we maintain modest trading inventories to facilitate customer flow, make markets in securities, and hedge certain risks including but not limited to credit risk and interest rate risk. the risks associated with these activities are mitigated in accordance with the market risk hedging policy.  the majority of our positions are traded in active markets.
management of trading market risks. market risk management is an integral part of key's risk culture. the risk committee of our board provides oversight of trading market risks. the erm committee and the market risk committee regularly review and discuss market risk reports prepared by our mrm that contain our market risk exposures and results of monitoring activities. market risk policies and procedures have been defined and take into account our tolerance for risk and consideration for the business environment. the market risk committee approves market risk policies and recommends our significant market risk policy to the erm committee, the keybank board, and the risk committee of the board for approval.
the mrm, as the second line of defense, is an independent risk management function that partners with the lines of business to identify, measure, and monitor market risks throughout our company. the mrm is responsible for ensuring transparency of significant market risks, monitoring compliance with established limits, and escalating limit exceptions to appropriate senior management. the various business units and trading desks are responsible for ensuring that market risk exposures are well-managed and prudent. market risk is monitored through various measures, such as var, and through routine stress testing, sensitivity, and scenario analyses. the mrm conducts stress tests for each position using historical worst case and standard shock scenarios. var, stressed var, and other analyses are prepared daily and distributed to appropriate management.
covered positions. we monitor the market risk of our covered positions as defined in the market risk rule, which includes all of our trading positions as well as all foreign exchange and commodity positions, regardless of whether the position is in a trading account. key's covered positions may also include mortgage-backed and asset-backed securities that may be identified as securitization positions or re-securitization positions under the market risk rule. the mrm as well as the lob that trades securitization positions monitor the positions, the portfolio composition and the risks identified in this section on a daily basis consistent with the market risk policies and procedures. at december 31, 2022, covered positions did not include any re-securitization positions. instruments that are used to hedge nontrading activities, such as bank-issued debt and loan portfolios, equity positions that are not actively traded, and securities financing activities, do not meet the definition of a covered position. the mrm is responsible for identifying our portfolios as either covered or non-covered. the covered position working group develops the final list of covered positions, and a summary is provided to the market risk committee.
our significant portfolios of covered positions are detailed below. we analyze market risk by portfolios of covered positions and do not separately measure and monitor our portfolios by risk type. the descriptions below incorporate the respective risk types associated with each of these portfolios.
•fixed income includes those instruments associated with our capital markets business and the trading of securities as a dealer. these instruments may include positions in municipal bonds, bonds backed by the u.s. government, agency and corporate bonds, certain mortgage-backed and asset-backed securities, securities issued by the u.s. treasury, money markets, and certain cmos. the activities and instruments within the fixed income portfolio create exposures to interest rate and credit spread risks.
•interest rate derivatives include interest rate swaps, caps, and floors, which are transacted primarily to accommodate the needs of commercial loan clients. in addition, we enter into interest rate derivatives to offset or mitigate the interest rate risk related to the client positions. the activities within this portfolio create exposures to interest rate risk.
var and stressed var. var is the estimate of the maximum amount of loss on an instrument or portfolio due to adverse market conditions during a given time interval within a stated confidence level. stressed var is used to assess extreme conditions on market risk within our trading portfolios. the mrm calculates var and stressed var table of contents on a daily basis, and the results are distributed to appropriate management. var and stressed var results are also provided to our regulators and utilized in regulatory capital calculations.
we use a historical simulation var model to measure the potential adverse effect of changes in interest rates, foreign exchange rates, equity prices, and credit spreads on the fair value of our covered positions and other non-covered positions. we analyze market risk by portfolios and do not separately measure and monitor our portfolios by risk type. historical scenarios are customized for specific positions, and numerous risk factors are incorporated in the calculation. additional consideration is given to the risk factors to estimate the exposures that contain optionality features, such as options and cancellable provisions. var is calculated using daily observations over a one-year time horizon, and approximates a 95% confidence level. statistically, this means that we would expect to incur losses greater than var, on average, five out of 100 trading days, or three to four times each quarter. we also calculate var and stressed var at a 99% confidence level.
the var model is an effective tool in estimating ranges of possible gains and losses on our positions. however, there are limitations inherent in the var model since it uses historical results over a given time interval to estimate future performance. historical results may not be indicative of future results, and changes in the market or composition of our portfolios could have a significant impact on the accuracy of the var model. we regularly review and enhance the modeling techniques, inputs, and assumptions used. our market risk policy includes the independent validation of our var model by key's internal model validation group on an annual basis. the model risk committee oversees the model validation program, and results of validations are discussed with the erm committee.
actual losses for the total covered positions did not exceed aggregate daily var on any day during the quarters ended december 31, 2022, and december 31, 2021. the mrm back tests our var model on a daily basis to evaluate its predictive power. the test compares var model results at the 99% confidence level to daily held profit and loss. results of back testing are provided to the market risk committee. back testing exceptions occur when trading losses exceed var. we do not engage in correlation trading or utilize the internal model approach for measuring default and credit migration risk. our net var approach incorporates diversification, but our var calculation does not include the impact of counterparty risk and our own credit spreads on derivatives.
the aggregate var at the 99% confidence level with a one day holding period for all covered positions was $1.1 million at december 31, 2022, and $1.0 million at december 31, 2021. figure 22 summarizes our var at the 99% confidence level with a one day holding period for significant portfolios of covered positions for the three months ended december 31, 2022, and december 31, 2021.

stressed var is calculated by running the portfolios through a predetermined stress period which is approved by the market risk committee and is calculated at the 99% confidence level using the same model and assumptions used for general var. the aggregate stressed var for all covered positions was $1.9 million at december 31, 2022, and $4.3 million at december 31, 2021. figure 23 summarizes our stressed var at the 99% confidence level with a one day holding period for significant portfolios of covered positions for the three months ended december 31, 2022, and december 31, 2021. the decrease in stressed var is due to several factors including a change in our var modeling and the change in the size and composition of the fixed income inventory.

internal capital adequacy assessment.  market risk is a component of our internal capital adequacy assessment. our risk-weighted assets include a market risk-equivalent asset amount, which consists of a var component, stressed var component, a de minimis exposure amount, and a specific risk add-on including the securitization positions. the aggregate market value of the securitization positions as defined by the market risk rule was $13 million at december 31, 2022, all of which were mortgage-backed security positions. specific risk is the price risk of individual financial instruments, which is not accounted for by changes in broad market risk factors and is measured through a standardized approach. market risk weighted assets, including the specific risk calculations, are run quarterly by the mrm in accordance with the market risk rule, and approved by the chief market risk officer.
nontrading market risk most of our nontrading market risk is derived from interest rate fluctuations and its impacts on our traditional loan and deposit products, as well as investments, hedging relationships, long-term debt, and certain short-term borrowings. interest rate risk, which is inherent in the banking industry, is measured by the potential for fluctuations in net interest income and the eve. such fluctuations may result from changes in interest rates and differences in the repricing and maturity characteristics of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities. we manage the exposure to changes in net interest income and the eve in accordance with our risk appetite and in accordance with the board approved erm policy.
interest rate risk positions are influenced by a number of factors, including the balance sheet positioning that arises out of customer preferences for loan and deposit products, economic conditions, the competitive environment within our markets, changes in market interest rates that affect client activity, and our hedging, investing, funding, and capital positions. the primary components of interest rate risk exposure consist of reprice risk, basis risk, yield curve risk, and option risk.
•"reprice risk" is the exposure to changes in the level of interest rates and occurs when the volume of interest-bearing liabilities and the volume of interest-earning assets they fund (e.g., deposits used to fund loans) do not mature or reprice at the same time.
•"basis risk" is the exposure to asymmetrical changes in interest rate indexes and occurs when floating-rate assets and floating-rate liabilities reprice at the same time, but in response to different market factors or indexes.
•"yield curve risk" is the exposure to non-parallel changes in the slope of the yield curve (where the yield curve depicts the relationship between the yield on a particular type of security and its term to maturity) and occurs when interest-bearing liabilities and the interest-earning assets that they fund do not price or reprice to the same term point on the yield curve.
•"option risk" is the exposure to a customer or counterparty's ability to take advantage of the interest rate environment and terminate or reprice one of our assets, liabilities, or off-balance sheet instruments prior to contractual maturity without a penalty. option risk occurs when exposures to customer and counterparty early withdrawals or prepayments are not mitigated with an offsetting position or appropriate compensation.
the management of nontrading market risk is centralized within corporate treasury. the risk committee of our board provides oversight of nontrading market risk. the erm committee and the alco review reports on the interest rate risk exposures described above. in addition, the alco reviews reports on stress tests and sensitivity analyses related to interest rate risk. these committees have various responsibilities related to managing nontrading market risk, including recommending, approving, and monitoring strategies that maintain risk positions within approved tolerance ranges. the a/lm policy provides the framework for the oversight and management of interest rate risk and is administered by the alco. the mrm, as the second line of defense, provides additional oversight.
table of contents libor transition as disclosed in item 1a. risk factors of this report, bank regulators have issued guidance advising against the use of libor in its current form for new contracts. for most financial products, the most common alternative reference rates have been, and are expected to be, sofr-based benchmarks. this is true for both new originations and legacy libor contracts that are subject to amendment or a transition by their terms. we have established an enterprise-wide program to identify and address all libor transition issues related to legacy libor contracts. we are collaborating closely with regulators and industry groups on the transition and closely monitoring industry practices related to libor alternatives. the goals of our libor transition program include:
•identifying and analyzing libor-based exposure and developing and executing transition strategies;
•reviewing and updating near-term strategies and actions for our libor-based business currently being written;
•assessing financial impacts and risks while planning and executing mitigation actions;
•understanding and strategically addressing the current market approach to libor relative to transitioning to alternative reference rates, including the impact of the libor act and the federal reserve's regulations as well as the fca's policy decisions related to so-called synthetic usd libor;
•determining and executing system and process work to be operationally ready for credit sensitive benchmarks; and
•remediating remaining libor contracts.
as part of the libor transition program, we completed an initial risk assessment to help us identify the impact and risks associated with various products, systems, processes, and models. this risk assessment has assisted us in making necessary updates to our infrastructure and operational systems and processes to implement a replacement rate, and we are operationally ready for various sofr-based benchmarks, including but not limited to, daily simple sofr in arrears, sofr compounded in arrears, sofr averages in advance, and term sofr. we are actively quoting alternative indexes other than libor, such as sofr and term sofr, and are originating new loans in those indexes. we have also originated a small number of new loans using credit sensitive rates in a limited and managed fashion.
we have compiled an inventory of existing legal contracts that are impacted by the libor transition. we have assessed the libor fallback language in those contracts, have devised a strategy to address the libor transition for those contracts, and are in the process of remediating such contracts. our progress is well-paced. we expect to leverage recommendations made by the arrc and isda that are tailored to our specific client segments. we also have evaluated the impact of the libor act on our transition strategy. the legislation provides a uniform national approach for replacing libor in legacy contracts that do not provide for the use of a clearly defined or practicable replacement benchmark rate.
as of december 31, 2022, key had the following instruments that were dependent on libor:

net interest income simulation analysis. the primary tool we use to measure our interest rate risk is simulation analysis. for purposes of this analysis, we estimate our net interest income based on the current and projected composition of our on- and off-balance sheet positions, accounting for recent and anticipated trends in customer activity. the analysis also incorporates assumptions for the current and projected interest rate environments and balance sheet growth projections based on a most likely macroeconomic view. the modeling incorporates investment portfolio and swap portfolio balances consistent with management's desired interest rate risk positioning. the simulation model estimates the amount of net interest income at risk by simulating the change in net interest income that would occur if rates were to gradually increase or decrease from current levels over the next 12 months (subject to a floor on market interest rates at zero).
figure 25 presents the results of the simulation analysis at december 31, 2022, and december 31, 2021. at december 31, 2022, our simulated impact to changes in interest rates was moderate. the exposure to declining rates has decreased as a result of the change in balance sheet mix compared to the december 31, 2021 analysis.
table of contents tolerance levels for risk management require the development of remediation plans to maintain residual risk within tolerance if simulation modeling demonstrates that a gradual, parallel 200 basis point increase or 200 basis point decrease in interest rates over the next 12 months would adversely affect net interest income over the same period by more than 5.5%. current modeled exposure is within board approved tolerances. if a tolerance level is breached and determined inconsistent with risk appetite, the development of a remediation plan is required to reduce exposure back to within tolerance.

simulation analysis produces a sophisticated estimate of interest rate exposure based on assumptions inputs within the model. assumptions are tailored to the specific interest rate environment and validated on a regular basis. however, actual results may differ from those derived in simulation analyses due to unanticipated changes to the balance sheet composition, customer behavior, product pricing, market interest rates, changes in management's desired interest rate risk positioning, investment, funding and hedging activities or repercussions from exogenous events.
regular stress tests and sensitivity analyses are performed on the model inputs that could materially change the resulting risk assessments. assessments are performed using different yield curve shapes, including steepenings or flattenings of the curve, immediate changes in market interest rates, and changes in the relationship of money market interest rates. assessments are also performed on changes to the following assumptions: loan and deposit balances, the pricing of deposits without contractual maturities, changes in lending spreads, prepayments on loans and securities, investment, funding and hedging activities, and liquidity and capital management strategies.
the results of additional assessments indicate that net interest income could increase or decrease from the base simulation results presented in figure 25. net interest income is highly dependent on the timing, magnitude, frequency, and path of interest rate changes and the associated assumptions for deposit repricing relationships, lending spreads, and the balance behavior of transaction accounts. if fixed rate assets increase by $1 billion, or fixed rate liabilities decrease by $1 billion, then the benefit to rising rates would decrease by approximately 25 basis points. if the interest-bearing liquid deposit beta assumption increases or decreases by 5% (e.g., 40% to 45%), then the benefit to rising rates would decrease or increase by approximately 99 basis points.
the current interest rate risk position could fluctuate to higher or lower levels of risk depending on the competitive environment and client behavior that may affect the actual volume, mix, maturity, and repricing characteristics of loan and deposit flows. corporate treasury discretionary activities related to funding, investing, and hedging may also change as a result of changes in customer business flows or changes in management's desired interest rate risk positioning. as changes occur to both the configuration of the balance sheet and the outlook for the economy, management proactively evaluates hedging opportunities that may change our interest rate risk profile.
simulations are also conducted that measure the effect of changes in market interest rates in the second and third years of a three-year horizon. these simulations are conducted in a similar manner to those based on a 12-month horizon. to capture longer-term exposures, changes in the eve are calculated as discussed in the following section.
economic value of equity modeling. eve complements net interest income simulation analysis as it estimates risk exposure beyond 12-, 24-, and 36-month horizons. eve modeling measures the extent to which the economic values of assets, liabilities, and off-balance sheet instruments may change in response to fluctuations in interest rates. eve is calculated by subjecting the balance sheet to an immediate increase or decrease in interest rates, measuring the resulting change in the values of assets, liabilities, and off-balance sheet instruments, and comparing those amounts with the base case of the current interest rate environment. eve policy limits are measured against a +200 basis point/policy decline scenario. the policy decline scenario is equal to the current fed target rate table of contents capped at 200 basis points. as of december 31, 2022, the policy decline scenario is minus 200 basis points. this analysis is highly dependent upon assumptions applied to assets and liabilities with non-contractual maturities. those assumptions are based on historical behaviors, as well as forward expectations. remediation plans are similarly developed if this analysis indicates that our eve will decrease by more than 15% in response to an immediate increase or decrease in interest rates. the position is within these guidelines as of december 31, 2022.
management of interest rate exposure. the results of the various interest rate risk analyses are used to formulate a/lm strategies to achieve the desired risk profile while managing to objectives for capital adequacy and liquidity risk exposures. specifically, risk positions are managed by purchasing securities, issuing term debt with floating or fixed interest rates, and using derivatives. interest rate swaps and options are predominantly used, which modify the interest rate characteristics of certain assets and liabilities.
figure 26 shows all swap positions held for a/lm purposes. these positions are used to convert the contractual interest rate index of agreed-upon amounts of assets and liabilities (i.e., notional amounts) to another interest rate index. for example, fixed-rate debt is converted to a floating rate through a "receive fixed/pay variable" interest rate swap. the volume, maturity, and mix of portfolio swaps change frequently to reflect broader a/lm objectives and the balance sheet positions to be hedged. for more information about how interest rate swaps are used to manage our risk profile, see note 8 ("derivatives and hedging activities").

liquidity risk management liquidity risk, which is inherent in the banking industry, is measured by our ability to accommodate liability maturities and deposit withdrawals, meet contractual obligations, and fund new business opportunities at a reasonable cost, in a timely manner, and without adverse consequences. liquidity management involves maintaining sufficient and diverse sources of funding to accommodate planned, as well as unanticipated, changes in assets and liabilities under both normal and adverse conditions.
governance structure we manage liquidity for all of our affiliates on an integrated basis. this approach considers the unique funding sources available to each entity, as well as each entity's capacity to manage through adverse conditions. the approach also recognizes that adverse market conditions or other events that could negatively affect the availability or cost of liquidity will affect the access of all affiliates to sufficient wholesale funding.
the management of consolidated liquidity risk is centralized within corporate treasury. oversight and governance is provided by the board, the erm committee, the alco, and the chief risk officer. the asset liability management policy provides the framework for the oversight and management of liquidity risk and is administered by the alco. the corporate treasury oversight group within the mrm, as the second line of defense, provides additional oversight. our current liquidity risk management practices are in compliance with the federal reserve board's enhanced prudential standards.
these committees regularly review liquidity and funding summaries, liquidity trends, peer comparisons, variance analyses, liquidity projections, internal liquidity stress tests, and goal tracking reports. the reviews generate a discussion of positions, trends, and directives on liquidity risk and shape a number of our decisions. when liquidity table of contents pressure is elevated, positions are monitored more closely and reporting is more intensive. to ensure that emerging issues are identified, we also communicate with individuals inside and outside of the company on a daily basis.
factors affecting liquidity our liquidity could be adversely affected by both direct and indirect events. an example of a direct event would be a downgrade in our public credit ratings by a rating agency. examples of indirect events (events unrelated to us) that could impair our access to liquidity would be an act of terrorism or war, natural disasters, global pandemics, political events, or the default or bankruptcy of a major corporation, mutual fund or hedge fund. similarly, market speculation, or rumors about us or the banking industry in general, may adversely affect the cost and availability of normal funding sources.
our credit ratings at december 31, 2022, are shown in figure 27. we believe these credit ratings, under normal conditions in the capital markets, will enable keycorp or keybank to issue fixed income securities to investors.

managing liquidity risk most of our liquidity risk is derived from our business model, which involves taking in deposits, many of which can be withdrawn at anytime, and lending them out in the form of illiquid loan assets. the assessments of liquidity risk are measured under the assumption of normal operating conditions as well as under a stressed environment. we manage these exposures in accordance with our risk appetite, and within board-approved policy limits.
we regularly monitor our liquidity position and funding sources and measure our capacity to obtain funds in a variety of hypothetical scenarios in an effort to maintain an appropriate mix of available and affordable funding. in the normal course of business, we perform a monthly internal liquidity stress test for both keycorp and keybank. in a "heightened monitoring mode," we may conduct internal liquidity stress tests more frequently, and use assumptions to reflect the changed market environment. our testing incorporates estimates for loan and deposit lives based on our historical studies. internal liquidity stress tests analyze potential liquidity scenarios under various funding constraints and time periods. ultimately, they determine the periodic effects that major direct and indirect events would have on our access to funding markets and our ability to fund our normal operations. to compensate for the effect of these assumed liquidity pressures, we consider alternative sources of liquidity and maturities over different time periods to project how funding needs would be managed.
our primary sources of funding for keybank include customer deposits, wholesale funding, and liquid assets. we maintain a contingency funding plan that outlines the process for addressing a liquidity crisis. as part of the plan, we maintain on-balance sheet liquid reserves referred to as our liquid asset portfolio, which consists of high quality liquid assets. during a problem period, that reserve could be used as a source of funding to provide time to develop and execute a longer-term strategy. the liquid asset portfolio at december 31, 2022, totaled $35.5 billion, consisting of $33.2 billion of unpledged securities, $10 million of securities available for secured funding at the fhlb, and $2.4 billion of net balances of federal funds sold and balances in our federal reserve account. the liquid asset portfolio can fluctuate due to excess liquidity, heightened risk, changes in market value, or prefunding of expected outflows, such as debt maturities. additionally, as of december 31, 2022, our unused borrowing capacity secured by loan collateral was $33.8 billion at the federal reserve bank of cleveland and $6.7 billion at the fhlb of cincinnati. in 2022, key's outstanding fhlb of cincinnati advances increased by $10.7 billion due to an increase in borrowings.
table of contents conversely, excess cash generated by operating, investing, and deposit-gathering activities may be used to repay outstanding debt or invest in liquid assets.
long-term liquidity strategy our long-term liquidity strategy is to be predominantly funded by core deposits. however, we may use wholesale funds to sustain an adequate liquid asset portfolio, meet daily cash demands, and allow management flexibility to execute business initiatives. key's client-based relationship strategy provides for a strong core deposit base that, in conjunction with intermediate and long-term wholesale funds managed to a diversified maturity structure and investor base, supports our liquidity risk management strategy. we use the loan-to-deposit ratio as a metric to monitor these strategies. our target loan-to-deposit ratio is 90-100% (at december 31, 2022, our loan-to-deposit ratio was 84.7%), which we calculate as the sum of total loans, loans held for sale, and nonsecuritized discontinued loans divided by deposits.
liquidity programs we have several liquidity programs, which are described in note 20 ("long-term debt"), that are designed to enable keycorp and keybank to raise funds in the public and private debt markets. the proceeds from most of these programs can be used for general corporate purposes, including acquisitions. these liquidity programs are reviewed from time to time by the board and are renewed and replaced as necessary. there are no restrictive financial covenants in any of these programs.
on august 8, 2022, keybank issued two notes under the bank note program: $1.25 billion of 4.15% fixed rate senior bank notes due august 8, 2025, and $750 million of 4.90% fixed rate subordinated bank notes due august 8, 2032. on november 15, 2022,under the bank note program, keybank issued $1.0 billion of 5.85% fixed rate senior bank notes due november 15, 2027. accordingly, at december 31, 2022, there was $17.0 billion available for issuance under the keybank bank note program.
on january 26, 2023, keybank issued $500 million of 4.70% fixed rate senior bank notes due january 26, 2026 and $1 billion of 5.00% fixed rate senior bank notes due january 26, 2033.
liquidity for keycorp the primary source of liquidity for keycorp is from subsidiary dividends, primarily from keybank. keycorp has sufficient liquidity when it can service its debt; support customary corporate operations and activities (including acquisitions); support occasional guarantees of subsidiaries' obligations in transactions with third parties at a reasonable cost, in a timely manner, and without adverse consequences; and fund capital distributions in the form of dividends and share buybacks.
we use a parent cash coverage months metric as the primary measure to assess parent company liquidity. the parent cash coverage months metric measures the number of months into the future where projected obligations can be met with the current quantity of liquidity. we generally issue term debt to supplement dividends from keybank to manage our liquidity position at or above our targeted levels. the parent company generally maintains cash and short-term investments in an amount sufficient to meet projected debt maturities over at least the next 24 months. at december 31, 2022, keycorp held $3.2 billion in cash and short-term investments, which we projected to be sufficient to meet our projected obligations, including the repayment of our maturing debt obligations for the periods prescribed by our risk tolerance.
typically, keycorp meets its liquidity requirements through regular dividends from keybank, supplemented with term debt. federal banking law limits the amount of capital distributions that a bank can make to its holding company without prior regulatory approval. a national bank's dividend-paying capacity is affected by several factors, including net profits (as defined by statute) for the two previous calendar years and for the current year, up to the date of dividend declaration. during 2022, keybank paid $475 million in cash dividends to keycorp, and during the fourth quarter of 2022, keybank paid $75 million cash dividends to keycorp. at january 1, 2023, keybank had regulatory capacity to pay $2.3 billion in dividends to keycorp without prior regulatory approval.
on may 23, 2022, keycorp issued $600 million of 3.878% fixed-to-floating rate senior notes due may 23, 2025 and $750 million of 4.789% fixed-to-floating rate senior notes due june 1, 2033. the fixed rate periods for each table of contents issuance are effective through may 23, 2024, and june 1, 2032, respectively. additionally, on august 24, 2022, keycorp issued $600 million of 6.2% fixed rate reset perpetual non-cumulative preferred stock.
our liquidity position and recent activity over the past 12 months, our liquid asset portfolio, which includes overnight and short-term investments, as well as unencumbered, high quality liquid securities held as protection against a range of potential liquidity stress scenarios, has decreased primarily due to a reduction in key's cash position and unencumbered securities portfolio. the liquid asset portfolio continues to exceed the amount that we estimate would be necessary to manage through an adverse liquidity event by providing sufficient time to develop and execute a longer-term solution.
from time to time, keycorp or keybank may seek to retire, repurchase, or exchange outstanding debt, capital securities, preferred shares, or common shares through cash purchase, privately negotiated transactions or other means. additional information on repurchases of common shares by keycorp is included in part ii, item 5. market for the registrant's common equity, related stockholder matters and issuer purchases of equity securities of this report. such transactions depend on prevailing market conditions, our liquidity and capital requirements, contractual restrictions, regulatory requirements, and other factors. the amounts involved may be material, individually or collectively.
the consolidated statements of cash flows summarize our sources and uses of cash by type of activity for the years ended december 31, 2022, and december 31, 2021.
credit risk management credit risk is the risk of loss arising from an obligor's inability or failure to meet contractual payment or performance terms. like other financial services institutions, we make loans, extend credit, distribute credit risk, purchase securities, provide financial and payments products, and enter into financial derivative contracts, all of which have related credit risk.
credit policy, approval, and evaluation we manage credit risk exposure through a multifaceted program. the credit risk committee approves management credit policies and recommends significant credit policies to the enterprise risk management committee, the keybank board, and the risk committee of the board for approval. these policies are communicated throughout the organization to foster a consistent approach to granting credit.
our credit risk management team and certain individuals within our lines of business, to whom credit risk management has delegated limited credit authority, are responsible for credit approval. individuals with assigned credit authority are authorized to grant exceptions to credit policies. it is not unusual to make exceptions to established policies when mitigating circumstances dictate, however, a corporate level tolerance has been established to keep exceptions at an acceptable level based upon portfolio and economic considerations.
our credit risk management team uses risk models to evaluate consumer loans. these models, known as scorecards, forecast the probability of serious delinquency and default for an applicant. the scorecards are embedded in the application processing system, which allows for real-time scoring and automated decisions for many of our products. we periodically validate the loan scoring processes.
we maintain an active concentration management program to mitigate concentration risk in our credit portfolios. for individual obligors, we employ a sliding scale of exposure, known as hold limits, which is dictated by the type of loan and strength of the borrower.
table of contents allowance for loan and lease losses we estimate the appropriate level of the alll on at least a quarterly basis. the methodology used is described in note 1 ("summary of significant accounting policies") under the heading "allowance for loan and lease losses." briefly, the alll estimate uses various models and estimation techniques based on our historical loss experience, current borrower characteristics, current conditions, reasonable and supportable forecasts and other relevant factors. on january 1, 2020, we adopted asc 326, financial instruments - credit losses, and as such, an expected credit loss methodology, specifically current expected credit losses for the remaining life of our loans and leases, will be used to estimate the appropriate level of the alll. for more information, see note 5 ("asset quality").
as shown in figure 28, our alll from continuing operations increased by $276 million, or 26.0%, from december 31, 2021. the commercial alll increased by $176 million, or 25.6%, from december 31, 2021, driven by changes in the economic outlook as the impact from higher interest rates dampened overall growth expectations, including lower commercial real estate values, combined with strong growth in the portfolio. the consumer alll increased $100 million, or 26.8%, from december 31, 2021, driven by changes in the economic forecasts including higher interest rates, lower home price values and growth in the portfolio.

operational and compliance risk management like all businesses, we are subject to operational risk, which is the risk of loss resulting from human error or malfeasance, inadequate or failed internal processes and systems, and external events. these events include, among other things, threats to our cybersecurity, as we are reliant upon information systems and the internet to conduct our business activities. operational risk intersects with compliance risk, which is the risk of loss from violations of, or noncompliance with, laws, rules and regulations, prescribed practices, and ethical standards. under the dodd-frank act, large financial companies like key are subject to heightened prudential standards and regulation. this heightened level of regulation has increased our operational risk. while operational and compliance risk are separate risk disciplines in keycorp's erm framework, losses and/or additional regulatory compliance costs are included in operational loss reporting and could take the form of explicit charges, increased operational costs, harm to our reputation, or foregone opportunities.
we seek to mitigate operational risk through identification and measurement of risk, alignment of business strategies with risk appetite and tolerance, and a system of internal controls and reporting. we continuously strive to strengthen our system of internal controls to improve the oversight of our operational risk and to ensure compliance table of contents with laws, rules, and regulations. for example, an operational event database tracks the amounts and sources of operational risk and losses. this tracking mechanism helps to identify weaknesses and to highlight the need to take corrective action. we also rely upon software programs designed to assist in assessing operational risk and monitoring our control processes. this technology has enhanced the reporting of the effectiveness of our controls to senior management and the board.
the operational risk management program provides the framework for the structure, governance, roles, and responsibilities, as well as the content, to manage operational risk for key. the compliance risk management program serves the same function in managing compliance risk for key. the operational risk committee and the compliance risk committee support the erm committee by identifying early warning events and trends, escalating emerging risks, and discussing forward-looking assessments. both the operational risk committee and the compliance risk committee include attendees from each of the three lines of defense. primary responsibility for managing and monitoring internal control mechanisms lies with the managers of our various lines of business. the operational risk committee and compliance risk committee are senior management committees that oversee our level of operational and compliance risk and direct and support our operational and compliance infrastructure and related activities. these committees and the operational risk management and compliance risk management functions are an integral part of our erm program. our risk review function regularly assesses the overall effectiveness of our operational risk management and compliance risk management programs and our system of internal controls. risk review reports the results of reviews on internal controls and systems to senior management and the risk and audit committees and independently supports the risk committee's oversight of these controls.
cybersecurity we maintain comprehensive cyber incident response plans, and we devote significant time and resources to maintaining and regularly updating our technology systems and processes to protect the security of our computer systems, software, networks, and other technology assets against attempts to obtain unauthorized access to confidential information, destroy data, disrupt or degrade service, sabotage systems, shut down access to systems for ransom, or cause other damage. as the threat landscape continues to evolve, critical infrastructure, including financial services, remains a top target for cyberattacks. the significant increase in remote working by our employees and third-party service providers inherently introduces additional risk. additionally, we face heightened risk of cyberattacks in the near term because of recent geopolitical events, which may result in increased attacks against u.s. critical infrastructure, including financial institutions. cyberattacks may include, but are not limited to, attacks that are intended to disrupt or disable banking services and prevent banking transactions, attempts to breach the security of systems and data, and social engineering attempts aimed at tricking employees and clients into providing sensitive information or executing financial transactions.
we also face cyberattack risks related to our third-party service providers. cyberattacks successfully compromising or circumventing the security of the systems of our third-party service providers have resulted in, and could again in the future result in, negative consequences to us, including interfering with our third-party providers' ability to fulfill their contractual obligations to us, an interruption in our business processes, or the disclosure or misappropriation of confidential information of us or that of our clients. these cyberattacks may result in regulatory consequences, reputational harm or financial loss or liability that could adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations. recent high-profile cyberattacks have targeted retailers, credit bureaus, and other businesses for the purpose of acquiring the confidential information (including personal, financial, and credit card information) of their customers. recently, there have also been numerous highly publicized cases where hackers requested ransom payments in exchange for not disclosing customer information or to restore company access to locked systems. we have incurred, and may again incur, expenses related to the investigation of cyberattacks involving third-party providers or related to the protection of our clients from identity theft as a result of such attacks. we have also incurred, and may continue to incur, expenses to enhance our systems or processes to protect against cyber or other security incidents.
risks and exposures related to cyberattacks are expected to remain high for the foreseeable future due to the rapidly evolving nature and sophistication of these threats, as well as due to the expanding use of internet banking, mobile banking, and other technology-based products and services by us and our clients. to date, key has not experienced material disruption of our operations, or material harm to our client base, as a result of the heightened threat landscape of cyberattacks.
as described in more detail in "risk management - overview" in item 7 of this report, the board serves in an oversight capacity ensuring that key's risks are managed in a manner that is effective and balanced and adds value table of contents for the shareholders. the board's risk committee has primary oversight for enterprise-wide risk at keycorp, including operational risk (which includes cybersecurity). the risk committee reviews and provides oversight of management's activities related to the enterprise-wide risk management framework, including cyber-related risk. board members are updated on cybersecurity matters at each regularly-scheduled board meeting. the erm committee, chaired by the chief executive officer and comprising other senior level executives, is responsible for managing risk (including cyber-related risk) and ensuring that the corporate risk profile is managed in a manner consistent with our risk appetite. the erm committee reports to the board's risk committee.
gaap to non-gaap reconciliations non-gaap financial measures have inherent limitations, are not required to be uniformly applied, and are not audited. although these non-gaap financial measures are frequently used by investors to evaluate a company, they have limitations as analytical tools, and should not be considered in isolation, nor as a substitute for analyses of results as reported under gaap.
the tangible common equity ratio and the return on tangible common equity ratio have been a focus for some investors, and management believes that these ratios may assist investors in analyzing key's capital position without regard to the effects of intangible assets and preferred stock. since analysts and banking regulators may assess our capital adequacy using tangible common equity, we believe it is useful to enable investors to assess our capital adequacy on these same bases.

the cash efficiency ratio is a ratio of two non-gaap performance measures, adjusted noninterest expense and total taxable-equivalent revenue. accordingly, there is no directly comparable gaap performance measure. the cash efficiency ratio excludes the impact of our intangible asset amortization from the calculation. we believe this ratio provides greater consistency and comparability between our results and those of our peer banks. additionally, this ratio is used by analysts and investors to evaluate how effectively management is controlling noninterest expenses in generating revenue, as they develop earnings forecasts and peer bank analysis.

critical accounting policies and estimates our business is dynamic and complex. consequently, we must exercise judgment in choosing and applying accounting policies and methodologies. these choices are critical; not only are they necessary to comply with gaap, they also reflect our view of the appropriate way to record and report our overall financial performance. all accounting policies are important, and all policies described in note 1 ("summary of significant accounting policies") should be reviewed for a greater understanding of how we record and report our financial performance.
in our opinion, some accounting policies are more likely than others to have a critical effect on our financial results and to expose those results to potentially greater volatility. these policies apply to areas of relatively greater business importance, or require us to exercise judgment and to make assumptions and estimates that affect amounts reported in the financial statements. because these assumptions and estimates are based on current circumstances, they may prove to be inaccurate, or we may find it necessary to change them. the following is a description of our current critical accounting policies.
allowance for loan and lease losses the allowance for loan and lease losses represents management's estimate of all expected credit losses over the expected contractual life of our existing loan portfolio. determining the appropriateness of the allowance is complex and requires judgment by management about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. these critical estimates include significant use of our own historical data and complex methods to interpret them. we have an ongoing process to evaluate and enhance the quality, quantity, and timeliness of our data and interpretation methods used in the determination of these allowances. these evaluations are inherently subjective, as they require material estimates and may be susceptible to significant change, and include, among others:
•pd,
•lgd,
•outstanding balance of the loan,

as described in our accounting policy related to the alll in note 1 ("summary of significant accounting policies") of this report under the heading "allowance for loan and lease losses," we employ a disciplined process and methodology to establish our alll, which has three main components: (i) asset specific / individual loan reserves; (ii) quantitative (formulaic or pooled) reserves; and (iii) qualitative (judgmental) reserves.
we use a non-dcf factor-based approach to estimate expected credit losses that include component pd/lgd/ead models as well as less complex estimation methods for smaller loan portfolios. probability of default models estimate the likelihood a borrower will cease making payments as agreed. these models use observed loan-level information and projected paths of macroeconomic variables. borrower credit attributes including fico scores of consumers and internally assigned risk ratings for commercial borrowers are significant inputs to the models. consumer fico scores are refreshed quarterly and commercial risk ratings are updated annually with select borrowers updated more frequently. the macroeconomic trends that have a significant impact on the probability of table of contents default vary by portfolio segment. exposure at default models estimate the loan balance at the time the borrower stops making payments. we use an amortization based formulaic approach to estimate account level ead for all term loans. we use portfolio specific methods in each of our revolving product portfolios. lgd models estimate the loss we will suffer once a loan is in default. account level inputs to lgd models include collateral attributes, such as loan to value.
if we observe limitations in the data or models, we use model overlays to make adjustments to model outputs to capture a particular risk or compensate for a known limitation. these variables and others may result in actual loan losses that differ from the originally estimated amounts.
this estimate produced by our models is forward-looking and requires management to use forecasts about future economic conditions to determine the expected credit loss over the remaining life of an instrument. moody's consensus forecast is the source of macroeconomic projections, including the interest rate forecasts used in the credit models. we use a two year reasonable and supportable period across all products to forecast economic conditions. as the length of the life of a financial asset increases, these inputs may become impractical to estimate as reasonable and supportable. we believe the two year time horizon appropriately aligns with our business planning, available industry guidance, and reliability of various forecasting services. following this two year period in which supportable forecasts can be generated, for all modeled loan portfolios, we revert expected credit losses to a level that is consistent with our historical information by reverting the macroeconomic variables (model inputs) to their long run average. we revert to historical loss rates for less complex estimation methods for smaller portfolios.
a four quarter reversion period is used where the macroeconomic variables linearly revert to their long run average following the two year reasonable and supportable period. we use a 20 year lookback period for determining long run historical average of the macroeconomic variables. we determined the 20 year lookback period is appropriate as it captures the previous two economic cycles as well as the impact from the pandemic.
the alll is sensitive to various macroeconomic drivers such as gdp and unemployment as well as portfolio attributes such as remaining term, outstanding balance, risk ratings, fico, ltv, and delinquency status. our alll models were designed to capture the correlation between economic and portfolio changes. as such, evaluating shifts in individual portfolio attributes and macroeconomic variables in isolation may not be indicative of past or future performance.
it is difficult to estimate how potential changes in any one factor or input might affect the overall alll because we consider a wide variety of factors and inputs in estimating the alll. changes in the factors and inputs considered may not occur at the same rate and may not be consistent across all geographies or product types, and changes in factors and input may be directionally inconsistent, such that improvement in one factor may offset deterioration in others. however, to consider the impact of a hypothetical alternate economic forecast, we compare the modeled quantitative allowance results using a downside economic scenario. the maximum difference in the quarterly macroeconomic variables between the base and downside scenarios over the two year reasonable and supportable period includes an approximate 7% decline in gdp annualized growth and an approximate 3% increase in the u.s. unemployment rate. the difference between these two scenarios would have driven an increase of approximately 1.6x for commercial and 1.5x for the consumer modeled allowance results.
similarly, deteriorating conditions for portfolio factors were also considered by moderately stressing key portfolio drivers, relative to the baseline portfolio conditions. stressing risk ratings by two ratings for commercial loans generates a 1.6x increase in the commercial modeled allowance results. stressing fico by ten points, and ltv and utilization by 10% for consumer loans generates a 1.2x increase in the consumer modeled allowance results.
note that these analyses demonstrate the sensitivity of the alll to key quantitative assumptions, but exclude potential impacts to non-modeled allowance components and reserves for individually assessed loans. furthermore, these analyses are not intended to estimate changes in the overall alll as they do not reflect qualitative factors, changes in current economic conditions that may not be reflected in quantitatively derived results, and other relevant factors that must be considered to ensure the alll reflects our best estimate of current expected credit losses.
table of contents valuation methodologies fair value measurements we measure or monitor many of our assets and liabilities on a fair value basis. fair value is generally defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) as opposed to the price that would be paid to acquire the asset or received to assume the liability (an entry price), in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date under current market conditions. while management uses judgment when determining the price at which willing market participants would transact when there has been a significant decrease in the volume or level of activity for the asset or liability in relation to "normal" market activity, management's objective is to determine the point within the range of fair value estimates that is most representative of a sale to a third-party investor under current market conditions. the value to us if the asset or liability were held to maturity is not included in the fair value estimates.
a fair value measure should reflect the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability, including the assumptions about the risk inherent in a particular valuation technique, the effect of a restriction on the sale or use of an asset and the risk of nonperformance. fair value is measured based on a variety of inputs. fair value may be based on quoted market prices for identical assets or liabilities traded in active markets (level 1 valuations). if market prices are not available, quoted market prices for similar instruments traded in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active, or model-based valuation techniques for which all significant assumptions are observable in the market are used (level 2 valuations). where observable market data is not available, the valuation is generated from model based techniques that use significant assumptions not observable in the market, but observable based on our specific data (level 3 valuations). unobservable assumptions reflect our estimates for assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability. valuation techniques typically include option pricing models, discounted cash flow models and similar techniques, but may also include the use of market prices of assets or liabilities that are not directly comparable to the subject asset or liability.
the selection and weighting of the various fair value techniques may result in a fair value higher or lower than carrying value. considerable judgment may be involved in determining the amount that is most representative of fair value.
for assets and liabilities recorded at fair value, our policy is to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when developing fair value measurements for those items where there is an active market. in certain cases, when market observable inputs for model-based valuation techniques may not be readily available, we are required to make judgments about assumptions market participants would use in estimating the fair value of the financial instrument. the models used to determine fair value adjustments are regularly evaluated by management for relevance under current facts and circumstances.
changes in market conditions may reduce the availability of quoted prices or observable data. for example, reduced liquidity in the capital markets or changes in secondary market activities could result in observable market inputs becoming unavailable. when market data is not available, we use valuation techniques requiring more management judgment to estimate the appropriate fair value.
fair value is used on a recurring basis for certain assets and liabilities in which fair value is the primary measure of accounting. fair value is used on a nonrecurring basis to measure certain assets or liabilities (including held-to-maturity securities, commercial loans held for sale, and oreo) for impairment or for disclosure purposes in accordance with current accounting guidance.
impairment analysis also relates to long-lived assets and core deposit and other intangible assets. an impairment loss is recognized if the carrying amount of the asset is not likely to be recoverable and exceeds its fair value. in determining the fair value, management uses models and applies the techniques and assumptions previously discussed.
see note 1 under the heading "fair value measurements" and note 6 ("fair value measurements") for a detailed discussion of determining fair value, including pricing validation processes.
table of contents goodwill the valuation and testing methodologies used in our analysis of goodwill impairment are summarized in note 1
under the heading "goodwill and other intangible assets." goodwill is initially recorded as the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of net assets acquired in a business combination. goodwill is tested for impairment for all three of our reporting units: consumer bank, commercial bank and institutional bank. we perform our annual impairment test as of october 1st and on an interim basis if events or changes in circumstances between annual tests suggest additional testing is needed. testing may be either quantitative or qualitative. fair value is measured during quantitative tests using a combination of income and market approaches. if the fair value of a reporting unit declines below its carrying value, an impairment charge will be recognized for any amount by which the carrying value exceeds the reporting unit's fair value, to the extent that the loss recognized does not exceed the amount of the goodwill allocated to that reporting unit. when utilizing the qualitative testing approach, key examines numerous qualitative factors such as financial performance, market capitalization and other industry and economic trends to conclude whether it is more likely than not that goodwill is impaired.
we monitor impairment indicators for goodwill and other intangible assets and evaluate the carrying amount of these assets quarterly. additional information is provided in note 12 ("goodwill and other intangible assets").
derivatives and hedging we primarily use interest rate swaps to hedge interest rate risk for asset and liability management purposes. these derivative instruments modify the interest rate characteristics of specified on-balance sheet assets and liabilities. our accounting policies related to derivatives reflect the current accounting guidance, which provides that all derivatives should be recognized as either assets or liabilities on the balance sheet at fair value, after taking into account the effects of master netting agreements. accounting for changes in the fair value (i.e., gains or losses) of a particular derivative depends on whether the derivative has been designated and qualifies as part of a hedging relationship, and further, on the type of hedging relationship.
the application of hedge accounting requires significant judgment to interpret the relevant accounting guidance, as well as to assess hedge effectiveness, identify similar hedged item groupings, and measure changes in the fair value of the hedged items. we believe our methods of addressing these judgments and applying the accounting guidance are consistent with both the guidance and industry practices. additional information relating to our use of derivatives is included in note 1 under the heading "derivatives and hedging," and note 8 ("derivatives and hedging activities").
contingent liabilities, guarantees and income taxes note 22 ("commitments, contingent liabilities, and guarantees") summarizes contingent liabilities arising from litigation and contingent liabilities arising from guarantees in various agreements with third parties under which we are a guarantor, and the potential effects of these items on the results of our operations. we record a liability for the fair value of the obligation to stand ready to perform over the term of a guarantee. contingent aspects of guarantees within the scope of asc 326 are assessed a reserve under cecl. there is a risk that our actual future payments in the event of a default by the guaranteed party could exceed the recorded amount. see note 22 ("commitments, contingent liabilities, and guarantees") for a comparison of the liability recorded and the maximum potential undiscounted future payments for the various types of guarantees that we had outstanding at december 31, 2022.
it is not always clear how the internal revenue code and various state tax laws apply to transactions that we undertake. in the normal course of business, we may record tax benefits and then have those benefits contested by the irs or state tax authorities. we have provided tax reserves that we believe are adequate to absorb potential adjustments that such challenges may necessitate. however, if our judgment later proves to be inaccurate, the tax reserves may need to be adjusted, which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and capital.
additionally, we conduct quarterly assessments that determine the amount of deferred tax assets that are more-likely-than-not to be realized, and therefore recorded. the available evidence used in connection with these assessments includes a history of pretax income, projected future taxable income, potential tax-planning strategies, and projected future reversals of deferred tax liabilities. these assessments are subjective and may change. based on these criteria, and all available positive and negative evidence, we establish a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets when we are unable to conclude it is more likely than not that they will be realized. however, if our assessments prove incorrect, they could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations in the period in table of contents which they occur. for further information on our accounting for income taxes, see note 1 ("summary of significant accounting policies") and note 14 ("income taxes").

risks relating to our business and strategy our strategy to develop and introduce new products and services exposes us to risks such as limited customer acceptance, costs related to product defects, and large expenditures, each of which may result in no additional net revenue or decreased net revenue.
the software industry is characterized by rapid technological changes as well as changes in customer requirements and preferences. in recent years, the industry has undergone a transition from developing and selling perpetual licenses and on-premises products to subscriptions and cloud-enabled technologies. customers are also reconsidering how they purchase software products, which requires us to constantly evaluate our business model and strategy. in response, we are focused on providing solutions to enable our customers to be more agile and collaborative on their projects. we devote significant resources to the development of new technologies. in addition, we frequently introduce new business models or methods that require a considerable investment of technical and financial resources, such as our introduction of flexible subscription and service offerings and our transition of multi-subscription plans to named-user plans. it is uncertain whether these strategies, including our product and pricing changes, will accurately reflect customer demand or be successful, or whether we will be able to develop the necessary infrastructure and business models more quickly than our competitors. we make such investments through further development and enhancement of our existing products and services, as well as through acquisitions. such investments may not result in sufficient revenue generation to justify their costs and could result in decreased net revenue or profitability. if we are not able to meet customer requirements, either with respect to our software or the manner in which we provide such products, or if we are not able to adapt our business model to meet our customers' requirements, our business, financial condition, or results of operations may be adversely impacted.
in particular, a critical component of our growth strategy is to have customers of our autocad and autocad lt products, as well as other individual autodesk products, expand their portfolios to include our other offerings and cloud-based functionality, and we are taking steps to accelerate this migration. at times, sales of our autocad and autocad lt or individual autodesk flagship products have decreased without a corresponding increase in industry collections or cloud-based functionality revenue, or without purchases of customer seats to our industry collections. should this continue, our results of operations will be adversely affected.
our executive management team must continuously act quickly and with vision, given the rapidly changing customer expectations and technology advancements inherent in the software industry, the extensive and complex efforts required to create useful and widely accepted products, and the rapid evolution of cloud computing, mobile devices, new computing platforms, and other technologies, such as consumer products. although we have articulated a strategy that we believe will fulfill these challenges, if we fail to execute properly on that strategy or adapt the strategy as market conditions evolve, we may fail to meet our customers' expectations, be unable to compete with our competitors' products and technology, and lose the confidence of our channel partners and employees. this in turn could adversely affect our business and financial performance.
global economic and political conditions may further impact our industries, business, and financial results.
our overall performance depends largely upon domestic and worldwide economic and political conditions. the united states and other countries' economies have experienced cyclical downturns, in which economic activity was impacted by falling demand for a variety of goods and services, restricted credit, poor liquidity, decreased government spending, reduced corporate profitability, volatility in credit, equity, and foreign exchange markets, inflationary pressures and higher interest rates, bankruptcies, and overall uncertainty. these economic conditions can occur abruptly. for example, current geopolitical and global macro-economic challenges and the coronavirus (covid-19) pandemic have caused uncertainty in the global economy, and an economic downturn or recession in the united states or in other countries may occur or has already occurred and may continue. the extent to which these challenges will impact our financial condition or results of operations is still uncertain and will continue to depend on developments such as the impact of these challenges on our customers, vendors, distributors, and resellers, such as the supply chain disruption and resulting inflationary pressures and global labor shortage that we have seen recently, as well as other factors; the ebb and flow of covid-19, including in specific geographies and as a result of outbreaks and variants; actions taken by governments, businesses, and consumers in response to these challenges; speed and timing of economic recovery, including in specific geographies; our billings and renewal rates, including new business close rates, rate of multi-year contracts, pace of closing larger transactions, and new unit volume growth; the war in ukraine; foreign exchange rate fluctuations; and the effect of these challenges on margins and cash flow. all of these factors continue to evolve and remain uncertain at this time, and some of these factors are not within our control. due to our subscription-based business model, the effect of covid-19 may not be fully reflected in our results of operations until future periods, if at all. if economic growth in countries where we do business slows or if such countries experience further economic recessions, customers may delay or reduce technology purchases, which we have seen recently in certain countries including china. our customers include government entities, including the u.s. federal government, and if spending cuts impede the ability of governments to purchase our products and services, our revenue could decline. in addition, a number of our customers rely, directly and indirectly, on government spending.
as described elsewhere in these risk factors, we are dependent on international revenue and operations and are subject to related risks of conducting business globally. trends toward nationalism and protectionism and the weakening or dissolution of international trade pacts may increase the cost of, or otherwise interfere with, conducting business. these trends have increased political and economic unpredictability globally and may increase the volatility of global financial markets, and the impact of such developments on the global economy remains uncertain. political instability or adverse political developments in any of the countries in which we do business could harm our business, results of operations, and financial condition. a financial sector credit crisis could impair credit availability and the financial stability of our customers, including our distribution partners and channels. a disruption in the financial markets may also have an effect on our derivative counter-parties and could also impair our banking partners, on which we rely for operating cash management. war, including the significant military action against ukraine launched by russia and any related political or economic responses and counter-responses or otherwise by various global actors or the general effect on the global economy, could also affect our business. any of these events could harm our business, results of operations, and financial condition.
our business could be adversely impacted by the costs and challenges associated with strategic acquisitions and investments.
we regularly acquire or invest in businesses, software solutions, and technologies that are complementary to our business through acquisitions, strategic alliances, or equity or debt investments, including several transactions in fiscal 2022 and the first fiscal quarter in fiscal 2023. the risks associated with such acquisitions include the difficulty of integrating solutions, operations, and personnel; inheriting liabilities such as intellectual property infringement claims; failure to realize anticipated revenue and cost projections and expected synergies; the requirement to test and assimilate the internal control processes of the acquired business in accordance with the requirements of section 404 of the sarbanes-oxley act of 2002; and diversion of management's time and attention. in addition, such acquisitions and investments involve other risks such as:
•the inability to retain customers, key employees, vendors, distributors, business partners, and other entities associated with the acquired business;
•the potential that due diligence of the acquired business or solution does not identify significant problems;
•exposure to litigation or other claims in connection with, or inheritance of claims or litigation risk as a result of, an acquisition, including claims from terminated employees, customers, or other third parties;
•the potential for incompatible business cultures;
•significantly higher than anticipated transaction or integration-related costs;
•potential additional exposure to economic, tax, currency, political, legal, and regulatory risks associated with specific countries; and
•the potential impact on relationships with existing customers, vendors, and distributors as business partners as a result of acquiring another business.
we may not be successful in overcoming such risks, and such acquisitions and investments may negatively impact our business. in addition, if we do not complete an announced acquisition transaction or integrate an acquired business successfully and in a timely manner, we may not realize the benefits of the acquisition to the extent anticipated. acquisitions and investments have in the past and may in the future contribute to fluctuations in our quarterly financial results. these fluctuations could arise from transaction-related costs and charges associated with eliminating redundant expenses or write-offs of impaired assets recorded in connection with acquisitions and investments, and could negatively impact our financial results.
we are dependent on international revenue and operations, exposing us to significant international regulatory, economic, intellectual property, collections, currency exchange rate, taxation, political, and other risks, which could adversely impact our financial results.
international net revenue represented 66% and 67% of our net revenue for fiscal 2023 and 2022, respectively. our international revenue, some of which comes from emerging economies, is subject to economic and political conditions in foreign markets, including those resulting from economic and political conditions in the united states, as well as country-specific conditions related to covid-19, such as varied speed of recovery in different geographies. for example, we have recently seen a deceleration in growth in certain geographies including china. our total revenue is also impacted by the relative geographical and country mix of our revenue over time. our dependency on international revenue makes us much more exposed to global economic and political trends, which can negatively impact our financial results even if our results in the united states are strong for a particular period.
we anticipate that our international operations will continue to account for a significant portion of our net revenue and, as we expand our international development, sales, and marketing expertise, will provide significant support to our overall efforts in countries outside of the united states. risks inherent in our international operations include:
•economic volatility;
•tariffs, quotas, and other trade barriers and restrictions , including any political or economic responses and counter-responses or otherwise by various global actors to the significant military action against ukraine launched by russia;
•fluctuating currency exchange rates, including devaluations, currency controls, and inflation, and risks related to any hedging activities we undertake;
•changes in regulatory requirements and practices;
•delays resulting from difficulty in obtaining export licenses for certain technology;
•different purchase patterns as compared to the developed world;
•operating in locations with a higher incidence of corruption and fraudulent business practices, particularly in emerging economies;
•compliance with the u.s. foreign corrupt practices act, the u.k. bribery act, and other anti-corruption laws;
•difficulties in staffing and managing foreign sales and development operations;
•local competition;
•longer collection cycles for accounts receivable;
•u.s. and foreign tax law changes and the complexities of tax reporting;
•laws regarding the free flow of data across international borders and management of and access to data and public networks;
•possible future limitations upon foreign-owned businesses;
•increased financial accounting and reporting burdens and complexities;
•inadequate local infrastructure;
•greater difficulty in protecting intellectual property;
•software piracy; and
•other factors beyond our control, including popular uprisings, terrorism, war (including the significant military action against ukraine launched by russia and any related political or economic responses and counter-responses or otherwise by various global actors or the general effect on the global economy), natural disasters, and diseases and pandemics, such as covid-19.
some of our business partners also have international operations and are subject to the risks described above.
the application of the trade and cooperation agreement between the european union, the european atomic energy community, and the united kingdom signed in december 2020 (the "tca"), which took effect january 1, 2021, could have adverse tax, tax treaty, banking, operational, legal, regulatory, or other impacts on our businesses in the region. the withdrawal could also, among other potential outcomes, create currency volatility; disrupt the free movement of goods, services, and people between the united kingdom and the european union; and significantly disrupt trade between the united kingdom and the european union and other parties. uncertainty around these and related issues could lead to adverse effects on the united kingdom economy, the european union economies, and the other economies in which we operate.
in addition, in recent years, the united states has instituted or proposed changes to foreign trade policy, including the negotiation or termination of trade agreements, the imposition of tariffs on products imported from certain countries, economic sanctions on individuals, corporations, or countries, and other government regulations affecting trade between the united states and other countries in which we do business. more recently, the united states and other global actors have imposed sanctions as a result of the significant military action against ukraine launched by russia. new or increased tariffs and other changes in u.s. trade policy, including new sanctions, could trigger retaliatory actions by affected countries, including russia. in addition, certain foreign governments, including the chinese government, have instituted or considered imposing trade sanctions on certain u.s.-manufactured goods. the escalation of protectionist or retaliatory trade measures in either the united states or any other countries in which we do business, such as announcing sanctions, a change in tariff structures, export compliance, or other trade policies, may increase the cost of, or otherwise interfere with, the conduct of our business, and could have a material adverse effect on our operations and business outlook.
even if we are able to successfully manage the risks of international operations, our business may be adversely affected if our business partners are not able to successfully manage these risks.
we may not be able to predict subscription renewal rates and their impact on our future revenue and operating results.
our customers are not obligated to renew their subscriptions for our offerings, and they may elect not to renew, upgrade, or expand their subscriptions. we cannot assure renewal rates or the mix of subscriptions renewals. customer renewal rates may decline or fluctuate due to a number of factors, including offering pricing; competitive offerings; customer satisfaction; and reductions in customer spending levels, customer activity, or number of users due to economic downturns, including as a result of the current covid-19 pandemic, or financial markets uncertainty. if our customers do not renew their subscriptions or if they renew on less favorable terms, our revenues may decline.
existing and increased competition and rapidly evolving technological changes may reduce our revenue and profits.
the software industry has limited barriers to entry, and the availability of computing devices with continually expanding performance at progressively lower prices contributes to the ease of market entry. the industry has undergone a transition from developing and selling perpetual licenses and on-premises products to subscriptions and cloud-enabled technologies. this shift further lowers barriers to entry and poses a disruptive challenge to established software companies. the markets in which we operate are characterized by vigorous competition, both by entrants with innovative technologies and by consolidation of companies with complementary offerings and technologies. some of our competitors have greater financial, technical, sales and marketing, and other resources. furthermore, a reduction in the number and availability of compatible third-party applications or our inability to rapidly adapt to technological and customer preference changes, including those related to cloud computing, mobile devices, and new computing platforms, may adversely affect the sale of our solutions. because of these and other factors, competitive conditions in the industry are likely to intensify in the future. increased competition could result in price reductions, reduced net revenue and profit margins, and loss of market share, any of which would likely harm our business.
our financial results, key metrics, and other operating metrics fluctuate within each quarter and from quarter to quarter, making our future revenue and financial results difficult to predict.
our quarterly financial results, key metrics, and other operating metrics have fluctuated in the past and will continue to do so in the future. these fluctuations could cause our stock price to change significantly or experience declines. we also provide investors with quarterly and annual financial forward-looking guidance that could prove to be inaccurate as a result of these fluctuations. in addition to the other risks described in these risk factors, some of the factors that could cause our financial results, key metrics, and other operating metrics to fluctuate include:
•general market, economic, business, and political conditions in europe, apac, and emerging economies, including from an economic downturn or recession in the united states or other countries;
•failure to produce sufficient revenue, billings, subscription, profitability, and cash flow growth, including as a result of the covid-19 pandemic;
•failure to accurately predict the impact of acquired businesses or to identify and realize the anticipated benefits of acquisitions, and successfully integrate such acquired businesses and technologies;
•shift to named-user plans and annual billing of multi-year contracts;
•potential goodwill impairment charges related to prior acquisitions;
•failure to manage spend;
•changes in billings linearity;
•changes in subscription mix, pricing pressure, or changes in subscription pricing;
•weak or negative growth in one or more of the industries we serve, including aec, manufacturing, and digital media and entertainment markets;
•the success of new business or sales initiatives;
•security breaches, related reputational harm, and potential financial penalties to customers and government entities;
•restructuring or other accounting charges and unexpected costs or other operating expenses;
•timing of additional investments in our technologies or deployment of our services;
•changes in revenue recognition or other accounting guidelines employed by us and/or established by the financial accounting standards board, securities and exchange commission, or other rulemaking bodies;
•fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and the effectiveness of our hedging activity;
•dependence on and timing of large transactions;
•adjustments arising from ongoing or future tax examinations;
•the ability of governments around the world to adopt fiscal policies, meet their financial and debt obligations, and finance infrastructure projects;
•failure to expand our autocad and autocad lt customer base to related design products and services;
•our ability to rapidly adapt to technological and customer preference changes, including those related to cloud computing, mobile devices, and new computing platforms;
•timing of the introduction of new products by us or our competitors;
•the financial and business condition of our reseller and distribution channels;
•perceived or actual technical or other problems with a product or combination of subscriptions;
•unexpected or negative outcomes of matters and expenses relating to litigation or regulatory inquiries;
•increases in cloud functionality-related expenses;
•timing of releases and retirements of offerings;
•changes in tax laws or tax or accounting rules and regulations, such as increased use of fair value measures;
•changes in sales compensation practices;
•failure to effectively implement and maintain our copyright legalization programs, especially in developing countries;
•renegotiation or termination of royalty or intellectual property arrangements;
•interruptions or terminations in the business of our consultants or third-party developers;
•timing and degree of expected investments in growth and efficiency opportunities;
•failure to achieve continued success in technology advancements;
•catastrophic events, natural disasters, or public health events, such as pandemics and epidemics, including covid-19;
•regulatory compliance costs; and
•failure to appropriately estimate the scope of services under consulting arrangements.
we have also experienced fluctuations in financial results in interim periods in certain geographic regions due to seasonality or regional economic or political conditions. in particular, our financial results in europe during our third quarter are usually affected by a slower summer period, and our apac operations typically experience seasonal slowing in our third and fourth quarters. war, including the significant military action against ukraine launched by russia and any related political or economic responses and counter-responses or otherwise by various global actors or the general effect on the global economy, could also affect our business.
our operating expenses are based in part on our expectations for future revenue and are relatively fixed in the short term. accordingly, any revenue shortfall below expectations has had, and in the future could have, an immediate and significant adverse effect on our profitability. greater than anticipated expenses or a failure to maintain rigorous cost controls would also negatively affect profitability.
we derive a substantial portion of our net revenue from a small number of solutions, including our autocad-based software products and collections, and if these offerings are not successful, our revenue would be adversely affected.
we derive a substantial portion of our net revenue from sales of subscriptions of a limited number of our offerings, including autocad software, solutions based on autocad, which include our collections that serve specific markets, and products that are interoperable with autocad. any factor adversely affecting sales of these subscriptions, including the product release cycle, market acceptance, product competition, performance and reliability, reputation, price competition, economic and market conditions, and the availability of third-party applications, would likely harm our financial results. during fiscal 2023 and 2022, combined revenue from our autocad and autocad lt family products, not including collections having autocad or autocad lt as a component, represented 28% and 29% of our total net revenue, respectively.
from time to time we realign or introduce new business and sales initiatives; if we fail to successfully execute and manage these initiatives, our results of operations could be negatively impacted.
as part of our effort to accommodate our customers' needs and demands and the rapid evolution of technology, from time to time we evolve our business and sales initiatives, such as shifting to annual billing of multi-year contracts, realigning our development and marketing organizations, offering software as a service, and realigning our internal resources in an effort to improve efficiency. we may take such actions without clear indications that they will prove successful and, at times, we have been met with short-term challenges in the execution of such initiatives. market acceptance of any new business or sales initiative is dependent on our ability to match our customers' needs at the right time and price. often, we have limited prior experience and operating history in these new areas of emphasis. if any of our assumptions about expenses, revenue, or revenue recognition principles from these initiatives proves incorrect, or our attempts to improve efficiency are not successful, our actual results may vary materially from those anticipated, and our financial results will be negatively impacted.
net revenue, billings, earnings, cash flow, or subscriptions shortfalls or volatility of the market generally may cause the market price of our stock to decline.
the market price for our common stock has experienced significant fluctuations and may continue to fluctuate significantly. the market price for our common stock may be affected by a number of factors, including the other risks described in these risk factors and the following:
•shortfalls in our expected financial results, including net revenue, billings, earnings, and cash flow or key performance metrics, such as subscriptions, including as a result of the current covid-19 pandemic, and how those results compare to securities analyst expectations, including whether those results fail to meet, exceed, or significantly exceed securities analyst expectations;
•quarterly variations in our or our competitors' results of operations;
•general socioeconomic, political, or market conditions, including from an economic downturn or recession in the united states or in other countries;
•changes in forward-looking estimates of future results, how those estimates compare to securities analyst expectations, or changes in recommendations or confusion on the part of analysts and investors about the short- and long-term impact to our business;
•uncertainty about certain governments' abilities to repay debt or effect fiscal policy;
•announcements of new offerings or enhancements by us or our competitors;
•unusual events such as significant acquisitions, divestitures, regulatory actions, and litigation;
•changes in laws, rules, or regulations applicable to our business;
•outstanding debt service obligations; and
•other factors, including factors unrelated to our operating performance, such as instability affecting the economy or the operating performance of our competitors.
significant changes in the price of our common stock could expose us to costly and time-consuming litigation. historically, after periods of volatility in the market price of a company's securities, a company becomes more susceptible to securities class action litigation. this type of litigation is often expensive and diverts management's attention and resources.
as a result of our strategy of partnering with other companies for product development, our product delivery schedules could be adversely affected if we experience difficulties with our product development partners.
we partner with certain independent firms and contractors to perform some of our product development activities. we believe our partnering strategy allows us to achieve efficiencies in developing new products and maintaining and enhancing existing product offerings. this strategy creates a dependency on independent developers. independent developers, including those who currently develop solutions for us in the united states and throughout the world, may not be able or willing to provide development support to us in the future. in addition, use of development resources through consulting relationships, particularly in non-u.s. jurisdictions with developing legal systems, may be adversely impacted by, and expose us to risks relating to, evolving employment, export, and intellectual property laws. these risks could, among other things, expose our intellectual property to misappropriation and result in disruptions to product delivery schedules.
social and ethical issues relating to the use of artificial intelligence in our offerings may result in reputational harm or liability.
social and ethical issues relating to the use of new and evolving technologies such as artificial intelligence ("ai") in our offerings, may result in reputational harm and liability, and may cause us to incur additional research and development costs to resolve such issues. we are increasingly building ai into many of our offerings. as with many innovations, ai presents risks and challenges that could affect its adoption, and therefore our business. ai presents emerging ethical issues and if we enable or offer solutions that draw controversy due to their perceived or actual impact on society, we may experience brand or reputational harm, competitive harm, or legal liability. potential government regulation in the space of ai ethics may also increase the burden and cost of research and development in this area, subjecting us to brand or reputational harm, competitive harm, or legal liability. failure to address ai ethics issues by us or others in our industry could undermine public confidence in ai and slow adoption of ai in our products and services.
risks relating to our operations security incidents may compromise the integrity of our or our customers' systems, solutions, offerings, services, applications, data, or intellectual property, harm our reputation, damage our competitiveness, create additional liability, and adversely impact our financial results.
as we digitize autodesk and use cloud- and web-based technologies to leverage customer data to deliver the total customer experience, we are exposed to increased security risks and the potential for unauthorized access to, or improper use of, our and our customers' information. like other software offerings and systems, ours are vulnerable to security incidents, including those from acquired companies. also, our ability to mitigate the security incident risk may be impacted by our limited control over our customers or third-party technology providers and vendors, or the processing of data by third-party technology providers and vendors, which may not allow us to maintain the integrity or security of such transmissions or processing. we devote significant resources in an effort to maintain the security and integrity of our systems, offerings, services, and applications (online, mobile, and desktop), including by enhancing security features, conducting penetration tests, code hardening, releasing security vulnerability updates, and accelerating our incident response time. we also provide annual information security training to our employees. despite these efforts, we may not prevent security incidents, and we may face delays or other difficulties in identifying, responding to, or remediating security incidents.
hackers regularly have targeted our systems, offerings, services, and applications, and we expect them to do so in the future. to date, such identified security events have not been material or significant to us or our customers, including to our reputation or business operations, or had a material financial impact, but there can be no assurance that future cyberattacks will not be material or significant. security incidents could disrupt the proper functioning of our systems, solutions, offerings, applications, or services; cause errors in the output of our customers' work; allow unauthorized access to or unauthorized use, disclosure, modification, loss, or destruction of, sensitive data or intellectual property, including proprietary or confidential information of ours or our customers; or cause other destructive outcomes. the risk of a security incident, particularly through cyber-attack or cyber intrusion, including by computer hackers, foreign governments, and cyber terrorists, has increased as the number, intensity, and sophistication of attempted attacks and intrusions from around the world have increased. these threats include identity theft, unauthorized access, dns attacks, wireless network attacks, viruses and worms, malware, bugs, vulnerabilities, advanced persistent threats (apt), application-centric attacks, peer-to-peer attacks, social engineering, phishing, credential stuffing, malicious file uploads, backdoor trojans, supply chain attacks, ransomware attacks, and distributed denial of service (ddos) attacks. in addition, third parties may attempt to fraudulently induce our employees, vendors, partners, customers, or users to disclose information to gain access to our data or our customers' or users' data and there is the risk of employee, contractor, or vendor error or malfeasance. these existing risks are compounded given the covid-19 pandemic and the resulting shift to work-from-home arrangements for a large population of employees and contractors, as well as employees and contractors of our third-party technology providers and vendors, and the risks could also be elevated in connection with the russian invasion of ukraine as we and our third-party technology providers and vendors are vulnerable to a heightened risk of cyberattacks from or affiliated with nation-state actors, including retaliatory attacks from russian actors against u.s.-based companies. despite our significant efforts to create security barriers to such threats, we cannot entirely mitigate these risks, and there is no guarantee that inadvertent or unauthorized use or disclosure of such information will not occur or that third parties will not gain unauthorized access to such information.
many governments have enacted laws requiring companies to provide notice of security incidents involving certain types of personal data and personal information. we are also contractually required to notify certain customers of certain security incidents. if any of the foregoing security incidents were to occur or to be perceived to have occurred, our reputation may suffer, our competitive position may be diminished, customers (including government customers) may stop paying for our solutions and services, we could be required to expend significant capital and other resources to evaluate and alleviate the security incident and to try to prevent further or additional incidents, and we could face regulatory inquiry, lawsuits, and potential liability. we could incur significant costs and liabilities, including due to litigation, indemnity obligations, damages for contract breach, penalties for violation of applicable laws or regulations, and costs for remediation and other incentives offered to customers or other business partners in an effort to maintain business relationships after a security incident, and our financial performance could be negatively impacted.
we cannot assure you that any limitations of liability provisions in our contracts would be enforceable or adequate or would otherwise protect us from any liabilities or damages with respect to any particular claim relating to a security incident. we also cannot be sure that our existing insurance coverage will continue to be available on acceptable terms or will be available in sufficient amounts to cover one or more large claims related to a security incident, or that the insurer will not deny coverage as to any future claim. the successful assertion of one or more large claims against us that exceed available insurance coverage, or the occurrence of changes in our insurance policies, including premium increases or the imposition of large deductible or co-insurance requirements, could have a material adverse effect on our business, including our financial condition, operating results, and reputation.
our use of third-party open source software could negatively affect our ability to sell subscriptions to access our products and subject us to possible litigation and greater security risks.
we use third-party open source software. from time to time, companies that use third-party open source software have faced claims challenging the use of such open source software and compliance with the open source software license terms. accordingly, we may be subject to suits by parties claiming ownership of what we believe to be open source software or claiming non-compliance with the applicable open source licensing terms. some open source software licenses require end-users, who distribute or make available across a network software and services that include open source software, to make publicly available or to license all or part of such software (which in some circumstances could include valuable proprietary code, such as modifications or derivative works created, based upon, incorporating, or using the open source software) under the terms of the particular open source license. while we employ practices designed to monitor our compliance with the licenses of third-party open source software and protect our valuable proprietary source code, we may inadvertently use third-party open source software in a manner that exposes us to claims of non-compliance with the terms of the applicable license, including claims of intellectual property rights infringement or for breach of contract. furthermore, there exists today an increasing number of types of open source software licenses, almost none of which have been tested in courts of law to provide clarity on their proper legal interpretation. if we were to receive a claim of non-compliance with the terms of any of these open source licenses, we may be required to publicly release certain portions of our proprietary source code. we could also be required to expend substantial time and resources to re-engineer some or all of our software. any of the foregoing could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects.
in addition, the use of third-party open source software typically exposes us to greater risks than the use of third-party commercial software because open source licensors generally do not provide warranties or controls on the functionality or origin of the software. use of open source software may also present additional security risks because the public availability of such software may make it easier for hackers and other third parties to determine how to compromise our platform. any of the foregoing could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects and could help our competitors develop products and services that are similar to or better than ours.
we rely on third parties to provide us with a number of operational and technical services; third-party security incidents could result in the loss of our or our customers' data, expose us to liability, harm our reputation, damage our competitiveness, and adversely impact our financial results.
we rely on third parties, such as amazon web services, to provide us with operational and technical services. these third parties may have access to our systems, provide hosting services, or otherwise process data about us or our customers, employees, or partners. our ability to monitor such third parties' security measures is limited. there have been and may continue to be significant supply chain attacks, and we cannot guarantee that our or our such third parties' systems have not been breached or that they do not contain exploitable defects, bugs, or vulnerabilities that could result in an incident, breach, or other disruption to, our or these third parties' systems. any security incident involving such third parties could compromise the integrity or availability of, or result in the theft of, our and our customers' data. in addition, our operations or the operations of our customers or partners could be negatively affected in the event of a security incident and could be subject to the loss or theft of confidential or proprietary information, including source code. unauthorized access to data and other confidential or proprietary information may be obtained through break-ins, network breaches by unauthorized parties, employee theft or misuse, or other misconduct. if any of the foregoing were to occur or to be perceived to occur, our reputation may suffer, our competitive position may be diminished, customers may buy fewer of our offerings and services, we could face lawsuits, regulatory investigation, fines, and potential liability, and our financial results could be negatively impacted.
delays in service from third-party service providers could expose us to liability, harm our reputation, damage our competitiveness, and adversely impact our financial results.
from time to time, we may rely on a single or limited number of suppliers, or upon suppliers in a single country, for the provision of services and materials that we use in the operation of our business and production of our solutions. inability of such third parties to satisfy our requirements could disrupt our operations or make it more difficult for us to implement our strategy. if any of these situations were to occur, our reputation could be harmed, we could be subject to third-party liability, including under data protection and privacy laws in certain jurisdictions, and our financial results could be negatively impacted.
we are investing in resources to update and improve our information technology systems to digitize autodesk and support our customers. should our investments not succeed, or if delays or other issues with new or existing information technology systems disrupt our operations, our business could be harmed.
we rely on our network and data center infrastructure, technology systems, and websites for our development, marketing, operational, support, sales, accounting, and financial reporting activities. we continually invest resources to update and improve these systems to meet the evolving requirements of our business and customers. in particular, our transition to cloud-based products and a subscription-only business model involves considerable investment in the development of technologies, as well as back-office systems for technical, financial, compliance, and sales resources. such improvements are often complex, costly, and time consuming. in addition, such improvements can be challenging to integrate with our existing technology systems, or may uncover problems with those systems. unsuccessful implementation of hardware or software updates and improvements could result in disruption in our business operations, loss of customers, loss of revenue, errors in our accounting and financial reporting, or damage to our reputation, all of which could harm our business.
our software solutions are highly complex and may contain undetected errors, defects, or vulnerabilities, and are subject to service disruptions, degradations, outages or other performance problems, each of which could harm our business and financial performance.
the software solutions that we offer are complex and, despite extensive testing and quality control, may contain errors, defects, or vulnerabilities. some errors, defects, or vulnerabilities in our software solutions may only be discovered after they have been released. in addition, we have experienced, and may in the future experience, service disruptions, degradations, outages, and other performance problems in connection with our software solutions.
any errors, defects, vulnerabilities, service disruptions, degradations, outages or other performance problems could result in the need for corrective releases to our software solutions, damage to our reputation, damage to our customers' businesses, loss of revenue, an increase in subscription cancellations, or lack of market acceptance of our offerings, any of which would likely harm our business and financial performance if we do not maintain good relationships with the members of our distribution channel, or if our distribution channel suffers financial losses, becomes financially unstable or insolvent, or is not provided the right mix of incentives to sell our subscriptions, our ability to generate revenue will be adversely affected.
we sell our software products both directly to end users and through a network of distributors and resellers. for both fiscal 2023 and 2022, approximately 65% of our revenue was derived from indirect channel sales through distributors and resellers, and we expect that the majority of our revenue will continue to be derived from indirect channel sales in the near future. our ability to effectively distribute our solutions depends in part upon the financial and business condition of our distributor and reseller network. computer software distributors and resellers typically are not highly capitalized, and have previously experienced difficulties during times of economic contraction as well as during the past several years. we have processes to ensure that we assess the creditworthiness of distributors and resellers prior to our sales to them. in the past we have taken steps to support them, and may take additional steps in the future, such as extending credit terms and adjusting our incentives. these steps, if taken, could harm our financial results. if our distributors and resellers were to become insolvent, they would not be able to maintain their business and sales or provide customer support services, which would negatively impact our business and revenue.
we rely significantly upon major distributors and resellers in both the u.s. and international regions. of our distributors, tech data accounted for 37% and 36% of our total net revenue for fiscal 2023 and 2022, respectively, and ingram micro accounted for 9% of our total net revenue for both fiscal 2023 and 2022. during october and november 2022, we entered into transition agreements with each of tech data and ingram micro to provide transition distribution activities for a one-to-two-year period, with potential extensions. in connection with such transition agreements, we intend to increase our selling efforts with value-added resellers and agents. during the transition period, we believe the resellers and end users who currently purchase our products through tech data and ingram micro will be able to continue to do so, and following the transition period, we believe such resellers and end users will be able to continue to purchase our products from our value-added resellers, our agents or from one of our many other distributors or directly from autodesk, in each case under substantially the same terms and without substantial disruption to our revenue. however, if during the transition period, tech data or ingram micro were to experience a significant business disruption or if our relationship with either were to significantly deteriorate, it is possible that our ability to sell to end users would, at least temporarily, be negatively impacted. also, if any of our assumptions about our end users, value added resellers, distributors, or agents or our direct selling capabilities proves incorrect, these changes could harm our business. this could, in turn, negatively impact our financial results.
over time, we have modified and especially during the transition process noted above, we will continue to modify aspects of our relationship with our distributors and resellers, such as their incentive programs, pricing to them, and our distribution model to motivate and reward them for aligning their businesses with our strategy and business objectives. changes in these relationships and underlying programs could negatively impact their business and harm our business. further, our distributors and resellers may lose confidence in our business, move to competitive products, or not have the skills or ability to support customers. the loss of or a significant reduction in business with those distributors or resellers could harm our business. in particular, if one or more of such distributors or resellers were unable to meet their obligations with respect to accounts payable to us, we could be forced to write off such accounts and may be required to delay the recognition of revenue on future sales to these customers. these events could have a material adverse effect on our financial results.
we rely on software from third parties, and a failure to properly manage our use of third-party software could result in increased costs or loss of revenue.
many of our products are designed to include software licensed from third parties. such third-party software includes software licensed from commercial suppliers and under public open source licenses. while we have internal processes to manage our use of such third-party software, if such processes are inadequate, we may be subject to copyright infringement or other third-party claims. if we are non-compliant with a license for commercial software, we may be required to pay penalties or undergo costly audits pursuant to the license agreement. in the case of open-source software licensed under certain "copyleft" licenses, the license itself, or a court-imposed remedy for non-compliant use of the open source software, may require that proprietary portions of our own software be publicly disclosed or licensed. this could result in a loss of intellectual property rights, increased costs, re-engineering of our software, damage to our reputation, or loss of revenue.
in addition to risks related to license requirements, usage of open source software can lead to greater risks than use of third-party commercial software, as open source licensors generally do not provide warranties, support, indemnities, assurances of title or controls on origin of the software, or other contractual protections regarding infringement claims or the quality of the code. likewise, some open source projects have known security and other vulnerabilities and architectural instabilities, or are otherwise subject to security attacks due to their wide availability, and are provided on an "as-is" basis.
our business could be adversely affected if we are unable to attract and retain key personnel.
our success and ability to invest and grow depend largely on our ability to attract and retain highly skilled technical, professional, managerial, sales, and marketing personnel. historically, competition for these key personnel has been intense. the loss of services of any of our key personnel, including key personnel joining our company through acquisitions, inability to retain and attract qualified employees in the future, or delays in hiring required personnel, particularly engineering and sales personnel, could make it difficult to meet key objectives, such as timely and effective product introductions and financial goals.
we rely on third-party technologies and if we are unable to use or integrate these technologies, our solutions and service development may be delayed and our financial results negatively impacted.
we rely on certain software that we license from third parties, including software that is integrated with internally developed software and used in our offerings to perform key functions. these third-party software licenses may not continue to be available on commercially reasonable terms, and the software may not be appropriately supported, maintained, or enhanced by the licensors. the loss of licenses to, or inability to support, maintain, and enhance any such software could result in increased costs or delays until equivalent software can be developed, identified, licensed, and integrated, which would likely harm our business.
disruptions in licensing relationships and with third-party developers could adversely impact our business.
we license certain key technologies from third parties. licenses may be restricted in the term or the use of such technology in ways that negatively affect our business. similarly, we may not be able to obtain or renew license agreements for key technology on favorable terms, if at all, and any failure to do so could harm our business. our business strategy has historically depended in part on our relationships with third-party developers who provide products that expand the functionality of our design software. some developers may elect to support other products or may experience disruption in product development and delivery cycles or financial pressure during periods of economic downturn. in particular markets, such disruptions have in the past, and would likely in the future, negatively impact these third-party developers and end users, which could harm our business.
technology created by outsourced product development, whether outsourced to third parties or developed externally and transferred to us through business or technology acquisitions, involves additional risks such as effective integration into existing products, adequate transfer of technology know-how, and ownership and protection of transferred intellectual property.
risks relating to laws and regulations increasing regulatory focus on privacy, data protection, and information security issues and new and expanding laws may impact our business and expose us to increased liability.
our strategy to digitize autodesk involves increasing our use of cloud- and web-based technologies and applications to leverage customer data to improve our offerings for the benefit of our customers. to accomplish this strategy, we must collect and otherwise process customer data, which may include personal data and personal information of users from different jurisdictions globally. we also collect and otherwise process personal data and personal information of our employees and contractors. as a result, federal, state, and global laws relating to privacy, data protection, and information security apply to autodesk's personal data and personal information processing activities. the scope of these laws and regulations is rapidly evolving, subject to differing interpretations, may be inconsistent among jurisdictions, or conflict with other rules and is likely to remain uncertain for the foreseeable future. we also expect that there will continue to be new laws, regulations, and industry standards concerning privacy, data protection, and information security proposed and enacted in various jurisdictions. globally, laws such as the general data protection regulation (eu) 2016/679 ("gdpr") in the european union ("eu") and the personal information protection law ("pipl") in china have been enacted. in addition, new and emerging state laws in the united states governing privacy, data protection, and information security, such as the california consumer privacy act ("ccpa"), the california privacy rights act ("cpra"), the virginia consumer data protection act ("vcdpa"), the colorado privacy act ("cpa"), the utah consumer privacy act ("ucpa"), and connecticut's act concerning personal data privacy and online monitoring ("ctdpa") have been enacted. these laws and regulations, as well as industry self-regulatory codes, create new compliance obligations and substantially expand the scope of potential liability and provide greater penalties for non-compliance. for example, the gdpr provides for penalties of up to €20 million or 4% of a company's annual global revenue, whichever is greater, the pipl provides for penalties of up to 50 million renminbi or 5% of a company's annual revenue and disgorgement of all illegal gains, whichever is greater, and the ccpa provides for penalties of up to $7,500 per violation. these laws, regulations and codes may also impact our innovation and business drivers in developing new and emerging technologies (e.g., artificial intelligence and machine learning). these requirements, among others, may impact demand for our offerings and force us to bear the burden of expanded obligations in our contracts.
in addition, there is continued instability of international personal data transfer legal mechanisms that are complex, uncertain, and subject to active litigation and enforcement actions in a number of jurisdictions around the world. for example, on june 4, 2021, the european commission published a new set of modular standard contractual clause ("sccs"), providing for an 18-month implementation period, which became effective on june 29, 2021, and imposes on companies obligations relating to personal data transfers, including the obligation to conduct a transfer impact assessment and, depending on a party's role in the transfer, to implement additional security measures and to update internal privacy practices. we may, in addition to other impacts, be required to expend significant time and resources to update our contractual arrangements and to comply with new obligations, and we face exposure to regulatory actions, substantial fines and injunctions in connection with transfers of personal data from the eu.
in addition, the united kingdom's ("uk") exit from the eu, and ongoing developments in the uk, have created uncertainty with regard to data protection regulation in the uk. data processing in the uk is now governed by the uk general data protection regulation and supplemented by other domestic data protection laws, such as the uk data protection act 2018, which authorizes fines of up to £17.5 million or 4% of annual global revenue, whichever is higher. we are also exposed to potentially divergent enforcement actions for certain violations. furthermore, the new sccs apply only to the transfer of personal data outside the eu and not the uk. although the european commission adopted an adequacy decision for the uk on june 28, 2021, allowing the continued flow of personal data from the eu to the uk, this decision will be regularly reviewed going forward and may be revoked if the uk diverges from its current adequate data protection laws following its exit from the eu. on february 2, 2022, the uk's information commissioner's office issued new standard contractual clauses to support personal data transfers out of the uk ("uk sccs"), which became effective march 21, 2022. we may, in addition to other impacts, experience additional costs associated with increased compliance burdens and be required to engage in new contract negotiations with third parties that aid in processing personal data on our behalf or localize certain personal data.
further, several european data protection authorities recently indicated that the use of google analytics by european website operators involves the unlawful transfer of personal data to the united states. as the enforcement landscape further develops, and depending on the impacts of these rulings and other developments with respect to cross-border data transfer, we could suffer additional costs, complaints and/or regulatory investigations or fines, have to stop using certain tools and vendors, and make other operational changes.
several other countries, including china, australia, new zealand, brazil, and japan, have also established specific legal requirements for cross-border data transfers. there is also an increasing trend towards data localization policies. for example, in 2021, china introduced localization requirements for certain data. there are also other countries, such as india, that are considering data localization requirements. if this trend continues, and countries implement more restrictive regulations for cross-border personal data transfers (or do not permit personal data to leave the country of origin), it could affect the manner in which we provide our services, the geographical location or segregation of our relevant systems and operations, and our business, financial condition, and results of operations in those jurisdictions could be impacted.
in addition, the new state laws - the cpra and the vcdpa - that became effective on january 1, 2023, the cpa and ctdpa that become effective on july 1, 2023, and the ucpa that becomes effective on december 31, 2023, introduce additional obligations such as data minimization and storage limitations, granting additional rights to consumers such as correction of personal information and additional opt-out rights. the cpra also created a new agency to implement and enforce the law. these new state laws have required us to modify our data processing practices and policies and may cause us to incur substantial costs and expenses in order to comply. laws in all 50 states, and some of our contracts, require us to provide notice under certain circumstances to customers whose personal information has been disclosed as a result of a data breach. also, if third parties we work with, such as suppliers, violate applicable data protection laws or regulations, such violations may also put our users' information at risk and could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects. additionally, in addition to government activity, privacy advocacy groups and technology and other industries are considering various new, additional or different self-regulatory standards that may place additional burdens on us. evolving legislation and the interplay of federal and state laws may be subject to varying interpretations by courts and government agencies, creating complex compliance issues and have and may cause variation in requirements, increase restrictions and potential legal risk and impact strategies and the availability of previously useful data, potentially exposing us to additional expense, adverse publicity, and liability.
in the eu and the uk, regulators are increasingly focusing on compliance with requirements in the online behavioral advertising ecosystem, and current national laws that implement the eprivacy directive are highly likely to be replaced by an eu regulation known as the eprivacy regulation, which is expected to significantly increase fines for non-compliance. while the text of the eprivacy regulation is under development, recent european case law and regulators' recent guidance are driving increased attention to cookies and tracking technologies. this could lead to substantial costs, require significant system changes, limit the effectiveness of our marketing activities, divert the attention of our technology personnel, adversely affect our margins, increase costs, and subject us to additional liabilities. regulation of cookies and similar technologies, and any decline of cookies or similar online tracking technologies as a means to identify and potentially target users, may lead to broader restrictions and impairments on our marketing and personalization activities and may negatively impact our efforts to understand our customers.
governments, regulators, plaintiffs' attorneys, privacy advocates have increased their focus on how companies collect, process, use, store, share, and transmit personal data and personal information. any perception of our practices, products, offerings, or services as a violation of individual privacy or data protection rights may subject us to public criticism, lawsuits, reputational harm, or investigations or claims by regulators, industry groups or other third parties, all of which could disrupt or adversely impact our business and expose us to increased liability. moreover, because the interpretation and application of many laws and regulations relating to privacy, data protection, and information security are uncertain, it is possible that these laws and regulations may be interpreted and applied in a manner that is inconsistent with our existing data management practices or the features of our products, offerings, and services. we could be required to fundamentally change our business activities and practices or modify our offerings and services, any of which could require significant additional expense and adversely affect our business, including impacting our ability to innovate, delaying our development roadmap and adversely affecting our relationships with customers and our ability to compete. if we are obligated to fundamentally change our business activities and practices or modify our products, offerings, or services, we may be unable to make such changes and modifications in a commercially reasonable manner, or at all, and our ability to develop new products, offerings, and services could be limited.
we are subject to governmental export and import controls that could impair our ability to compete in international markets or subject us to liability if we violate the controls.
our offerings are subject to export controls and economic sanctions laws and regulations that prohibit the delivery of certain solutions and services without the required export authorizations or export to locations, governments, and persons targeted by applicable sanctions. while we have processes to prevent our offerings from being exported in violation of these laws, including obtaining authorizations as appropriate and screening against u.s. government and international lists of restricted and prohibited persons, we cannot guarantee that these processes will prevent all violations of export control and sanctions laws.
if our channel partners fail to obtain appropriate import, export, or re-export licenses or permits, we may also be adversely affected, through reputational harm as well as other negative consequences including government investigations and penalties. we presently incorporate export control and sanctions compliance requirements in our channel partner agreements. complying with export control and sanctions regulations for a particular sale may be time-consuming and may result in the delay or loss of sales opportunities. violations of applicable sanctions or export control laws can result in fines or penalties.
for additional risks regarding sanctions and trade protectionism, please see the risk factor entitled "we are dependent on international revenue and operations . . ." earlier in this section.
if we are not able to adequately protect our proprietary rights, our business could be harmed.
we rely on a combination of patent, copyright, and trademark laws, trade secret protections, confidentiality procedures, and contractual provisions to protect our proprietary rights. however, the steps we take to protect our intellectual property rights may be inadequate. while we have patent applications pending in the united states and throughout the world, we may be unable to obtain patent protection for the technology covered in our patent applications. in addition, any patents issued to us in the future may not provide us with competitive advantages or may be successfully challenged by third parties. furthermore, legal standards relating to the validity, enforceability, and scope of protection of intellectual property rights are uncertain. despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights, unauthorized parties from time to time have copied or reverse engineered aspects of our software or have obtained and used information that we regard as proprietary. policing unauthorized use of our software is time-consuming and costly. we are unable to measure the extent to which unauthorized use of our software exists and we expect that unauthorized use of software will remain a persistent problem, particularly in emerging economies.
additionally, we actively protect the secrecy of our confidential information and trade secrets, including our source code. if unauthorized disclosure of our source code occurs, we could potentially lose future trade secret protection for that source code. unauthorized disclosure of our source code could make it easier for third parties to compete with our offerings by copying functionality, which could adversely affect our financial performance and our reputation. we also seek to protect our confidential information and trade secrets through the use of non-disclosure agreements with our employees, customers, contractors, vendors, and partners. however, it is possible that our confidential information and trade secrets may be disclosed or published without our authorization. if this were to occur, it may be difficult and/or costly for us to enforce our rights, and our financial performance and reputation could be negatively impacted.
we may face intellectual property infringement claims that could be costly to defend and result in the loss of significant rights.
our competitors, as well as a number of other entities and individuals, may own or claim to own intellectual property relating to our business. third parties may claim that we are infringing upon or misappropriating their intellectual property rights, and we may be found to be infringing upon such rights, even if we are unaware of the intellectual property rights claimed against us. as more software patents are granted worldwide, the number of offerings and competitors in our industries grows, and the functionality of products in different industries overlaps, we expect that software developers will be increasingly subject to infringement claims. additionally, certain patent assertion entities have become more aggressive in threatening and pursuing litigation in attempts to obtain fees for licensing the right to use patents.
any claims or threats of infringement or misappropriation, whether with or without merit, have been and could in the future be time-consuming to defend, result in costly litigation and diversion of resources, cause product delays, require us to change our products or business practices, prevent us from offering our software and services, or require us to enter into royalty or licensing agreements. in addition, such royalty or license agreements, if required, may not be available on acceptable terms, if at all, which would likely harm our business. we may also be obligated to indemnify our customers or business partners or pay substantial settlement costs, including royalty payments, in connection with any such claim or litigation and to obtain licenses, modify applications, or refund fees, which could be costly. furthermore, from time to time we may introduce or acquire new products, including in areas where we historically have not competed, which could increase our exposure to patent and other intellectual property claims.
contracting with government entities exposes us to additional risks inherent in the government procurement process.
we provide products and services, directly and indirectly, to a variety of government entities. risks associated with licensing and selling products and services to government entities include extended sales and collection cycles, varying governmental budgeting processes, and adherence to complex procurement regulations and other government-specific contractual requirements. we may be subject to audits and investigations relating to our government contracts and any violations could result in civil and criminal penalties and administrative sanctions, including termination of contracts, payment of fines, and suspension or debarment from future government business, as well as harm to our reputation and financial results.
risks relating to financial developments we are exposed to fluctuations in currency exchange rates that could negatively impact our financial results and cash flows.
because we conduct a substantial portion of our business outside the united states, we face exposure to adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates, which could have a material adverse impact on our financial results and cash flows. these exposures may change over time as business practices evolve and economic conditions change. we use derivative instruments to manage a portion of our cash flow, revenue and expense exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. as part of our risk management strategy, we use foreign currency contracts to manage a portion of our exposures of underlying assets, liabilities, and other obligations, which exist as part of our ongoing business operations. these foreign currency instruments may have maturities that extend for one to 18 months in the future and provide us with some protection against currency exposures. however, our attempts to hedge against these risks may not be completely successful, resulting in an adverse impact on our financial results.
the fluctuations of currencies in which we conduct business can both increase and decrease our overall revenue and expenses for any given period. although our foreign currency cash flow hedge program extends beyond the current quarter in order to reduce our exposure to foreign currency volatility, we do not attempt to completely mitigate this risk, and in any case, will incur transaction fees in adopting such hedging programs. such volatility, even when it increases our revenues or decreases our expenses, impacts our ability to accurately predict our future results and earnings.
in addition, global events, including the sudden and unexpected effects of the covid-19 pandemic as well as geopolitical and economic developments, may contribute to volatility in foreign exchange markets, which we may not be able to effectively manage, and our financial results could be adversely impacted. additionally, countries in which we operate may be classified as highly inflationary economies, requiring special accounting and financial reporting treatment for such operations, or such countries' currencies may be devalued, or both, which may adversely impact our business operations and financial results.
our debt service obligations may adversely affect our financial condition and cash flows from operations.
we have $2.30 billion of principal debt, consisting of notes due at various times from june 2025 to december 2031, as of january 31, 2023, as described in part ii, item 8. we also entered into a credit agreement that provides for an unsecured revolving loan facility in the aggregate principal amount of $1.5 billion, with an option to be increased up to $2.0 billion, as described in part ii, item 8. maintenance of our indebtedness, contractual restrictions, and additional issuances of indebtedness could:
•cause us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flows from operations towards debt service obligations and principal repayments;
•increase our vulnerability to adverse changes in general economic, industry, and competitive conditions;
•limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and our industry;
•impair our ability to obtain future financing for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, general corporate, or other purposes; and
•due to limitations within the debt instruments, restrict our ability to grant liens on property, enter into certain mergers, dispose of all or substantially all of the assets of autodesk and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole, materially change our business, and incur subsidiary indebtedness, subject to customary exceptions.
we are required to comply with the covenants set forth in our credit agreement. if we breach any of the covenants and do not obtain a waiver from the note holders or lenders, then, subject to applicable cure periods, we would not be able to incur additional indebtedness under the credit agreement described in part ii, item 8, and any outstanding indebtedness under the credit agreement may be declared immediately due and payable. in addition, changes by any rating agency to our credit rating may negatively impact the value and liquidity of our securities. under certain circumstances, if our credit ratings are downgraded or other negative action is taken, the interest rate payable by us under our credit agreement could increase. downgrades in our credit ratings could also restrict our ability to obtain additional financing in the future and could affect the terms of any such financing.
our investment portfolio consists of a variety of investment vehicles that are subject to interest rate trends, market volatility, and other economic factors. if general economic conditions decline, this could cause the credit ratings of our investments to deteriorate and illiquidity in the financial marketplace, and we may experience a decline in interest income and an inability to sell our investments, leading to impairment in the value of our investments.
it is our policy to invest our cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities in highly liquid instruments with, and in the custody of, financial institutions with high credit ratings and to limit the amounts invested with any one institution, type of security, or issuer. however, we are subject to general economic conditions, interest rate trends, and volatility in the financial marketplace that can affect the income that we receive from our investments, the net realizable value of our investments (including our cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities), and our ability to sell them. any one of these factors could reduce our investment income or result in material charges, which in turn could impact our overall net income (loss) and earnings (loss) per share.
from time to time we make direct investments in privately held companies. investments in privately held companies are considered inherently risky. the technologies and products these companies have under development are typically in the early stages and may never materialize, which could result in a loss of all or a substantial part of our initial investment in these companies. the evaluation of privately held companies is based on information that we request from these companies, which is not subject to the same disclosure regulations as u.s. publicly traded companies and, as such, the basis for these evaluations is subject to the timing and accuracy of the data received from these companies.
a loss on any of our investments may cause us to record an other-than-temporary impairment charge. the effect of this charge could impact our overall net income and earnings per share. in any of these scenarios, our liquidity may be negatively impacted, which in turn may prohibit us from making investments in our business, taking advantage of opportunities, and potentially meeting our financial obligations as they come due.
changes in tax rules and regulations, and uncertainties in interpretation and application, could materially affect our tax obligations and effective tax rate.
we are a u.s.-based multinational company subject to tax in multiple u.s. and foreign tax jurisdictions. our effective tax rate is primarily based on our geographic mix of earnings; statutory rates; stock-based compensation; intercompany arrangements, including the manner we develop, value, and license our intellectual property; and enacted tax rules. significant judgment is required in determining our effective tax rate and in evaluating our tax positions on a worldwide basis. while we believe our tax positions, including intercompany transfer pricing policies, are consistent with the tax laws in the jurisdictions in which we conduct our business, it is possible that these positions may be challenged by tax authorities and may have a significant impact on our effective tax rate and cash taxes.
tax laws in the united states and in foreign tax jurisdictions are dynamic and subject to change as new laws are passed and new interpretations of the law are issued or applied. for example, the u.s. government enacted significant tax law changes in december 2017, the tax act, which impacted our tax obligations and effective tax rate beginning in our fiscal 2018 tax year, and significant tax legislation was included in the march 2020 cares act and subsequent consolidated appropriations act in december 2020. due to the complexity and varying interpretations of the tax act and the cares act, the u.s. department of treasury and other standard-setting bodies have been issuing and will continue to issue regulations and interpretative guidance that could significantly impact how we will apply the law and the ultimate effect on our results of operations from both the tax act and the cares act, including for our prior tax years. in addition, increases in corporate tax rates, could increase our effective tax rate, cash taxes and have an adverse effect on our results from operations.
signed into law on august 16, 2022, the inflation reduction act contains many provisions that may impact autodesk, including the adjusted book minimum tax and excise tax on stock buybacks. we are assessing these impacts on our consolidated financial statements.
increasingly, tax authorities are reviewing existing corporate tax regulatory and legal regimes. many countries in the european union as well as other countries and organizations such as the organization for economic cooperation and development are actively considering new taxing regimes and changes to existing tax laws. if u.s. or foreign tax authorities change applicable tax laws or successfully challenge how or where our profits are currently recognized, our overall taxes could increase, and our business, financial condition, or results of operations may be adversely impacted.
if we were required to record an impairment charge related to the value of our long-lived assets or an additional valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets, our results of operations would be adversely affected.
our long-lived assets are tested for impairment if indicators of impairment exist. if impairment testing shows that the carrying value of our long-lived assets exceeds their estimated fair values, we would be required to record a non-cash impairment charge, which would decrease the carrying value of our long-lived assets, adversely affecting our results of operations. our deferred tax assets include net operating loss, amortizable tax assets, and tax credit carryforwards that can be used to offset taxable income and reduce income taxes payable in future periods. each quarter, we assess the need for a valuation allowance, considering both positive and negative evidence to determine whether all or a portion of the deferred tax assets are more likely than not to be realized. we continue to have a valuation allowance against certain u.s. and foreign deferred tax assets. changes in the amount of the u.s. and foreign jurisdictions valuation allowance could also result in a material non-cash expense or benefit in the period in which the valuation allowance is adjusted, and our results of operations could be materially affected. we will continue to perform these tests on our worldwide deferred tax assets, and any future adjustments to the realizability of our deferred tax assets may have a material effect on our financial condition and results of operations.
general risk factors our business may be significantly disrupted upon the occurrence of a catastrophic event.
our business is highly automated and relies extensively on the availability of our network and data center infrastructure, our internal technology systems, and our websites. we also rely on hosted computer services from third parties for services that we provide to our customers and computer operations for our internal use. the failure of our systems or hosted computer services due to a catastrophic event, such as an earthquake, fire, flood, tsunami, weather event, telecommunications failure, power failure, cyber attack, terrorism or war (including the significant military action against ukraine launched by russia and any related political or economic responses and counter-responses or otherwise by various global actors or the general effect on the global economy), or business interruption from epidemics or pandemics, or the fear of such events, could adversely impact our business, financial results, and financial condition. for example, our corporate headquarters and executive offices are located near major seismic faults in the san francisco bay area and face annual periods of wildfire danger, which increase the probability of power outages and may impact employees' abilities to commute to work or to work from home. we have developed disaster recovery plans and maintain backup systems in order to reduce the potential impact of a catastrophic event; however, there can be no assurance that these plans and systems would enable us to return to normal business operations. in addition, any such event could negatively impact a country or region in which we sell our products. this could in turn decrease that country's or region's demand for our products, negatively impacting our financial results.
we are subject to legal proceedings and regulatory inquiries, and we may be named in additional legal proceedings or become involved in regulatory inquiries in the future, all of which are costly, distracting to our core business, and could result in an unfavorable outcome or a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, or the trading prices for our securities.
we are involved in legal proceedings and receive inquiries from regulatory agencies. as the global economy has changed and our business has evolved, we have seen an increase in litigation activity and regulatory inquiries. like many other technology companies, the number and frequency of inquiries from u.s. and foreign regulatory agencies we have received regarding our business and our business practices, as well as the business practices of others in our industry, have increased in recent years. in the event we are involved in significant disputes or are the subject of a formal action by a regulatory agency, we could be exposed to costly and time-consuming legal proceedings that could result in any number of outcomes. any claims or regulatory actions initiated by or against us, whether successful or not, could result in high defense costs, damage awards, injunctive relief, increased costs of business, fines or orders to change certain business practices, significant dedication of management time, diversion of operational resources, or otherwise harm our business. in any such event, our financial results, results of operations, cash flows, or trading prices for our securities could be negatively impacted.
changes in existing financial accounting standards or practices, or taxation rules or practices may adversely affect our results of operations.
changes in existing accounting or taxation rules or practices, new accounting pronouncements or taxation rules, or varying interpretations of current accounting pronouncements or taxation practices could have a significant adverse effect on our results of operations or the way we conduct our business. further, such changes could potentially affect our reporting of transactions completed before such changes are effective.
we are required to evaluate our internal control over financial reporting under section 404 of the sarbanes-oxley act of 2002 and any adverse results from such evaluation could result in a loss of investor confidence in our financial reports and have an adverse effect on our stock price.
pursuant to section 404 of the sarbanes-oxley act of 2002, we are required to furnish a report by our management on our internal control over financial reporting, including an assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of the end of our fiscal year. this assessment must include a statement as to whether or not our internal control over financial reporting is effective and disclosure of any material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting identified by management. if our management or independent registered public accounting firm identifies one or more material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting, we are unable to assert that our internal control over financial reporting is effective, or our independent registered public accounting firm is unable to express an opinion that our internal controls are effective, investors could lose confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports, which could have an adverse effect on our business and stock price.
in preparing our financial statements we make certain assumptions, judgments, and estimates that affect amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements which, if not accurate, may significantly impact our financial results.
we make assumptions, judgments, and estimates for a number of items, including revenue recognition for product subscriptions and enterprise business arrangements ("ebas"), the determination of the fair value of acquired assets and liabilities, goodwill, financial instruments including strategic investments, long-lived assets, and intangible assets, the realizability of deferred tax assets, and the fair value of stock awards. we also make assumptions, judgments, and estimates in determining the accruals for uncertain tax positions, variable compensation, partner incentive programs, product returns reserves, allowances for credit losses, asset retirement obligations, legal contingencies, and operating lease liabilities. these assumptions, judgments, and estimates are drawn from historical experience and various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances as of the date of the consolidated financial statements. actual results could differ materially from our estimates, and such differences could significantly impact our financial results.
item 7.management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes appearing in part ii, item 8 of this annual report on form 10-k. this discussion contains forward-looking statements based upon current expectations that involve risks and uncertainties. our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of several factors, including those set forth above in part i, item 1a, "risk factors," and elsewhere in this report. see "forward-looking information" immediately preceding part i.
strategy autodesk is changing how the world is designed and made. our technology spans architecture, engineering, construction, product design, manufacturing, media and entertainment, empowering innovators everywhere to solve challenges big and small. from greener buildings to smarter products to more mesmerizing blockbusters, autodesk technology helps our customers to design and make a better world for all.
our strategy is to build enduring customer relationships, delivering innovative technology that provides valuable automation and insight into their design and make processes. to drive the execution of our strategy, we are focused on three strategic priorities: deliver a world-class customer experience, catalyze our customers' digital transformation, and establish an industry-leading platform for design and make.
we equip and inspire our users with the tailored tools, services, and access they need for success today and tomorrow. at every step, we help users harness the power of data to build upon their ideas and explore new ways of imagining, collaborating, and creating to achieve better outcomes for their customers, for society, and for the world. and because creativity can't flourish in silos, we connect what matters - from steps in a project to collaborators on a unified platform.
autodesk was founded during the platform transition from mainframe computers and engineering workstations to personal computers. we have developed and sustained a compelling value proposition based upon software for the personal computer. just as the transition from mainframes to personal computers transformed the hardware industry, the software industry has transitioned from developing and selling perpetual licenses and on-premises products to subscriptions and cloud-enabled technologies.
product evolution we offer subscriptions for individual products and industry collections, enterprise business arrangements ("ebas"), and cloud service offerings (collectively referred to as "subscription plans"). subscription plans are designed to give our customers more flexibility with how they use our offerings and to attract a broader range of customers, such as project-based users and small businesses.
our subscription plans represent a hybrid of desktop software and cloud functionality, which provides a device-independent, collaborative design workflow for designers and their stakeholders. our cloud offerings, for example, bim 360, autodesk build, fusion 360, shotgrid, autocad web app, and autocad mobile app, provide tools, including mobile and collaboration capabilities, to streamline design, collaboration, building and manufacturing, and data management processes. we believe that customer adoption of these latest offerings will continue to grow as customers across a range of industries begin to take advantage of the scalable computing power and flexibility provided through these services.
industry collections provide our customers with access to a broader selection of autodesk solutions and services, simplifying the customers' ability to benefit from a complete set of tools for their industry.
to support our strategic priority of digital transformation in architecture, engineering, and construction ("aec"), we are strengthening our aec solutions' foundation with both organic and inorganic investments. in fiscal 2023, we acquired a cloud-connected, extended reality (xr) platform enabling aec professionals to present, collaborate and review projects in immersive and interactive experiences, from anywhere and at any time. this acquisition enables autodesk to meet increasing needs for augmented reality (ar) and virtual reality (vr) technology advancements within the aec industry and further support aec customers throughout the project delivery lifecycle. in fiscal 2022, we acquired storm uk holdco limited, the parent of innovyze, inc. ("innovyze"), which provides water infrastructure software. combining innovyze's hydraulic modeling, simulation, asset performance management and operational analytics solutions with autodesk's design and analysis solutions (including autodesk civil 3d, autodesk infraworks, and the autodesk construction cloud) enables us to deliver end-to-end, cloud-based solutions for our water infrastructure customers that drive efficiency and sustainability. other acquisitions in fiscal 2022 include a cloud-based estimating solution that enables construction teams to create estimates, perform digital takeoffs, generate detailed reports and proposals and manage bid-day processes. additionally, in fiscal 2022, we launched autodesk tandem, a cloud-based digital twin technology platform that extends digital project delivery by providing owner/operators with an easy to use, accurate, digital as-built model of a newly built or renovated facility. for owner/operators, this accelerates operational readiness and extends the value of bim downstream into the owner/operator segment.
in manufacturing, our strategy is to combine organic and acquired software in existing and adjacent verticals to create end-to-end, cloud-based solutions for our customers that drive efficiency and sustainability. we continue to attract global manufacturing leaders and disruptive startups with our generative design and cloud-based fusion 360 that converges the design process with manufacturing. in the first fiscal quarter of 2023, we acquired a maker of software for optimizing manufacturing processes with automation and digitization from the shop floor upward that provides a real-time system of record for data collection, management, and analysis. in fiscal 2022, we acquired upchain, an instant-on, cloud-based data management technology that allows product design and manufacturing customers to collaborate in the cloud across their value chains and bring products to market faster.
our strategy includes improving our product functionality and expanding our product offerings through internal development as well as through the acquisition of products, technology, and businesses. acquisitions often increase the speed at which we can deliver product functionality to our customers; however, they entail cost and integration challenges and may, in certain instances, negatively impact our operating margins. we continually review these factors in making decisions regarding acquisitions. we anticipate that we will continue to acquire products, technology, and businesses as compelling opportunities become available.
global reach we sell our products and services globally, through a combination of indirect and direct channels. our indirect channels include value added resellers, direct market resellers, distributors, and other software developers. we entered into transition agreements with each of our distributors tech data and ingram micro to provide transition distribution activities for a one-to-two-year period, with potential extensions. in connection with the transition agreements, autodesk intends to increase its selling efforts with value-added resellers and agents. our direct channels include internal sales resources focused on selling in our largest accounts, our highly specialized solutions, and business transacted through our online autodesk branded store. see part ii, item 8, note 2, "revenue recognition" in the notes to the consolidated financial statements for further detail on the results of our indirect and direct channel sales for the fiscal years ended january 31, 2023, 2022, and 2021.
we anticipate that our channel mix will continue to change as we scale our online autodesk branded store business and our largest accounts shift towards direct-only business models. additionally, as part of the continued growth of our online autodesk branded store and the transition to annual billings for multi-year contracts and our new token-based flex model, we are planning to expand our transactions with value-added resellers and transact directly with more end customers without substantial disruption to our revenue.  we expect our indirect channel will continue to transact and support a considerable portion of our customers. we also expect our transition to annual billings for multi-year contracts to impact the timing of our billings and cash collections. we employ a variety of incentive programs and promotions to align our direct and indirect channels with our business strategies.
one of our key strategies is to maintain an api based architecture of our software products to facilitate third-party development of complementary products and industry-specific software solutions. this approach enables customers and third parties to customize solutions for a wide variety of highly specific uses. we offer several programs that provide strategic investment funding, technological platforms, user communities, technical support, forums, and events to developers who develop add-on applications for our products. for example, we have established the autodesk platform services to support innovators that build solutions to facilitate the development of a single connected ecosystem for the future of how things are designed, made, and used.
in addition to the competitive advantages afforded by our technology, our large global network of distributors, resellers, third-party developers, customers, educators, educational institutions, learning partners, and students is a key competitive advantage which has been cultivated over an extensive period. this network of partners and relationships provides us with a broad and deep reach into volume markets worldwide. our distributor and reseller network is extensive and provides our customers with the resources to purchase, deploy, learn, and support our solutions quickly and easily. we have a significant number of registered third-party developers who create products that work well with our solutions and extend them for a variety of specialized applications.
impact at autodesk autodesk is committed to advancing a more sustainable, resilient, and equitable world. we don't believe in waiting for progress, we believe in making it. we take action as a business and to support our employees, customers, and communities in our collective opportunity to design and make a better world for all.
we focus our efforts to advance positive outcomes across three primary areas: energy and materials, health and resilience, and work and prosperity. these impact opportunity areas are derived from the un sustainable development goals ("sdgs") and have been focused through a multi-pronged process to align the top needs of our stakeholders, the important issues of our business, and the areas we are best placed to accelerate positive impact at scale.
these opportunities manifest as outcomes through how our customers leverage our technology to design and make net-zero carbon buildings, resilient infrastructure, more sustainable products, and a thriving workforce. we realize these opportunities through powering our business with 100% renewable energy, neutralizing greenhouse gas emissions and developing an inclusive culture. we advance these opportunities with industry innovators through collaboration, philanthropic capital, software donations, and training.
the autodesk foundation (the "foundation"), a privately funded 501(c)(3) charity organization established and solely funded by us, leads our philanthropic efforts. the purpose of the foundation is twofold: to support employees to make a better world by matching employees' volunteer time and/or donations to nonprofit organizations; and to support organizations using design to drive positive social and environmental impact. on our behalf, the foundation also administers a discounted software donation program to nonprofit organizations, social and environmental entrepreneurs, and others who are developing design solutions that will shape a more sustainable future.
additional information about our environmental, social, and governance program is available in our annual impact report on our website at www.autodesk.com. information contained on or accessible through our website is not part of or incorporated by reference into this report.
assumptions behind our strategy our strategy depends upon many assumptions, including: making our technology available to mainstream markets; leveraging our large global network of distributors, resellers, agents, third-party developers, customers, educators, educational institutions, learning partners, and students; improving the performance and functionality of our products and platform; and adequately protecting our intellectual property. if the outcome of any of these assumptions differs from our expectations, we may not be able to implement our strategy, which could potentially adversely affect our business. for further discussion regarding these and related risks, see part i, item 1a, "risk factors."
critical accounting policies and estimates our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with u.s. generally accepted accounting principles. in preparing our consolidated financial statements, we make assumptions, judgments, and estimates that can have a significant impact on amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements. we evaluate our estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis. we base our assumptions, judgments, and estimates on historical experience and various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. actual results could differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.
our significant accounting policies are described in part ii, item 8, "financial statements and supplementary data," note 1, "business and summary of significant accounting policies," in the notes to consolidated financial statements. an accounting policy is deemed to be critical if it requires an accounting estimate to be made based on assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the estimate is made, if different estimates reasonably could have been used, or if changes in the estimate that are reasonably possible could materially impact the financial statements. we believe that of all our significant accounting policies, the following accounting policies and specific estimates involve a greater degree of judgment and complexity. accordingly, these are the accounting policies we believe are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our financial condition and results of operations.
revenue recognition - judgments with multiple performance obligations. our contracts with customers may include promises to transfer multiple products and services to a customer. a performance obligation is a promise in a contract with a customer to transfer products or services that are distinct. determining whether products and services are distinct performance obligations that should be accounted for separately or combined as a single performance obligation may require significant judgment that requires us to assess the nature of the promise and value delivered to the customer and the interaction of the desktop applications and cloud functionalities.
for our product subscriptions, cloud service offerings, and flexible enterprise business arrangements, the functional nature of the promise, as well as the customers' value expectations, led us to conclude desktop applications and cloud functionalities are not distinct in the context of the contract and should be accounted for as a single performance obligation. there is a high degree of interaction of the desktop applications and cloud functionalities, which is not available with the desktop applications alone or in conjunction with third-party cloud service providers. furthermore, customers are not able to use the desktop applications for its intended purpose without our cloud functionalities.
for contracts with more than one performance obligation, the transaction price is allocated among the performance obligations in an amount that depicts the relative standalone selling price ("ssp") of each obligation. judgment is required to determine the ssp for each distinct performance obligation. we use a range of amounts to estimate ssp when we sell each of the products and services separately and need to determine whether there is a discount that should be allocated based on the relative ssp of the various products and services.
in instances where ssp is not directly observable, such as when we do not sell the product or service separately, we determine the ssp using information that includes market conditions and other observable inputs. we typically have more than one ssp for individual products and services due to the stratification of those products and services by customer and circumstance. in these instances, we use relevant information such as the sales channel to determine the ssp.
strategic investments. strategic investment debt and equity securities are valued using significant unobservable inputs or data in an inactive market and the valuation requires our judgment due to the absence of market prices and inherent lack of liquidity. the carrying value is adjusted for our strategic investment equity securities if there are observable price changes in a same or similar security from the same issuer or if there are identified events or changes in circumstances that may indicate impairment, as discussed below. the determination of whether an orderly transaction is for a same or similar investment requires significant management judgment including the nature of rights and obligations of the investments, the extent to which differences in those rights and obligations would affect the fair values of those investments, and the impact of any differences based on the stage of operational development of the investee.
these assumptions are inherently subjective and involve significant management judgment. whenever possible, we use observable market data and rely on unobservable inputs only when observable market data is not available when determining fair value.
we assess our strategic investment debt and equity securities portfolio quarterly for impairment. strategic investment equity securities are assessed based on available information such as current cash positions, earnings and cash flow forecasts, recent operational performance, and any other readily available market data. for any available-for-sale debt securities, if autodesk does not intend to sell and it is not more likely than not that autodesk will be required to sell the available-for-sale debt security prior to recovery of its amortized cost basis, autodesk will determine whether a decline in fair value below the amortized cost basis is due to credit-related factors. the credit loss is measured as the amount by which the debt security's amortized cost basis exceeds the estimate of the present value of cash flows expected to be collected, up to the difference between the amortized cost basis and the fair value. impairment will be assessed at the individual security level. credit-related impairment is recognized as an allowance on the consolidated balance sheets with a corresponding adjustment to "interest and other expense, net" on the company's consolidated statements of operations. any impairment that is not credit-related is recognized in "accumulated other comprehensive loss" on the consolidated balance sheets.
for our quarterly impairment assessment of privately held debt and equity securities, the analysis encompasses an assessment of the severity and duration of the impairment and qualitative and quantitative analysis of other key factors including: the investee's financial metrics, the investee's products and technologies meeting or exceeding predefined milestones, market acceptance of the product or technology, other competitive products or technology in the market, general market conditions, management and governance structure of the investee, the investee's liquidity, debt ratios, and the rate at which the investee is using its cash.
business combinations. the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination are recorded based on their estimated fair values at the acquisition date, with the exception of contract assets and contract liabilities (i.e., deferred revenue) which are recognized and measured on the acquisition date in accordance with autodesk's "revenue recognition" policy in part ii, item 8, "financial statements and supplementary data," note 1 "business and summary of significant accounting policies". any residual purchase price is recorded as goodwill. accounting for business combinations requires us to make significant estimates and assumptions, especially at the acquisition date with respect to intangible assets and deferred revenue obligations.
although we believe the assumptions and estimates we have made are reasonable, they are based in part on historical experience and information obtained from the management of the acquired companies and are inherently uncertain and unpredictable. unanticipated events and circumstances may occur which may affect the accuracy or validity of such assumptions, estimates, or actual results. examples of critical estimates used in valuing certain of the intangible assets and in determining the assets' useful lives for the assets we have acquired or may acquire in the future include but are not limited to:
•future expected cash flows from subscriptions and maintenance agreements, sales, and acquired developed technologies;
•the acquired company's trade name and patents, as well as assumptions about the period of time the acquired trade name and patents will continue to be used in our product portfolio;
•expected growth in revenue from the acquired company's existing customer relationships;
•expected costs to develop the in-process research and development into commercially viable products and estimated cash flows from the projects when completed;
•uncertain tax positions and tax related valuation allowances assumed; and
•discount rates used to determine the present value of estimated future cash flows.
realizability of long-lived assets. we assess the realizability of our long-lived assets and related intangible assets, other than goodwill, quarterly, or sooner should events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying values of such assets may not be recoverable. we consider the following factors important in determining when to perform an impairment review: significant under-performance of a business or product line relative to budget, shifts in business strategies which affect the continued uses of the assets, significant negative industry or economic trends, and the results of past impairment reviews. when such events or changes in circumstances occur, we assess recoverability of these assets.
we assess recoverability of these assets by comparing the carrying amounts to the future undiscounted cash flows the assets are expected to generate. if impairment indicators were present based on our undiscounted cash flow models, which include assumptions regarding projected cash flows, we would perform a discounted cash flow analysis to assess impairments on long-lived assets.
the key assumptions that we use in our discounted cash flow model include the amount and timing of estimated future cash flows to be generated by the asset group over an extended period of time and a rate of return that considers the relative risk of achieving the cash flows and the time value of money. significant judgment is required to estimate the amount and timing of future cash flows and the relative risk of achieving those cash flows. we also make judgments about the remaining useful lives of acquired intangible assets and other long-lived assets that have finite lives.
variances in these assumptions could have a significant impact on our conclusion as to whether an asset is impaired or the amount of any impairment charge. impairment charges, if any, result in situations where any fair values of these assets are less than their carrying values.
income taxes. we account for income taxes under the asset and liability approach. under this method, deferred tax assets, including those related to tax loss carryforwards and credits, and deferred tax liabilities are determined based on the differences between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse. we recognize the tax benefit for an uncertain tax position when it meets the more likely than not threshold for recognition. we recognize potential accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as income tax expense.
a valuation allowance is recorded to reduce deferred tax assets when management cannot conclude that it is more likely than not that the deferred tax asset will be recovered. the valuation allowance is determined by assessing both positive and negative evidence to determine whether it is more likely than not that deferred tax assets are recoverable; such assessment is required on a jurisdiction-by-jurisdiction basis. significant judgment is required in determining whether the valuation allowance should be recorded against deferred tax assets. in assessing the need for or release of a valuation allowance, we consider all available evidence including past operating results and estimates of future taxable income.
as we continually strive to optimize our overall business model, tax planning strategies may become feasible and prudent whereby management may determine that it is more likely than not that the netherlands, australia, california, michigan and u.s. capital loss deferred tax assets will be realized. each quarter we will continue to evaluate the positive and negative evidence of our ability to utilize our global deferred tax assets.
loss contingencies. as described in part i, item 3, "legal proceedings" and part ii, item 8, "financial statements and supplementary data, note 11, "commitments and contingencies," in the notes to consolidated financial statements, we are periodically involved in various legal claims and proceedings. we routinely review the status of each significant matter and assess our potential financial exposure. if the potential loss from any matter is considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated, we record a liability for the estimated loss. significant judgment is required to determine both the likelihood of there being, and the estimated amount of, a loss related to such matters. due to inherent uncertainties related to these matters, we base our loss accruals on the best information available at the time. until the final resolution of such matters, there may be an exposure to loss in excess of the amount recorded. as additional information becomes available, we reassess our potential liability and may revise our estimates. such revisions could have a material impact on future quarterly or annual results of operations.
recently issued accounting standards see part ii, item 8, "financial statements and supplementary data," note 1, "business and summary of significant accounting policies," in the notes to consolidated financial statements for a full description of recent accounting pronouncements, including the expected dates of adoption and estimated effects on results of operations and financial condition.
overview of fiscal 2023
•total net revenue was $5.01 billion during fiscal 2023, an increase of 14% compared to the prior fiscal year.
•recurring revenue as a percentage of net revenue was 98% for both fiscal years ending january 31, 2023 and 2022.
•net revenue retention rate ("nr3") was within the range of 100% and 110% as of both january 31, 2023 and 2022.
•deferred revenue was $4.58 billion, an increase of 21% compared to the prior fiscal year.
•remaining performance obligations (short-term and long-term deferred revenue plus unbilled deferred revenue) ("rpo") was $5.62 billion, an increase of 19% compared to the fourth quarter in the prior fiscal year.
•current remaining performance obligations were $3.52 billion, an increase of 12% compared to the prior fiscal year.
revenue analysis during fiscal 2023, net revenue increased 14%, as compared to the prior fiscal year, primarily due to a 15% increase in subscription revenue, partially offset by a 14% decrease in maintenance revenue.
further discussion of the drivers of these results are discussed below under the heading "results of operations."
we rely significantly upon major distributors and resellers in both the united states and international regions, including tech data corporation and its global affiliates (collectively, "tech data") and ingram micro inc. ("ingram micro"). total sales to tech data accounted for 37%, 36%, and 37% of autodesk's total net revenue during fiscal 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively. ingram micro accounted for 9%, 9%, and 10% of autodesk's total net revenue during fiscal 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively. our customers through tech data and ingram micro are the resellers and end users who purchase our software subscriptions and services. we entered into transition agreements with each of our distributors tech data and ingram micro to provide transition distribution activities for a one-to-two-year period, with potential extensions. in connection with the transition agreements, autodesk intends to increase our selling efforts with value-added resellers and agents. consequently, we believe our business is not substantially dependent on tech data or ingram micro.
recurring revenue and net revenue retention rate in order to help better understand our financial performance we use several key performance metrics, including recurring revenue and nr3. these metrics are key performance metrics and should be viewed independently of revenue and deferred revenue as these metrics are not intended to be combined with those items. we use these metrics to monitor the strength of our recurring business. we believe these metrics are useful to investors because they can help in monitoring the long-term health of our business. our determination and presentation of these metrics may differ from that of other companies. the presentation of these metrics is meant to be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for or in isolation from, our financial measures prepared in accordance with gaap. please refer to the "glossary of terms" for the definitions of these metrics in part i, item 1, "business".
the following table outlines our recurring revenue metric for the fiscal years ended january 31, 2023, 2022, and 2021:

changes in the value of the u.s. dollar may have a significant effect on net revenue, total spend, and income from operations in future periods. we use foreign currency contracts to reduce the exchange rate effect on a portion of the net revenue of certain anticipated transactions but do not attempt to completely mitigate the impact of fluctuations of such foreign currency against the u.s. dollar.
remaining performance obligations rpo represents deferred revenue and contractually stated or committed orders under early renewal and multi-year billing plans for subscription, services, license, and maintenance for which the associated deferred revenue has not yet been recognized. unbilled deferred revenue is not included as a receivable or deferred revenue on our consolidated balance sheets. see part ii, item 8, note 2, "revenue recognition" for more details on autodesk's performance obligations.

unbilled deferred revenue                1,043           949

rpo consisted of the following:
(in millions)           january 31, 2022             january 31, 2021
current rpo                                            $3,518              $3,141
non-current rpo                                         2,105               1,598
rpo                                                    $5,623              $4,739
we expect that the amount of rpo will change from quarter to quarter for several reasons, including the specific timing, duration, and size of customer subscription and support agreements, the specific timing of customer renewals, the frequency of the billing installments, and foreign currency fluctuations. historically, we have had increased eba sales activity in our fourth fiscal quarter and this seasonality may affect the relative value of our billings, rpo, and collections in the fourth and first fiscal quarters.
balance sheet and cash flow items at january 31, 2023, we had $2.17 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities. our cash flow from operations increased to $2.07 billion for the fiscal year ended january 31, 2023, from $1.53 billion for the fiscal year ended january 31, 2022. we repurchased 5 million shares of our common stock for $1.08 billion during fiscal 2023. comparatively, we repurchased 4 million shares of our common stock for $1.09 billion during fiscal 2022. further discussion regarding the balance sheet and cash flow activities are discussed below under the heading "liquidity and capital resources."
results of operations overview we believe our investment in cloud products and a subscription business model, backed by a strong balance sheet, give us a robust foundation to successfully navigate complex geopolitical and global macro-economic challenges. however, supply chain disruption and resulting inflationary pressures, higher interest rates, a global labor shortage, the ebb and flow of covid-19, including in specific geographies, the war in ukraine, and foreign exchange rate fluctuations, may impact our outlook. we also expect our transition to annual billings for multi-year contracts to impact the timing of our billings and cash collections. the extent of the impact of these risks on our business in fiscal 2024 and beyond will depend on several factors, some of which are out of our control. further discussion of the potential impacts of these risks on our business can be found in part i, item 1a, "risk factors."
the covid-19 pandemic has spurred changes in the way we work and we moved to a more hybrid workforce resulting in an evaluation of our office space needs. accordingly, we reduced our facilities portfolio worldwide and incurred charges associated with our operating leases for real estate during the fiscal years ended january 31, 2023 and 2022. see part ii, item 8, note 9, "leases" in the notes to consolidated financial statements for more information. optimizing our facilities costs allows us to deploy capital better to further our strategy and drive growth. however, there is no guarantee that we will realize any anticipated benefits to our business, including any cost savings or operational efficiencies.
net revenue by income statement presentation subscription revenue consists of our term-based product subscriptions, cloud service offerings, and flexible ebas. revenue from these arrangements is predominately recognized ratably over the contract term commencing with the date our service is made available to customers and when all other revenue recognition criteria have been satisfied.
maintenance revenue consists of renewal fees for existing maintenance plan agreements that were initially purchased with a perpetual software license. under our maintenance plan, customers are eligible to receive unspecified upgrades, when and if available, and technical support. we recognize maintenance revenue ratably over the term of the agreements, which is generally one year.
other revenue consists of revenue from consulting, training, and other products and services, and is recognized as the products are delivered and services are performed.

we believe that international revenue will continue to comprise a majority of our net revenue. unfavorable economic conditions, including as a result of the covid-19 pandemic or in connection with the significant military action against ukraine launched by russia (and any related political or economic responses and counter-responses or otherwise by various global actors or the general effect on the global economy), in the countries that contribute a significant portion of our net revenue, including in emerging economies such as brazil, india, and china, may have an adverse effect on our business in those countries and our overall financial performance. changes in the value of the u.s. dollar relative to other currencies have significantly affected, and could continue to significantly affect, our financial results for a given period even though we hedge a portion of our current and projected revenue. increases to the levels of political and economic unpredictability or protectionism in the global market may impact our future financial results.

interest and other expense, net, decreased by $10 million during fiscal 2023, as compared to fiscal 2022. the decrease was primarily due to an increase in gains on foreign currency in the current period compared to the prior fiscal year due to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations and an increase in interest income, partially offset by an increase in interest expense as a result of the issuance of debt in fiscal year 2022 and losses in the current period as compared to gains in the prior year for investments in debt and equity securities that are held in a rabbi trust under non-qualified deferred compensation plans.
interest and other expense, net, decreased by $29 million during fiscal 2022, as compared to fiscal 2021. the decrease was primarily due to gains on dispositions, mark-to-market gains, and a decrease in impairments of strategic investment equity securities in the current period as compared to the prior period offset in part by an increase in interest expense as a result of the issuance of debt in fiscal 2022 and a decrease in mark-to market gains on debt and equity securities held in a rabbi trust under non-qualified deferred compensation plans.
interest expense and investment income fluctuates based on average cash, marketable securities, debt balances, average maturities, and interest rates.
gains and losses on foreign currency are primarily due to the impact of re-measuring foreign currency transactions and net monetary assets into the functional currency of the corresponding entity. the amount of the gain or loss on foreign currency is driven by the volume of foreign currency transactions and the foreign currency exchange rates for the year.
provision for income taxes we account for income taxes and the related accounts under the liability method. deferred tax liabilities and assets are determined based on the difference between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities, using enacted rates expected to be in effect during the year in which the basis differences reverse. furthermore, on january 22, 2018, the fasb released guidance on the accounting for tax on the global intangible low-taxed income ("gilti") provisions of the tcja. the gilti provisions impose a tax on foreign income in excess of a deemed return on tangible assets of foreign corporations. the company has elected to recognize any potential gilti obligations as an expense in the period it is incurred.
income tax expense was $123 million and $68 million for fiscal 2023 and 2022, relative to pre-tax income of $946 million and $565 million, respectively, for the same periods. the tax expense for fiscal 2023 consists primarily of the u.s. and foreign tax expense, including withholding tax, an increase in tax expense relating to stock-based compensation, final u.s. foreign tax credit regulations enacted in fiscal 2023, offset by the benefit from the canada valuation allowance release and a u.s. foreign derived intangible income benefit driven by capitalization of research and development expenditures starting in fiscal 2023 as required by the tax act. tax expense for fiscal 2022 consisted primarily of the u.s. and foreign tax expense, including withholding tax, offset by shared-based compensation deductions, india withholding tax refunds and generation of federal tax credits.
a valuation allowance is recorded to reduce deferred tax assets when management cannot conclude that it is more likely than not that the net deferred tax asset will be recovered. the valuation allowance is determined by assessing both positive and negative evidence to determine whether it is more likely than not that deferred tax assets are recoverable; such assessment is required on a jurisdiction-by-jurisdiction basis. significant judgment is required in determining whether the valuation allowance should be recorded against deferred tax assets. in assessing the need for a valuation allowance, we consider all available evidence including past operating results and estimates of future taxable income.
in fiscal 2016, we considered cumulative losses in the u.s. from our business model transition as a significant source of negative evidence. considering this negative evidence, we determined that it was more likely than not that we would not realize the u.s. deferred tax assets and recorded a full valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets. foreign operations in the netherlands and canada that generated interest expense, future creditable research in excess of earnings, respectively, also resulted in the historic recording of a full valuation under the more likely than not realizability criteria.
in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021, we released the valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets in the u.s., resulting in a $679 million non-cash benefit to earnings. we released the u.s. valuation allowance in fiscal 2021 due to the following positive evidence:
•recent history of worldwide pre-tax earnings, including cumulative earnings on a worldwide basis as of fiscal 2021
•recent history of u.s. taxable income
•forecast of worldwide and u.s. pre-tax earnings, including a forecast of cumulative earnings in the u.s. jurisdiction
•forecast of u.s. taxable income
•reversal of deferred tax liabilities we released our canada valuation allowance in fiscal 2023 due to positive evidence supporting the utilization of the r&d credits before they expire, resulting in a $38 million non-cash benefit to earnings.
we have retained a valuation allowance against california and michigan deferred tax assets as well as deferred tax assets that will convert into a capital loss upon reversal as we do not have sufficient income of the appropriate character to benefit these deferred tax assets. also, the company continues to retain a valuation allowance against foreign deferred tax assets in the netherlands and australia.
as we continually strive to optimize our overall business model, tax planning strategies may become feasible whereby management may determine, based on all available evidence, both positive and negative, that it is more likely than not that the netherlands, australia, california, michigan, and u.s. capital loss deferred tax assets will be realized.
as of january 31, 2023, we had $223 million of gross unrecognized tax benefits, of which $38 million would reduce our valuation allowance, if recognized. the remaining $185 million would impact the effective tax rate. the amount of unrecognized tax benefits will decrease in the next twelve months for statute lapse of approximately $4 million.
our future effective annual tax rate may be materially impacted by the amount of benefits and charges from tax amounts associated with our foreign earnings that are taxed at rates different from the federal statutory rate, changes in valuation allowances, level of profit before tax, accounting for uncertain tax positions, business combinations, closure of statute of limitations or settlement of tax audits, and changes in tax laws. a significant amount of our earnings are generated by our european and asia pacific subsidiaries. our future effective tax rates may be adversely affected to the extent earnings are lower than anticipated in countries where we have lower statutory tax rates.
signed into law on august 16, 2022, the inflation reduction act contains many revisions to the internal revenue code effective in taxable years beginning after december 31, 2022, including a 15% corporate minimum income tax and a 1% excise tax on corporate stock repurchases by publicly traded u.s. corporations. autodesk is currently assessing the impact the inflation reduction act will have on our consolidated financial statements.
other financial information in addition to our results determined under u.s. generally accepted accounting principles ("gaap") discussed above, we believe the following non-gaap measures are useful to investors in evaluating our operating performance. for the fiscal years ended january 31, 2023, 2022, and 2021, our gross profit, income from operations, operating margin, net income, and diluted net income per share on a gaap and non-gaap basis were as follows (in millions except for operating margin and per share data):

for our internal budgeting and resource allocation process and as a means to provide consistency in period-to-period comparisons, we use non-gaap measures to supplement our consolidated financial statements presented on a gaap basis. these non-gaap measures do not include certain items that may have a material impact upon our reported financial results. we also use non-gaap measures in making operating decisions because we believe those measures provide meaningful supplemental information regarding our earning potential and performance for management by excluding certain benefits, credits, expenses, and charges that may not be indicative of our core business operating results. for the reasons set forth below, we believe these non-gaap financial measures are useful to investors both because (1) they allow for greater transparency with respect to key metrics used by management in its financial and operational decision-making and (2) they are used by our institutional investors and the analyst community to analyze the health of our business. this allows investors and others to better understand and evaluate our operating results and future prospects in the same manner as management, compare financial results across accounting periods and to those of peer companies, and to better understand the long-term performance of our core business. we also use some of these measures for purposes of determining company-wide incentive compensation.
there are limitations in using non-gaap financial measures because non-gaap financial measures are not prepared in accordance with gaap and may be different from non-gaap financial measures used by other companies. the non-gaap financial measures included above are limited in value because they exclude certain items that may have a material impact upon our reported financial results. in addition, they are subject to inherent limitations as they reflect the exercise of judgments by management about which charges are excluded from the non-gaap financial measures. we compensate for these limitations by analyzing current and future results on a gaap basis as well as a non-gaap basis and also by providing gaap measures in our public disclosures. the presentation of non-gaap financial information is meant to be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for or in isolation from, the directly comparable financial measures prepared in accordance with gaap. we urge investors to review the reconciliation of our non-gaap financial measures to the comparable gaap financial measures included below, and not to rely on any single financial measure to evaluate our business.

our non-gaap financial measures may exclude the following:
stock-based compensation expenses. we exclude stock-based compensation expenses from non-gaap measures primarily because they are non-cash expenses and management finds it useful to exclude certain non-cash charges to assess the appropriate level of various operating expenses to assist in budgeting, planning, and forecasting future periods. moreover, because of varying available valuation methodologies, subjective assumptions, and the variety of award types that companies can use under fasb asc topic 718, we believe excluding stock-based compensation expenses allows investors to make meaningful comparisons between our recurring core business operating results and those of other companies.
amortization of developed technologies and purchased intangibles. we incur amortization of acquisition-related developed technology and purchased intangibles in connection with acquisitions of certain businesses and technologies. amortization of developed technologies and purchased intangibles is inconsistent in amount and frequency and is significantly affected by both the timing and size of our acquisitions. management finds it useful to exclude these variable charges from our cost of revenues to assist in budgeting, planning, and forecasting future periods. investors should note that the use of intangible assets contributed to our revenues earned during the periods presented and will contribute to our future period revenues as well. amortization of developed technologies and purchased intangible assets will recur in future periods.
ceo transition costs. we exclude amounts paid to the company's former ceos upon departure under the terms of their transition agreements, including severance payments, acceleration of restricted stock units, and continued vesting of performance stock units, and legal fees incurred with the transition. also excluded from our non-gaap measures are recruiting costs related to the search for a new ceo. these costs represent non-recurring expenses and are not indicative of our ongoing operating expenses. we further believe that excluding the ceo transition costs from our non-gaap results is useful to investors in that it allows for period-over-period comparability.
goodwill impairment. this is a non-cash charge to write down goodwill to fair value when there is an indication that the asset has been impaired. as explained above, management finds it useful to exclude certain non-cash charges to assess the appropriate level of various operating expenses to assist in budgeting, planning, and forecasting future periods.
restructuring and other exit costs, net. these expenses are associated with realigning our business strategies based on current economic conditions. in connection with these restructuring actions or other exit actions, we recognize costs related to termination benefits for former employees whose positions were eliminated, the closure of facilities, and cancellation of certain contracts. we exclude these charges because these expenses are not reflective of ongoing business and operating results. we believe it is useful for investors to understand the effects of these items on our total operating expenses.
lease-related asset impairments and other charges.  these charges are associated with the optimization of our facilities costs related to leases for facilities that we have recently vacated as a result of our one-time move to a more hybrid remote workforce. in connection with these facility leases, we recognize costs related to the impairment or abandonment of operating lease right-of-use assets, computer equipment, furniture, and leasehold improvements, and other costs. we exclude these charges because these expenses are not reflective of ongoing business and operating results. we believe it is useful for investors to understand the effects of these items on our total operating expenses.
acquisition-related costs. we exclude certain acquisition-related costs, including due diligence costs, professional fees in connection with an acquisition, certain financing costs, and certain integration-related expenses. these expenses are unpredictable, and depend on factors that may be outside of our control and unrelated to the continuing operations of the acquired business or our company. in addition, the size and complexity of an acquisition, which often drives the magnitude of acquisition-related costs, may not be indicative of such future costs. we believe excluding acquisition-related costs facilitates the comparison of our financial results to the company's historical operating results and to other companies in our industry.
loss (gain) on strategic investments and dispositions. we exclude gains and losses related to our strategic investments and dispositions of strategic investments, purchased intangibles, and businesses from our non-gaap measures primarily because management finds it useful to exclude these variable gains and losses on these investments and dispositions in assessing our financial results. included in these amounts are non-cash unrealized gains and losses, dividends received, realized gains and losses on the sales or losses on the impairment of these investments, and gain and loss on dispositions. we believe excluding these items is useful to investors because they do not correlate to the underlying performance of our business and these losses or gains were incurred in connection with strategic investments and dispositions which do not occur regularly.
discrete tax provision items. we exclude the gaap tax provision, including discrete items, from the non-gaap measure of net income (loss), and include a non-gaap tax provision based upon the projected annual non-gaap effective tax rate. discrete tax items include income tax expenses or benefits that do not relate to ordinary income from continuing operations in the current fiscal year, unusual or infrequently occurring items, or the tax impact of certain stock-based compensation. examples of discrete tax items include, but are not limited to, certain changes in judgment and changes in estimates of tax matters related to prior fiscal years, certain costs related to business combinations, certain changes in the realizability of deferred tax assets, or changes in tax law. management believes this approach assists investors in understanding the tax provision and the effective tax rate related to ongoing operations. we believe the exclusion of these discrete tax items provides investors with useful supplemental information about our operational performance.
establishment (release) of a valuation allowance on certain net deferred tax assets. this is a non-cash charge to record or to release a valuation allowance on certain deferred tax assets. as explained above, management finds it useful to exclude certain non-cash charges to assess the appropriate level of various cash expenses to assist in budgeting, planning, and forecasting future periods.
income tax effects on the difference between gaap and non-gaap costs and expenses. the income tax effects that are excluded from the non-gaap measures relate to the tax impact on the difference between gaap and non-gaap expenses, primarily due to stock-based compensation, amortization of purchased intangibles, and restructuring charges and other exit costs (benefits) for gaap and non-gaap measures.
liquidity and capital resources our primary source of cash is from the sale of our software and related services. our primary use of cash is payment of our operating costs, which consist primarily of employee-related expenses, such as compensation and benefits, as well as general operating expenses for marketing, facilities, and overhead costs. long-term cash requirements for items other than normal operating expenses are anticipated for the following: the acquisition of businesses, software products, or technologies complementary to our business; repayment of debt; common stock repurchases; and capital expenditures, including the purchase and implementation of internal-use software applications.
at january 31, 2023, our principal sources of liquidity were cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities totaling $2.17 billion and net accounts receivable of $961 million.
in november 2022, autodesk entered into an amended and restated credit agreement ("credit agreement") by and among autodesk, the lenders party thereto, and citibank, n.a., as agent, that provides for a revolving credit facility in the aggregate principal amount of $1.5 billion with an option to be increased up to $2.0 billion. the revolving credit facility is available for working capital or other business needs. the maturity date on the credit agreement is september 30, 2026. at january 31, 2023, autodesk had no outstanding borrowings under the credit agreement. additionally, as of march 14, 2023, we have no amounts outstanding under the credit agreement. see part ii, item 8, note 8, "borrowing arrangements," in the notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion on our covenant requirements. if we are unable to remain in compliance with the covenants under the credit agreement, we may not be able to draw on our revolving credit facility.
as of january 31, 2023, we had $2.30 billion aggregate principal amount of notes outstanding. see part ii, item 8, note 8,
"borrowing arrangements," in the notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion.
our cash and cash equivalents are held by diversified financial institutions globally. our primary commercial banking relationship is with citigroup and its global affiliates. in addition, citibank n.a., an affiliate of citigroup, is one of the lead lenders and agent in the syndicate of our $1.5 billion revolving credit facility.
our cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities balances are concentrated in a few locations around the world, with substantial amounts held outside of the united states. as of january 31, 2023, approximately 59% of our total cash or cash equivalents and marketable securities are located in foreign jurisdictions and that percentage will fluctuate subject to business needs. there are several factors that can impact our ability to utilize foreign cash balances, such as foreign exchange restrictions, foreign regulatory restrictions, or adverse tax costs. the tax act included a mandatory one-time tax on accumulated earnings of foreign subsidiaries and generally eliminated u.s. taxes on foreign subsidiary distributions in future periods. as a result, earnings in foreign jurisdictions are generally available for distribution to the united states with little to no incremental u.s. taxes. we regularly review our capital structure and consider a variety of potential financing alternatives and planning strategies to ensure we have the proper liquidity available in the locations in which it is needed. we expect to meet our liquidity needs through or in combination of current cash balances, ongoing cash flows, and external borrowings.
cash from operations could also be affected by various risks and uncertainties, including, but not limited to the risks detailed in part i, item 1a,"risk factors." based on our current business plan and revenue prospects, we believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents, our anticipated cash flows from operations, and our available revolving credit facility will be sufficient to meet our working capital and operating resource expenditure requirements for at least the next 12 months from the date of this annual report.
our revenue, earnings, cash flows, receivables, and payables are subject to fluctuations due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates, for which we have put in place foreign currency contracts as part of our risk management strategy. see part ii, item 7a, "quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk" for further discussion.

net cash provided by operating activities of $2,071 million for fiscal 2023, primarily consisted of $823 million of our net income adjusted for $556 million non-cash items such as stock-based compensation expense, depreciation, amortization, and accretion expense, lease-related asset impairment charges, and deferred income tax. the increase in cash provided by working capital was primarily due to a net increase in deferred revenue of $798 million driven by an increase in product subscriptions and eba offerings offset in part by a change in accounts receivable of 247 million due to the seasonality of our billings in the fourth fiscal quarter and timing of cash collections from customers.
net cash provided by operating activities of $1,531 million for fiscal 2022, primarily consisted of $497 million of our net income adjusted for $817 million non-cash items such as stock-based compensation expense, depreciation, amortization, and accretion expense, lease-related asset impairment charges, and deferred income tax. the increase in cash provided by working capital was primarily due to: a net increase in deferred revenue of $419 million driven by an increase in product subscriptions and eba offerings and a decrease in maintenance subscriptions offset in part by an increase in prepaid expenses and other assets of $134 million primarily due to the timing of payments for operating expenses.
net cash used in investing activities was $143 million for fiscal 2023 and was primarily due to purchases of marketable securities and business combinations, net of cash acquired, partially offset by sales and maturities of marketable securities.
net cash used in investing activities was $1,595 million for fiscal 2022 and was primarily due to business combinations, net of cash acquired, and purchases of marketable securities.
net cash used in financing activities was $1,487 million in fiscal 2023 and was primarily due to repurchases of our common stock and repayment of debt.
net cash used in financing activities was $169 million in fiscal 2022 and was primarily due to repurchases of our common stock offset by proceeds from the issuance of debt and common stock.

____________________
(1)this table generally excludes amounts already recorded on the balance sheet as current liabilities, certain purchase obligations as discussed below, long term deferred revenue, and amounts related to income tax accruals for uncertain tax positions, since we cannot predict with reasonable reliability the timing of cash settlements to the respective taxing authorities (see part ii, item 8, note 5, "income taxes" in the notes to consolidated financial statements).
purchase orders or contracts for the purchase of supplies and other goods and services are not included in the table above. we are not able to determine the aggregate amount of such purchase orders that represent contractual obligations, as purchase orders may represent authorizations to purchase rather than binding agreements. our purchase orders are based on our current procurement or development needs and are fulfilled by our vendors within short time horizons. we do not have significant agreements for the purchase of supplies or other goods specifying minimum quantities or set prices that exceed our expected requirements for three months. in addition, we have certain software royalty commitments associated with the shipment and licensing of certain products.
the expected timing of payment of the obligations discussed above is estimated based on current information. timing of payments and actual amounts paid may be different depending on the time of receipt of goods or services or changes to agreed-upon amounts for some obligations.
we provide indemnifications of varying scopes and certain guarantees, including limited product warranties. historically, costs related to these warranties and indemnifications have not been significant, but because potential future costs are highly variable, we are unable to estimate the maximum potential impact of these guarantees on our future results of operations.
issuer purchases of equity securities autodesk's stock repurchase programs provide autodesk with the ability to offset the dilution from the issuance of stock under our employee stock plans and reduce shares outstanding over time and has the effect of returning excess cash generated from our business to stockholders. under the share repurchase programs, autodesk may repurchase shares from time to time in open market transactions, privately negotiated transactions, accelerated share repurchase programs, tender offers, or by other means. the share repurchase programs do not have an expiration date and the pace and timing of repurchases will depend on factors such as cash generation from operations, available surplus, the volume of employee stock plan activity, remaining shares available in the authorized pool, cash requirements for acquisitions, economic and market conditions, stock price, and legal and regulatory requirements.
in november 2022, the board of directors authorized the repurchase of $5 billion of the company's common stock, in addition to the shares remaining under previously announced share repurchase programs.
during the three and 12 months ended january 31, 2023, we repurchased 1 million and 5 million shares of our common stock, respectively. at january 31, 2023, 3 million shares and $5 billion remained available for repurchase under the september 2016 and november 2022 repurchase programs approved by the board of director, respectively. the plans do not have a fixed expiration date.  see part ii, item 8, note 12, "stock repurchase program," in the notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion.

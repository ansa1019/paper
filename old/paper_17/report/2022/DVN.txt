property and equipment oil and gas property and equipment devon follows the successful efforts method of accounting for its oil and gas properties. exploration costs, such as exploratory geological and geophysical costs, and costs associated with nonproductive exploratory wells, delay rentals and exploration overhead are charged against earnings as incurred. costs of drilling successful exploratory wells along with acquisition costs and the costs of drilling development wells, including those that are unsuccessful, are capitalized. devon groups its oil and gas properties with a common geological structure or stratigraphic condition ("common operating field") for purposes of computing dd&a, assessing proved property impairments and accounting for asset dispositions. exploratory drilling costs and exploratory-type stratigraphic test wells are initially capitalized, or suspended, pending the determination of proved reserves. if proved reserves are found, drilling costs remain capitalized as proved properties. costs of unsuccessful wells are charged to exploration expense. for exploratory wells that find reserves that cannot be classified as proved when drilling is completed, costs continue to be capitalized as suspended exploratory well costs if there have been sufficient reserves found to justify completion as a producing well and sufficient progress is being made in assessing the reserves and the economic and operating viability of the project. if management determines that future appraisal drilling or development activities are unlikely to occur, associated suspended exploratory well costs are expensed. in some instances, this determination may take longer than one year. devon reviews the status of all suspended exploratory drilling costs quarterly. capitalized costs of proved oil and gas properties are depleted by an equivalent unit-of-production method, converting gas to oil at the ratio of six mcf of gas to one bbl of oil. proved leasehold acquisition costs, less accumulated amortization, are depleted over total proved reserves, which includes proved undeveloped reserves. 61 table of contents index to financial statements devon energy corporation and subsidiaries notes to consolidated financial statements - (continued) capitalized costs of wells and related equipment and facilities, including estimated asset retirement costs, net of estimated salvage values and less accumulated amortization are depreciated over proved developed reserves associated with those capitalized costs. depletion is calculated by applying the dd&a rate
(amortizable base divided by beginning of period proved reserves) to current period production. costs associated with unproved properties are excluded from the depletion calculation until it is determined whether or not proved reserves can be assigned to such properties. devon assesses its unproved properties for impairment annually, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances dictate that the carrying value of those assets may not be recoverable. significant unproved properties are assessed individually. proved properties are assessed for impairment when events or changes in circumstances dictate that the carrying value of those assets may not be recoverable. individual assets are grouped for impairment purposes based on a common operating field. if there is an indication the carrying amount of an asset may not be recovered, the asset is assessed for potential impairment by management through an established process. if, upon review, the sum of the undiscounted pre-tax reserve cash flows is less than the carrying value of the asset, the carrying value is written down to estimated fair value.
because there is usually a lack of quoted market prices for long-lived assets, the fair value of impaired assets is typically determined based on the present values of expected future cash flows using discount rates believed to be consistent with those used by principal market participants or by comparable transactions. the expected future cash flows used for impairment reviews and related fair value calculations are typically based on judgmental assessments of future production volumes, commodity prices, operating costs, and capital investment plans, considering all available information at the date of review. gains or losses are recorded for sales or dispositions of oil and gas properties which constitute an entire common operating field or which result in a significant alteration of the common operating field's dd&a rate. these gains and losses are classified as asset dispositions in the accompanying statements of comprehensive earnings. partial common operating field sales or dispositions deemed not to significantly alter the dd&a rates are generally accounted for as adjustments to capitalized costs with no gain or loss recognized. devon capitalizes interest costs incurred that are attributable to material unproved oil and gas properties and major development projects of oil and gas properties. other property and equipment costs for midstream assets that are in use are depreciated over the assets' estimated useful lives, using the straight-line method. depreciation and amortization of other property and equipment, including corporate and leasehold improvements, are provided using the straight-line method based on estimated useful lives ranging from three to 60
years. interest costs incurred and attributable to major corporate construction projects are also capitalized.
asset retirement obligations devon recognizes liabilities for retirement obligations associated with tangible long-
lived assets, such as producing well sites when there is a legal obligation associated with the retirement of such assets and the amount can be reasonably estimated. the initial measurement of an asset retirement obligation is recorded as a liability at its fair value, with an offsetting asset retirement cost recorded as an increase to the associated property and equipment on the consolidated balance sheet. when the assumptions used to estimate a recorded asset retirement obligation change, a revision is recorded to both the asset retirement obligation and the asset retirement cost. devon's asset retirement obligations also include estimated environmental remediation costs which arise from normal operations and are associated with the retirement of such long-lived assets. the asset retirement cost is depreciated using a systematic and rational method similar to that used for the associated property and equipment.

leases devon establishes right-of-use assets and lease liabilities on the balance sheet for all leases with a term longer than 12 months. devon's right-of-use operating lease assets are for certain leases related to real estate, drilling rigs and other equipment related to the exploration, development and production of oil and gas. devon's right-of-use financing lease assets are related to real estate. certain of devon's lease agreements include variable payments based on usage or rental payments adjusted periodically for inflation. devon's lease agreements do not contain any material residual value guarantees or restrictive covenants.
goodwill goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price of business combinations over the fair value of the net assets acquired and is tested for impairment annually, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances dictate that the carrying value of goodwill may not be recoverable. such test includes a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. if the qualitative assessment determines that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, including goodwill, then a quantitative goodwill impairment test is performed. the quantitative goodwill impairment test requires the fair value of the reporting unit be compared to the carrying value of the reporting unit. if the fair value of the reporting unit is less than the carrying value, an impairment charge will be recognized for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the fair value. the fair value of the reporting unit is estimated based upon market capitalization, comparable transactions of similar companies and premiums paid. devon performed impairment tests of goodwill in the fourth quarters of 2022, 2021 and
2020. no impairment was required as a result of the annual tests in these time periods.
commitments and contingencies liabilities for loss contingencies arising from claims, assessments, litigation or other sources are recorded when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated. liabilities for environmental remediation or restoration claims resulting from allegations of improper operation of assets are recorded when it is probable that obligations have been incurred and the amounts can be reasonably estimated. expenditures related to such environmental matters are expensed or capitalized in accordance with devon's accounting policy for property and equipment.
fair value measurements certain of devon's assets and liabilities are measured at fair value at each reporting date. fair value represents the price that would be received to sell the asset or paid to transfer the liability in an orderly transaction between market participants. this price is commonly referred to as the "exit price." fair value measurements are classified according to a hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs underlying the valuation techniques. this hierarchy consists of three broad levels: • level 1 - inputs consist of unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities and have the highest priority. when available, devon measures fair value using level 1 inputs because they generally provide the most reliable evidence of fair value.
63 table of contents index to financial statements devon energy corporation and subsidiaries notes to consolidated financial statements - (continued) • level 2 - inputs consist of quoted prices that are generally observable for the asset or liability. common examples of level 2 inputs include quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets or quoted prices for identical assets and liabilities in markets not considered to be active. •
level 3 - inputs are not observable from objective sources and have the lowest priority. the most common level 3
fair value measurement is an internally developed cash flow model.
noncontrolling interests noncontrolling interests represent third-party ownership in the net assets of devon's consolidated subsidiaries and are presented as a component of equity. changes in devon's ownership interests in subsidiaries that do not result in deconsolidation are recognized in equity.
2. acquisitions and divestitures wpx merger onjanuary 7, 2021, devon and wpx completed an all-stock merger of equals. wpx was an oil and gas exploration and production company with assets in the delaware basin in texas and new mexico and the williston basin in north dakota. on the closing date of the merger, each share of wpx common stock was automatically converted into the right to receive0.5165of a share of devon common stock. no fractional shares of devon's common stock were issued in the merger, and holders of wpx common stock instead received cash in lieu of fractional shares of devon common stock, if any. based on the closing price of devon's common stock on january 7, 2021, the total value of devon common stock issued to holders of wpx common stock as part of this transaction was approximately $5.4billion. the merger was structured as a tax-free reorganization for u.s. federal income tax purposes.
purchase price allocation the allocation of the total purchase price of wpx to the identifiable assets acquired and the liabilities assumed was finalized at december 31, 2021. the transaction was accounted for using the acquisition method of accounting, with devon being treated as the accounting acquirer. under the acquisition method of accounting, the assets and liabilities of wpx and its subsidiaries were recorded at their respective fair values as of the date of completion of the merger and added to devon's. determining the fair value of the assets and liabilities of wpx required judgment and certain assumptions to be made, the most significant of these being related to the valuation of wpx's oil and gas properties. significant judgments and assumptions included, among other things, estimates of reserve quantities, estimates of future commodity prices, expected development costs, lease operating costs, reserve risk adjustment factors and an estimate of an applicable market participant discount rate that reflected the risk of the underlying cash flow estimates. the inputs and assumptions related to the oil and gas properties were categorized as level 3 in the fair value hierarchy.

acquisitions in september 2022, devon completed its acquisition of producing properties and leasehold interests located in the eagle ford for cash consideration of approximately $1.7billion, net of purchase price adjustments. additionally, in july 2022, devon completed its acquisition of producing properties and leasehold interests located in the williston basin for cash consideration of approximately $830million, net of purchase price adjustments. the total estimated proved reserves associated with these eagle ford and williston basin assets are approximately87mmboe and66mmboe, respectively. each of these acquisitions were accounted for as asset acquisitions as substantially all of the fair value was concentrated in a group of similar assets. each of the acquisitions resulted in the purchase of producing properties and leasehold interests in a defined geographical and geological area and substantially all of the assets have similar risk characteristics.
divestitures - continuing operations in 2021, devon completed the sale of non-core assets in the rockies for proceeds of $9million, net of purchase price adjustments, and recognized a $35million gain related to the sale. devon received $4million in contingent earnout payments related to this transaction in the first quarters of 2023 and 2022. the total estimated proved reserves associated with these divested assets was approximately3mmboe.
divestitures - discontinued operations in the fourth quarter of 2020, devon completed the sale of its barnett shale assets to bkv for proceeds, net of purchase price adjustments, of $490million. the agreement with bkv provides for contingent earnout payments to devon with upside participation beginning at a $2.75henry hub natural gas price or a $50wti oil price.the contingent payment period commenced on january 1, 2021 and has a term of four years.devon received $65million in contingent earnout payments related to this transaction in the first quarters of 2023 and 2022 and could receive up to an additional $130million in contingent earnout payments for the remaining performance periods depending on future commodity prices. the valuation of the future contingent earnout payments included within other current assets and other long-term assets in the december 31, 2022 consolidated balance sheet was $65million and
$88million, respectively. during 2022 and 2021, devon recorded a $42million and $110million increase to the fair value within asset dispositions on the consolidated statements of comprehensive earnings related to these payments.
these values were derived utilizing a monte carlo valuation model and qualify as a level 3 fair value measurement.

4. share-based compensation in 2022, devon's stockholders approved the 2022 plan. the 2022 plan replaces the 2017 plan. from the effective date of the 2022 plan, no further awards may be made under the 2017 plan; however, awards previously granted will continue to be governed by the terms of the respective award documents. the 2022 plan authorizes the grant of nonqualified and incentive stock options, restricted stock awards or units and stock appreciation rights to eligible employees. restricted stock awards or restricted stock units granted under the 2022 plan may be subject to performance-based conditions. the 2022 plan also authorizes the grant of nonqualified stock options, restricted stock awards or units and stock appreciation rights to non-employee directors. to calculate the number of shares that may be granted in awards under the 2022 plan, options and stock appreciation rights representoneshare and other awards represent1.74shares.
the vesting for certain share-based awards was accelerated in 2021 and 2020 in conjunction with the reduction of workforce activities described innote 6and is included in restructuring and transaction costs in the accompanying consolidated statements of comprehensive earnings.

restricted stock awards and units restricted stock awards and units are subject to the terms, conditions, restrictions and limitations, if any, that the compensation committee deems appropriate, including restrictions on continued employment. generally, the service requirement for vesting ranges fromonetofour years. dividends declared during the vesting period with respect to restricted stock awards and units will not be paid until the underlying award vests. devon estimates the fair values of restricted stock awards and units as the closing price of devon's common stock on the grant date of the award, which is expensed over the applicable vesting period.
performance share units performance share units are granted to certain members of devon's management and employees. each unit that vests entitles the recipient to one share of devon common stock. the vesting of these units is based on comparing devon's tsr to the tsr of a predetermined group of peer companies over the specifiedthree-yearperformance period. subject to certain limits, the vesting of units may be betweenzeroand200% of the units granted depending on devon's tsr as compared to the peer group as of the end of the performance period.

at vesting, recipients receive dividend equivalents with respect to the number of units vested. the fair value of each performance share unit is estimated as of the date of grant using a monte carlo simulation with the following assumptions used for all grants made under the plan: (i) a risk-free interest rate based on u.s. treasury rates as of the grant date; (ii) a volatility assumption based on the historical realized price volatility of devon and the designated peer group; and (iii) an estimated ranking of devon among the designated peer group. the fair value of the unit on the date of grant is expensed over the applicable vesting period.the following table presents the assumptions related to performance share units granted.

proved oil and gas and other asset impairments reduced demand from the covid-19 pandemic caused an unprecedented downturn in the price of oil. as a result, devon reduced 2020 planned capital spend by45% in march 2020. with materially lower commodity prices and reduced near-
term investment, devon assessed all of its oil and gas common operating fields for impairment as of march 31, 2020.
for impairment determination, devon historically utilized nymex forward strip prices for the first five years and applied internally generated price forecasts for subsequent years. in response to the covid-19 pandemic, the nymex forward market became highly illiquid as evidenced by materially reduced trading volumes for periods beyond 2021.
therefore, devon supplemented the nymex forward strip prices with price forecasts published by reputable investment banks and reservoir engineering firms to estimate future revenues as of march 31, 2020. for wti, the range of pricing utilized in the first ten years of impairment reserve cash flows was approximately $23to $50, and the weighted average of wti pricing was approximately $39. for henry hub pricing utilized in the first ten years of impairment reserve cash flows, the range was approximately $1.29- $2.63, with a weighted average henry hub price of approximately $1.85. to measure the indicated impairment in the first quarter of 2020, devon used a market-based weighted-average cost of capital of9% to discount the future net cash flows. these inputs are categorized as level
3 in the fair value hierarchy.
devon recognized approximately $2.7billion of proved asset impairments during the first quarter of 2020. these impairments related to the anadarko basin and rockies fields in which the cost basis included acquisitions completed in 2016 and 2015, respectively, when commodity prices were much higher. during 2020, devon recognized approximately $29million of non-oil and gas asset impairments.

table of contents index to financial statements devon energy corporation and subsidiaries notes to consolidated financial statements - (continued)
unprovedimpairments due to the downturn in the commodity price environment and reduced near-term investment as discussed above, devon recognized $152million of unproved impairments in 2020, primarily in the rockies field. in 2022 and 2021, devon allowed certain non-core acreage to expire without plans for development resulting in unproved impairments.

2021 merger integration in conjunction with the merger closing, devon recognized $210million of restructuring expense in 2021 related to employee severance and termination benefits, settlements and curtailments from defined retirement benefits and contract terminations. of these expenses, $66million related to non-cash charges which primarily consisted of settlements and curtailments of defined retirement benefits of $41million and the accelerated vesting of share-
based grants of $21million. additionally, in conjunction primarily with the merger closing, devon recognized
$48million of transaction costs primarily comprised of bank, legal and accounting fees.
prior years' restructurings during 2020, devon sold assets, reduced its workforce and recognized restructuring expenses of $41million. of these expenses recognized in 2020, $11million and $9million resulted from accelerated vesting of share-based grants and settlements and curtailments of defined retirement benefits, respectively.

devon has guaranteed performance through 2026 for a minimum volume commitment associated with assets divested in
2018. in 2022, the purchaser of the assets was able to fully satisfy the $35million performance obligation due in
2022 and repay devon $44million for shortfall payments paid by wpx and devon in 2021 and 2020. due to improved commodity prices, market conditions, and performance by the purchaser of the assets, devon also reduced the estimated liability associated with this performance obligation by $65million in 2022. the effect of these cash collections and liability revisions resulted in a $144million total benefit in 2022.
during 2022, devon paid approximately $20million for humanitarian relief for the ukrainian people and surrounding countries supporting refugees.
during 2022, 2021 and 2020, devon received severance and other non-income tax refunds of $5million, $39million and
$40million, respectively, related to prior periods.

devon and its subsidiaries are subject to u.s. federal income tax as well as income or capital taxes in various state and foreign jurisdictions. devon's tax reserves are related to tax years that may be subject to examinations by the relevant taxing authority. devon is under audit in the u.s. and various foreign jurisdictions as part of its normal course of business.
devon assesses the realizability of its deferred tax assets. if devon concludes that it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized, the asset is reduced by a valuation allowance. numerous judgments and assumptions are inherent in the determination of future taxable income, including factors such as future operating conditions (particularly as related to prevailing oil and gas prices) and changing tax laws.
2022
on august 16, 2022, the ira was signed into law and included various income tax related provisions with effective dates generally beginning in 2023. among the enacted provisions are a15% corporate alternative minimum tax ("camt")
and several new and expanded clean energy credits and incentives. the camt will be assessed on applicable corporations with an average annual adjusted financial statement income that exceeds $1billion for the preceding three consecutive years. devon has made an accounting policy election to not consider the effects of the camt on the realizability of its deferred tax assets, carryforwards and other tax credits and will instead account for any such effects as a period cost when they arise.
2021
prior to 2021, devon maintained a valuation allowance against all u.s. federal deferred tax assets. devon recognized approximately $250million of deferred tax liabilities to account for the merger. the recognition of these deferred tax liabilities caused a decrease to devon's net deferred tax assets and a corresponding decrease to the valuation allowance devon had recognized on its u.s. federal deferred tax assets.
due to significant increases in commodity pricing and projections of future income, in the fourth quarter of 2021, devon reassessed its evaluation of the realizability of deferred tax assets in future years and determined that a u.s. federal valuation allowance was no longer necessary. as such, devon removed its remaining $84million u.s.
federal valuation allowance.
2020
thecoronavirus aid, relief, and economic security act ("cares act") became law on march 27, 2020. the cares act allows net operating losses generated in taxable years beginning after december 31, 2017 and
73
table of contents index to financial statements devon energy corporation and subsidiaries notes to consolidated financial statements - (continued)
beforejanuary 1, 2021 to be carried back five years to offset taxable income and recoup previously paid taxes. as a result, devon carried net operating losses generated in 2019 and 2020 back to 2014 and 2015, respectively, and recorded a $220million current income tax benefit, partially offset by a $107million deferred income tax expense.
the net $113million income tax benefit recorded in 2020 is the result of the higher u.s. federal income tax rate in the carry back periods.
throughout 2019, devon maintained a valuation allowance against certain deferred tax assets, including certain tax credits and state net operating losses. reduced demand from the covid-19 pandemic caused an unprecedented downturn in the commodity price environment in 2020. as a result, devon recorded significant impairments during the first quarter of 2020. devon reassessed its position and recorded a100% valuation allowance against all u.s. federal and state net deferred tax assets and maintained a full valuation allowance position throughout 2020.

during 2022, devon increased its asset retirement obligations by approximately $38million due to asset acquisitions in the eagle ford and williston basin. during this same time period, devon reduced its asset retirement obligations by $35million primarily due to extended retirement dates for oil and gas assets, partially offset by inflation-
driven increases to current settlement costs. during 2021, devon assumed $98million of wpx asset retirement obligations.
17. retirement plans defined contribution plans devon sponsors defined contribution plans covering its employees. such plans include its 401(k) plan and enhanced contribution plan. devon makes matching contributions and additional retirement contributions, with the matching contributions being primarily based upon percentages of annual compensation and years of service. in addition, each plan is subject to regulatory limitations by the u.s. government. devon contributed $37million, $33million and
$33million to these plans in 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively.
defined benefit plans devon has various non-contributory defined benefit pension plans, including qualified plans and nonqualified plans covering eligible employees and former employees meeting certain age and service requirements. benefits under the defined benefit plans have been closed to new employees and effective, as of december 31, 2020, devon's benefits committee approved a freeze of all future benefit accruals under the plans.
benefits are primarily funded from assets held in the plans' trusts.
devon's investment objective for its plans' assets is to achieve stability of the funded status while providing long-term growth of invested capital and income to ensure benefit payments can be funded when required. devon has established certain investment strategies, including target allocation percentages and permitted and prohibited investments, designed to mitigate risks inherent with investing. devon's target allocations for its plan assets are90% fixed income and10% equity. see the following discussion for devon's pension assets by asset class.

equity- devon's equity securities include commingled global equity funds that invest in large, mid and small capitalization stocks across the world's developed and emerging markets and international large cap equity securities. these equity securities can be sold on demand but are not actively traded. the fair values of these securities are based upon the net asset values provided by the investment managers and were $49million and
$67million at december 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.
other- devon's other securities include short-term investment funds that invest both long and short term using a variety of investment strategies. the fair value of these securities is based upon the net asset values provided by investment managers and were $25million and $14million at december 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.
defined postretirement plans devon also has defined benefit postretirement plans that provide benefits for substantially all qualifying retirees. benefit obligations for such plans are estimated based on devon's future cost-sharing intentions. devon's funding policy for the plans is to fund the benefits as they become payable with available cash and cash equivalents.

discount rate- future pension and post-retirement obligations are discounted based on the rate at which obligations could be effectively settled, considering the timing of expected future cash flows related to the plans. this rate is based on high-quality bond yields, after allowing for call and default risk.
expected return on plan assets- this was determined by evaluating input from external consultants and economists, as well as long-term inflation assumptions and consideration of target allocation of investment types.
mortality rate- devon utilized the society of actuaries produced mortality tables.
other assumptions- for measurement of the 2022 benefit obligation for the other postretirement medical plans, a6.6%
annual rate of increase in the per capita cost of covered health care benefits was assumed for 2023. the rate was assumed to decrease annually to an ultimate rate of5% in the year 2029 and remain at that level thereafter.
expected cash flows devon expects benefit plan payments to average approximately $53million a year for the next five years and
$249million total for the five years thereafter. of these payments to be paid in 2023, $15million is expected to be funded from devon's available cash, cash equivalents and other assets.

20. commitments and contingencies devon is party to various legal actions arising in connection with its business. matters that are probable of unfavorable outcome to devon and which can be reasonably estimated are accrued. such accruals are based on information known about the matters, devon's estimates of the outcomes of such matters and its experience in contesting, litigating and settling similar matters. none of the actions are believed by management to likely involve future amounts that would be material to devon's financial position or results of operations after consideration of recorded accruals. actual amounts could differ materially from management's estimates.
royalty matters numerous oil and natural gas producers and related parties, including devon, have been named in various lawsuits alleging royalty underpayments. devon is currently named as a defendant in a number of such lawsuits, including some lawsuits in which the plaintiffs seek to certify classes of similarly situated plaintiffs. among the
89
table of contents index to financial statements devon energy corporation and subsidiaries notes to consolidated financial statements - (continued)
allegations typically asserted in these suits are claims that devon used below-market prices, made improper deductions, paid royalty proceeds in an untimely manner without including required interest, used improper measurement techniques and entered into gas purchase and processing arrangements with affiliates that resulted in underpayment of royalties in connection with oil, natural gas and ngls produced and sold. devon is also involved in governmental agency proceedings and royalty audits and is subject to related contracts and regulatory controls in the ordinary course of business, some that may lead to additional royalty claims.
environmental and climate change matters devon's business is subject to numerous federal, state, tribal and local laws and regulations governing the discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise relating to environmental protection. failure to comply with these laws and regulations may result in the assessment of administrative, civil and criminal fines and penalties, as well as remediation costs. although devon believes that it is in substantial compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations and that continued compliance with existing requirements will not have a material adverse impact on its business, there can be no assurance that this will continue in the future.
beginning in 2013, various parishes in louisiana filed suit against numerous oil and gas companies, including devon, alleging that the companies' operations and activities in certain fields violated the state and local coastal resource management act of 1978, as amended, and caused substantial environmental contamination, subsidence and other environmental damages to land and water bodies located in the coastal zone of louisiana. the plaintiffs'
claims against devon relate primarily to the operations of several of devon's corporate predecessors. the plaintiffs seek, among other things, payment of the costs necessary to clear, re-vegetate and otherwise restore the allegedly impacted areas. although devon cannot predict the ultimate outcome of these matters, devon denies the allegations in these lawsuits and intends to vigorously defend against these claims.
the state of delaware and various municipalities and other governmental and private parties in california have filed legal proceedings against numerous oil and gas companies, including devon, seeking relief to abate alleged impacts of climate change. these proceedings include far-reaching claims for monetary damages and injunctive relief. although devon cannot predict the ultimate outcome of these matters, devon denies the allegations asserted in these lawsuits and intends to vigorously defend against these claims.
other indemnifications and legacy matters pursuant to various sale agreements relating to divested businesses and assets, devon has indemnified various purchasers against liabilities that they may incur with respect to the businesses and assets acquired from devon.
additionally, federal, state and other laws in areas of former operations may require previous operators (including corporate successors of previous operators) to perform or make payments in certain circumstances where the current operator may no longer be able to satisfy the applicable obligation. such obligations may include plugging and abandoning wells, removing production facilities or performing requirements under surface agreements in existence at the time of disposition.
in november 2020, the department of the interior, bureau of safety and environmental enforcement ordered several oil and gas operators, including devon, to perform decommissioning and reclamation activities related to two california offshore oil and gas production platforms and related facilities. the current operator and owner of the platforms contends that it does not have the financial ability to perform these obligations and relinquished the related federal lease in october 2020. in response to the apparent insolvency of the current operator, the government has ordered the former operators and alleged former lease record title owners to decommission the platforms and related facilities. the government contends that an alleged corporate predecessor of devon owned a partial interest in the subject lease and platforms. although devon cannot predict the ultimate outcome of this matter, devon denies any obligation to decommission the subject platforms, has appealed the order, and believes any decommissioning obligation related to the subject platforms should be assumed by others.

table of contents index to financial statements devon energy corporation and subsidiaries notes to consolidated financial statements - (continued)
level 1 fair value measurements cash equivalents- amounts consist primarily of money market investments and the fair value approximates the carrying value.
level 2 fair value measurements commodity derivatives- the fair value of commodity derivatives is estimated using internal discounted cash flow calculations based upon forward curves and data obtained from independent third parties for contracts with similar terms or data obtained from counterparties to the agreements.
debt- devon's debt instruments do not consistently trade actively in an established market. the fair values of its debt are estimated based on rates available for debt with similar terms and maturity when active trading is not available.
level 3 fair value measurements contingent earnout payments- devon has the right to receive contingent consideration related to the barnett and non-core rockies asset divestiture based on future oil and gas prices. these values were derived using a monte carlo valuation model and qualify as a level 3 fair value measurement. for additional information, seenote 2.
22. supplemental information on oil and gas operations (unaudited)
supplemental unaudited information regarding devon's oil and gas activities is presented in this note. all of devon's reserves are located within the u.s.
the supplemental information in the tables below excludes amounts for 2020 related to devon's discontinued operations. for additional information on these discontinued operations, seenote 19.

acquisition costs for 2022 in the table above pertain primarily to the eagle ford and willison basin acquisitions which closed in the third quarter of 2022. acquisition costs for 2021 primarily relate to the merger. development costs in the tables above include additions and revisions to devon's asset retirement obligations.
results of operations the following table includes revenues and expenses associated with devon's oil and gas producing activities. it does not include any allocation of devon's interest costs or general corporate overhead and, therefore, are not necessarily indicative of the contribution to net earnings of devon's oil and gas operations. income tax expense has been calculated by applying statutory income tax rates to oil, gas and ngl sales after deducting costs, including dd&a, and after giving effect to permanent differences.

(1) gas reserves are converted to boe at the rate of six mcf per bbl of oil, based upon the approximate relative energy content of gas and oil. ngl reserves are converted to boe on a one-to-one basis with oil. the conversion rates are not necessarily indicative of the relationship of oil, natural gas and ngl prices.
price revisions reserves increased34mmboe in 2022 primarily due to price increases in the trailing 12 month averages for oil, gas and ngls.

reserves decreased78mmboe in 2020 primarily due to price decreases in the trailing 12 month averages for oil, gas and ngls.
revisions other than price
2022- total revisions other than price (-49mmboe) were driven by higher operating costs across all areas of operation and the revisions to proved undeveloped reserves noted below. these downward revisions were partially offset by upward revisions due to well performance exceeding previous estimates primarily in the delaware basin. in total, after accounting for these compensating factors, we recorded negative revisions across each of our operating areas with the most significant changes being located in the delaware basin (-33mmboe), followed by the powder river basin (-5mmboe) and the anadarko basin (-4mmboe).
2021- total revisions other than price (43mmboe) were primarily due to well performance exceeding previous estimates modestly across all areas of operation (53mmboe) and the removal of proved undeveloped locations as noted below (-10mmboe). the upward revisions were driven by the delaware basin (23mmboe), williston basin (12mmboe) and anadarko basin (12mmboe).
2020- total revisions other than price (55mmboe) were primarily due to well performance exceeding previous estimates (75mmboe) and the removal of proved undeveloped locations as noted below (-20mmboe). the most significant well performance revisions were attributable to the delaware basin (40mmboe) and the anadarko basin (22mmboe).
extensions and discoveries each year, devon's proved reserves extensions and discoveries consist of adding proved undeveloped reserves to locations classified as undeveloped at year-end and adding proved developed reserves from successful development wells drilled on locations outside the areas classified as proved at the previous year-end. therefore, it is not uncommon for devon's total proved extensions and discoveries to differ from the extensions and discoveries for devon's proved undeveloped reserves. furthermore, because annual additions are classified according to reserve determinations made at the previous year-end and because devon operates a multi-basin portfolio with assets at varying stages of maturity, extensions and discoveries for proved developed and proved undeveloped reserves can differ significantly in any particular year.
2022- of the278mmboe of additions from extensions and discoveries,255mmboe were in the delaware basin,7mmboe were in the powder river basin,6mmboe were in eagle ford,5mmboe were in the anadarko basin and5mmboe were in the williston basin.
2021- of the228mmboe of additions from extensions and discoveries,209mmboe were in the delaware basin,8mmboe were in the anadarko basin,6mmboe were in the williston basin,3mmboe were in eagle ford and2mmboe were in the powder river basin.
2020- of the135mmboe of additions from extensions and discoveries,117mmboe were in the delaware basin,8mmboe were in the anadarko basin,5mmboe were in the powder river basin and5mmboe were in eagle ford.

total proved undeveloped reserves increased16% from 2021 to 2022 with the year-end 2022 balance representing22% of total proved reserves. approximately97% of the176mmboe in extensions and discoveries were the result of devon's focus on drilling and development activities in the delaware basin. this continued development in the delaware basin also accounted for more than80% of the127mmboe of proved undeveloped reserves being converted to proved developed reserves in 2022. costs incurred in 2022 to develop and convert devon's proved undeveloped reserves were approximately $866million. of the44mmboe of purchased reserves,51% relate to the williston basin and49% to the eagle ford. proved undeveloped reserves revisions other than price (-39mmboe) were due to changes in previously adopted development plans (-22mmboe) in the delaware basin (-9mmboe), anadarko basin (-7mmboe) and powder river basin (-6mmboe), combined with additional downward revisions (-17mmboe) caused by both continued evaluation of well performance and higher operating costs.

item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations introduction the following discussion and analysis presents management's perspective of our business, financial condition and overall performance. this information is intended to provide investors with an understanding of our past performance, current financial condition and outlook for the future and should be read in conjunction with "item 8. financial statements and supplementary data" of this report.
the following discussion and analyses primarily focus on 2022 and 2021 items and year-to-year comparisons between 2022 and 2021. discussions of 2020 items and year-to-year comparisons between 2021 and 2020 that are not included in this report can be found in "management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations" in part ii, item 7 of our 2021 annual report on form 10-k.
executive overview looking across our 2021 and 2022 performance, the merger has helped us become a leading unconventional oil producer in the u.s., with an asset base underpinned by premium acreage in the economic core of the delaware basin. this strategic combination accelerated our transition to a cash-return business model, including the implementation of a fixed plus variable dividend strategy. in the third quarter of 2022, we acquired additional producing properties and leasehold interests in both the williston basin and eagle ford that are complementary to our existing acreage, offer operational synergies and add high-quality inventory. additionally, our diverse portfolio balances exposure to oil and natural gas prices with access to premium markets to improve realized pricing.
we remain focused on building economic value by executing on our strategic priorities of moderating production growth, emphasizing capital and operational efficiencies, optimizing reinvestment rates to maximize free cash flow, maintaining low leverage, delivering cash returns to our shareholders and pursuing esg excellence. our 2022 performance highlights for these priorities include the following items:
•generated $8.5 billion of operating cash flow in 2022, which is a 74% increase from the prior year.
•2022 oil production averaged 299 mbbls/d, which is a 3% increase from the prior year.
•as of december 31, 2022, completed approximately 65% of our authorized $2.0 billion share repurchase program, with 25.7 million of our common shares repurchased for $1.3 billion, or $50.90 per share, since inception of the plan.
•exited 2022 with $4.5 billion of liquidity, including $1.5 billion of cash.
•including variable dividends, paid dividends of approximately $3.4 billion in 2022 and have declared $579 million of dividends to be paid in the first quarter of 2023, which is inclusive of an 11% increase to our fixed quarterly dividend to $0.20 per share.
•invested approximately $100 million in emissions reduction capital projects in 2022.
we remain committed to capital discipline and delivering the objectives that underpin our current plan. those objectives prioritize value creation through moderated capital investment and production growth, particularly with a view of the volatility in commodity prices, supply chain constraints and the economic uncertainty arising from recent geopolitical events.
commodity prices strengthened in 2021 and continued to strengthen throughout the majority of 2022, which has significantly improved our earnings and cash flow generation. the increase in commodity prices was primarily driven by increased demand resulting from the recovery from the covid-19 pandemic. the military conflict between russia and ukraine and related economic sanctions imposed on russia, as well as opec+ restraining production growth, further exacerbated supply shortages, causing oil index to financial statements prices to increase even more throughout most of 2022. however, oil prices did begin to decline in the fourth quarter of 2022 due to economic uncertainty surrounding inflation and increased interest rates as well as certain geopolitical events.
as presented in the graph at the left, commodity prices are volatile and heavily influence our financial performance and trends. over the last four years, nymex wti oil and nymex henry hub gas prices ranged from average highs of $94.39 per bbl and $6.65 per mmbtu, respectively, to average lows of $39.59 per bbl and $2.08 per mmbtu, respectively.
trends of our annual earnings, operating cash flow, ebitdax and capital expenditures are shown below. the annual earnings chart and cash flow chart present amounts pertaining to devon's continuing operations. "core earnings" and "ebitdax" are financial measures not prepared in accordance with gaap. for a description of these measures, including reconciliations to the comparable gaap measures, see "non-gaap measures" in this item 7.
our earnings in 2020 were negatively impacted by lower commodity prices and deterioration of the macro-economic environment resulting from the unprecedented covid-19 pandemic. earnings improved significantly in 2021 due to commodity prices recovering from the initial covid-19 pandemic as well as the merger closing in january 2021. earnings continued to improve index to financial statements during 2022 as commodity prices continued to strengthen and we executed on our strategic priorities as a company. led by a 73% and 39% increase in henry hub and wti from 2021 to 2022, respectively, our unhedged combined realized price rose 38%. additionally, volumes increased 7% from 2021 to 2022 primarily due to the continued development of assets in the delaware basin and acquisitions in the williston basin and eagle ford that both closed in the third quarter of 2022.
our net earnings in recent years have been significantly impacted by asset impairments and temporary, noncash adjustments to the value of our commodity hedges. net earnings in both 2020 and 2021 included a $0.1 billion hedge valuation loss, net of taxes and 2022 included a $0.5 billion hedge valuation gain, net of taxes. additionally, net earnings in 2020 included $2.2 billion of asset impairments on our proved and unproved properties, net of taxes, due to reduced demand from the covid-19 pandemic. excluding these amounts, our core earnings have been more stable over recent years but continue to be heavily influenced by commodity prices.
like earnings, our operating cash flow is sensitive to volatile commodity prices. we have continued to deliver strong cash flow and ebitdax results primarily due to improved commodity prices and overall market conditions as well as strong operating performance.
we exited 2022 with $4.5 billion of liquidity, comprised of $1.5 billion of cash and $3.0 billion of available credit under our senior credit facility. we currently have $6.4 billion of debt outstanding, of which approximately $250 million is classified as short-term. we currently have approximately 25% and 20% of our oil and gas production hedged, respectively, for 2023. these contracts consist of collars and swaps based off the wti oil benchmark and the henry hub natural gas index. additionally, we have entered into regional basis swaps in an effort to protect price realizations across our portfolio.
as commodity prices and our operating performance strengthen and bolster our financial condition, we have authorized opportunistic repurchases of up to $2.0 billion of our common shares with an expiration date of may 4, 2023. we repurchased approximately 11.7 million shares during 2022 for approximately $718 million, or $61.36 per share. as of december 31, 2022, we have repurchased approximately 25.7 million shares for approximately $1.3 billion, or $50.90 per share, since the inception of the program. additionally, we continue funding our fixed plus variable dividends, which totaled $3.4 billion in 2022. we recently declared a dividend payable in the first quarter of 2023 for $579 million, which includes an 11% increase to our fixed quarterly dividend to $0.20 per share.
business and industry outlook in 2022, devon marked its 51st anniversary in the oil and gas business and its 34th year as a public company. the strength of our portfolio of assets, the success of our 2021 transformational merger with wpx and strong commodity prices led us to generate net earnings of $6 billion in 2022, which was more than double that of 2021. our portfolio was further strengthened in 2022 following the completion of two bolt-on acquisitions in the williston basin and eagle ford that were highly complementary to our existing positions in each basin. both acquisitions were funded with cash on hand, and our balance sheet and financial position remains strong following the acquisitions. we remain committed to continuing our track record of industry leading return of capital to our shareholders, underpinned by low capital reinvestment rates and a disciplined, returns-driven strategy which is designed to be successful through index to financial statements economic cycles. in line with this strategy, we returned over $4 billion of cash to shareholders through fixed and variable cash dividends and share repurchases in 2022.
in 2022, wti oil prices averaged $94.39 per bbl versus $67.86 per bbl in 2021. crude prices experienced significant improvement from the prior year, but volatility remained. current market fundamentals indicate that even though the supply-demand balance for commodities is expected to remain tight due to growing demand and continued discipline by oil producers, market prices for crude oil and natural gas are expected to be lower in 2023 due to ongoing recession fears driven by high inflation levels and rising interest rates. additionally, commodity prices could remain volatile as uncertainty still exists from the impact of sanctioned russian oil in the global market, as well as actions taken by opec+ countries in supporting a balanced global crude supply. henry hub natural gas prices continued to strengthen in 2022, averaging $6.65 per mcf compared to $3.85 per mcf in 2021. natural gas prices rebounded in 2022 due to increased demand, continued capital discipline by producers, high lng prices and infrastructure constraints. looking forward to 2023, natural gas and ngl prices are expected to decline compared to 2022 due to limited lng export capacity coming online, rising u.s. natural gas production and sufficient storage levels. our 2023 cash flow is partly protected from commodity price volatility due to our current hedge position that covers approximately 25% of our anticipated oil volumes and 20% of our anticipated gas volumes. further insulating our cash flow, we continue to examine and, when appropriate, execute attractive regional basis swap hedges to protect price realizations across our portfolio.
we expect to continue our capital-efficiency focus and our steadfast commitment to capital discipline with our 2023 capital program which is expected to maintain our oil production at similar levels as 2022, adjusted for acquisitions. to achieve our 2023 capital program objectives that maximize free cash flow, approximately 60% of our 2023 spend is expected to be allocated to our highest margin u.s. oil play, the delaware basin. we expect to continue to leverage the strengths of our multi-basin strategy and deploy the remainder of our 2023 capital in our other core areas of eagle ford, anadarko basin, powder river basin and williston basin. our 2023 capital is expected to be higher than last year partly due to a full year of planned capital spend on assets acquired during 2022. additionally, the estimated impact of inflation has also been accounted for in our 2023 capital and operating costs forecasts. the currently elevated level of cost inflation could erode our cost efficiencies gained over previous years and pressure our margin in 2023, particularly if commodity prices decline. despite this, we expect to continue generating material amounts of free cash flow at current commodity price levels due to our strategy of spending within cash flow. we expect to mitigate the impact of cost inflation through efficiencies gained from the scale of our operations as well as by leveraging our long-standing relationships with our suppliers.

index to financial statements in 2022, asset dispositions include $42 million related to the re-valuation of contingent earnout payments associated with divested barnett shale assets. 2021 asset dispositions include $110 million related to the re-valuation of contingent earnout payments associated with divested barnett shale assets as well as $39 million related to the sale of non-core assets in the rockies. for additional information, see note 2 in "item 8. financial statements and supplementary data" of this report.
net financing costs decreased due to debt retirements in 2021 which was partially offset by a $30 million gain associated with those retirements. additionally, net financing costs also decreased in 2022 due to an increase in interest income resulting from an increase in interest rates. for additional information, see note 14 in "item 8. financial statements and supplementary data" of this report.
restructuring and transaction costs in 2021 reflect workforce reductions in conjunction with the merger, as well as various transaction costs related to the merger. for additional information, see note 6 in "item 8. financial statements and supplementary data" of this report.

capital expenditures consist primarily of amounts related to our oil and gas exploration and development operations, midstream operations and other corporate activities. our capital investment program is driven by a disciplined allocation process focused on moderating our production growth and maximizing our returns. as such, our capital expenditures for 2022 represent approximately 30% of our operating cash flow.
investment activity during 2022 and 2021, devon received distributions from our investments of $39 million and $35 million, respectively. devon contributed $76 million and $25 million to our investments during 2022 and 2021, respectively. the 2022 contributions primarily related to our investment in matterhorn.
debt activity subsequent to the merger closing, we redeemed $1.2 billion of senior notes in 2021. we also paid $59 million of cash retirement costs related to these redemptions.
repurchases of common stock and shareholder distributions we repurchased 11.7 million shares of common stock for $718 million in 2022 and 14 million shares of common stock for $589 million in 2021 under share repurchase programs authorized by our board of directors. for additional information, see note 18 in "item 8. financial statements and supplementary data" in this report.

noncontrolling interest activity during 2021, we received $4 million of contributions from our noncontrolling interests (primarily in cdm). during 2022 and 2021, we distributed $30 million and $21 million, respectively, to our noncontrolling interests in cdm. in the first quarter of 2021, we paid $24 million to purchase the noncontrolling interest portion of a partnership that wpx had formed to acquire minerals in the delaware basin.
liquidity the business of exploring for, developing and producing oil and natural gas is capital intensive. because oil, natural gas and ngl reserves are a depleting resource, we, like all upstream operators, must continually make capital investments to grow and even sustain production. generally, our capital investments are focused on drilling and completing new wells and maintaining production from existing wells. at opportunistic times, we also acquire operations and properties from other operators or land owners to enhance our existing portfolio of assets.
historically, our primary sources of capital funding and liquidity have been our operating cash flow, cash on hand and asset divestiture proceeds. additionally, we maintain a commercial paper program, supported by our revolving line of credit, which can be accessed as needed to supplement operating cash flow and cash balances. if needed, we can also issue debt and equity securities, including through transactions under our shelf registration statement filed with the sec. we estimate the combination of our sources of capital will continue to be adequate to fund our planned capital requirements, as discussed in this section, as well as execute our cash-return business model.
operating cash flow key inputs into determining our planned capital investment is the amount of cash we hold and operating cash flow we expect to generate over the next one to three or more years. at the end of 2022, we held approximately $1.5 billion of cash. our operating cash flow forecasts are sensitive to many variables and include a measure of uncertainty as actual results may differ from our expectations.
commodity prices - the most uncertain and volatile variables for our operating cash flow are the prices of the oil, gas and ngls we produce and sell. prices are determined primarily by prevailing market conditions. regional and worldwide economic activity, weather and other highly variable factors influence market conditions for these products. these factors, which are difficult to predict, create volatility in prices and are beyond our control.
to mitigate some of the risk inherent in prices, we utilize various derivative financial instruments to protect a portion of our production against downside price risk. the key terms to our oil, gas and ngl derivative financial instruments as of december 31, 2022 are presented in note 3 in "item 8. financial statements and supplementary data" of this report.
index to financial statements further, when considering the current commodity price environment and our current hedge position, we expect to achieve our capital investment priorities. additionally, we remain committed to capital discipline and focused on delivering the objectives that underpin our capital plan for 2023. the currently elevated level of cost inflation could erode our cost efficiencies gained over previous years and pressure our margin in 2023. despite this, we expect to continue generating material amounts of free cash flow at current commodity price levels due to our strategy of spending within cash flow.
operating expenses - commodity prices can also affect our operating cash flow through an indirect effect on operating expenses. significant commodity price decreases can lead to a decrease in drilling and development activities. as a result, the demand and cost for people, services, equipment and materials may also decrease, causing a positive impact on our cash flow as the prices paid for services and equipment decline. however, the inverse is also generally true during periods of rising commodity prices, which is what we experienced in 2022 and 2021. furthermore, the covid-19 pandemic has contributed to disruption and volatility in our supply chain, which has resulted, and may continue to result, in labor shortages, increased costs and delays for pipe and other materials needed for our operations as well as increased costs due to inflation. we expect to mitigate the impact of cost inflation through efficiencies gained from the scale of our operations as well as by leveraging our long-standing relationships with our suppliers.
credit losses - our operating cash flow is also exposed to credit risk in a variety of ways. this includes the credit risk related to customers who purchase our oil, gas and ngl production, the collection of receivables from joint interest owners for their proportionate share of expenditures made on projects we operate and counterparties to our derivative financial contracts. we utilize a variety of mechanisms to limit our exposure to the credit risks of our customers, partners and counterparties. such mechanisms include, under certain conditions, requiring letters of credit, prepayments or collateral postings.
credit availability we have $3.0 billion of available borrowing capacity under our senior credit facility at december 31, 2022. the senior credit facility matures on october 5, 2024, with the option to extend the maturity date by two additional one-year periods subject to lender consent. subsequent to october 5, 2023, the borrowing capacity decreases to $2.8 billion. the senior credit facility supports our $3.0 billion of short-term credit under our commercial paper program. as of december 31, 2022, there were no borrowings under our commercial paper program. see note 14 in "item 8. financial statements and supplementary data" of this report for further discussion.
the senior credit facility contains only one material financial covenant. this covenant requires us to maintain a ratio of total funded debt to total capitalization, as defined in the credit agreement, of no more than 65%. as of december 31, 2022, we were in compliance with this covenant with a 23% debt-to-capitalization ratio.
our access to funds from the senior credit facility is not subject to a specific funding condition requiring the absence of a "material adverse effect". it is not uncommon for credit agreements to include such provisions. in general, these provisions can remove the obligation of the banks to fund the credit line if any condition or event would reasonably be expected to have a material and adverse effect on the borrower's financial condition, operations, properties or business considered as a whole, the borrower's ability to make timely debt payments or the enforceability of material terms of the credit agreement. while our credit agreement includes provisions qualified by material adverse effect as well as a covenant that requires us to report a condition or event having a material adverse effect, the obligation of the banks to fund the senior credit facility is not conditioned on the absence of a material adverse effect.
as market conditions warrant and subject to our contractual restrictions, liquidity position and other factors, we may from time to time seek to repurchase or retire our outstanding debt through cash purchases and/or exchanges for other debt or equity securities in open market transactions, privately negotiated transactions, by tender offer or otherwise. any such cash repurchases by us may be funded by cash on hand or incurring new debt. the amounts involved in any such transactions, individually or in the aggregate, may be material. furthermore, any such repurchases or exchanges may result in our acquiring and retiring a substantial amount of such indebtedness, which would impact the trading liquidity of such indebtedness.
debt ratings we receive debt ratings from the major ratings agencies in the u.s. in determining our debt ratings, the agencies consider a number of qualitative and quantitative items including, but not limited to, commodity pricing levels, our liquidity, asset quality, index to financial statements reserve mix, debt levels, cost structure, planned asset sales and size and scale of our production. our credit rating from standard and poor's financial services is bbb with a stable outlook. our credit rating from fitch is bbb+ with a stable outlook. our credit rating from moody's investor service is baa2 with a stable outlook. any rating downgrades may result in additional letters of credit or cash collateral being posted under certain contractual arrangements.
there are no "rating triggers" in any of our contractual debt obligations that would accelerate scheduled maturities should our debt rating fall below a specified level. however, a downgrade could adversely impact our interest rate on any credit facility borrowings and the ability to economically access debt markets in the future.
fixed plus variable dividend we are committed to a "fixed plus variable" dividend strategy. our board of directors will consider a number of factors when setting the quarterly dividend, if any, including a general target of paying out approximately 10% of operating cash flow through the fixed dividend. our board of directors increased our quarterly fixed dividend rate by 45% to $0.16 per share in february 2022 and again by 13% to $0.18 per share beginning in august 2022. in addition to the fixed quarterly dividend, we may pay a variable dividend up to 50% of our excess free cash flow, which is a non-gaap measure. each quarter's excess free cash flow is computed as operating cash flow (a gaap measure) before balance sheet changes, less capital expenditures and the fixed dividend. the declaration and payment of any future dividend, whether fixed or variable, will remain at the full discretion of our board of directors and will depend on our financial results, cash requirements, future prospects and other factors deemed relevant by the board.
in february 2023, devon announced a cash dividend in the amount of $0.89 per share payable in the first quarter of 2023. the dividend consists of a fixed quarterly dividend in the amount of $130 million (or $0.20 per share) and a variable dividend in the amount of approximately $449 million (or $0.69 per share).
share repurchase program our board of directors has authorized a $2.0 billion share repurchase program that expires on may 4, 2023. through february 10, 2023, we had executed $1.3 billion of the authorized program.
capital expenditures our 2023 capital expenditure budget is expected to be approximately $3.6 billion to $3.8 billion, which is approximately 35% higher than our 2022 capital expenditures. the anticipated increase in capital spending is driven by a full year of planned capital spend on assets acquired in 2022 and general inflation trends.
contractual obligations as of december 31, 2022, our material contractual obligations include debt, interest expense, asset retirement obligations, lease obligations, retained obligations related to our divested canadian business, operational agreements, drilling and facility obligations and various tax obligations. as discussed above, we estimate the combination of our sources of capital will continue to be adequate to fund our short- and long-term contractual obligations. see notes 6, 8, , ,  and 20 in "item 8. financial statements and supplementary data" of this report for further discussion.
contingencies and legal matters for a detailed discussion of contingencies and legal matters, see note 20 in "item 8. financial statements and supplementary data" of this report.
critical accounting estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the u.s. requires us to make estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. actual amounts could differ from these estimates, and changes in these estimates are recorded when known. we consider the following to be our most critical accounting estimates that involve judgment and have reviewed these critical accounting estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors.
index to financial statements oil and gas assets accounting, classification, reserves & valuation successful efforts method of accounting and classification we utilize the successful efforts method of accounting for our oil and natural gas exploration and development activities which requires management's assessment of the proper designation of wells and associated costs as developmental or exploratory. this classification assessment is dependent on the determination and existence of proved reserves, which is a critical estimate discussed in the section below. the classification of developmental and exploratory costs has a direct impact on the amount of costs we initially recognize as exploration expense or capitalize, then subject to dd&a calculations and impairment assessments and valuations.
once a well is drilled, the determination that proved reserves have been discovered may take considerable time and requires both judgment and application of industry experience. development wells are always capitalized. costs associated with drilling an exploratory well are initially capitalized, or suspended, pending a determination as to whether proved reserves have been found. at the end of each quarter, management reviews the status of all suspended exploratory drilling costs to determine whether the costs should continue to remain capitalized or shall be expensed. when making this determination, management considers current activities, near-term plans for additional exploratory or appraisal drilling and the likelihood of reaching a development program. if management determines future development activities and the determination of proved reserves are unlikely to occur, the associated suspended exploratory well costs are recorded as dry hole expense and reported in exploration expense in the consolidated statements of comprehensive earnings. otherwise, the costs of exploratory wells remain capitalized. at december 31, 2022, all suspended well costs have been suspended for less than one year.
similar to the evaluation of suspended exploratory well costs, costs for undeveloped leasehold, for which reserves have not been proven, must also be evaluated for continued capitalization or impairment. at the end of each quarter, management assesses undeveloped leasehold costs for impairment by considering future drilling plans, drilling activity results, commodity price outlooks, planned future sales or expiration of all or a portion of such projects. at december 31, 2022, devon had approximately $777 million of undeveloped leasehold costs. of the remaining undeveloped leasehold costs at december 31, 2022, none is scheduled to expire in 2023.
reserves our estimates of proved and proved developed reserves are a major component of dd&a calculations. additionally, our proved reserves represent the element of these calculations that require the most subjective judgments. estimates of reserves are forecasts based on engineering data, projected future rates of production and the timing of future expenditures. the process of estimating oil, gas and ngl reserves requires substantial judgment, resulting in imprecise determinations, particularly for new discoveries. different reserve engineers may make different estimates of reserve quantities based on the same data. our engineers prepare our reserve estimates. we then subject certain of our reserve estimates to audits performed by a third-party petroleum consulting firm. in 2022, 89% of our proved reserves were subjected to such an audit.
the passage of time provides additional information which may result in revisions to previous estimates to reflect updated information. in the past five years, annual revisions other than price to our proved reserve estimates, which have been both increases and decreases in individual years, have averaged approximately 5% of the previous year's estimate. however, there can be no assurance that more significant revisions will not be necessary in the future. for example, revisions may be driven broadly by economic factors such as significant changes in operating costs, or they may be more focused such as in a given area or reservoir. the data for a given reservoir may change substantially over time as a result of numerous factors, including, but not limited to, additional development activity, evolving production history and continual reassessment of the viability of production under varying economic conditions.
valuation of long-lived assets long-lived assets used in operations, including proved and unproved oil and gas properties, are depreciated and assessed for impairment annually or whenever changes in facts and circumstances indicate a possible significant deterioration in future cash flows is expected to be generated by an asset group. for dd&a calculations and impairment assessments, management groups individual assets based on a judgmental assessment of the lowest level ("common operating field") for which there are identifiable cash flows that are largely independent of the cash flows of other groups of assets. the determination of common operating fields is largely based on geological structural features or stratigraphic condition, which requires judgment. management also considers the nature of index to financial statements production, common infrastructure, common sales points, common processing plants, common regulation and management oversight to make common operating field determinations. these determinations impact the amount of dd&a recognized each period and could impact the determination and measurement of a potential asset impairment.
management evaluates assets for impairment through an established process in which changes to significant assumptions such as prices, volumes and future development plans are reviewed. if, upon review, the sum of the undiscounted pre-tax cash flows is less than the carrying value of the asset group, the carrying value is written down to estimated fair value. because there usually is a lack of quoted market prices for long-lived assets, the fair value of impaired assets is typically determined based on the present values of expected future cash flows using discount rates believed to be consistent with those used by principal market participants. the expected future cash flows used for impairment reviews and related fair value calculations are typically based on judgmental assessments of future production volumes, commodity prices, operating costs and capital investment plans, considering all available information at the date of review. the expected future cash flows used for impairment reviews include future production volumes associated with proved producing and risk-adjusted proved undeveloped reserves, and when needed, probable and possible reserves.
besides the risk-adjusted estimates of reserves and future production volumes, future commodity prices are the largest driver in the variability of undiscounted pre-tax cash flows. for our impairment determinations, we utilize nymex forward strip prices and incorporate internally generated price forecasts along with price forecasts published by reputable investment banks and reservoir engineering firms to estimate our future revenues.
we also estimate and escalate or de-escalate future capital and operating costs by using a method that correlates cost movements to price movements similar to recent history. to measure indicated impairments, we use a market-based weighted-average cost of capital to discount the future net cash flows. changes to any of the reserves or market-based assumptions can significantly affect estimates of undiscounted and discounted pre-tax cash flows and impact the recognition and amount of impairments.
reduced demand from the covid-19 pandemic and management of production levels from opec+ caused wti pricing to decrease more than 60% during the first quarter of 2020. as a result, we reduced our planned 2020 capital investment 45%. with materially lower commodity prices and reduced near-term investment, we assessed all our oil and gas fields for impairment as of march 31, 2020 and recognized proved and unproved impairments totaling $2.8 billion. the impairments relate to our anadarko basin and rockies fields in which our basis included acquisitions completed in 2016 and 2015, respectively, when commodity prices were much higher than the first quarter of 2020.
as a result of the impairments recognized in 2020 and the significant increases in commodity prices during 2021 which sustained through 2022, none of our oil and gas assets were at risk of impairment as of december 31, 2022.
income taxes the amount of income taxes recorded requires interpretations of complex rules and regulations of federal, state, provincial and foreign tax jurisdictions. we recognize current tax expense based on estimated taxable income for the current period and the applicable statutory tax rates. we routinely assess potential uncertain tax positions and, if required, estimate and establish accruals for such amounts. we have recognized deferred tax assets and liabilities for temporary differences, operating losses and other tax carryforwards. we routinely assess our deferred tax assets and reduce such assets by a valuation allowance if we deem it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. due to significant increases in commodity pricing and projections of future income, in the fourth quarter of 2021, devon reassessed its evaluation of the realizability of deferred tax assets in future years and determined that a u.s. federal valuation allowance was no longer necessary. as such, devon removed its remaining u.s. federal valuation allowance.
further, in the event we were to undergo an "ownership change" (as defined in section 382 of the internal revenue code of 1986, as amended), our ability to use net operating losses and tax credits generated prior to the ownership change may be limited. generally, an "ownership change" occurs if one or more shareholders, each of whom owns five percent or more in value of a corporation's stock, increase their aggregate percentage ownership by more than 50% over the lowest percentage of stock owned by those shareholders at any time during the preceding three-year period. based on currently available information, we do not believe an ownership change occurred during 2022 for devon, but the merger did cause an ownership change for wpx and increased the likelihood devon could experience an ownership change over the next year. see note 8 in "item 8. financial statements and supplementary data" in this report for further discussion regarding our net operating losses and tax credits available to be carried forward and used in future years. devon continues to maintain valuation allowances for certain state and foreign deferred tax assets.
index to financial statements on august 16, 2022, the ira was signed into law and included various income tax related provisions with an effective date beginning in 2023. among the enacted provisions are a 15% corporate alternative minimum tax ("camt") and several new and expanded clean energy credits and incentives. the camt will be assessed on applicable corporations with an average annual adjusted financial statement income that exceeds $1 billion for the preceding three consecutive years. the company continues to assess the potential impact of the camt, and material incremental cash tax could be incurred depending on actual operating results as well as future u.s. treasury guidance.
purchase accounting periodically we acquire assets and assume liabilities in transactions accounted for as business combinations, such as the merger with wpx. in connection with the merger in 2021, as the accounting acquirer, we allocated the $5.4 billion of purchase price consideration to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on estimated fair values as of the date of the merger.
we made a number of assumptions in estimating the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the merger. the most significant assumptions related to the estimated fair values of proved and unproved oil and gas properties. since sufficient market data was not available regarding the fair values of proved and unproved oil and gas properties, we prepared estimates and engaged third-party valuation experts. significant judgments and assumptions were inherent in these estimates and included, among other things, estimates of reserve quantities, estimates of future commodity prices, expected development costs, lease operating costs, reserve risk adjustment factors and an estimate of an applicable market participant discount rate that reflected the risk of the underlying cash flow estimates.
estimated fair values ascribed to assets acquired can have a significant impact on future results of operations presented in devon's financial statements. a higher fair value ascribed to a property results in higher dd&a expense, which results in lower net earnings. fair values are based on estimates of future commodity prices, reserve quantities, development costs and operating costs. in the event that future commodity prices or reserve quantities are lower than those used as inputs to determine estimates of acquisition date fair values, the likelihood increases that certain costs may be determined to not be recoverable.
in addition to the fair value of proved and unproved oil and gas properties, other fair value assessments for the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the merger related to debt, the equity method investment in catalyst and out-of-market contract liabilities. the fair value of the assumed wpx publicly traded debt was based on available third-party quoted prices. we prepared estimates and engaged third-party valuation experts to assist in the valuation of the equity method investment in catalyst. significant judgments and assumptions inherent in this estimate included projected catalyst cash flows, comparable companies cash flow multiples and an estimate of an applicable market participant discount rate. the fair value of assumed out-of-market contract assets and liabilities associated with longer-term marketing, gathering, processing and transportation contracts included significant judgments and assumptions related to determining the market rates, estimates of future reserves and production associated with the respective contracts and applying an applicable market participant discount rate.
non-gaap measures core earnings we make reference to "core earnings (loss) attributable to devon" and "core earnings (loss) per share attributable to devon" in "overview of 2022 results" in this item 7 that are not required by or presented in accordance with gaap. these non-gaap measures are not alternatives to gaap measures and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results reported under gaap. core earnings (loss) attributable to devon, as well as the per share amount, represent net earnings (loss) excluding certain noncash and other items that are typically excluded by securities analysts in their published estimates of our quarterly financial results. for more information on the results of discontinued operations for our barnett shale assets, see note 19 in "item 8. financial statements and supplementary data" in this report. our non-gaap measures are typically used as a quarterly performance measure. amounts excluded for 2022 relate to asset dispositions, noncash asset impairments (including unproved asset impairments), deferred tax asset valuation allowance and fair value changes in derivative financial instruments.
amounts excluded for 2021 relate to asset dispositions, noncash asset impairments (including unproved asset impairments), deferred tax asset valuation allowance, changes in tax legislation, fair value changes in derivative financial instruments, restructuring and transaction costs associated with the workforce reductions in 2021 and costs associated with the early retirement of debt.
index to financial statements amounts excluded for 2020 relate to asset dispositions, noncash asset impairments (including unproved asset impairments), deferred tax asset valuation allowance, fair value changes in derivative financial instruments and foreign currency, change in tax legislation and restructuring and transaction costs associated with the workforce reductions in 2020.
we believe these non-gaap measures facilitate comparisons of our performance to earnings estimates published by securities analysts. we also believe these non-gaap measures can facilitate comparisons of our performance between periods and to the performance of our peers.
below are reconciliations of our core earnings and earnings per share to their comparable gaap measures.

ebitdax and field-level cash margin to assess the performance of our assets, we use ebitdax and field-level cash margin. we compute ebitdax as net earnings from continuing operations before income tax expense; financing costs, net; exploration expenses; dd&a; asset impairments; asset disposition gains and losses; non-cash share-based compensation; non-cash valuation changes for derivatives and financial instruments; restructuring and transaction costs; accretion on discounted liabilities; and other items not related to our normal operations. field-level cash margin is computed as oil, gas and ngl revenues less production expenses. production expenses consist of lease operating, gathering, processing and transportation expenses, as well as production and property taxes.
we exclude financing costs from ebitdax to assess our operating results without regard to our financing methods or capital structure. exploration expenses and asset disposition gains and losses are excluded from ebitdax because they generally are not indicators of operating efficiency for a given reporting period. dd&a and impairments are excluded from ebitdax because capital expenditures are evaluated at the time capital costs are incurred. we exclude share-based compensation, valuation changes, restructuring and transaction costs, accretion on discounted liabilities and other items from ebitdax because they are not considered a measure of asset operating performance.
we believe ebitdax and field-level cash margin provide information useful in assessing our operating and financial performance across periods. ebitdax and field-level cash margin as defined by devon may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies and should be considered in conjunction with net earnings from continuing operations.

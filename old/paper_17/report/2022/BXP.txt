item 1a. risk factors.
set forth below are the risks that we believe are material to our investors and they should be carefully considered. throughout this section, we refer to the equity and debt securities of both bxp and bplp as our "securities," and the investors who own securities of bxp, bplp or both, as our "securityholders." these risks are not all of the risks we face and other factors not presently known to us or that we currently believe are immaterial may also affect our business if they occur. this section contains forward-looking statements. you should refer to the explanation of the qualifications and limitations on forward-looking statements beginning on page 58.
risks related to our business and operations our performance depends upon the economic conditions, particularly the supply and demand characteristics, of our markets-boston, los angeles, new york, san francisco, seattle and washington, dc.
substantially all of our revenue is derived from properties located in six markets: boston, los angeles, new york, san francisco, seattle and washington, dc. a downturn in the economies of these markets, or the impact that a downturn in the overall national economy may have upon these economies, could result in reduced demand for office space and/or a reduction in rents. because our portfolio consists primarily of premier workplace buildings (as compared to a more diversified real estate portfolio), a decrease in demand for workplaces in turn could adversely affect our results of operations. additionally, there are submarkets within our markets that are dependent upon a limited number of industries. for example, in our washington, dc market, we focus on leasing our properties to governmental agencies and contractors, as well as legal firms. a reduction in spending by the federal government could result in reduced demand for office space and adversely affect our results of operations. in addition, in our new york market, we have historically leased properties to financial, legal and other professional firms. a significant downturn in one or more of these sectors could adversely affect our results of operations.
in addition, a significant economic downturn over a period of time could result in an event or change in circumstances that results in an "other than temporary" impairment in the value of our properties or our investments in unconsolidated joint ventures. an "other than temporary" impairment loss is recognized if the carrying amount of the asset (1) is not recoverable over its expected holding period and (2) exceeds its fair value. there can be no assurance that we will not take charges in the future related to the impairment of our assets or investments. any future impairment could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations in the period in which the charge is taken.
enhanced market and economic volatility due to adverse economic and geopolitical conditions, health crises or dislocations in the credit markets could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and ability to pay dividends and/or distributions.
our business may be adversely affected by market and economic volatility experienced by the u.s. and global economies, the real estate industry as a whole and/or the local economic conditions in the markets in which our properties are located. such adverse economic and geopolitical conditions may be due to, among other issues, prolonged labor market challenges impacting the recruitment and retention of talent, continued inflation, high interest rates, and volatility in the public equity and debt markets, and international economic and other conditions, including pandemics, geopolitical instability and other conditions beyond our control. these current conditions, or similar conditions existing in the future, may adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition and ability to pay dividends and/or distributions as a result of the following, among other potential consequences:
•the financial condition of our clients may be adversely affected, which may result in client defaults under leases due to bankruptcy, lack of liquidity, lack of funding, operational failures or for other reasons;
•significant job losses and/or a sustained shift away from collective in-person work environments or relocations away from the markets in which we operate may occur, which could decrease overall demand for workplaces in the regions in which we operate and cause market rental rates and property values to be negatively impacted;
•tightening labor market conditions may adversely affect our ability to recruit and retain talent, which may result in lack of business continuity and increased costs to address the labor challenges;
•our ability to borrow on terms and conditions that we find acceptable, or at all, may be limited, which could reduce our ability to pursue acquisition and development opportunities and refinance existing debt, reduce our returns from our acquisition and development activities and increase our future interest expense;
•reduced values of our properties may limit our ability to dispose of assets at attractive prices or to obtain debt financing secured by our properties and may reduce the availability of unsecured loans;
•the value and liquidity of our short-term investments and cash deposits could be reduced as a result of a deterioration of the financial condition of the institutions that hold our cash deposits or the institutions or assets in which we have made short-term investments, a dislocation of the markets for our short-term investments, increased volatility in market rates for such investments or other factors;
•one or more lenders under our line of credit could refuse to fund their financing commitment to us or could fail and we may not be able to replace the financing commitment of any such lenders on favorable terms, or at all; and
•to the extent we enter into derivative financial instruments, one or more counterparties to our derivative financial instruments could default on their obligations to us, or could fail, increasing the risk that we may not realize the benefits of these instruments.
the outbreak of highly infectious or contagious diseases, such as covid-19, could adversely impact or cause disruption to our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and liquidity and that of our clients.
public health crises such as pandemics or similar outbreaks could adversely impact our business. for example, there remains uncertainty regarding the degree to which the covid-19 pandemic may continue to adversely impact our business, financial condition, results of operation, cash flows and liquidity, and that of our clients. these uncertainties include the emergence of new virus strains, availability of effective treatment, possible future governmental responses and the severity and duration of the indirect economic and social impacts of the covid 19-pandemic, such as economic downturn, supply chain disruptions, labor market disruptions, inflation, increasing interest rates, dislocation and volatility in capital markets, job losses and potential longer-term changes in consumer and client behavior. these uncertainties make it impossible for us to predict with certainty the overall impact that covid-19 will have on us and our clients prospectively. factors related to covid-19 that have had, or could have, a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition, include:
•changes made by companies in response to the covid-19 pandemic that could lead to a sustained shift away from collective in-person work environments or relocations away from the markets in which we operate, either of which could adversely affect the overall demand for workplaces in the regions in which we operate;
•reduced economic activity and/or supply chain disruptions or delays in delivery of products, services or other materials necessary for our clients that impact our clients' businesses, financial condition or liquidity has caused, and may continue to cause, one or more of our clients to be unable to meet their obligations to us, including their ability to make timely rental payments, in full or at all, or to otherwise seek modifications of such obligations, including rent concessions, deferrals or abatements, or to declare bankruptcy. any one or more of the foregoing could:
•reduce our cash flows,
•adversely impact our ability to finance, refinance or sell a property,
•adversely impact our ability to continue paying distributions to our equityholders at current levels, or at all, and
•result in additional legal and other costs to enforce our rights, collect rent and/or re-lease the space occupied by the distressed client;
•the degree to which our clients' businesses have been, and continue to be, negatively impacted has required, and may in the future require, us to write-off a client's accrued rent balance and this could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and liquidity;
•new laws, governmental policies, and similar actions, including legal restrictions on prosecutions, could adversely impact public safety and thereby adversely affect (1) the desirability of clients to lease space in our properties or markets, and (2) businesses' office re-population plans;
•the impact of covid-19 could result in an event or change in circumstances that results in an impairment in the value of our properties or our investments in unconsolidated joint ventures, and any such impairment could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations in the periods in which the charge is taken;
•we may be unable to restructure or amend leases with certain of our clients on terms favorable to us or at all;
•the impact and validity of interpretations of lease provisions and applicable laws related to claims by clients regarding their obligations to pay rent as a result of covid-19, and any adverse court rulings or decisions interpreting these provisions and laws, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and liquidity;
•the impact of governmental and business travel limitations and restrictions have had, and may in the future have, a material adverse effect on the operator of our hotel property, which negatively impacts our revenues, and may result in sustained decreased demand for hotel stays;
•the extent of labor shortages, disruptions in the supply chains, inflation impacting costs of materials, delays in permitting or inspections, and other factors could result in our failure to meet the development milestones set forth in any applicable lease agreement, which could provide the client the right to terminate its lease or entitle the client to monetary damages, delay the commencement or completion of construction and our anticipated lease-up plans for a development/redevelopment project or our overall development pipeline, including recognizing revenue for new leases, that may cause returns on investment to be less than projected, and/or increase the costs of construction of new or existing projects, any of which could adversely affect our investment returns, profitability and/or our future growth; and
•the potential that business interruption, loss of rental income and/or other associated expenses related to our operations will not be covered in whole or in part by our insurance policies, which may increase unreimbursed liabilities.
our success depends on key personnel whose continued service is not guaranteed.
we depend on the efforts of key personnel, particularly owen d. thomas, chief executive officer, douglas t. linde, president, and raymond a. ritchey, senior executive vice president. among the reasons that messrs. thomas, linde and ritchey are important to our success is that each has a national reputation, which attracts business and investment opportunities and assists us in negotiations with lenders, joint venture partners and other investors. if we lost their services, our relationships with lenders, potential clients and industry personnel could diminish.
our chief financial officer and regional managers also have strong reputations. their reputations aid us in identifying opportunities, having opportunities brought to us, and negotiating with clients and build-to-suit prospects. while we believe that we could find replacements for these key personnel, the loss of their services could materially and adversely affect our operations because of diminished relationships with lenders, prospective clients and industry personnel.
risks related to real estate our performance and value are subject to risks associated with our real estate assets and with the real estate industry.
our economic performance and the value of our real estate assets, and consequently the value of our securities, are subject to the risk that if our properties do not generate revenues sufficient to meet our operating expenses, including debt service and capital expenditures, our cash flow and ability to pay distributions to our securityholders will be adversely affected. the following factors, among others, may adversely affect the income generated by our properties:
•downturns in the national, regional and local economic conditions (particularly increases in unemployment);
•changes in client preferences and space utilization from full-time, collective in-person work environments to hybrid or remote work models, which could decrease overall demand for workplaces and cause market rental rates and property values to be negatively impacted;
•competition from other office, life sciences, hotel, retail and residential buildings;
•local real estate market conditions, such as oversupply or reduction in demand for office, life sciences, hotel, retail or residential space;
•changes in interest rates and availability of financing;
•vacancies, changes in market rental rates and the need to periodically repair, renovate and re-let space;
•delays in completion of development and redevelopment projects due to supply chain disruptions and labor shortages;
•increased costs to maintain, renovate and develop our properties related to inflation;
•changes in space utilization by our clients due to technology, economic conditions and business culture;
•increased operating costs, including insurance expense, utilities, real estate taxes, state and local taxes and heightened security costs;
•civil disturbances, earthquakes and other natural disasters or terrorist acts or acts of war which may result in uninsured or underinsured losses or decrease the desirability to our clients in impacted locations;
•significant expenditures associated with each investment, such as debt service payments, real estate taxes (including reassessments and changes in tax laws), insurance and maintenance costs which are generally not reduced when circumstances cause a reduction in revenues from a property;
•declines in the financial condition of our clients and our ability to collect rents from our clients; and
•decreases in the underlying value of our real estate.
we face potential adverse effects from major clients' bankruptcies or insolvencies.
the bankruptcy or insolvency of a major client may adversely affect the income produced by our properties. our clients could file for bankruptcy protection or become insolvent in the future. we cannot evict a client solely because of its bankruptcy. on the other hand, a bankrupt client may reject and terminate its lease with us. in such case, our claim against the bankrupt client for unpaid and future rent would be subject to a statutory cap that might be substantially less than the remaining rent actually owed under the lease, and, even so, our claim for unpaid rent would likely not be paid in full. this shortfall could adversely affect our cash flow and results of operations.
our properties face significant competition.
we face significant competition from developers, owners and managers of office, life sciences and residential properties and other commercial real estate, including sublease space available from our clients. substantially all of our properties face competition from similar properties in the same market. this competition may affect our ability to attract and retain clients and may reduce the rents we are able to charge. these competing properties may have vacancy rates higher than our properties, which may result in their owners being willing to lease available space at lower rates than the space in our properties.
we face potential difficulties or delays renewing leases or re-leasing space.
we derive most of our income from rent received from our clients. if a client experiences a downturn in its business or other types of financial distress, it may be unable to make timely rental payments. also, when our clients decide not to renew their leases, renew for less space or terminate early, we may not be able to re-let the space or there could be a substantial delay in re-letting the space. even if clients decide to renew or lease new space, the terms of renewals or new leases, including the cost of required renovations or concessions to clients, may be less favorable to us than current lease terms. as a result, our cash flow could decrease and our ability to make distributions to our securityholders could be adversely affected.
our actual costs to develop properties may exceed our budgeted costs.
we intend to continue to develop and substantially renovate office, life sciences, retail and residential properties. our current and future development and construction activities may be exposed to the following risks:
•we may be unable to proceed with the development of properties because we cannot obtain financing on favorable terms or at all;
•we may incur construction costs for a development project that exceed our original estimates due to increased materials, labor, leasing or other costs, increases in interest rates, or supply chain disruptions, any of which could make completion of the project less profitable because market rents may not increase sufficiently to compensate for the increase in construction costs;
•we may be unable to obtain, or face delays in obtaining, required zoning, land-use, building, occupancy, and other governmental permits and authorizations, which could result in increased costs and could require us to abandon our activities entirely with respect to a project;
•we may abandon development opportunities after we begin to explore them and, as a result, we may lose deposits or fail to recover expenses already incurred;
•we may expend funds on and devote management's time to projects that we do not complete;
•we may be unable to complete construction and/or leasing of a property on schedule or at all; and
•we may suspend development projects after construction has begun due to changes in economic conditions or other factors, and this may result in the write-off of costs, payment of additional costs or increases in overall costs when the development project is restarted.
investment returns from our developed properties may be less than anticipated.
our developed properties may be exposed to the following risks:
•we may lease developed properties at rental rates that are less than projected, or at a slower pace than projected, at the time we decide to undertake the development;
•operating expenses and construction costs may be greater than projected at the time of development, resulting in our investment being less profitable than we expected; and
•occupancy rates and rents at newly developed properties may fluctuate depending on a number of factors, including market and economic conditions, and may result in our investments being less profitable than we expected or not profitable at all.
we face risks associated with the development of mixed-use commercial properties.
we operate, are currently developing, and may in the future develop, properties either alone or through joint ventures with other persons that are known as "mixed-use" developments. this means that in addition to the development of office space, the project may also include space for residential, retail, hotel or other commercial purposes. we have less experience in developing and managing non-office and non-retail real estate than we do with office real estate. as a result, if a development project includes a non-office or non-retail use, we may seek to develop that component ourselves, sell the rights to that component to a third-party developer with experience in that use or we may seek to partner with such a developer. if we do not sell the rights or partner with such a developer, or if we choose to develop the other component ourselves, we would be exposed not only to those risks typically associated with the development of commercial real estate generally, but also to specific risks associated with the development and ownership of non-office and non-retail real estate. in addition, even if we sell the rights to develop the other component or elect to participate in the development through a joint venture, we may be exposed to the risks associated with the failure of the other party to complete the development as expected. these include the risk that the other party would default on its obligations necessitating that we complete the other component ourselves (including providing any necessary financing). in the case of residential properties, these risks include competition for prospective residents from other operators whose properties may be perceived to offer a better location or better amenities or whose rent may be perceived as a better value given the quality, location and amenities that the resident seeks. we will also compete against condominiums and single-family homes that are for sale or rent. because we have less experience with residential properties than with office and retail properties, we expect to retain third parties to manage our residential properties. if we decide to not sell or participate in a joint venture and instead hire a third party manager, we would be dependent on them and their key personnel who provide services to us and we may not find a suitable replacement if the management agreement is terminated, or if key personnel leave or otherwise become unavailable to us.
our use of joint ventures and participation in the strategic capital program may limit our control over and flexibility with jointly owned investments and other assets we may wish to acquire.
in appropriate circumstances, we intend to acquire and recapitalize or develop, as applicable, properties in joint ventures with other persons or entities. we currently have joint ventures that are and are not consolidated within our financial statements. our participation in joint ventures subjects us to risks, including but not limited to, the following risks that:
•our joint venture partners may have different objectives than we have regarding the appropriate timing and terms of any sale or refinancing of a property, its operation or, if applicable, the commencement of development activities, and a dispute with any of our joint venture partners could lead to the sale of a partner's ownership interest in the venture or the property at a time or price that we do not find attractive;
•some of our joint ventures are subject to debt and, depending on credit market conditions, the refinancing of such debt may require equity capital calls;
•our joint venture partners may be structured differently than us for tax purposes and this could create conflicts of interest, including with respect to our compliance with the reit requirements, and our reit status could be jeopardized if any of our joint ventures do not operate in compliance with reit requirements;
•our joint venture partners may have competing interests in our markets that could create conflicts of interest;
•our joint venture partners may default on their obligations, which could necessitate that we fulfill their obligations ourselves;
•our joint ventures may be unable to repay any amounts that we may loan to them;
•our joint venture agreements may contain provisions limiting the liquidity of our interest for sale or sale of the entire asset;
•as the general partner or managing member of a joint venture, we could be generally liable under applicable law for the debts and obligations of the venture, and we may not be entitled to contribution or indemnification from our partners;
•our joint venture agreements may contain provisions that allow our partners to remove us as the general partner or managing member for cause, and this could result in liability for us to our partners under the governing agreement of the joint venture;
•we may need our partner(s)' approval to take certain actions and, therefore, we may be unable to cause a joint venture to implement decisions that we consider advisable; and
•with respect to our participation in the co-investment program, we could lose opportunities to pursue properties that are within the program's target investment criteria alone or with other partners with whom the terms of the joint venture and/or our returns could be more favorable to us.
we face the risk that third parties will not be able to service or repay loans we make to them.
from time to time, we have loaned and in the future may loan funds to (1) a third-party buyer to facilitate the sale of an asset by us to such third party, or (2) a third party in connection with the formation of a joint venture to acquire and/or develop a property. making these loans subjects us to the following risks, each of which could have a material adverse effect on our cash flow, results of operations and/or financial condition:
•the third party may be unable to make full and timely payments of interest and principal on the loan when due;
•if the third-party buyer to whom we provide seller financing does not manage the property well, or the property otherwise fails to meet financial projections, performs poorly or declines in value, then the buyer may not have the funds or ability to raise new debt with which to make required payments of interest and principal to us;
•if we loan funds to a joint venture, and the joint venture is unable to make required payments of interest or principal, or both, or there are disagreements with respect to the repayment of the loan or other matters, then we could have a resulting dispute with our partner(s), and such a dispute could harm our relationship(s) with our partner(s) and cause delays in developing or selling the property or the failure to properly manage the property; and
•if we loan funds to a joint venture and the joint venture is unable to make required payments of interest and principal, or both, then we may exercise remedies available to us in the joint venture agreement that could allow us to increase our ownership interest or our control over major decisions, or both, which could result in an unconsolidated joint venture becoming consolidated with our financial statement; doing so could require us to reallocate the purchase price among the various asset and liability components and this could result in material changes to our reported results of operations and financial condition.
we face risks associated with property acquisitions.
we have acquired in the past and intend to continue to pursue the acquisition of properties and portfolios of properties, including large portfolios that could increase our size and result in alterations to our capital structure. our acquisition activities and their success are subject to the following risks:
•even if we enter into an acquisition agreement for a property, we may be unable to complete that acquisition after making a non-refundable deposit and incurring certain other acquisition-related costs;
•we may be unable to obtain or assume financing for acquisitions on favorable terms or at all;
•acquired properties may fail to perform as expected;
•the actual costs of repositioning, redeveloping or maintaining acquired properties may be greater than our estimates;
•the acquisition agreement will likely contain conditions to closing, including completion of due diligence investigations to our satisfaction or other conditions that are not within our control, which may not be satisfied;
•acquired properties may be located in new markets, either within or outside the united states, where we may face risks associated with a lack of market knowledge or understanding of the local economy, lack of business relationships in the area, costs associated with opening a new regional office and unfamiliarity with local governmental and permitting procedures;
•we may acquire real estate through the acquisition of the ownership entity subjecting us to the risks of that entity; and
•we may be unable to quickly and efficiently integrate new acquisitions, particularly acquisitions of portfolios of properties, into our existing operations, and this could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.
we have acquired in the past and in the future may acquire properties through the acquisition of first mortgage or mezzanine debt. investments in these loans must be carefully structured to ensure that bxp continues to satisfy the various asset and income requirements applicable to reits. if we fail to structure any such acquisition properly, bxp could fail to qualify as a reit. in addition, acquisitions of first mortgage or mezzanine loans subject us to the risks associated with the borrower's default, including potential bankruptcy, and there may be significant delays and costs associated with the process of foreclosure on collateral securing or supporting these investments.  there can be no assurance that we would recover any or all of our investment in the event of such a default or bankruptcy.
we have acquired in the past and in the future may acquire properties or portfolios of properties through tax deferred contribution transactions in exchange for partnership interests in bplp. this acquisition structure has the effect, among others, of reducing the amount of tax depreciation we can deduct over the tax life of the acquired properties, and typically requires that we agree to protect the contributors' ability to defer recognition of taxable gain through restrictions on our ability to dispose of the acquired properties and/or the allocation of partnership debt to the contributors to maintain their tax bases. these restrictions could limit our ability to sell an asset at a time, or on terms, that would be favorable absent such restrictions.
acquired properties may expose us to unknown liability.
we may acquire properties or invest in joint ventures that own properties subject to liabilities and without any recourse, or with only limited recourse, against the prior owners or other third parties with respect to unknown liabilities. as a result, if a liability were asserted against us based upon ownership of those properties, we might have to pay substantial sums to settle or contest it, which could adversely affect our results of operations and cash flow. unknown liabilities with respect to acquired properties might include:
•liabilities for clean-up of undisclosed environmental contamination;
•claims by clients, vendors or other persons against the former owners of the properties;
•liabilities incurred in the ordinary course of business; and
•claims for indemnification by general partners, directors, officers and others indemnified by the former owners of the properties.
competition for acquisitions may result in increased prices for properties.
we plan to continue to acquire properties as we are presented with attractive opportunities. we may face competition for acquisition opportunities with other investors, and this competition may adversely affect us by subjecting us to the following risks:
•we may be unable to acquire a desired property because of competition from other well-capitalized real estate investors, including publicly traded and private reits, institutional investment funds and other real estate investors; and
•even if we are able to acquire a desired property, competition from other real estate investors may significantly increase the purchase price.
we may have difficulty selling our properties, which may limit our flexibility.
properties like the ones that we own could be difficult to sell. this may limit our ability to change our portfolio promptly in response to changes in economic or other conditions. in addition, federal tax laws limit our ability to sell properties and this may affect our ability to sell properties without adversely affecting returns to our securityholders. these restrictions reduce our ability to respond to changes in the performance of our investments and could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.
our ability to dispose of some of our properties is constrained by their tax attributes. properties that we developed and have owned for a significant period of time or that we acquired through tax deferred contribution transactions in exchange for partnership interests in bplp often have low tax bases. furthermore, as a reit, bxp may be subject to a 100% "prohibited transactions" tax on the gain from dispositions of property if bxp is deemed to hold the property primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of business, unless the disposition qualifies under a safe harbor exception for properties that have been held for at least two years and with respect to which certain other requirements are met. the potential application of the prohibited transactions tax could cause us to forego potential dispositions of property or other opportunities that might otherwise be attractive to us, or to undertake such dispositions or other opportunities through a taxable reit subsidiary, which would generally result in income taxes being incurred. if we dispose of these properties outright in taxable transactions, we may be required to distribute a significant amount of the taxable gain to our securityholders under the requirements of the code applicable to reits, which in turn would impact our future cash flow and may increase our leverage. in some cases, without incurring additional costs we may be restricted from disposing of properties contributed in exchange for our partnership interests under tax protection agreements with contributors. to dispose of low basis or tax-protected properties efficiently we from time to time use like-kind exchanges, which are intended to qualify for non-recognition of taxable gain, but can be difficult to consummate and result in the property for which the disposed assets are exchanged inheriting their low tax bases and other tax attributes (including tax protection covenants).
because we own a hotel property, we face the risks associated with the hospitality industry.
the following factors, among others, are common to the hotel industry, and may reduce the receipts generated by our hotel property:
•our hotel property competes for guests with other hotels, a number of which may have greater marketing and financial resources than our hotel-operating business partners;
•if there is an increase in operating costs resulting from inflation and other factors, our hotel-operating business partners may not be able to offset such increase by increasing room rates;
•our hotel property is subject to the fluctuating and seasonal demands of business travelers and tourism; and
•our hotel property is subject to general and local economic and social conditions that may affect demand for travel in general, including war and terrorism.
in addition, because our hotel property is located in cambridge, massachusetts, it is subject to the cambridge market's fluctuations in demand, increases in operating costs and increased competition from additions in supply.
failure to comply with federal government contractor requirements could result in substantial costs and loss of substantial revenue.
as of december 31, 2022, the u.s. government was one of our largest clients by square feet. we are subject to compliance with a wide variety of complex legal requirements because we are a federal government contractor. these laws regulate how we conduct business, require us to administer various compliance programs and require us to impose compliance responsibilities on some of our contractors. our failure to comply with these laws could subject us to fines, penalties and damages, cause us to be in default of our leases and other contracts with the federal government and bar us from entering into future leases and other contracts with the federal government. there can be no assurance that these costs and loss of revenue will not have a material adverse effect on our properties, operations or business.
changes in rent control or rent stabilization and eviction laws and regulations in our markets could have a material adverse effect on our residential portfolio's results of operations and residential property values.
various state and local governments have enacted, and may continue to enact, rent control or rent stabilization laws and regulations or take other actions that could limit our ability to raise rents or charge certain fees, such as pet fees or application fees. we have seen a recent increase in governments considering, or being urged by advocacy groups to consider, rent control or rent stabilization laws and regulations. depending on the extent and terms of future enactments of rent control or rent stabilization laws and regulations, as well as any lawsuits against us arising from such issues, such future enactments could have a material adverse effect on our residential portfolio's results of operations and the value of our residential properties.
state and local governments may also make changes to eviction and other tenants' rights laws and regulations that could have a material adverse effect on our residential portfolio's results of operations and the value of our residential properties. if we are restricted from re-leasing apartment units due to the inability to evict delinquent residents, our results of operations and property values for our residential properties may be adversely affected.
we did not obtain new owner's title insurance policies in connection with properties acquired during bxp's initial public offering.
we acquired many of our properties from our predecessors at the completion of bxp's initial public offering in june 1997. before we acquired these properties, each of them was insured by a title insurance policy. we did not obtain new owner's title insurance policies in connection with the acquisition of these properties. to the extent we have financed properties after acquiring them in connection with the initial public offering, we have obtained new title insurance policies, however, the amount of these policies may be less than the current or future value of the applicable properties. nevertheless, because in many instances we acquired these properties indirectly by acquiring ownership of the entity that owned the property and those owners remain in existence as our subsidiaries, some of these title insurance policies may continue to benefit us. many of these title insurance policies may be for amounts less than the current or future values of the applicable properties. if there was a title defect related to any of these properties, or to any of the properties acquired at the time of the initial public offering of bxp, that is no longer covered by a title insurance policy, we could lose both our capital invested in and our anticipated profits from such property. we have obtained title insurance policies for all properties that we have acquired after the initial public offering of bxp, however, these policies may be for amounts less than the current or future values of the applicable properties.
some potential losses are not covered by insurance.
our property insurance program per occurrence limits are $1.0 billion for our portfolio insurance program, including coverage for acts of terrorism other than nuclear, biological, chemical or radiological terrorism ("terrorism coverage"). we also carry $1.35 billion of property insurance in excess of the $1.0 billion of coverage in our property insurance program for 601 lexington avenue, new york, new york, consisting of $750 million of property and terrorism coverage in excess of our property insurance program and $600 million of terrorism coverage only in excess of the $1.75 billion of coverage.
certain properties, including the general motors building located at 767 fifth avenue in new york, new york ("767 fifth avenue"), are currently insured in separate insurance programs. the property insurance program per occurrence limits for 767 fifth avenue are $1.625 billion, including terrorism coverage. we also currently carry nuclear, biological, chemical and radiological terrorism insurance coverage for acts of terrorism certified under the federal terrorism risk insurance act (as amended, "tria") ("nbcr coverage"), which is provided by ixp as a direct insurer, for the properties in our portfolio, including 767 fifth avenue, but excluding certain other properties owned in joint ventures with third parties or which we manage. the per occurrence limit for nbcr coverage is $1.0 billion. under tria, after the payment of the required deductible and coinsurance, the nbcr coverage provided by ixp is backstopped by the federal government if the aggregate industry insured losses resulting from a certified act of terrorism exceed a "program trigger." the program trigger is $200 million, the coinsurance is 20% and the deductible is 20% of the premiums earned by the insurer for the year prior to a claim. if the federal government pays out for a loss under tria, it is mandatory that the federal government recoup the full amount of the loss from insurers offering tria coverage after the payment of the loss pursuant to a formula in tria. we may elect to terminate the nbcr coverage if the federal government seeks recoupment for losses paid under tria, if tria is not extended after its expiration on december 31, 2027, if there is a change in our portfolio or for any other reason. we intend to continue to monitor the scope, nature and cost of available terrorism insurance.
we also currently carry earthquake insurance on our properties located in areas known to be subject to earthquakes. specifically, we currently carry earthquake insurance which covers our san francisco and los angeles regions with a $330 million per occurrence limit, and a $330 million annual aggregate limit, $30 million of which is provided by ixp, as a direct insurer. this insurance is subject to a deductible in the amount of 3% of the value of the affected property. in addition, we currently carry earthquake insurance which covers our seattle region with a $110 million per occurrence limit, and a $110 million annual aggregate limit. this insurance is subject to a deductible in the amount of 2% of the value of the affected property. the amount of our earthquake insurance coverage may not be sufficient to cover losses from earthquakes. in addition, the amount of earthquake coverage could impact our ability to finance properties subject to earthquake risk. we may discontinue earthquake insurance or change the structure of our earthquake insurance program on some or all of our properties in the future if the premiums exceed our estimation of the value of the coverage.
ixp, a captive insurance company which is a wholly-owned subsidiary, acts as a direct insurer with respect to a portion of our earthquake insurance coverage for our greater san francisco and los angeles properties and our nbcr coverage. insofar as we own ixp, we are responsible for its liquidity and capital resources, and the accounts of ixp are part of our consolidated financial statements. in particular, if a loss occurs which is covered by our nbcr coverage but is less than the applicable program trigger under tria, ixp would be responsible for the full amount of the loss without any backstop by the federal government. ixp would also be responsible for any recoupment charges by the federal government in the event losses are paid out and its insurance policy is maintained after the payout by the federal government. if we experience a loss and ixp is required to pay under its insurance policy, we would ultimately record the loss to the extent of the required payment. therefore, insurance coverage provided by ixp should not be considered as the equivalent of third-party insurance, but rather as a modified form of self-insurance. in addition, bplp has issued a guarantee to cover liabilities of ixp in the amount of $20.0 million.
we continue to monitor the state of the insurance market in general, and the scope and costs of coverage for acts of terrorism, earthquakes and pandemics, in particular, but we cannot anticipate what coverage will be available on commercially reasonable terms in future policy years. there are other types of losses, such as from wars, for which we cannot obtain insurance at all or at a reasonable cost. with respect to such losses and losses from acts of terrorism, earthquakes, pandemics or other catastrophic events, if we experience a loss that is uninsured or that exceeds policy limits, we could lose the capital invested in the damaged properties, as well as the anticipated future revenues from those properties. depending on the specific circumstances of each affected property, it is possible that we could be liable for mortgage indebtedness or other obligations related to the property. any such loss could materially and adversely affect our business and financial condition and results of operations.
actual or threatened terrorist attacks may adversely affect our ability to generate revenues and the value of our properties.
we have significant investments in large metropolitan markets that have been or may be in the future the targets of actual or threatened terrorism attacks, including boston, los angeles, new york, san francisco, seattle and washington, dc. as a result, some clients in these markets may choose to relocate their businesses to other markets or to lower-profile office buildings within these markets that may be perceived to be less likely targets of future terrorist activity. this could result in an overall decrease in the demand for office space in these markets generally or in our properties in particular, which could increase vacancies in our properties or necessitate that we lease our properties on less favorable terms or both. in addition, future terrorist attacks in these markets could directly or indirectly damage our properties, both physically and financially, or cause losses that materially exceed our insurance coverage. as a result of the foregoing, our ability to generate revenues and the value of our properties could decline materially. see also "-some potential losses are not covered by insurance."
we face risks associated with our clients and contractual counterparties being designated "prohibited persons" by the office of foreign assets control.
pursuant to executive order 13224 and other laws, the office of foreign assets control of the united states department of the treasury ("ofac") maintains a list of persons designated as terrorists or who are otherwise blocked or banned ("prohibited persons"). ofac regulations and other laws prohibit conducting business or engaging in transactions with prohibited persons (the "ofac requirements"). certain of our loan and other agreements require us to comply with ofac requirements. we have established a compliance program whereby clients and others with whom we conduct business are checked against the ofac list of prohibited persons prior to entering into any agreement and on a periodic basis thereafter. our leases and other agreements, in general, require the other party to comply with ofac requirements. if a client or other party with whom we contract is placed on the ofac list we may be required by the ofac requirements to terminate the lease or other agreement. any such termination could result in a loss of revenue or a damage claim by the other party that the termination was wrongful.
we face risks associated with climate change and severe weather events, as well as the regulatory efforts intended to reduce the effects of climate change.
the physical effects of climate change could have a material adverse effect on our properties, operations and business. for example, many of our properties are located along the east and west coasts, particularly those in the central business districts of boston, los angeles, new york, san francisco, seattle and washington, dc. to the extent climate change causes changes in weather patterns, our markets could experience increases in storm intensity, extreme temperatures, rising sea-levels and/or drought. over time, these conditions could result in declining demand for office space in our buildings or increased costs associated with infrastructure-related remediation projects. climate change may also have indirect effects on our business by making property insurance unavailable or by increasing the cost of (i) property insurance on terms we find acceptable, (ii) real estate taxes or other assessments, (iii) energy and (iv) property maintenance. in addition, we face transition risks related to federal, state and local legislation and regulations that are being implemented or are under consideration to mitigate the effects of climate change. the costs of complying with evolving regulatory requirements, including ghg emissions regulations and policies, could negatively impact our financial results.
for additional discussion regarding our approach to climate resiliency and our continued commitment to transparent reporting of esg performance indicators, see "item 1. business-business and growth strategies-environmental, social and governance (esg)" and our annual esg report available on our website at http://www.bxp.com under the heading "commitment."
potential liability for environmental contamination could result in substantial costs.
under federal, state and local environmental laws, ordinances and regulations, we may be required to investigate and clean up the effects of releases of hazardous or toxic substances or petroleum products at or migrating from our properties simply because of our current or past ownership or operation of the real estate. if unidentified environmental problems arise, we may have to make substantial payments, which could adversely affect our cash flow and our ability to make distributions to our securityholders, because: as owner or operator we may have to pay for property damage and for investigation and clean-up costs incurred in connection with the contamination; the law typically imposes clean-up responsibility and liability regardless of whether the owner or operator knew of or caused the contamination; even if more than one person may be responsible for the contamination, each person who shares legal liability under the environmental laws may be held responsible for all of the clean-up costs; and governmental entities and third parties may sue the owner or operator of a contaminated site for damages and costs.
these costs could be substantial and in extreme cases could exceed the amount of our insurance or the value of the contaminated property. we currently carry environmental insurance in an amount and subject to deductibles that we believe are commercially reasonable. specifically, we carry a pollution legal liability policy with a $20 million limit per incident and a policy aggregate limit of $40 million. the presence or migration of hazardous or toxic substances or petroleum products or the failure to properly remediate contamination may give rise to third-party claims for bodily injury, property damage and/or response costs and may materially and adversely affect our ability to borrow against, sell or rent an affected property. in addition, applicable environmental laws create liens on contaminated sites in favor of the government for damages and costs it incurs in connection with contamination. changes in laws, regulations and practices and their implementation increasing the potential liability for environmental conditions existing at our properties, or increasing the restrictions on the handling, storage or discharge of hazardous or toxic substances or petroleum products or other actions may result in significant unanticipated expenditures.
environmental laws also govern the presence, maintenance and removal of asbestos and other building materials. for example, laws require that owners or operators of buildings containing asbestos:
•properly manage and maintain the asbestos;
•notify and train those who may come into contact with asbestos; and
•undertake special precautions, including removal or other abatement, if asbestos would be disturbed during renovation or demolition of a building.
such laws may impose fines and penalties on building owners or operators who fail to comply with these requirements and may allow third parties to seek recovery from owners or operators for personal injury associated with exposure to asbestos fibers.
some of our properties are located in urban and previously developed areas where fill or current or historic industrial uses of the areas have caused site contamination. it is our policy to retain independent environmental consultants to conduct or update phase i environmental site assessments and asbestos surveys with respect to our acquisition of properties. these assessments generally include a visual inspection of the properties and the surrounding areas, an examination of current and historical uses of the properties and the surrounding areas and a review of relevant state, federal and historical documents, but do not involve invasive techniques such as soil and ground water sampling. where appropriate, on a property-by-property basis, our practice is to have these consultants conduct additional testing, including sampling for asbestos, for lead and other contaminants in drinking water and, for soil and/or groundwater contamination where underground storage tanks are or were located or where other past site usage creates a potential environmental problem. even though these environmental assessments are conducted, there is still the risk that:
•the environmental assessments and updates did not identify or properly address all potential environmental liabilities;
•a prior owner created a material environmental condition that is not known to us or the independent consultants preparing the assessments;
•new environmental liabilities have developed since the environmental assessments were conducted; and
•future uses or conditions such as changes in applicable environmental laws and regulations could result in environmental liability for us.
inquiries about indoor air quality may necessitate special investigation and, depending on the results, remediation beyond our regular indoor air quality testing and maintenance programs. indoor air quality issues can stem from inadequate ventilation, chemical contaminants from indoor or outdoor sources, and biological contaminants such as molds, pollen, viruses and bacteria. indoor exposure to chemical or biological contaminants can be alleged to be connected to allergic reactions or other adverse health effects. if these conditions were to occur at one of our properties, we may be subject to third-party claims for personal injury, or may need to undertake a targeted remediation program, including without limitation, special cleaning measures and steps to increase indoor ventilation rates and eliminate sources of contaminants. such remediation programs could be costly, necessitate the temporary relocation of some or all of the property's clients or require rehabilitation of the affected property.
compliance or failure to comply with the americans with disabilities act or other safety regulations and requirements could result in substantial costs.
the americans with disabilities act generally requires that certain buildings, including office buildings, residential buildings and hotels, be made accessible to disabled persons. noncompliance could result in the imposition of fines by the federal government or the award of damages to private litigants. if, under the americans with disabilities act, we are required to make substantial alterations and capital expenditures in one or more of our properties, including the removal of access barriers, it could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations, as well as the amount of cash available for distribution to our securityholders.
our properties are subject to various federal, state and local regulatory requirements, such as state and local fire and life safety requirements. if we fail to comply with these requirements, we could incur fines or private damage awards. we do not know whether existing requirements will change or whether compliance with future requirements will require significant unanticipated expenditures that will affect our cash flow and results of operations.
any future international activities will be subject to special risks and we may not be able to effectively manage our international business.
we have underwritten, and in the future may acquire, properties, portfolios of properties or interests in real estate-related entities on a strategic or selective basis in international markets that are new to us. if we acquire properties or platforms located in these markets, we will face risks associated with a lack of market knowledge and understanding of the local economy, forging new business relationships in the area and unfamiliarity with local laws and government and permitting procedures. in addition, our international operations will be subject to the usual risks of doing business abroad such as possible revisions in tax treaties or other laws and regulations, including those governing the taxation of our international income, restrictions on the transfer of funds and uncertainty over terrorist activities. we cannot predict the likelihood that any of these developments may occur. further, we may in the future enter into agreements with non-u.s. entities that are governed by the laws of, and are subject to dispute resolution in the courts of, another country or region. we cannot accurately predict whether such a forum would provide us with an effective and efficient means of resolving disputes that may arise.
investments in international markets may also subject us to risks associated with funding increasing headcount, integrating new offices, and establishing effective controls and procedures to regulate the operations of new offices and to monitor compliance with u.s. laws and regulations such as the foreign corrupt practices act and similar foreign laws and regulations, such as the u.k. bribery act.
we may be subject to risks from potential fluctuations in exchange rates between the u.s. dollar and the currencies of the other countries in which we invest.
if we invest in countries where the u.s. dollar is not the national currency, we will be subject to international currency risks from the potential fluctuations in exchange rates between the u.s. dollar and the currencies of those other countries. a significant depreciation in the value of the currency of one or more countries where we have a significant investment may materially affect our results of operations. we may attempt to mitigate any such effects by borrowing in the currency of the country in which we are investing and, under certain circumstances, by hedging exchange rate fluctuations; however, access to capital may be more restricted, or unavailable on favorable terms or at all, in certain locations. for leases denominated in international currencies, we may use derivative financial instruments to manage the international currency exchange risk. we cannot assure you, however, that our efforts will successfully neutralize all international currency risks.
risks related to our indebtedness and financing an increase in interest rates would increase our interest costs on variable rate debt and could adversely impact our ability to refinance existing debt or sell assets on favorable terms or at all.
as of february 21, 2023, we had $1.2 billion outstanding indebtedness, excluding our unconsolidated joint ventures, that bears interest at a variable rate, and we may incur more indebtedness in the future. interest rates increased throughout 2022, and if interest rates continue to increase, then so would the interest costs on our unhedged variable rate debt, which could adversely affect our cash flow and our ability to pay principal and interest on our debt and our ability to make distributions to our securityholders. further, rising interest rates could limit our ability to refinance existing debt when it matures or significantly increase our future interest expense. from time to time, we enter into interest rate swap agreements and other interest rate hedging contracts, including swaps, caps and floors. while these agreements are intended to lessen the impact of rising interest rates on us, they also expose us to the risk that the other parties to the agreements will not perform, we could incur significant costs associated with the settlement of the agreements, the agreements will be unenforceable and the underlying transactions will fail to qualify as highly-effective cash flow hedges under guidance included in asc 815 "derivatives and hedging." in addition, an increase in interest rates could decrease the amounts third-parties are willing to pay for our assets, thereby limiting our ability to change our portfolio promptly in response to changes in economic or other conditions.
covenants in our debt agreements could adversely affect our financial condition.
the mortgages on our properties contain customary covenants such as those that limit our ability, without the prior consent of the lender, to further mortgage the applicable property or to modify or discontinue insurance coverage. our unsecured credit facility, unsecured debt securities and certain secured loans contain customary restrictions, requirements and other limitations on our ability to incur indebtedness, including total debt to asset ratios, secured debt to total asset ratios, debt service coverage ratios and minimum ratios of unencumbered assets to unsecured debt, which we must maintain. our continued ability to borrow under our credit facilities is subject to compliance with our financial and other covenants. in addition, our failure to comply with such covenants could cause a default under the applicable debt agreement, and we may then be required to repay such debt with capital from other sources. under those circumstances, other sources of capital may not be available to us, or be available only on unattractive terms. additionally, in the future our ability to satisfy current or prospective lenders' insurance requirements may be adversely affected if lenders generally insist upon greater insurance coverage against acts of terrorism or losses resulting from earthquakes than is available to us in the marketplace or on commercially reasonable terms.
we rely on debt financing, including borrowings under our unsecured credit facility, issuances of unsecured debt securities and debt secured by individual properties, to finance our existing portfolio, our acquisition and development activities and for working capital. if we are unable to obtain debt financing from these or other sources, or to refinance existing indebtedness upon maturity, our financial condition and results of operations would likely be adversely affected. if we breach covenants in our debt agreements, the lenders can declare a default and, if the debt is secured, can take possession of the property securing the defaulted loan. in addition, our unsecured debt agreements contain specific cross-default provisions with respect to specified other indebtedness, giving the unsecured lenders the right to declare a default if we are in default under other loans in some circumstances. defaults under our debt agreements could materially and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.
we face risks associated with the use of debt to fund acquisitions and developments, including refinancing risk.
we are subject to the risks normally associated with debt financing, including the risk that our cash flow will be insufficient to meet required payments of principal and interest. we anticipate that only a small portion of the principal of our debt will be repaid prior to maturity. therefore, we are likely to need to refinance at least a portion of our outstanding debt as it matures. there is a risk that we may not be able to refinance existing debt or that the terms of any refinancing will not be as favorable as the terms of our existing debt. if principal payments due at maturity cannot be refinanced, extended or repaid with proceeds from other sources, such as new equity capital, our cash flow may not be sufficient to repay all maturing debt in years when significant "balloon" payments come due. in addition, we may rely on debt to fund a portion of our new investments such as our acquisition and development activity. there is a risk that we may be unable to finance these activities on favorable terms or at all. these conditions, which increase the cost and reduce the availability of debt, may continue or worsen in the future.
we have had and may in the future have agreements with a number of limited partners of bplp who contributed properties in exchange for partnership interests that require bplp to maintain for specified periods of time secured debt on certain of our assets and/or allocate partnership debt to such limited partners to enable them to continue to defer recognition of their taxable gain with respect to the contributed property. these tax protection and debt allocation agreements may restrict our ability to repay or refinance debt.  as of december 31, 2022, we had one tax protection agreement that could restrict our ability to repay or finance debt.
our degree of leverage could limit our ability to obtain additional financing or affect the market price of our equity and debt securities.
as of february 21, 2023, our consolidated debt was approximately $14.7 billion (excluding unconsolidated joint venture debt).
the following table presents consolidated market capitalization as well as the corresponding ratios of consolidated debt to consolidated market capitalization (dollars and shares / units in thousands):

our degree of leverage could affect our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, development or other general corporate purposes. our senior unsecured debt is currently rated investment grade by two major rating agencies. however, there can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain this rating, and in the event our senior debt is downgraded from its current rating, we would likely incur higher borrowing costs and/or difficulty in obtaining additional financing. our degree of leverage could also make us more vulnerable to a downturn in business or the economy generally. there is a risk that changes in our debt to market capitalization ratio, which is in part a function of bxp's stock price, or bplp's ratio of indebtedness to other measures of asset value used by financial analysts may have an adverse effect on the market price of our equity or debt securities.
the discontinuation of libor and the replacement of libor with an alternative reference rate may adversely affect our borrowing costs and could impact our business and results of operations.
we expect that all libor settings relevant to us will cease to be published or will no longer be representative after june 30, 2023. the discontinuation of libor will not affect our ability to borrow or maintain already outstanding borrowings or hedging transactions, but if our contracts indexed to libor are converted to sofr, the differences between libor and sofr, plus the recommended spread adjustment, could result in interest or hedging costs that are higher than if libor remained available. additionally, although sofr is the recommended replacement rate, it is also possible that lenders may instead choose alternative replacements that may differ from libor in ways similar to sofr or in ways that would result in higher interest or hedging costs for us. it is not yet possible to predict the magnitude of libor's end on our borrowing costs given the remaining uncertainty about which rates will replace libor. as of december 31, 2022, each of the agreements governing our variable rate debt either have been transitioned to sofr or provide for the replacement of libor if it becomes unavailable during the term of such agreement.
we face risks associated with short-term liquid investments.
we may invest cash balances in a variety of short-term investments that are intended to preserve principal value and maintain a high degree of liquidity while providing current income. from time to time, these investments may include (either directly or indirectly):
•direct obligations issued by the u.s. treasury;
•obligations issued or guaranteed by the u.s. government or its agencies;
•taxable municipal securities;
•obligations (including certificates of deposit) of banks and thrifts;
•commercial paper and other instruments consisting of short-term u.s. dollar denominated obligations issued by corporations and banks;
•repurchase agreements collateralized by corporate and asset-backed obligations;
•both registered and unregistered money market funds; and
•other highly rated short-term securities.
investments in these securities and funds are not insured against loss of principal. under certain circumstances we may be required to redeem all or part of our investment, and our right to redeem some or all of our investment may be delayed or suspended. in addition, there is no guarantee that our investments in these securities or funds will be redeemable at par value. a decline in the value of our investment or a delay or suspension of our right to redeem may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition.
risks related to our organization and structure conflicts of interest exist with holders of interests in bplp.
sales of properties and repayment of related indebtedness will have different effects on holders of interests in bplp than on bxp's stockholders.
some holders of interests in bplp could incur adverse tax consequences upon the sale of certain of our properties and on the repayment of related debt which differ from the tax consequences to bxp and its stockholders. consequently, such holders of partnership interests in bplp may have different objectives regarding the appropriate pricing and timing of any such sale or repayment of debt. while bxp has exclusive authority under the limited partnership agreement of bplp to determine when to refinance or repay debt or whether, when, and on what terms to sell a property, subject, in the case of certain properties, to the contractual commitments described below, any such decision would require the approval of bxp's board of directors. while the board of directors has a policy with respect to these matters directors and executive officers could exercise their influence in a manner inconsistent with the interests of some, or a majority, of bxp's stockholders, including in a manner which could prevent completion of a sale of a property or the repayment of indebtedness.
agreement not to sell some properties.
we have had and may have in the future agreements with the contributors of properties that we have acquired in exchange for partnership interests in bplp pursuant to which we have agreed not to sell or otherwise transfer the properties, prior to specified dates, in any transaction that would trigger taxable income to the contributors. in addition, we are responsible for the reimbursement of certain tax-related costs to the prior owners if the subject properties are sold in a taxable sale. in general, our obligations to the prior owners are limited in time and only apply to actual damages suffered.
also, bplp has had and may have in the future agreements providing prior owners of properties with the right to guarantee specific amounts of indebtedness and, in the event that the specific indebtedness they guarantee is repaid or reduced, additional and/or substitute indebtedness. these agreements may hinder actions that bplp may otherwise desire to take to repay or refinance guaranteed indebtedness because doing so would require bplp to make payments to the prior owners if bplp violates these agreements.
limits on changes in control may discourage takeover attempts beneficial to stockholders.
provisions in bxp's charter and bylaws, bxp's shareholder rights agreement and the limited partnership agreement of bplp, as well as provisions of the code and delaware corporate law, may:
•delay or prevent a change of control over bxp or a tender offer, even if such action might be beneficial to bxp's stockholders; and
•limit bxp's stockholders' opportunity to receive a potential premium for their shares of common stock over then-prevailing market prices.
stock ownership limit to facilitate maintenance of bxp's qualification as a reit and to otherwise address concerns relating to concentration of stock ownership, bxp's charter generally prohibits ownership, directly, indirectly or beneficially, by any single stockholder of more than 6.6% of the number of outstanding shares of any class or series of its common stock. we refer to this limitation as the "ownership limit." bxp's board of directors may waive, in its sole discretion, or modify the ownership limit with respect to one or more persons if it is satisfied that ownership in excess of this limit will not jeopardize bxp's status as a reit for federal income tax purposes. in addition, under bxp's charter, each of mortimer b. zuckerman and the respective families and affiliates of mortimer b. zuckerman and edward h. linde, as well as, in general, pension plans and mutual funds, may actually and beneficially own up to 15% of the number of outstanding shares of any class or series of bxp's equity common stock. shares owned in violation of the ownership limit will be subject to the loss of rights to distributions and voting and other penalties. the ownership limit may have the effect of inhibiting or impeding a change in control.
bplp's partnership agreement bxp has agreed in the limited partnership agreement of bplp not to engage in specified extraordinary transactions, including, among others, business combinations, unless limited partners of bplp other than bxp receive, or have the opportunity to receive, either (1) the same consideration for their partnership interests as holders of bxp common stock in the transaction or (2) limited partnership units that, among other things, would entitle the holders, upon redemption of these units, to receive shares of common equity of a publicly traded company or the same consideration as holders of bxp common stock received in the transaction. if these limited partners would not receive such consideration, we cannot engage in the transaction unless limited partners holding at least 75% of the common units of limited partnership interest, other than those held by bxp or its affiliates, consent to the transaction. in addition, bxp has agreed in the limited partnership agreement of bplp that it will not complete specified extraordinary transactions, including among others, business combinations, in which bxp receive the approval of its common stockholders unless (1) limited partners holding at least 75% of the common units of limited partnership interest, other than those held by bxp or its affiliates, consent to the transaction or (2) the limited partners of bplp are also allowed to vote and the transaction would have been approved had these limited partners been able to vote as common stockholders on the transaction. therefore, if bxp's common stockholders approve a specified extraordinary transaction, the partnership agreement requires the following before it can complete the transaction:
•holders of partnership interests in bplp, including bxp, must vote on the matter;
•bxp must vote its partnership interests in the same proportion as its stockholders voted on the transaction; and
•the result of the vote of holders of partnership interests in bplp must be such that had such vote been a vote of stockholders, the business combination would have been approved.
with respect to specified extraordinary transactions, bxp has agreed in bplp's partnership agreement to use its commercially reasonable efforts to structure such a transaction to avoid causing its limited partners to recognize gain for federal income tax purposes by virtue of the occurrence of or their participation in such a transaction.
as a result of these provisions, a potential acquirer may be deterred from making an acquisition proposal, and bxp may be prohibited by contract from engaging in a proposed extraordinary transaction, including a proposed business combination, even though bxp stockholders approve of the transaction.
we may change our policies without obtaining the approval of our stockholders.
our operating and financial policies, including our policies with respect to acquisitions of real estate, growth, operations, indebtedness, capitalization and dividends, are exclusively determined by bxp's board of directors. accordingly, our securityholders do not control these policies.
risks related to bxp's status as a reit failure to qualify as a reit would cause bxp to be taxed as a corporation, which would substantially reduce funds available for payment of dividends.
if bxp fails to qualify as a reit for federal income tax purposes, it will be taxed as a corporation unless certain relief provisions apply. we believe that bxp is organized and qualified as a reit and intends to operate in a manner that will allow bxp to continue to qualify as a reit. however, we cannot assure you that bxp is qualified as such, or that it will remain qualified as such in the future. this is because qualification as a reit involves the application of highly technical and complex provisions of the code as to which there are only limited judicial and administrative interpretations and involves the determination of facts and circumstances not entirely within our control. future legislation, new regulations, administrative interpretations or court decisions may significantly change the tax laws or the application of the tax laws with respect to qualification as a reit for federal income tax purposes or the federal income tax consequences of such qualification.
in addition, we currently hold certain of our properties through subsidiaries that have elected to be taxed as reits and we may in the future determine that it is in our best interests to hold one or more of our other properties through one or more subsidiaries that elect to be taxed as reits. if any of these subsidiaries fails to qualify as a reit for federal income tax purposes, then bxp may also fail to qualify as a reit for federal income tax purposes.
if bxp or any of its subsidiaries that are reits fails to qualify as a reit then, unless certain relief provisions apply, it will face serious tax consequences that will substantially reduce the funds available for payment of dividends for each of the years involved because:
•bxp would not be allowed a deduction for dividends paid to stockholders in computing its taxable income and would be subject to federal income tax at regular corporate rates;
•bxp also could be subject to the federal alternative minimum tax for tax years ending before january 1, 2018 and possibly increased state and local taxes; and
•unless bxp is entitled to relief under statutory provisions, bxp could not elect to be subject to tax as a reit for four taxable years following the year during which it was disqualified.
in addition, if bxp fails to qualify as a reit and the relief provisions do not apply, it will no longer be required to pay dividends. as a result of all these factors, bxp's failure to qualify as a reit could impair our ability to raise capital and expand our business, and it would adversely affect the value of bxp's common stock. if bxp or any of its subsidiaries that are reits fails to qualify as a reit but is eligible for certain relief provisions, then it may retain its status as a reit, but may be required to pay a penalty tax, which could be substantial.
in order to maintain bxp's reit status, we may be forced to borrow funds during unfavorable market conditions.
in order to maintain bxp's reit status, we may need to borrow funds on a short-term basis to meet the reit distribution requirements, even if the then-prevailing market conditions are not favorable for these borrowings. to qualify as a reit, bxp generally must distribute to its stockholders at least 90% of its taxable income each year, excluding capital gains and with certain other adjustments. in addition, bxp will be subject to a 4% nondeductible excise tax on the amount, if any, by which dividends paid in any calendar year are less than the sum of 85% of ordinary income, 95% of capital gain net income and 100% of undistributed income from prior years. we may need short-term debt or long-term debt or proceeds from asset sales, creation of joint ventures or sales of common stock to fund required distributions as a result of differences in timing between the actual receipt of income and the recognition of income for federal income tax purposes, or the effect of non-deductible capital expenditures, the creation of reserves or required debt or amortization payments. any inability of our cash flows to cover our distribution requirements could have an adverse impact on our ability to raise short- and long-term debt or sell equity securities in order to fund distributions required to maintain bxp's reit status.
we may be subject to adverse legislative or regulatory tax changes that could negatively impact our financial condition.
at any time, the u.s. federal income tax laws governing reits or the administrative interpretations of those laws may be amended, including with respect to our hotel ownership structure. we cannot predict if or when any new u.s. federal income tax law, regulation, or administrative interpretation, or any amendment to any existing u.s. federal income tax law, treasury regulation or administrative interpretation, will be adopted, promulgated or become effective and any such law, regulation, or interpretation may take effect retroactively. bxp, its taxable reit subsidiaries, and our securityholders could be adversely affected by any such change in, or any new, u.s. federal income tax law, treasury regulation or administrative interpretation.
we face possible adverse state and local tax audits and changes in state and local tax laws.
because bxp is organized and qualifies as a reit, it is generally not subject to federal income taxes, but we are subject to certain state and local taxes. in the normal course of business, certain entities through which we own real estate either have undergone, or are currently undergoing, tax audits. although we believe that we have substantial arguments in favor of our positions in the ongoing audits, in some instances there is no controlling precedent or interpretive guidance on the specific point at issue. collectively, tax deficiency notices received to date from the jurisdictions conducting the ongoing audits have not been material. however, there can be no assurance that future audits will not occur with increased frequency or that the ultimate result of such audits will not have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.
from time to time changes in state and local tax laws or regulations are enacted, which may result in an increase in our tax liability. a shortfall in tax revenues for states and municipalities in which we operate may lead to an increase in the frequency and size of such changes. if such changes occur, we may be required to pay additional taxes on our assets or income. these increased tax costs could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations and the amount of cash available for the payment of dividends and distributions to our securityholders.
general risk factors changes in market conditions could adversely affect the market price of bxp's common stock.
as with other publicly traded equity securities, the value of bxp's common stock depends on various market conditions that may change from time to time. among the market conditions that may affect the value of bxp's common stock are the following:
•the extent of investor interest in our securities;
•the general reputation of reits and the attractiveness of our equity securities in comparison to other equity securities, including securities issued by other real estate-based companies;
•our underlying asset value;
•investor confidence in the stock and bond markets, generally;
•national economic conditions;
•changes in tax laws;
•our financial performance;
•changes in our credit ratings;
•differences between the yields paid on other investments available in the market and bxp's dividend yield; and
•general stock and bond market conditions, including changes in interest rates.
the market value of bxp's common stock is based primarily upon the market's perception of our growth potential and our current and potential future earnings and cash dividends. consequently, bxp's common stock may trade at prices that are greater or less than bxp's net asset value per share of common stock. if our future earnings or cash dividends are less than expected, it is likely that the market price of bxp's common stock will diminish.
further issuances of equity securities may be dilutive to current securityholders.
the interests of our existing securityholders could be diluted if additional equity securities are issued to finance future developments, acquisitions or repay indebtedness. our ability to execute our business strategy depends on our access to an appropriate blend of debt financing, including unsecured lines of credit and other forms of secured and unsecured debt, and equity financing, including common and preferred equity.
the number of shares available for future sale could adversely affect the market price of bxp's stock.
in connection with and subsequent to bxp's initial public offering, we have completed many private placement transactions in which shares of stock of bxp or partnership interests in bplp were issued to owners of properties we acquired or to institutional investors. this common stock, or common stock issuable in exchange for such partnership interests in bplp, may be sold in the public securities markets over time under registration rights we granted to these investors. additional common stock issuable under our employee benefit and other incentive plans, including as a result of the grant of stock options and restricted equity securities, may also be sold in the market at some time in the future. future sales of bxp common stock in the market could adversely affect the price of its common stock. we cannot predict the effect the perception in the market that such sales may occur will have on the market price of bxp's common stock.
our involvement in legal proceedings and other claims may result in substantial monetary and other costs that have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.
from time to time, we are involved in legal proceedings and other claims. we may also be named as defendants in lawsuits allegedly arising out of our actions or the actions of our vendors, contractors, clients or other contractual parties in which such parties have agreed to indemnify, defend and hold us harmless from and against various claims, litigation and liabilities arising in connection with their respective businesses and/or added as an additional insured under certain insurance policies. an unfavorable resolution of any legal proceeding or other claim could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results from operations. regardless of its outcome, legal proceedings and other claims may result in substantial costs and expenses and significantly divert the attention of our management. with respect to any legal proceeding or other claim, there can be no assurance that we will be able to prevail, or achieve a favorable settlement or outcome, or that our insurance or the insurance and/or any contractual indemnities of our vendors, contractors, clients or other contractual parties will be enough to cover all of our defense costs or any resulting liabilities.
we face risks associated with security breaches through cyber attacks, cyber intrusions or otherwise, as well as other significant disruptions of our information technology (it) networks and related systems.
we face risks associated with security breaches, whether through cyber attacks or cyber intrusions over the internet, malware, computer viruses, attachments to e-mails, persons inside our organization or persons with access to systems inside our organization, and other significant disruptions of our it networks and related systems. the risk of a security breach or disruption, particularly through cyber attack or cyber intrusion, including by computer hackers, foreign governments and cyber terrorists, has generally increased as the number, intensity and sophistication of attempted attacks and intrusions from around the world have increased. our it networks and related systems are essential to the operation of our business and our ability to perform day-to-day operations (including managing our building systems) and, in some cases, may be critical to the operations of certain of our clients.
the audit committee of bxp's board of directors oversees our risk management processes related to cybersecurity. it meets no less frequently than annually with our it personnel and senior management to discuss recent trends in cyber risks and our strategy to defend our it networks, business systems and information against cyber attacks and intrusions. under the oversight of the audit committee, we established our overall cybersecurity program and its standards by reference to the national institute of standards and technology ("nist") cyber security framework. as part of our overall cybersecurity program:
•we have implemented a continuous improvement methodology including, but not limited to, ongoing enhancements to processes and controls, quarterly control reviews, annual policy reviews, biannual penetration tests and annual investments in our security infrastructure;
•we annually assess our cybersecurity program against the nist framework and periodically engage an outside consulting firm to conduct the assessment; and
•we conduct cybersecurity awareness training at least three times per year for our employees and primary on-site providers, and we conduct ongoing phishing simulations to raise awareness of spoofed or manipulated electronic communications and other critical security threats.
although we make efforts to maintain the security and integrity of our it networks and related systems, and we have implemented various measures to manage the risk of a security breach or disruption, there can be no assurance that our security efforts and measures will be effective or that attempted security breaches or disruptions would not be successful or damaging. even the most well-protected information, networks, systems and facilities remain potentially vulnerable because the techniques used in such attempted security breaches evolve and generally are not recognized until launched against a target, and in some cases, are designed not be detected and, in fact, may not be detected. accordingly, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate security barriers or other preventative measures, and thus it is impossible for us to entirely mitigate this risk.
like other businesses, we have been, and expect to continue to be, subject to attempts at unauthorized access, mishandling or misuse, computer viruses or malware, cyber attacks and intrusions and other events of varying degrees. to date, these events have not adversely affected our operations or business and have not been material, either individually or in the aggregate. however, a security breach or other significant disruption involving our it networks and related systems could:
•disrupt the proper functioning of our networks and systems and therefore our operations and/or those of certain of our clients;
•result in misstated financial reports, violations of loan covenants, missed reporting deadlines and/or missed permitting deadlines;
•result in our inability to properly monitor our compliance with the rules and regulations regarding bxp's qualification as a reit;
•result in the unauthorized access to, and destruction, loss, theft, misappropriation or release of, proprietary, confidential, sensitive or otherwise valuable information of ours or others, which others could use to compete against us or which could expose us to damage claims by third-parties for disruptive, destructive or otherwise harmful purposes and outcomes;
•result in our inability to maintain the building systems relied upon by our clients for the efficient use of their leased space;
•require significant management attention and resources to remedy any damages that result;
•subject us to claims for breach of contract, damages, credits, penalties or termination of leases or other agreements; and
•damage our reputation among our clients and investors generally.
any one or more of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.
changes in accounting pronouncements could adversely affect our operating results, in addition to the reported financial performance of our clients.
accounting policies and methods are fundamental to how we record and report our financial condition and results of operations. uncertainties posed by various initiatives of accounting standard-setting by the financial accounting standards board and the securities and exchange commission, which create and interpret applicable accounting standards for u.s. companies, may change the financial accounting and reporting standards or their interpretation and application of these standards that govern the preparation of our financial statements. changes include, but are not limited to, changes in revenue recognition, lease accounting and the adoption of accounting standards likely to require the increased use of "fair-value" measures.
these changes could have a material impact on our reported financial condition and results of operations. in some cases, we could be required to apply a new or revised standard retroactively, resulting in potentially material restatements of prior period financial statements. similarly, these changes could have a material impact on our clients' reported financial condition or results of operations or could affect our clients' preferences regarding leasing real estate.
item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations.
the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this report.
forward-looking statements this annual report on form 10-k, including the documents incorporated by reference, contain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws, section 27a of the securities act of 1933, as amended, and section 21e of the securities exchange act of 1934, as amended. we intend these forward-looking statements to be covered by the safe harbor provisions for forward-looking statements contained in the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 and are including this statement for purposes of complying with those safe harbor provisions, in each case, to the extent applicable. the forward-looking statements are contained principally, but not only, under the captions "business-business and growth strategies," "risk factors" and "management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations." we caution investors that forward-looking statements are based on current beliefs, expectations of future events and assumptions made by, and information currently available to, our management. when used, the words "anticipate," "believe," "budget," "could," "estimate," "expect," "intend," "may," "might," "plan," "project," "should," "will" and similar expressions that do not relate solely to historical matters are intended to identify forward-looking statements. these statements are subject to risks, uncertainties and assumptions and are not guarantees of future performance or occurrences, which may be affected by known and unknown risks, trends, uncertainties and factors that are, in some cases, beyond our control. should one or more of these known or unknown risks or uncertainties materialize, or should underlying assumptions prove incorrect, actual results may vary materially from those expressed or implied by the forward-looking statements. we caution you that, while forward-looking statements reflect our good-faith beliefs when we make them, they are not guarantees of future performance or occurrences and are impacted by actual events when they occur after we make such statements. accordingly, investors should use caution in relying on forward-looking statements, which are based on results and trends at the time they are made, to anticipate future results or trends.
the most significant factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied by the forward-looking statements include the risks and uncertainties related to the impact of changes in general economic and capital market conditions, including continued inflation, increasing interest rates, supply chain disruptions, labor market disruptions, dislocation and volatility in capital markets, and potential longer-term changes in consumer and client behavior resulting from the severity and duration of any downturn in the u.s. or global economy, as well as the other important factors below and the risks set forth in this form 10-k in part i, item 1a.
some of the risks and uncertainties that may cause our actual results, performance or achievements to differ materially from those expressed or implied by forward-looking statements include, among others, the following:
•volatile or adverse global economic and geopolitical conditions, health crises and dislocations in the credit markets could adversely affect our access to cost-effective capital and have a resulting material adverse effect on our business opportunities, results of operations and financial condition;
•risks associated with downturns in the national and local economies, continued inflation, increasing interest rates, and volatility in the securities markets;
•general risks affecting the real estate industry (including, without limitation, the inability to enter into or renew leases, changes in client preferences and space utilization, dependence on clients' financial condition, and competition from other developers, owners and operators of real estate);
•the impact of geopolitical conflicts, including the ongoing war in ukraine;
•the immediate and long-term impact of the outbreak of a highly infectious or contagious disease, such as covid-19, on our and our clients' financial condition, results of operations and cash flows (including the impact of actions taken to contain the outbreak or mitigate its impact, the direct and indirect economic effects of the outbreak and containment measures on our clients, and the ability of our clients to successfully operate their businesses);
•failure to manage effectively our growth and expansion into new markets and sub-markets or to integrate acquisitions and developments successfully;
•the ability of our joint venture partners to satisfy their obligations;
•risks and uncertainties affecting property development and construction (including, without limitation, continued inflation, supply chain disruptions, labor shortages, construction delays, increased construction costs, cost overruns, inability to obtain necessary permits, client accounting considerations that may result in negotiated lease provisions that limit a client's liability during construction, and public opposition to such activities);
•risks associated with the availability and terms of financing and the use of debt to fund acquisitions and developments or refinance existing indebtedness, including the impact of higher interest rates on the cost and/or availability of financing;
•risks associated with forward interest rate contracts and the effectiveness of such arrangements;
•risks associated with actual or threatened terrorist attacks;
•costs of compliance with the americans with disabilities act and other similar laws;
•potential liability for uninsured losses and environmental contamination;
•risks associated with climate change and severe weather events, as well as the regulatory efforts intended to reduce the effects of climate change;
•risks associated with security breaches through cyber attacks, cyber intrusions or otherwise, as well as other significant disruptions of our information technology (it) networks and related systems, which support our operations and our buildings;
•risks associated with bxp's potential failure to qualify as a reit under the internal revenue code of 1986, as amended;
•possible adverse changes in tax and environmental laws;
•the impact of newly adopted accounting principles on our accounting policies and on period-to-period comparisons of financial results;
•risks associated with possible state and local tax audits; and
•risks associated with our dependence on key personnel whose continued service is not guaranteed.
the risks set forth above are not exhaustive. other sections of this report, including "part i, item 1a-risk factors," include additional factors that could adversely affect our business and financial performance. moreover, we operate in a very competitive and rapidly changing environment. new risk factors emerge from time to time and it is not possible for management to predict all risk factors, nor can we assess the impact of all risk factors on our business or the extent to which any factor, or combination of factors, may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements. given these risks and uncertainties, investors should not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements as a prediction of actual results. investors should also refer to our most recent quarterly reports on form 10-q for future periods and current reports on form 8-k as we file them with the sec, and to other materials we may furnish to the public from time to time through current reports on form 8-k or otherwise, for a discussion of risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results, performance or achievements to differ materially from those expressed or implied by forward-looking statements. we expressly disclaim any responsibility to update any forward-looking statements to reflect changes in underlying assumptions or factors, new information, future events, or otherwise, and you should not rely upon these forward-looking statements after the date of this report.
overview bxp is one of the largest publicly traded office real estate investment trusts (reits) (based on total market capitalization as of december 31, 2022) in the united states that develops, owns, and manages primarily premier workplaces. our properties are concentrated in six dynamic gateway markets in the united states - boston, los angeles, new york, san francisco, seattle, and washington, dc. bplp is the entity through which bxp conducts substantially all of its business and owns (either directly or through subsidiaries) substantially all of its assets. we generate revenue and cash primarily by leasing premier workplaces to our clients. when making leasing decisions, we consider, among other things, the creditworthiness of the client and the industry in which it conducts business, the length of the lease, the rental rate to be paid at inception and throughout the lease term, the costs of tenant improvements, free rent periods and other landlord concessions, anticipated operating expenses and real estate taxes, current and anticipated vacancy in our properties and the market overall (including sublease space), current and expected future demand for the space, the impact of other client's expansion rights and general economic factors.
our core strategy has always been to develop, acquire and manage premier workplaces in gateway markets with high barriers-to-entry and attractive demand drivers, and to focus on executing long-term leases with financially strong clients. our client base is diverse across market sectors and the weighted-average lease term for our in-place leases, excluding residential units, was approximately 7.9 years, as of december 31, 2022, including leases signed by our unconsolidated joint ventures. the weighted-average lease term for our 20 largest clients, based on leased square footage, was approximately 10.7 years as of december 31, 2022.
to be successful in any leasing environment, we believe we must consider all aspects of the client-landlord relationship. in this regard, we believe that our competitive leasing advantage is based on the following attributes:
•our understanding of our client's short- and long-term space utilization and amenity needs in the local markets;
•our track record of developing and operating premier workplaces in a sustainable and responsible manner;
•our reputation as a high quality developer, owner and manager of premier workplaces in our markets;
•our financial strength and our ability to maintain high building standards; and
•our relationships with local brokers.
outlook the inflation experienced in 2022 has slowly decreased but remains high. the federal reserve is expected to continue to increase interest rates, although likely at a more moderate pace, in an effort to bring prices under control. this, coupled with the discussion surrounding raising the u.s. debt ceiling could cause further turmoil in the financial markets. there have already been signs of this strain with announcements of staff reductions from large- and medium-sized employers. while the initial announcements were largely concentrated in the technology sectors, companies in the finance industry, the legal industry and broader corporate america are now announcing similar layoffs. this evolving operating environment impacts various aspects of our operating activities as:
•business leaders may generally become more reticent to make large capital allocation decisions, such as entry into a new lease;
•labor market conditions shift resulting in increasing employer demands for mandatory in-person workdays and gradual increases in space utilization by our clients;
•our capital costs have increased due to higher interest rates and credit spreads, and private market debt financing, both for construction and existing assets, is significantly more challenging to arrange; and
•construction costs have increased for new development and, although the costs for our active development pipeline are, at this stage, relatively fixed, the cost of potential future developments continues to increase.
in light of the foregoing, we believe we are positioning ourselves for success, notwithstanding the uncertain trajectory of the u.s. and global economies, by managing our leverage while continuing to selectively invest (including both acquisitions and developments) in premier workplace opportunities. we remain focused on the following priorities:
•continuing to embrace our leadership position in the premier workplace industry and leveraging our strength in portfolio quality, client relationships, development skills, market penetration and sustainability to profitably build market share. premier workplaces, the preferred choice for our current and prospective clients, are gaining market share compared to general office space and demonstrating the highest occupancy, net absorption levels and rental rates in the central business district ("cbd") markets where we operate;
•leasing available space in our in-service and development properties, as well as proactively focusing on future lease expirations;
•completing the construction and leasing of our development properties;
•pursuing attractive asset class adjacencies where we have a track record of success, such as life sciences and residential development;
•continuing to raise the bar in the quality of our portfolio and actively recycling capital by selling assets, subject to market conditions, which may be negatively impacted by a slowdown in the capital markets and the limited availability of private market debt financing;
•actively managing our operations in a sustainable and responsible manner; and
•prioritizing risk management by actively managing liquidity, investing more extensively with joint venture partners to manage our debt levels, and being highly selective in new investment commitments.
the following is an overview of leasing and investment activity in the fourth quarter of 2022.
leasing activity and occupancy in the fourth quarter of 2022, we signed approximately 1.1 million square feet of new leases and renewals, for a total of approximately 5.7 million square feet leased in 2022, which is 95% of our average annual leasing volume over the last ten years. the leases executed in the fourth quarter and full year 2022 have a weighted-average lease term of approximately 7.8 years and 9.2 years, respectively, indicating that many new and existing clients continue to commit to the long-term use of space and view our properties as their preferred choice for a premier workplace environment.
the overall occupancy of our in-service office and retail properties was 88.6% at december 31, 2022, a decrease of 30 basis points from september 30, 2022. the decrease in occupancy is primarily due to fully placing in-service reston next and 880 winter street, which have leases for which revenue recognition has not commenced in accordance with gaap. excluding the impact of placing these two properties in-service, occupancy would have increased in the fourth quarter of 2022 by 20 basis points to 89.1%.
the macroeconomic environment has resulted in softening demand in all of our markets. while property tours continue and leases under negotiation move forward, there is less urgency from clients to make new commitments. potential clients touring space acknowledge that economic uncertainty is impacting space decisions. as we consider our expectations for leasing in 2023, we have factored in the impacts of a slower economy, softer business performance, and reduced demand for space. we expect the bulk of our leasing in 2023 will continue to come from small- and medium-sized professional and financial services firms.
investment activity although the real estate capital markets for office assets has slowed substantially with u.s. transaction volume down 40% in the fourth quarter of 2022 from the third quarter of 2022, we remain committed to developing and acquiring assets to enhance our long-term growth and to meet client demand for premier workplaces, life sciences, retail and residential space. we continually evaluate current and prospective markets for possible acquisitions of "value-add" assets that require lease-up or repositioning, and acquisitions that are otherwise consistent with our long-term strategy of owning, managing, developing, and improving premier workplaces in each of our chosen markets.
consistent with this strategy, in 2022, we purchased an aggregate of approximately $1.6 billion (our share) of premier workplaces, including life sciences, and an interest in an unconsolidated joint venture that owns a premier workplace. in the fourth quarter of 2022, we acquired a 26.69% interest in the joint venture that owns 200 fifth avenue, a 14-story, approximately 855,000 square-foot, leed gold certified, premier workplace located in new york city that is approximately 93% leased as of december 31, 2022. the acquisition of the joint venture interest is our second investment in the vibrant midtown south neighborhood. we serve as the managing member and provide customary leasing and property management services for the joint venture. we closed on the interest in the joint venture for a gross purchase price of approximately $280.2 million, which includes $120.1 million of cash and our pro rata share of the outstanding loan secured by the property of $160.1 million. the mortgage loan bears interest at a variable rate equal to libor plus 1.30% per annum and matures on november 24, 2028. the joint venture has interest rate swap contracts through june 2028, resulting in a fixed rate of approximately 4.34% per annum through the expiration of the interest rate swap contracts.
as of december 31, 2022, our development/redevelopment pipeline consisted of 13 properties that, when completed, we expect will total approximately 3.2 million net rentable square feet. our share of the estimated total cost for these projects is approximately $1.9 billion, of which approximately $729.1 million remains to be invested. in january 2023, bxp commenced the development of 290 binney street and the redevelopment of 300 binney street at kendall center in cambridge, massachusetts. including projects that commenced in january 2023, we had 15 properties under development or redevelopment which, excluding view boston at the prudential center and reston next residential, are 52% pre-leased as of february 21, 2023. our share of the estimated total cost for these projects is approximately $3.3 billion.
as we continue to focus on new investments to drive future growth, we regularly review our portfolio to identify properties as potential sales candidates that either no longer fit within our portfolio strategy or could attract premium pricing in the current market. in the fourth quarter of 2022, we completed the disposition of the avant at reston town center for a gross sale price of $141.0 million. the avant at reston town center a is a 15-story, approximately 329,000 square foot, excluding retail space, 359-unit, luxury residential building located in reston, virginia. bxp retained ownership of the approximately 26,000 square foot ground-level retail space.
including the sale of the residential component of the avant at reston town center, bxp completed the disposition of 14 properties and two land parcels, for an aggregate gross sale price of approximately $864.2 million, in 2022.
a brief overview of each of our markets follows.
boston during the fourth quarter of 2022, we executed approximately 287,000 square feet of leases and approximately 476,000 square feet of leases commenced in the boston region. approximately 245,000 square feet of the leases that commenced had been vacant for less than one year and represent an increase in net rental obligations of approximately 22% over the prior leases.
our boston cbd in-service portfolio was approximately 94% leased as of december 31, 2022.
our approximately 2.7 million square foot in-service office portfolio in cambridge was approximately 96% leased as of december 31, 2022.
in january 2023, bxp commenced the development of 290 binney street and the redevelopment of 300 binney street at kendall center in cambridge, massachusetts for an estimated total investment of approximately $1.4 billion. 290 binney street is an approximately 566,000 net rentable square foot laboratory/life sciences project that is 100% pre-leased to astrazeneca. concurrent with the commencement of this project, bxp removed from service and began demolition of the existing kendall center blue parking garage to support the development of this project. 300 binney street is a conversion of an approximately 195,000 net rentable square foot property into an approximately 240,000 net rentable square foot laboratory/life sciences property. 300 binney street is 100% pre-leased to a life sciences organization.

critical accounting estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america, or gaap, requires management to use judgment in the application of accounting policies, including making estimates and assumptions. we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. these judgments affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting periods. if our judgment or interpretation of the facts and circumstances relating to various transactions had been different, it is possible that different accounting policies would have been applied resulting in a different presentation of our financial statements. from time to time, we evaluate our estimates and assumptions. in the event estimates or assumptions prove to be different from actual results, adjustments are made in subsequent periods to reflect more current information. our significant accounting policies, which utilize these critical accounting estimates, are described in note 2 to our consolidated financial statements.
we consider our critical accounting estimates to be those used in the determination of the reported amounts and disclosure related to the following:
•purchase price allocations,
•impairment and
•impairment related to unconsolidated joint ventures.
each of the above critical accounting estimates is described in more detail below.
real estate purchase price allocations we assess the fair value of acquired tangible and intangible assets (including land, buildings, tenant improvements, "above-" and "below-market" leases, leasing and assumed financing origination costs, acquired in-place leases, other identified intangible assets and assumed liabilities) and allocate the purchase price to the acquired assets and assumed liabilities, including land and buildings as if vacant. we assess fair value based on estimated cash flow projections that utilize discount and/or capitalization rates that we deem appropriate, as well as available market information. estimates of future cash flows are based on a number of factors including the historical operating results, known and anticipated trends, and market and economic conditions.
the fair value of the tangible assets of an acquired property considers the value of the property as if it were vacant. we also consider an allocation of purchase price of other acquired intangibles, including acquired in-place leases that may have a customer relationship intangible value, including (but not limited to) the nature and extent of the existing relationship with the clients, the clients' credit quality and expectations of lease renewals. based on our acquisitions to date, our allocation to customer relationship intangible assets has been immaterial.
we record acquired "above-" and "below-market" leases at their fair values (using a discount rate which reflects the risks associated with the leases acquired) equal to the difference between (1) the contractual amounts to be paid pursuant to each in-place lease and (2) management's estimate of fair market lease rates for each corresponding in-place lease, measured over a period equal to the remaining term of the lease for above-market leases and the initial term plus the term of any below-market fixed rate renewal options for below-market leases. acquired "above-" and "below-market" lease values have been reflected within prepaid expenses and other assets and other liabilities, respectively, in our consolidated balance sheets. other intangible assets acquired include amounts for in-place lease values that are based on our evaluation of the specific characteristics of each client's lease. factors to be considered include estimates of carrying costs during hypothetical expected lease-up periods considering current market conditions, and costs to execute similar leases. in estimating carrying costs, we include real estate taxes, insurance and other operating expenses and estimates of lost rentals at market rates during the expected lease-up periods, depending on local market conditions. in estimating costs to execute similar leases, we consider leasing commissions, legal and other related expenses.
during the year ended december 31, 2022, we completed the acquisition of madison centre in seattle, washington and 125 broadway in cambridge, massachusetts for an aggregate net purchase price of approximately $1.3 billion. these transactions were accounted for as asset acquisitions, and the purchase price of each was allocated based on the relative fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed (see note 3 to the consolidated financial statements).
impairment management reviews its long-lived assets for indicators of impairment following the end of each quarter and when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable. this evaluation of long-lived assets is dependent on a number of factors, including when there is an event or adverse change in the operating performance of the long-lived asset or a current expectation that, more likely than not, a long-lived asset will be sold or otherwise disposed of significantly before the end of its previously estimated useful life or hold period. an impairment loss is recognized if the carrying amount of an asset is not recoverable and exceeds its fair value. the evaluation of anticipated cash flows is subjective and is based in part on assumptions regarding anticipated hold periods, future occupancy, future rental rates, future capital requirements, discount rates and capitalization rates that could differ materially from actual results in future periods. because cash flows on properties considered to be "long-lived assets to be held and used" are considered on an undiscounted basis to determine whether an asset may be impaired, our established strategy of holding properties over the long term directly decreases the likelihood of recording an impairment loss. if our hold strategy changes or market conditions otherwise dictate an earlier sale date, an impairment loss may be recognized and such loss could be material. if we determine that an impairment has occurred, the affected assets must be reduced to their fair value.
unconsolidated joint ventures impairment our investments in unconsolidated joint ventures are reviewed for indicators of impairment on a quarterly basis and we record impairment charges when events or circumstances change indicating that a decline in the fair values below the carrying amounts has occurred and such decline is other-than-temporary. this evaluation of the investments in unconsolidated joint ventures is dependent on a number of factors, including the performance of each investment and market conditions. we will record an impairment charge if we determine that a decline in the fair value below the carrying amount of an investment in an unconsolidated joint venture is other-than-temporary. the fair value is calculated using discounted cash flows which is subjective and considers assumptions regarding future occupancy, future rental rates, future capital requirements, debt interest rates and availability, discount rates and capitalization rates that could differ materially from actual results in future periods.
as of december 31, 2022, the net carrying amounts of our investments in unconsolidated joint ventures was approximately $1.6 billion, which includes investments with deficit balances aggregating approximately $85.4 million included within other liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets. during the year ended december 31, 2022, we recorded an other-than-temporary impairment of approximately $50.7 million related to our dock 72 unconsolidated joint venture (see note 6 to the consolidated financial statements).
income taxes our accounting policies related to income tax are described in note 2 to our consolidated financial statements.
bxp the net difference between the tax basis and the reported amounts of bxp's assets and liabilities was approximately $2.1 billion and $1.8 billion as of december 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, which was primarily related to the difference in basis of contributed property and accrued rental income.
certain entities included in bxp's consolidated financial statements are subject to certain state and local taxes. these taxes are recorded as operating expenses in the accompanying consolidated financial statements.

at december 31, 2022 and 2021, we owned or had joint venture interests in a portfolio of 194 and 201 commercial real estate properties, respectively (in each case, the "total property portfolio"). as a result of changes within our total property portfolio, the financial data presented below shows significant changes in revenue and expenses from period-to-period. accordingly, we do not believe that our period-to-period financial data with respect to the total property portfolio provides a complete understanding of our operating results. therefore, the comparison of operating results for the year ended december 31, 2022 and 2021 show separately the changes attributable to the properties that were owned by us and in-service throughout each period compared (the "same property portfolio") and the changes attributable to the properties included in the acquired, placed in-service, development or redevelopment or sold portfolios.
in our analysis of operating results, particularly to make comparisons of net operating income between periods more meaningful, it is important to provide information for properties that were in-service and owned by us throughout each period presented. we refer to properties acquired or placed in-service prior to the beginning of the earliest period presented and owned by us and in-service through the end of the latest period presented as our same property portfolio. the same property portfolio therefore excludes properties acquired, placed in-service or in development or redevelopment after the beginning of the earliest period presented or disposed of prior to the end of the latest period presented.
noi is a non-gaap financial measure equal to net income attributable to boston properties, inc. common shareholders and net income attributable to boston properties limited partnership common unitholders, as applicable, the most directly comparable gaap financial measures, plus (1) preferred stock/unit redemption charge, preferred dividends/distributions, net income attributable to noncontrolling interests, interest expense, losses from early extinguishment of debt, unrealized loss on non-real estate investment, loss from unconsolidated joint ventures, depreciation and amortization expense, transaction costs, payroll and related costs from management services contracts and corporate general and administrative expense less (2) gains (losses) from investments in securities, other income - assignment fee, interest and other income (loss), gain on sales-type lease, gains on sales of real estate, direct reimbursements of payroll and related costs from management services contracts and development and management services revenue. we use noi internally as a performance measure and believe it provides useful information to investors regarding our results of operations and financial condition because, when compared across periods, it reflects the impact on operations from trends in occupancy rates, rental rates, operating costs and acquisition and development activity on an unleveraged basis, providing perspective not immediately apparent from net income attributable to boston properties, inc. common shareholders and net income attributable to boston properties limited partnership common unitholders. for example, interest expense is not necessarily linked to the operating performance of a real estate asset and is often incurred at the corporate level as opposed to the property level. similarly, interest expense may be incurred at the property level even though the financing proceeds may be used at the corporate level (e.g., used for other investment activity). in addition, depreciation and amortization expense, because of historical cost accounting and useful life estimates, may distort operating performance measures at the property level. noi presented by us may not be comparable to noi reported by other reits or real estate companies that define noi differently.
we believe that in order to understand our operating results, noi should be examined in conjunction with net income attributable to boston properties, inc. common shareholders and net income attributable to boston properties limited partnership common unitholders as presented in our consolidated financial statements. noi should not be considered as a substitute for net income attributable to boston properties, inc. common shareholders or net income attributable to boston properties limited partnership common unitholders (determined in accordance with gaap) or any other gaap financial measures and should only be considered together with and as a supplement to our financial information prepared in accordance with gaap.
the gains on sales of real estate and depreciation expense may differ between bxp and bplp as a result of previously applied acquisition accounting by bxp for the issuance of common stock in connection with non-sponsor redemptions of common units of limited partnership interest of bplp ("op units"). this accounting resulted in a step-up of the real estate assets at bxp that was allocated to certain properties. the difference between the real estate assets of bxp as compared to bplp for certain properties having an allocation of the real estate step-up will result in a corresponding difference in gains on sales of real estate and depreciation expense when those properties are sold. for additional information see the explanatory note that follows the cover page of this annual report on form 10-k.
comparison of the year ended december 31, 2022 to the year ended december 31, 2021
the table below shows selected operating information for the same property portfolio and the total property portfolio. the same property portfolio consists of 124 properties totaling approximately 37.8 million net rentable square feet, excluding unconsolidated joint ventures. the same property portfolio includes properties acquired or placed in-service on or prior to january 1, 2021 and owned and in service through december 31, 2022. the total property portfolio includes the effects of the other properties either acquired, placed in-service, in development or redevelopment after january 1, 2021 or disposed of on or prior to december 31, 2022. this table includes a reconciliation from the same property portfolio to the total property portfolio by also providing information for the years ended december 31, 2022 and 2021 with respect to the properties that were acquired, placed in-service, in development or redevelopment or sold.

(1)rental revenue is equal to revenue less development and management services revenue and direct reimbursements of payroll and related costs from management services revenue per the consolidated statements of operations, excluding the residential and hotel revenue that is noted below. we use rental revenue internally as a performance measure and in calculating other non-gaap financial measures (e.g., noi), which provides investors with information regarding our performance that is not immediately apparent from the comparable non-gaap measures and allows investors to compare operating performance between periods.
(2)for a detailed discussion of noi, including the reasons management believes noi is useful to investors, see page 70. residential net operating income for the year ended december 31, 2022 and 2021 is comprised of residential revenue of $57,181 and $42,668 less residential expenses of $29,583 and $24,444, respectively. hotel net operating income for the year ended december 31, 2022 and 2021 is comprised of hotel revenue of $39,482 and $13,609 less hotel expenses of $27,478 and $12,998, respectively, per the consolidated statements of operations.
same property portfolio lease revenue (excluding termination income)
lease revenue (excluding termination income) from the same property portfolio increased by approximately $82.1 million for the year ended december 31, 2022 compared to 2021. the increase was a result of our average revenue per square foot increasing by approximately $2.96, contributing approximately $99.3 million, partially offset by average occupancy decreasing from 91.7% to 91.1%, resulting in a decrease of approximately $17.2 million.

(1)average monthly rental rate is calculated as the average of the quotients obtained by dividing (a) rental revenue as determined in accordance with gaap, by (b) the number of occupied units for each month within the applicable fiscal period.
(2)average physical occupancy is defined as (1) the average number of occupied units divided by (2) the total number of units, expressed as a percentage.
(3)average economic occupancy is defined as (1) total possible revenue less vacancy loss divided by (2) total possible revenue, expressed as a percentage. total possible revenue is determined by valuing average occupied units at contract rates and average vacant units at market rents. vacancy loss is determined by valuing vacant units at current market rents. by measuring vacant units at their market rents, average economic occupancy takes into account the fact that units of different sizes and locations within a residential property have different economic impacts on a residential property's total possible gross revenue. market rents used by us in calculating economic occupancy are based on the current market rates set by the managers of our residential properties based on their experience in renting their residential property's units and publicly available market data. actual market rents and trends in such rents for a region as reported by others may vary materially from market rents used by us. market rents for a period are based on the average market rents during that period and do not reflect any impact for cash concessions.
hotel net operating income the boston marriott cambridge hotel had net operating income of approximately $12.0 million for the year ended december 31, 2022, representing an increase of approximately $11.4 million compared to the year ended december 31, 2021. as demand for travel has returned, the boston marriott cambridge has seen an increase in occupancy and room rates, which has led to increased net operating income.
the following reflects our occupancy and rate information for the boston marriott cambridge hotel for the year ended december 31, 2022 and 2021.

other operating revenue and expense items development and management services revenue development and management services revenue increased by approximately $0.4 million for the year ended december 31, 2022 compared to 2021. management services revenue increased by approximately $2.3 million and development services revenue decreased by approximately $1.9 million. the increase in management services revenue was primarily related to an increase in property management fees from an unconsolidated joint venture in the boston region and asset management fees from unconsolidated joint ventures in the los angeles and seattle regions. the decrease in development services revenue was primarily related to a decrease in development fees earned from unconsolidated joint venture properties in the washington, dc and boston regions, which were placed in-service during prior periods.
general and administrative expense general and administrative expense decreased by approximately $5.2 million for the year ended december 31, 2022 compared to 2021 primarily due to a decrease in compensation expense of approximately $11.9 million, partially offset by an approximately $6.7 million increase in other general and administrative expenses. the decrease in compensation expense related to an approximately $12.1 million decrease in the value of our deferred compensation plan and an approximately $0.2 million increase in other compensation expenses. the increase in other general and administrative expenses was primarily related to an increase in professional fees.
wages directly related to the development of rental properties are capitalized and included in real estate assets on our consolidated balance sheets and amortized over the useful lives of the applicable asset or lease term. capitalized wages for the year ended december 31, 2022 and 2021 were approximately $16.1 million and $13.7 million, respectively. these costs are not included in the general and administrative expenses discussed above.
transaction costs transaction costs decreased by approximately $2.1 million for the year ended december 31, 2022 compared to 2021 due primarily to costs incurred in connection with the pursuit and formation of new joint ventures in 2021 that did not occur at the same levels in 2022. in general, transaction costs relating to the formation of new joint ventures and the pursuit of other transactions are expensed as incurred.
depreciation and amortization expense depreciation expense may differ between bxp and bplp as a result of previously applied acquisition accounting by bxp for the issuance of common stock in connection with non-sponsor op unit redemptions by bplp.  this accounting resulted in a step-up of the real estate assets at bxp that was allocated to certain properties.  the difference between the real estate assets of bxp as compared to bplp for certain properties having an allocation of the real estate step-up will result in a corresponding difference in depreciation expense. for additional information see the explanatory note that follows the cover page of this annual report on form 10-k.

direct reimbursements of payroll and related costs from management services contracts and payroll and related costs from management service contracts we have determined that amounts reimbursed for payroll and related costs received from third parties in connection with management services contracts should be reflected on a gross basis instead of on a net basis as we have determined that we are the principal under these arrangements. we anticipate that these two financial statement line items will generally offset each other.
other income and expense items loss from unconsolidated joint ventures for the year ended december 31, 2022 compared to 2021, loss from unconsolidated joint ventures increased by approximately $57.3 million primarily due to (1) a $50.7 million non-cash impairment charge at our dock 72 joint venture during the year ended december 31, 2022, (2) a $10.3 million gain on sale of investment from the sale of our annapolis junction joint venture interest during the year ended december 31, 2021 and (3) an increase in interest expense due to increasing interest rates on variable rate debt.
the unconsolidated joint venture properties have approximately $4.0 billion of outstanding debt, which is primarily variable rate. therefore, we expect our share of joint venture income to be impacted by higher interest rates.
gains on sales of real estate gains on sales of real estate may differ between bxp and bplp as a result of previously applied acquisition accounting by bxp for the issuance of common stock in connection with non-sponsor op unit redemptions by bplp. this accounting resulted in a step-up of the real estate assets at bxp that was allocated to certain properties. the difference between the real estate assets of bxp as compared to bplp for certain properties having an allocation of the real estate step-up will result in a corresponding difference in the gains on sales of real estate when those properties are sold. for additional information, see the explanatory note that follows the cover page of this annual report on form 10-k.

_____________
(1)excludes approximately $0.7 million of gains on sales of real estate recognized during the year ended december 31, 2022 related to gains on sales of real estate occurring in the prior year.
(2)on december 13, 2018, we sold our 6595 springfield center drive development project located in springfield, virginia. concurrently with the sale, we agreed to act as development manager and guaranteed the completion of the project. the development project achieved final completion during the third quarter of 2021 at which time the total cost of development was determined to be below the estimated total investment at the time of sale. as a result, we recognized a gain of approximately $8.1 million.
gain on sales-type lease in connection with a ground lease amendment, executed on december 19, 2022 with a third-party hotel developer, we recorded a sales-type lease receivable of approximately $13.0 million, which includes an unguaranteed residual asset of approximately $17,000. the sales-type lease receivable was measured as the present value of the fixed and determinable lease payments, including the unguaranteed residual value of the asset at the end of the lease, discounted at the rate implicit in the lease. in addition, we recorded a gain on sales-type lease of approximately $10.1 million associated with the derecognition of the asset. we did not recognize any interest income during the year ended december 31, 2022 (see note 4 to the consolidated financial statements).
interest and other income (loss)
interest and other income (loss) increased by approximately $6.2 million for the year ended december 31, 2022 compared to 2021, due primarily to an increase of approximately $7.3 million in interest income due to increased interest earned on our deposits.
other income - assignment fee on april 19, 2021, we entered into an agreement to acquire 11251 roger bacon drive in reston, virginia for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $5.6 million. on april 7, 2022, we executed an agreement to assign the right to acquire 11251 roger bacon drive to a third party for an assignment fee of approximately $6.9 million. net cash proceeds totaled approximately $6.6 million. 11251 roger bacon drive is an approximately 65,000 square foot office building situated on approximately 2.6 acres.
gains (losses) from investments in securities gains (losses) from investments in securities for the year ended december 31, 2022 and 2021 related to investments that we have made to reduce our market risk relating to deferred compensation plans that we maintain for bxp's officers and former non-employee directors. under the deferred compensation plans, each officer or non-employee director who is eligible to participate is permitted to defer a portion of the officer's current income or the non-employee director's compensation on a pre-tax basis and receive a tax-deferred return on these deferrals based on the performance of specific investments selected by the officer or non-employee director. in order to reduce our market risk relating to these plans, we typically acquire, in a separate account that is not restricted as to its use, similar or identical investments as those selected by each officer or non-employee director. this enables us to generally match our liabilities to bxp's officers or former non-employee directors under our deferred compensation plans with equivalent assets and thereby limit our market risk. the performance of these investments is recorded as gains (losses) from investments in securities. during the year ended december 31, 2022 and 2021, we recognized gains (losses) of approximately $(6.5) million and $5.6 million, respectively, on these investments. by comparison, our general and administrative expense increased (decreased) by approximately $(6.5) million and $5.6 million during the year ended december 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, as a result of increases (decreases) in our liability under our deferred compensation plans that was associated with the performance of the specific investments selected by officers and former non-employee directors of bxp participating in the plans.
unrealized loss on non-real estate investment during the year ended december 31, 2022, we began investing in non-real estate investments, which are primarily environmentally focused investment funds. as a result, we recognized an unrealized loss of $0.2 million due to the observable changes in the fair value of the investments.
losses from early extinguishment of debt on february 14, 2021, bplp completed the redemption of $850.0 million in aggregate principal amount of its 4.125% senior notes due may 15, 2021. the redemption price was approximately $858.7 million, which was equal to the stated principal plus approximately $8.7 million of accrued and unpaid interest to, but not including, the redemption date. we recognized a loss from early extinguishment of debt totaling approximately $0.4 million related to unamortized origination costs.
on march 16, 2021, bplp repaid $500.0 million, representing all amounts outstanding on its delayed draw term loan facility ("delayed draw facility") under its prior unsecured revolving credit agreement. we recognized a loss from early extinguishment of debt totaling approximately $0.5 million related to the acceleration of remaining unamortized financing costs.
on october 15, 2021, bplp used proceeds from its september 2021 offering of unsecured senior notes and borrowings under its new credit facility, which replaced the prior credit facility (as amended and restated, the "2021 credit facility") to complete the redemption of $1.0 billion in aggregate principal amount of its 3.85% senior notes due february 1, 2023. the redemption price was approximately $1.05 billion. the redemption price included approximately $7.9 million of accrued and unpaid interest to, but not including, the redemption date. excluding the accrued and unpaid interest, the redemption price was approximately 104.284% of the principal amount being redeemed. we recognized a loss from early extinguishment of debt totaling approximately $44.2 million, which amount included the payment of the redemption premium totaling approximately $42.8 million.
on december 10, 2021, the consolidated entity in which we have a 55% interest refinanced the mortgage loan collateralized by its 601 lexington avenue property located in new york city with a new lender. the mortgage loan has a principal amount of $1.0 billion, requires interest-only payments at a fixed interest rate of 2.79% per annum and matures on january 9, 2032. the previous mortgage loan had an outstanding balance of approximately $616.1 million, bore interest at a fixed rate of 4.75% per annum and was scheduled to mature on april 10, 2022. there was no prepayment penalty associated with the repayment of the previous mortgage loan. we recognized a loss from early extinguishment of debt totaling approximately $0.1 million due to the write-off of unamortized deferred financing costs.

interest expense directly related to the development of rental properties is capitalized and included in real estate assets on our consolidated balance sheets and amortized over the useful lives of the real estate or lease term. as portions of properties are placed in-service, we cease capitalizing interest on that portion and interest is then expensed. interest capitalized for the years ended december 31, 2022 and 2021 was approximately $52.1 million and $53.1 million, respectively. these costs are not included in the interest expense referenced above.
we expect our interest expense will be materially greater in 2023 compared to 2022 due to the cessation of capitalized interest on our development deliveries, acquisitions funded by debt, higher interest rates on our floating rate debt, and the impact of refinancing our 2023 debt maturities at materially higher interest rates.
at december 31, 2022, our variable rate debt consisted of bplp's $1.5 billion revolving facility (the "revolving facility") and bplp's $730.0 million 2022 unsecured term loan. the revolving facility and 2022 unsecured term loan had approximately $730.0 million outstanding as of december 31, 2022 (see note 16 to the consolidated financial statements). for a summary of our consolidated debt as of december 31, 2022 and 2021 refer to the heading "liquidity and capital resources-debt financing" within "item 7-management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations."

noncontrolling interest-common units of the operating partnership for bxp, noncontrolling interest-common units of the operating partnership increased by approximately $40.8 million for the year ended december 31, 2022 compared to 2021 due primarily to an increase in allocable income, which was the result of recognizing a greater gain on sales of real estate amount during 2022. due to our ownership structure, there is no corresponding line item on bplp's financial statements.
preferred stock/unit redemption charge on march 2, 2021, bxp issued a redemption notice for 80,000 shares of its 5.25% series b cumulative redeemable preferred stock ("series b preferred stock"), which constituted all of the outstanding series b preferred stock, and the corresponding depositary shares, each representing 1/100th of a share of series b preferred stock (the "depositary shares"). in connection with the redemption of the series b preferred stock, all of the series b preferred units, which had terms and preferences generally mirroring those of the series b preferred stock, were redeemed by bplp. the redemption price per share of series b preferred stock was $2,500, plus all accrued and unpaid dividends to, but not including, the redemption date, totaling $2,516.41 per share.  on march 31, 2021, we transferred the full redemption price for all outstanding shares of series b preferred stock of approximately $201.3 million, including approximately $1.3 million of accrued and unpaid dividends to, but not including, the redemption date, to the redemption agent. the excess of the redemption price over the carrying value of the series b preferred stock and series b preferred units of approximately $6.4 million relates to the original issuance costs and is reflected as a reduction to net income attributable to boston properties, inc. common shareholders and net income attributable to boston properties limited partnership common unitholders on the consolidated income statement.
liquidity and capital resources general our principal liquidity needs for the next twelve months and beyond are to:
•fund normal recurring expenses;
•meet debt service and principal repayment obligations and balloon payments on maturing debt, including the $500 million of 3.125% unsecured senior notes maturing september 1, 2023;
•fund development and redevelopment costs;
•fund capital expenditures, including major renovations, tenant improvements and leasing costs;
•fund pending and possible acquisitions of properties, either directly or indirectly through the acquisition of equity interests therein; and
•make the minimum distribution required to enable bxp to maintain its reit qualification under the internal revenue code of 1986, as amended.
we expect to satisfy these needs using one or more of the following:
•cash flow from operations;
•distribution of cash flows from joint ventures;
•cash and cash equivalent balances;
•borrowings under bplp's revolving facility, unsecured term loans, short-term bridge facilities and construction loans;
•long-term secured and unsecured indebtedness (including unsecured exchangeable indebtedness);
•sales of real estate and interests in joint ventures owning real estate;
•private equity sources, including through our strategic capital program ("scp") with large institutional investors; and
•issuances of bxp equity securities and/or preferred or common units of partnership interests in bplp.
we draw on multiple financing sources to fund our long-term capital needs. we expect to fund our current development/redevelopment properties primarily with our available cash balances, construction loans, unsecured term loans, proceeds from asset sales and bplp's revolving facility. we use bplp's revolving facility primarily as a bridge facility to fund acquisition opportunities, refinance outstanding indebtedness and meet short-term development and working capital needs. although we may seek to fund our development projects with construction loans, which may require guarantees by bplp, the financing for each particular project ultimately depends on several factors, including, among others, the project's size and duration, the extent of pre-leasing, our available cash and access to cost effective capital at the given time.

(11)percentage leased excludes the residential property and the view boston observatory at the prudential center (redevelopment) at 800 boylston street - the prudential center. estimated total investment excludes approximately $1.2 billion related to the development of 290 binney street and approximately $210 million related to the redevelopment of 300 binney street which was still in-service at december 31, 2022. we terminated our existing lease agreement with a client at 300 binney street to facilitate the redevelopment of the property, which commenced in january 2023. 290 binney street and 300 binney street are 100% pre-leased. see note 16 to the consolidated financial statements.
lease revenue (which includes recoveries from clients), other income from operations, available cash balances, mortgage financings, unsecured indebtedness and draws on bplp's revolving facility are the principal sources of capital that we use to fund operating expenses, debt service, maintenance and repositioning capital expenditures, tenant improvements and the minimum distribution required to enable bxp to maintain its reit qualification. we seek to maximize income from our existing properties by maintaining quality standards for our properties that promote high occupancy rates and permit increases in rental rates while reducing client turnover and controlling operating expenses. our sources of revenue also include third-party fees generated by our property management, leasing, development and construction businesses, as well as the sale of assets from time to time. we believe these sources of capital will continue to provide the funds necessary for our short-term liquidity needs. material adverse changes in one or more sources of capital may adversely affect our net cash flows.
we expect our primary uses of capital over the next twelve months will be to fund the continuation and completion of our current and committed development and redevelopment projects, repay debt maturities (as discussed below), service the interest payments on our outstanding indebtedness, and satisfy our reit distribution requirements.
as of december 31, 2022, we had 13 properties under development or redevelopment. our share of the estimated total cost for these projects is approximately $1.9 billion, of which approximately $729.1 million remains to be funded with equity through 2026. in the fourth quarter of 2022, we commenced the redevelopment of 105 carnegie center in princeton, new jersey. 105 carnegie center is an approximately 70,000 net rentable square feet property that will be converted into an approximately 73,000 square foot laboratory/life sciences property for an approximate cost of $40.6 million.
in january 2023, we added the following new projects to our active development and redevelopment portfolio (see note 16 to the consolidated financial statements):
•290 binney steet in cambridge, massachusetts, an approximately 566,000 net rentable square foot laboratory/life sciences project. the project has a total budget of approximately $1.2 billion and is expected to be completed in 2026. the project is 100% pre-leased to astrazeneca.
•300 binney street in cambridge, massachusetts. the conversion of this approximately 195,000 net rentable square foot property into an approximately 240,000 net rentable square foot laboratory/life sciences property has a total budgeted cost of $210.0 million. this project is 100% pre-leased.
as of february, 21, 2023, we had 15 properties under development or redevelopment. our share of the estimated total cost for these projects is approximately $3.3 billion.
on november 17, 2022, we acquired a 26.69% interest in the joint venture that owns 200 fifth avenue for a gross purchase price of approximately $280.2 million, which include $120.1 million of cash and our pro rata share of the outstanding loan secured by the property of $160.1 million. 200 fifth avenue is a 14-story, approximately 855,000 square foot leed gold certified, premier workplace located in the midtown south submarket of manhattan, new york. the property was 93% leased as of december 31, 2022.
in the fourth quarter of 2022, we completed the sale of the residential component of the avant at reston town center, located in reston, virginia, for a gross sale price of $141.0 million. the avant is a 15-story, approximately 329,000 square foot, excluding retail space, 359-unit, luxury multifamily property.
aggregating our pro rata share of 2022 capital markets activity, we purchased properties or interests in joint ventures that own property of approximately $1.6 billion, sold properties or parcels of land for gross sales prices of approximately $864.2 million, commenced development and redevelopment projects, including projects that commenced in the first quarter of 2023, of approximately $2.0 billion and completed approximately $1.8 billion of debt financing.
in july 2021, we announced the formation of the scp with two partners each having a targeted equity commitment of $1.0 billion and a $250 million commitment from us. under this agreement, we agreed to provide these partners, for up to two years, exclusive first offers to form joint ventures with us to invest in assets that meet target criteria. all investments are discretionary to each partner.
the scp provides us the opportunity to partner with large institutional investors and capitalize our investment opportunities partially through private equity. the scp enhances our access to capital and investment capacity, enhances our returns through fee income, and in some investments provides us the opportunity to realize a greater share of income upon achieving certain success criteria. these large financial partners are among the world's largest sovereign wealth funds and pension plans. as we move forward, we anticipate increasing our use of joint venture partner equity to manage our debt levels.
on january 4, 2023, we entered into a credit agreement that provided for a $1.2 billion unsecured term loan facility (the "2023 unsecured term loan"). under the credit agreement, we may, at any time prior to the maturity date, increase total commitments by up to an additional $300.0 million in aggregate principal amount by increasing the existing 2023 unsecured term loan or incurring one or more additional term loans, in each case, subject to syndication of the increase and other conditions. the 2023 unsecured term loan matures on may 16, 2024, with one 12-month extension option, subject to customary conditions. upon entry into the credit agreement, we borrowed the full $1.2 billion available under the 2023 unsecured term loan, a portion of which was used to repay in full the 2022 unsecured term loan, which was scheduled to mature on may 16, 2023.
after repayment of the $730.0 million 2022 unsecured term loan on january 4, 2023, our remaining 2023 and 2024 debt maturities include (1) $500.0 million aggregate principal amount of bplp's 3.125% senior unsecured notes, which mature on september 1, 2023, (2) $700.0 million aggregate principal amount of bplp's 3.800% senior unsecured notes, which mature on february 1, 2024 and (3) the $1.2 billion 2023 unsecured term loan. in our unconsolidated joint venture portfolio, we have approximately $603.2 million (our share) of debt maturating in 2023 and 2024. we expect to fund 2023 and 2024 debt maturities using available cash balances, proceeds from asset sales, draws on bplp's revolving facility, and/or through refinancings. we expect our interest expense will be materially greater in 2023 compared to 2022 due to the cessation of capitalized interest on our development deliveries, acquisitions funded by debt, higher interest rates on our floating rate debt, and the impact of refinancing our 2023 debt maturities at materially higher interest rates.
as of february 21, 2023, we had available cash of approximately $833.3 million (of which approximately $79.9 million is attributable to our consolidated joint venture partners). our liquidity and capital resources depend on a wide range of factors and we believe that our access to capital and our strong liquidity, including the approximately $1.5 billion available under the revolving facility and our available cash, as of february 21, 2023, are sufficient to fund our remaining capital requirements on existing development and redevelopment projects, fund acquisitions, repay our maturing indebtedness when due (if not refinanced), satisfy our reit distribution requirements and still allow us to act opportunistically on attractive investment opportunities.
we may seek to enhance our liquidity to fund our current and future development activity, pursue additional attractive investment opportunities and refinance or repay indebtedness. depending on interest rates, the overall conditions in the debt and public and private equity markets, and our leverage at the time, we may decide to access one or more of these capital sources (including utilization of bxp's $600.0 million "at the market" equity offering program). doing so may result in us carrying additional cash and cash equivalents pending our use of the proceeds, which could increase our net interest expense or be dilutive to our earnings, or both.
we have not sold any shares under bxp's $600.0 million "at the market" equity offering program.
inflation we are exposed to inflation risk, as income from long-term leases is the primary source of our cash flows from operations. there are provisions in the majority of our client leases that protect us from, and mitigate the risk of, the impact of inflation. these provisions include rent steps and resets to market, reimbursement billings for operating expense pass-through charges, real estate tax and insurance reimbursements on a per-square-foot basis, or in some cases, annual reimbursement of operating expenses above a certain per-square-foot allowance. however, due to the long-term nature of the leases, the rent may not increase frequently enough to fully cover inflation.
reit tax distribution considerations dividend bxp as a reit is subject to a number of organizational and operational requirements, including a requirement that bxp currently distribute at least 90% of its annual taxable income (excluding capital gains and with certain other adjustments). our policy is for bxp to distribute at least 100% of its taxable income, including capital gains, to avoid paying federal tax. common and ltip unitholders (other than unearned myltip units) of limited partnership interest in bplp receive the same total distribution per unit.
bxp's board of directors will continue to evaluate bxp's dividend rate in light of our actual and projected taxable income (including gains on sales), liquidity requirements and other circumstances and there can be no assurance that the future dividends declared by bxp's board of directors will not differ materially from the current quarterly dividend amount.
sales to the extent that we sell assets at a gain and cannot efficiently use the proceeds in a tax deferred manner for either our development activities or attractive acquisitions, bxp would, at the appropriate time, decide whether it is better to declare a special dividend, adopt a stock repurchase program, reduce indebtedness or retain the cash for future investment opportunities. such a decision will depend on many factors including, among others, the timing, availability and terms of development and acquisition opportunities, our then-current and anticipated leverage, the cost and availability of capital from other sources, the price of bxp's common stock and reit distribution requirements. at a minimum, we expect that bxp would distribute at least that amount of proceeds necessary for bxp to avoid paying corporate level tax on the applicable gains realized from any asset sales.
from time to time in select cases, whether due to a change in use, structuring issues to comply with applicable reit regulations or other reasons, we may sell an asset that is held by a taxable reit subsidiary ("trs"). such a sale by a trs would be subject to federal and local taxes.
cash flow summary the following summary discussion of our cash flows is based on the consolidated statements of cash flows and is not meant to be an all-inclusive discussion of the changes in our cash flows for the periods presented below.
cash and cash equivalents and cash held in escrows aggregated approximately $736.8 million and $501.2 million at december 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, representing an increase of approximately $235.7 million. the following table sets forth changes in cash flows:

our principal source of cash flow is related to the operation of our properties. the weighted-average term of our in-place leases, including leases signed by our unconsolidated joint ventures, excluding residential units, was approximately 7.9 years as of december 31, 2022, with occupancy rates historically in the range of 88% to 94%. generally, our properties generate a relatively consistent stream of cash flow that provides us with resources to pay operating expenses, debt service and fund regular quarterly dividend and distribution payment requirements. in addition, over the past several years, we have raised capital through the sale of some of our properties and through secured and unsecured borrowings.
cash is used in investing activities to fund acquisitions, development, net investments in unconsolidated joint ventures and maintenance and repositioning capital expenditures. we selectively invest in new projects that enable us to take advantage of our development, leasing, financing and property management skills and invest in existing buildings to enhance or maintain our market position. cash used in investing activities for the years ended december 31, 2022 and december 31, 2021 is detailed below:

(1)values are based on the closing price per share of bxp's common stock on the new york stock exchange on december 30, 2022 of $67.58.
(2)includes long-term incentive plan units (including 2012 opp units and 2013 - 2019 myltip units) but excludes the 2020 - 2022 myltip units because the three-year performance periods had not ended as of december 31, 2022.

consolidated debt to consolidated market capitalization ratio is a measure of leverage commonly used by analysts in the reit sector. we present this measure as a percentage and it is calculated by dividing (a) our consolidated debt by (b) our consolidated market capitalization, which is the market value of our outstanding equity securities plus our consolidated debt. consolidated market capitalization is the sum of:
(1) our consolidated debt; plus
(2) the product of (x) the closing price per share of bxp common stock on december 31, 2022, as reported by the new york stock exchange, multiplied by (y) the sum of:
(i) the number of outstanding shares of common stock of bxp,
(ii) the number of outstanding op units in bplp (excluding op units held by bxp),
(iii) the number of op units issuable upon conversion of all outstanding ltip units, assuming all conditions have been met for the conversion of the ltip units, and
(iv) the number of op units issuable upon conversion of 2012 opp units, and 2013 - 2019 myltip units that were issued in the form of ltip units.
the calculation of consolidated market capitalization does not include ltip units issued in the form of myltip awards unless and until certain performance thresholds are achieved and they are earned. because their three-year performance periods have not yet ended, 2020 - 2022 myltip units are not included in this calculation as of december 31, 2022.
we also present bxp's share of market capitalization and bxp's share of debt/bxp's share of market capitalization, which are calculated in the same manner, except that bxp's share of debt is utilized instead of our consolidated debt in both the numerator and the denominator. bxp's share of debt is defined as our consolidated debt plus our share of debt from our unconsolidated joint ventures (calculated based upon our ownership percentage), minus our partners' share of debt from our consolidated joint ventures (calculated based upon the partners' percentage ownership interests adjusted for basis differentials). management believes that bxp's share of debt provides useful information to investors regarding our financial condition because it includes our share of debt from unconsolidated joint ventures and excludes our partners' share of debt from consolidated joint ventures, in each case presented on the same basis. we have several significant joint ventures and presenting various measures of financial condition in this manner can help investors better understand our financial condition and/or results of operations after taking into account our economic interest in these joint ventures.  we caution investors that the ownership percentages used in calculating bxp's share of debt may not completely and accurately depict all of the legal and economic implications of holding an interest in a consolidated or unconsolidated joint venture. for example, in addition to partners' interests in profits and capital, venture agreements vary in the allocation of rights regarding decision making (both for routine and major decisions), distributions, transferability of interests, financing and guarantees, liquidations and other matters.  moreover, in some cases we exercise significant influence over, but do not control, the joint venture in which case gaap requires that we account for the joint venture entity using the equity method of accounting and we do not consolidate it for financial reporting purposes. in other cases, gaap requires that we consolidate the venture even though our partner(s) own(s) a significant percentage interest. as a result, management believes that the presentation of bxp's share of a financial measure should not be considered a substitute for, and should only be considered with and as a supplement to our financial information presented in accordance with gaap.
we present these supplemental ratios because our degree of leverage could affect our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, development or other general corporate purposes and because different investors and lenders consider one or both of these ratios. investors should understand that these ratios are, in part, a function of the market price of the common stock of bxp and as such will fluctuate with changes in such price, and they do not necessarily reflect our capacity to incur additional debt to finance our activities or our ability to manage our existing debt obligations. however, for a company like bxp, whose assets are primarily income-producing real estate, these ratios may provide investors with an alternate indication of leverage, so long as they are evaluated along with the ratio of indebtedness to other measures of asset value used by financial analysts and other financial ratios, as well as the various components of our outstanding indebtedness.
for a discussion of our unconsolidated joint venture indebtedness, see "liquidity and capital resources-investment in unconsolidated joint ventures - secured debt" within "item 7-management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations" and for a discussion of our consolidated joint venture indebtedness see "liquidity and capital resources-mortgage notes payable" within "item 7-management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations."
debt financing as of december 31, 2022, we had approximately $14.2 billion of outstanding consolidated indebtedness, representing approximately 54.63% of our consolidated market capitalization as calculated above consisting of approximately (1) $10.2 billion (net of discount and deferred financing fees) in publicly traded unsecured senior notes having a gaap weighted-average interest rate of 3.69% per annum and maturities in 2023 through 2033, (2) $3.3 billion (net of deferred financing fees) of property-specific mortgage debt having a gaap weighted-average interest rate of 3.42% per annum and a weighted-average term of 5.8 years and (3) $730.0 million outstanding under bplp's 2022 unsecured term loan that was scheduled to mature on may 16, 2023 and was repaid subsequent to december 31, 2022 (see notes 7 and 16 to the consolidated financial statements).

unsecured credit facility on june 15, 2021, bplp amended and restated its prior credit facility (as amended and restated, the "2021 credit facility"). the 2021 credit facility provides for borrowings of up to $1.5 billion through the revolving facility, subject to customary conditions. among other things, the 2021 credit facility (1) extended the maturity date from april 24, 2022 to june 15, 2026, (2) eliminated the $500.0 million delayed draw facility (3) reduced the per annum variable interest rates on borrowings and (4) added a sustainability-linked pricing component. under the 2021 credit facility, bplp may increase the total commitment by up to $500.0 million by increasing the amount of the revolving facility and/or by incurring one or more term loans, in each case, subject to syndication of the increase and other conditions. based on bplp's december 31, 2022 credit rating, (1) the applicable eurocurrency and libor daily floating rate margins are 0.775%, (2) the alternate base rate margin is zero basis points and (3) the facility fee is 0.15% per annum. the 2021 credit facility includes provisions which allow libor daily floating rate to be switched to sofr.
at december 31, 2022 and february 21, 2023, bplp had no borrowings under its revolving facility and outstanding letters of credit totaling approximately $6.4 million, with the ability to borrow approximately $1.5 billion.
unsecured term loans on may 17, 2022, bplp entered into the 2022 unsecured term loan, which provided for a single borrowing of up to $730.0 million. the 2022 unsecured term loan was scheduled to mature on may 16, 2023.

market risk market risk is the risk of loss from adverse changes in market prices and interest rates. our future earnings, cash flows and fair values relevant to financial instruments are dependent upon prevalent market interest rates. our primary market risk results from our indebtedness, which bears interest at fixed and variable rates. the fair value of our debt obligations are affected by changes in the market interest rates. we manage our market risk by matching long-term leases with long-term, fixed-rate, non-recourse debt of similar duration. we continue to follow a conservative strategy of generally pre-leasing development projects on a long-term basis to creditworthy clients in order to achieve the most favorable construction and permanent financing terms. approximately 94.9% of our outstanding debt, excluding our unconsolidated joint ventures, has fixed interest rates, which minimizes the interest rate risk through the maturity of such outstanding debt. we also manage our market risk by entering into hedging arrangements with financial institutions. our primary objectives when undertaking hedging transactions and derivative positions is to reduce our floating rate exposure and to fix a portion of the interest rate for anticipated financing and refinancing transactions. this in turn, reduces the risks that the variability of cash flows imposes on variable rate debt. our strategy mitigates against future increases in our interest rates.
at december 31, 2022, our weighted-average coupon/stated rate on our fixed rate outstanding consolidated debt was 3.51% per annum. at december 31, 2022, we had $730.0 million of consolidated variable rate debt outstanding. at december 31, 2022, the gaap interest rate on our variable rate debt was approximately 4.85% per annum. if market interest rates on our variable rate debt had been 100 basis points greater, total interest expense would have increased approximately $7.3 million, on an annualized basis, for the year ended december 31, 2022.
the information above does not include our unconsolidated joint venture debt. for a discussion concerning our unconsolidated joint venture debt, see note 6 to the consolidated financial statements and "item 7-management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations-liquidity and capital resources-investment in unconsolidated joint ventures - secured debt."
funds from operations pursuant to the revised definition of funds from operations adopted by the board of governors of the national association of real estate investment trusts ("nareit"), we calculate funds from operations, or "ffo," for each of bxp and bplp by adjusting net income (loss) attributable to boston properties, inc. common shareholders and net income (loss) attributable to boston properties limited partnership common unitholders (computed in accordance with gaap), respectively, for gains (or losses) from sales of properties, impairment losses on depreciable real estate consolidated on our balance sheet, impairment losses on our investments in unconsolidated joint ventures driven by a measurable decrease in the fair value of depreciable real estate held by the unconsolidated joint ventures and our share of real estate-related depreciation and amortization. ffo is a non-gaap financial measure. we believe the presentation of ffo, combined with the presentation of required gaap financial measures, improves the understanding of operating results of reits among the investing public and helps make comparisons of reit operating results more meaningful. management generally considers ffo to be useful measures for understanding and comparing our operating results because, by excluding gains and losses related to sales of previously depreciated operating real estate assets, impairment losses and real estate asset depreciation and amortization (which can differ across owners of similar assets in similar condition based on historical cost accounting and useful life estimates), ffo can help investors compare the operating performance of a company's real estate across reporting periods and to the operating performance of other companies.
our computation of ffo may not be comparable to ffo reported by other reits or real estate companies that do not define the term in accordance with the current nareit definition or that interpret the current nareit definition differently. we believe that in order to facilitate a clear understanding of our operating results, ffo should be examined in conjunction with net income attributable to boston properties, inc. common shareholders and net income attributable to boston properties limited partnership common unitholders as presented in our consolidated financial statements. ffo should not be considered as a substitute for net income attributable to boston properties, inc. common shareholders or net income attributable to boston properties limited partnership common unitholders (determined in accordance with gaap) or any other gaap financial measures and should only be considered together with and as a supplement to our financial information prepared in accordance with gaap.

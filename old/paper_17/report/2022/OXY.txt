revolving credit facility in december 2021, occidental entered into the second amended and restated credit agreement in which the total committed borrowing capacity of $ 4.0billion is based on a sofr benchmark. the interest rate margin and the facility fee rates are subject to adjustments based on occidental's performance on specified sustainability target thresholds with respect to absolute reductions in ghg emissions from its worldwide operated assets. the rcf maturity date is june 30, 2025.
borrowings under the rcf bear interest at sofr benchmark rates, plus a margin based on occidental's senior debt ratings. the facility has similar terms to other debt agreements and does not contain material adverse change clauses or debt ratings triggers that could restrict occidental's ability to borrow, or that would permit lenders to terminate their commitments or accelerate debt repayment. the facility provides for the termination of loan commitments and requires immediate repayment of any outstanding amounts if certain events of default occur. as of the date of this filing, occidental had no drawn amounts under the rcf. in 2022, occidental paid average annual facility fees of 0.302% on the total commitment amount.
receivables securitization facility in december 2021, occidental amended and extended its existing receivables securitization facility to december
2024. as of december 31, 2022, the facility had $ 400million of available borrowing capacity and no drawn amounts.
subsequent to december 31, 2022, but before the date of this filing, occidental amended the facility to expand its available borrowing capacity to $ 600million. the amended facility includes adjustments based on the same specified sustainability target thresholds as contained in the rcf.

financial statementsfootnotes note 7 - lease commitments occidental identifies leases through its accounts payable and contract monitoring processes. lease assets and liabilities are recognized at commencement date based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term.
lease assets include the lease liability, upfront payments and costs incurred to execute the lease and are amortized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. occidental assesses the likelihood of exercising renewal, termination and purchase options to determine the lease term. occidental uses its incremental borrowing rate at commencement date to determine the present value of lease payments. the incremental borrowing rate is the rate of interest that occidental would pay to borrow an amount equal to the lease payments over a similar term on a collateralized basis in a similar economic environment. certain leases include variable lease payments based on the underlying asset's operations that are not included in the lease asset and liability.
occid ental has operating leases for oil and gas exploration and development equipment, including office space of $
352million, offshore and onshore drilling rigs of $ 169million, compressors of $ 113million and $ 60million consisting of storage facilities and other field equipment. operating lease terms generally range from oneto eight years. operating leases also include pipelines, rail cars, easements, aircraft and real estate of $ 236million.
these operating leases have contract expiration terms ranging from oneto 10years.
occidental's finance leases include compressors of $ 378million, real estate offices of $ 266million and $
45million consisting of drilling rigs, vehicles and aircraft leases.

financial statementsfootnotes note 8 - derivatives objective and strategy occidental uses a variety of derivative financial instruments and physical contracts to manage its exposure to commodity price fluctuations, transportation commitments and to fix margins on the future sale of stored commodity volumes. occidental also enters into derivative financial instruments for trading purposes. derivatives are carried at fair value and on a net basis when a legal right of offset exists with the same counterparty.
occidental may elect normal purchases and normal sales exclusions when physically delivered commodities are purchased or sold to a customer. occidental occasionally applies cash flow hedge accounting treatment to derivative financial instruments to lock in margins on the forecasted sales of its natural gas storage volumes. the value of cash flow hedges was insignificant for all periods presented. see note 1 - summary of significant accounting policies for occidental's accounting policy on derivatives.
derivatives not designated as hedging instruments as of december 31, 2022, occidental's derivatives not designated as hedges consisted of marketing derivatives. all interest rate swaps were settled prior to december 31, 2022.
derivative instruments that are not designated as hedging instruments are required to be recorded on the balance sheet at fair value. changes in fair value will impact occidental's earnings through mark-to-market adjustments until the physical commodity is delivered or the financial instrument is settled.
marketing derivatives occidental's marketing derivative instruments not designated as hedges are short-duration physical and financial forward contracts. a substantial majority of occidental's physically settled derivative contracts are index-based and carry no mark-to-market valuation in earnings. as of december 31, 2022, the weighted-average settlement price of these forward contracts was $ 81.37/bbl and $ 7.89/mcf for crude oil and natural gas, respectively. the weighted-average settlement price was $ 74.85/bbl and $ 4.61/mcf for crude oil and natural gas, respectively, as of december 31, 2021. net gains and losses associated with marketing derivative instruments not designated as hedging instruments are recognized currently in net sales.
the following table summarizes net short volumes associated with the outstanding marketing commodity derivatives not designated as hedging instruments as of december 31:
2022          2021
oil commodity contracts volume (mmbbl)                      -33           -28
natural gas commodity contracts volume (bcf)                       -112          -136
interest rate swaps occidental retired all remaining outstanding interest rate swaps in the twelve months ended december 31, 2022.
occidental's interest rate swap contracts locked in a fixed interest rate in exchange for a floating interest rate indexed to the three-month libor throughout the reference period. net gains and losses associated with interest rate swaps and warrants, were recognized currently in gains (losses) on interest rate swaps, net in the consolidated statements of operations.
interest rate swaps and collateralization are classified as cash flows from financing activities. for the twelve months ended december 31, 2022, the interest rate swaps were terminated through the application of $ 144million of collateral and cash payments of $ 255million. prior to termination, occidental paid $ 35million of periodic settlements and $ 179million of collateral was returned.
fair value of derivatives occidental has categorized its assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value in a three-level fair value hierarchy, based on the inputs to the valuation techniques: level 1 - using quoted prices in active markets for the assets or liabilities; level 2 - using observable inputs other than quoted prices for the assets or liabilities;
and level 3 - using unobservable inputs. transfers between levels, if any, are reported at the end of each reporting period. the following table presents the fair values of occidental's outstanding derivatives. fair values are presented at gross amounts below, including when derivatives are subject to netting arrangements, and are presented on a net basis in the consolidated balance sheets.

credit risk the majority of occidental's counterparty credit risk is related to the physical delivery of energy commodities to its customers and their inability to meet their settlement commitments. occidental manages credit risk by selecting counterparties that it believes to be financially strong, by entering into netting arrangements with counterparties and by requiring collateral or other credit risk mitigants, as appropriate. occidental actively evaluates the creditworthiness of its counterparties, assigns appropriate credit limits and monitors credit exposures against those assigned limits. occidental also enters into futures contracts through regulated exchanges with select clearinghouses and brokers, which are subject to minimal credit risk, if any.
certain of occidental's otc derivative instruments contain credit-risk-contingent features, primarily tied to credit ratings for occidental or its counterparties, which may affect the amount of collateral that each party would need to post. the aggregate fair value of derivative instruments with credit-risk-contingent features for which a net liability position existed as of december 31, 2022 was $ 18million. the aggregate fair value of derivative instruments with credit-risk-contingent features for which a net liability position existed as of december 31, 2021 was $ 107million (net of $ 323million of collateral), which was primarily related to interest rate swaps.

goodwill in the first quarter of 2020, occidental impaired $ 1.2billion in goodwill related to occidental's ownership in wes, which was previously included in long-term receivables and other assets, net. the market value of wes'
publicly traded units is considered a level 1 input.
oil and gas properties in the second quarter of 2020, as a result of the expected prolonged period of lower commodity prices brought on by the covid-19 pandemic's impact on oil demand, occidental tested substantially all of its oil and gas assets for impairment. occidental recognized total pre-tax impairments to its oil and gas proved and unproved properties of $
8.6billion, of which $ 6.4billion was included in oil and gas segment results and $ 2.2billion ($ 1.4billion net of tax) related to ghana was included in discontinued operations.
in the second quarter of 2020, occidental recorded proved property pre-tax impairments of $ 1.2billion primarily related to certain assets for its domestic onshore and gulf of mexico assets and $ 0.9billion to adjust the algeria oil and gas proved properties to their fair value. the fair value of the proved properties was measured based on the income approach.
unproved property pre-tax impairments of $ 4.3billion were primarily related to domestic onshore unproved acreage.
the fair value of this acreage was measured based on a market approach using an implied acreage valuation derived from domestic onshore market participants excluding the fair value assigned to proved properties.
income approaches are considered level 3 fair value estimates and include significant assumptions of future production and timing of production, commodity price assumptions and operating and capital cost estimates, discounted using a 10percent weighted average cost of capital. taxes were based on current statutory rates. future production and timing of production is based on internal reserves estimates and internal economic models for a specific oil and gas asset. internal reserve estimates consist of proved reserves and unproved reserves, the latter adjusted for uncertainty based on reserve category. price assumptions were based on a combination of market information and published industry resources adjusted for historical differentials. price assumptions ranged from approximately $ 40per barrel of oil in 2020 increasing to approximately $ 70per barrel of oil in 2034, with an unweighted arithmetic average price of $ 59.17and $ 62.42for wti and brent indexed assets for the 15year period, respectively. natural gas prices ranged from approximately $ 2.00per mcf in 2020 to approximately $ 3.60per mcf in
2034, with an unweighted arithmetic average price of $ 3.13for nymex based assets for the 15year period. both oil and natural gas commodity prices were held flat after 2034 and were adjusted for location and quality differentials. operating and capital cost estimates were based on current observable costs and were further escalated 1percent in every period where commodity prices exceeded $ 50per barrel and 2percent in every period where commodity prices exceeded $ 60per barrel. the weighted average cost of capital is calculated based on industry peers and best approximates the cost of capital an external market participant would expect to obtain.
in the first quarter of 2020, occidental's oil and gas segment recognized pre-tax impairment and related charges of
$ 581million primarily related to both proved and unproved oil and gas properties and a lower of cost or net realizable value adjustment for crude inventory. occidental recorded proved property impairments of $ 293million related to certain international assets and the gulf of mexico. occidental recorded unproved property impairments, of approximately $ 241million, primarily related to domestic onshore undeveloped leases and offshore gulf of mexico where occidental no
36oxy2022 form 10-k financial statementsfootnotes longer intends to pursue exploration, appraisal or development activities primarily due to the reduction in near-
term capital plans.
if there is an adverse downturn of the macroeconomic conditions and if such downturn is expected to or does persist for a prolonged period of time, occidental's oil and gas properties may be subject to further testing for impairment, which could result in additional non-cash asset impairments. such impairments could be material to the financial statements.
wes equity investment at the end of the third quarter of 2020, occidental recorded an other-than-temporary impairment of $ 2.7billion, as the fair value of occidental's investment in wes had remained significantly lower than its book value for the majority of the nine months ended september 30, 2020. occidental concluded that the difference between the fair value and book value of wes was not temporary, primarily given both the magnitude and the duration that the fair value was below its book value. this other-than-temporary impairment was calculated based on the closing market price of wes as of september 30, 2020. the market value of wes' publicly traded common units is considered a level
1 input.
financial instruments fair value the carrying amounts of cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash, restricted cash equivalents and other on-balance sheet financial instruments, other than fixed-rate debt, approximate fair value. see note 6 - long-term debt for the fair value of long-term debt.
note 10 - income taxes legal entity reorganization to align occidental's legal entity structure with the nature of its business activities after completing the acquisition of anadarko and subsequent large scale post-acquisition divestiture program, management undertook a legal entity reorganization that was completed in the first quarter of 2022.
as a result of this legal entity reorganization, management made an adjustment to the tax basis in a portion of its operating assets, thus reducing occidental's deferred tax liabilities. accordingly, in 2022, occidental recorded a tax benefit of $ 2.7billion in connection with this reorganization. the timing of any reduction in occidental's future cash taxes as a result of this legal entity reorganization will be dependent on a number of factors, including prevailing commodity prices, capital activity level and production mix. the legal entity reorganization transaction is currently under irs review as part of the company's 2022 federal tax audit.
inflation reduction act in august 2022, congress passed the inflation reduction act that contains, among other provisions, a corporate book minimum tax on financial statement income, an excise tax on stock buybacks, a methane emissions fee and certain tax incentives related to climate change and clean energy. occidental is currently evaluating the provisions of this act. the ultimate impact of the inflation reduction act to occidental will depend on a number of factors including future commodity prices, interpretations and assumptions as well as additional regulatory guidance.

7.7billion and $ 10.5billion as of december 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. the decrease in the net deferred tax liability in 2022 compared to 2021 was primarily driven by a tax benefit associated with occidental's legal entity reorganization, as described above, partially offset by the utilization of net operating losses and other tax attributes.
as of december 31, 2022, occidental had foreign tax credit carryforwards of $ 3.6billion a nd state tax credit carryforwards of $ 30million. occidental had recorded a valuation allowance fo r $ 3.6billion of the foreign tax credit carryforwards a nd $ 27million of the state tax credit carryforwards.

184million of the tax-effected state net operating loss carryforwards and $ 801million of the tax-effected foreign net operating loss carryforwards. occidental had an additional valuation allowance of $ 145million against other foreign deferred tax assets.
occidental had no tax-effected federal interest expense carryforward and tax-effected state interest expense carryforward of $ 11million as of december 31, 2022. occidental recorded a valuation allowance for $ 9million of the state interest expense carryforward .
a deferred tax liability had not been recognized for temporary differences related to unremitted earnings of certain consolidated international subsidiaries aggregating approximately $ 924million as of december 31, 2022, as it is occidental's intention to reinvest such earnings indefinitely. if the earnings of these international subsidiaries were not indefinitely reinvested, an additional deferred tax liability of approximately $ 221million would be required.

the december 31, 2022 balance of unrecognized tax benefits of $ 2.0billion included potential benefits of $
2.0billion of which, if recognized, $ 1.5billion would affect the effective tax rate on income. also included were benefits of $ 45million related to tax positions for which the ultimate deductibility is highly certain, but the timing of such deductibility is uncertain. unrecognized tax benefits are included in deferred credits and other liabilities - other. occidental records estimated potential interest and penalties related to liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits in the provisions for domestic and foreign income taxes. during 2022, occidental recorded interest related to liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits of $ 95million, for a cumulative accrued interest related to liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits of $ 416million as of december 31, 2022. there were nopenalties associated with liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits recorded for the years ended december 31,
2022 and 2021. over the next 12 months, it is reasonably possible that the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits could decrease by $ 50million to $ 60million due to settlements with taxing authorities or lapses in statutes of limitation.
occidental recognized $ 280million and $ 105million in federal and state income tax receivables as of december 31,
2022 and 2021, respectively, which was recorded in other current assets. in addition, occidental recognized $
33million associated with the december 31, 2021 au dit, which was recorded in long-term receivables and other assets, net.
occidental is subject to audit by various tax authorities in varying periods. see note 13 - lawsuits, claims, commitments and contingencies for a discussion of these matters.
note 11 - retirement and postretirement benefit plans occidental has various defined contribution and defined benefit plans for its salaried, domestic union and nonunion hourly and certain foreign national employees. in addition, occidental also provides medical and other benefits for certain active, retired and disabled employees and their eligible dependents.
in 2021, occidental settled a significant portion of retiree liability through an annuity purchase. this annuity purchase applied to participants in certain defined benefit plans. the impact of this settlement transaction was approximately $ 109million and is reflected in the december 31, 2021 projected benefit obligation.
defined contribution plans all domestic employees and certain foreign national employees are eligible to participate in one or more of the defined contribution retirement or savings plans that provide for periodic contributions by occidental based on plan-specific criteria, such as base pay, level and employee contributions. certain salaried employees participate in a supplemental retirement plan that restores benefits lost due to governmental limitations on qualified retirement benefits. the accrued liabilities for the supplemental retirement plan were $ 288million and $
249million as of december 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. occidental expensed $ 202million in 2022, $ 166million in 2021 and $ 192million in 2020 under the provisions of these defined contribution and supplemental retirement plans.
defined benefit plans participation in defined benefit plans is limited. approximately 400domestic and 300foreign national employees, mainly union, nonunion hourly and certain employees that joined occidental from acquired operations with grandfathered benefits, are currently accruing benefits under these plans.
pension costs for occidental's defined benefit pension plans, determined by independent actuarial valuations, are generally funded by payments to trust funds, which are administered by independent trustees.
postretirement and other benefit plans occidental provides medical and dental benefits and life insurance coverage for certain active, retired and disabled employees and their eligible dependents. occidental generally funds the benefits as they are paid during the year. these benefit costs, including the postretirement costs for the years ended december 31, were $
211million in 2022, $ 211million in 2021 and $ 235million in 2020.

additional information the following table sets forth the weighted-average assumptions used to determine occidental's benefit obligation and net periodic benefit cost for domestic plans for the years ended december 31:

assets for domestic pension plans and postretirement benefit plans, occidental based the discount rate on a aa-aaa universe yield curve in 2022 and 2021. the assumed long-term rate of return on assets is estimated with regard to current market factors but within the context of historical returns for the asset mix that exists at year end.
assumed rates of compensation increases for active participants in certain plans and vary by age group.
42oxy2022 form 10-k financial statementsfootnotes in 2021, occidental adopted the society of actuaries pri-2012 private retirement plans mortality tables with mp-2021 mortality improvement scale, which updated the mortality assumptions that private defined-benefit plans in the united states use in the actuarial valuations that determine a plan sponsor's pension obligations. the new mortality assumption reflects additional data that the social security administration has released since the previous mortality tables and improvement scales were released.
the postretirement benefit obligation was determined by application of the terms of medical and dental benefits and life insurance coverage, including the effect of established maximums on covered costs, together with relevant actuarial assumptions and health care cost trend rates. health care cost trend rates for medicare advantaged prescription drug plans of 9.2% starting in 2022, then grading down to 4.5% in 2028 and beyond. health care cost trend rates used for non-medicare advantaged prescription drug plans are 6.0% to 6.5% in 2022, then grading down to
4.5% in 2028 and beyond.
the actuarial assumptions used could change in the near-term as a result of changes in expected future trends and other factors that, depending on the nature of the changes, could cause increases or decreases in the plan assets and liabilities.
fair value of pension plan assets qualified defined benefit plan assets are monitored by occidental's pension and retirement trust and investment committee in its role as a fiduciary. the investment committee selects and employs various external professional investment management firms to manage specific investments across the spectrum of asset classes. the investment committee employs a liability driven investment approach that uses a diversified blend of investments (equity securities, fixed-income securities, and alternative investments) along a glide path to optimize the long-term return of plan assets relative to plan liabilities, at a prudent level of risk. equity investments are diversified across u.s. and non-u.s. stocks, as well as differing styles and market capitalizations. investment performance is measured and monitored on an ongoing basis through quarterly investment portfolio and manager guideline compliance reviews, annual liability measurements and periodic studies.
the fair values of occidental's pension plan assets by asset category were as follows:

the consolidated estimate of environmental remediation liabilities in the table above varies over time depending on factors such as acquisitions or divestitures, identification of additional sites, remedy selection and implementation and changes in applicable laws or regulations, among other factors. occidental's subsidiaries recorded environmental remediation expensesof $ 65million, $ 28million and $ 36million for the years ended december
31, 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively, on a consolidated basis. environmental remediation expenses primarily relate to changes to existing conditions from past operations. based on current estimates, occidental expects its subsidiaries to expend funds corresponding to approximately 40% of the year-end remediation balance over the next threeto four yearswith the remainder over the subsequent 10or more years.
occidental believes its range of reasonably possible additional losses of its subsidiaries beyond those amounts currently recorded for environmental remediation for the 162environmental sites in the table above could be up to $
2.7billion.
maxus environmental sites a significant portion of aggregate estimates of environmental remediation liabilities and reasonably possible additional losses described above relates to the former diamond alkali chemicals company (dscc). when oxychem acquired dscc in 1986, maxus agreed to indemnify oxychem for a number of environmental sites, including the dass.
in june 2016, maxus and several affiliated companies filed for chapter 11 bankruptcy in the u.s. bankruptcy court for the district of delaware. prior to filing for bankruptcy, maxus defended and indemnified oxychem in connection with remediation costs and other liabilities associated with the sites subject to the indemnity. any additional recovery of indemnified costs would come from the proceeds of litigation brought by the maxus liquidating trust.
for additional information on the maxus liquidating trust, see note 13 - lawsuits, claims, commitments and contingencies .
diamond alkali superfund site the epa has organized the dass into fouroperable units (ous) for evaluating, selecting and implementing remediation under cercla. oxychem's current activities in each ou are summarized below, many of which are performed on oxychem's behalf by glenn springs holdings, inc.
ou1 - the former diamond alkali plant at 80-120 lister avenue in newark: maxus and its affiliates implemented an interim remedy of ou1 pursuant to a 1990 consent decree, for which oxychem currently performs maintenance and monitoring. the epa is conducting a periodic evaluation of the interim remedy for ou1.
ou2 - the lower 8.3miles of the lower passaic river: in march 2016, the epa issued a record of decision (rod)
specifying remedial actions required for ou2. during the third quarter of 2016, and following maxus's bankruptcy filing, oxychem and the epa entered into an administrative order on consent (aoc) to complete the design of the remedy selected in the rod. at that time, the epa sent notice letters to approximately 100parties notifying them that they were potentially responsible to pay the costs to implement the remedy in ou2 and announced that it would pursue similar agreements with other potentially responsible parties. in june 2018, oxychem filed a complaint under cercla in federal district court in the state of new jersey against numerous potentially responsible parties seeking contribution and cost recovery of amounts incurred or to be incurred to comply with the aoc and the ou2
rod, or to perform other remediation activities related to the dass. that action remains pending and the district court has not adjudicated oxychem's relative share of responsibility for those costs. the epa has estimated the cost to remediate ou2 to be approximately $ 1.4billion.
ou3 - newark bay study area, including newark bay and portions of the hackensack river, arthur kill, and kill van kull: maxus and its affiliates initiated a remedial investigation and feasibility study of ou3 pursuant to a 2004
aoc which was amended in 2010. oxychem is currently performing feasibility study activities in ou3.
ou4 - the 17-mile lower passaic river study area, comprising ou2 and the upper 9miles of the lower passaic river:
in september 2021, the epa issued a rod selecting an interim remedy for the portion of ou4 that excludes ou2, and is located upstream from the lister avenue plant site for which oxychem inherited legal responsibility. the epa had estimated the cost to remediate ou4 to be approximately $ 440million. at this time, oxychem's role or responsibilities under the ou4 rod, and those of other potentially responsible parties, have not been adjudicated.
to provide continued, efficient remediation progress, in january 2022, oxychem offered to design and implement the interim remedy for ou4 subject to certain conditions, including a condition that the epa would not seek to bar oxychem's right to seek contribution or cost recovery from any other parties that are potentially responsible to pay for the ou4 interim remedy. in march 2022, the epa sent a notice letter to oxychem and other parties requesting good faith offers to implement the selected remedies at ou2 and ou4. oxychem submitted a good faith offer in june
2022, reaffirming the offer to design the remedy for ou4 and offering to enter into additional sequential agreements to remediate ou2 and ou4, subject to similar conditions, including that the epa not seek to bar oxychem from pursuing contribution or cost recovery from other responsible parties. the epa did not accept oxychem's june
2022 offer and, as such, oxychem believes that the epa may issue a unilateral administrative order or commence cercla litigation against it, and potentially other parties, to require further design and/or implementation activities of the epa's selected remedies at the dass.

financial statementsfootnotes ongoing assessment by natural resource trustees: in addition to the activities of the epa and oxychem in the ous described above, federal and state natural resources trustees are conducting an assessment of natural resources in the lower passaic river and greater newark bay to evaluate potential claims for natural resource damages.
alden leeds litigation in december 2022, the epa and the doj filed a proposed consent decree in the alden leeds litigation seeking court approval to settle with 85parties for a total of $ 150million and release them from liability for remediation costs in dass ou2 and ou4, which oxychem believes is based on a disproportionate allocation of responsibility to oxychem despite overwhelming evidence regarding the responsibility of others, and, among other infirmities, is contrary to site-specific sampling and other relevant evidence concerning the liability of the settling parties. the epa and doj also seek entry of an order that would bar oxychem from pursuing contribution against those parties for remediation costs oxychem had incurred or may incur in the future to design and implement the remedies in ou2 and ou4.
oxychem intends to challenge the proposed settlement vigorously in the alden leeds litigation and to seek contribution and cost recovery from other potentially responsible parties for remediation costs it had incurred or may incur at the dass. if oxychem is denied leave to intervene in the alden leeds litigation, its anticipated settlement objections are overruled by the court or in any subsequent appeals, or the proposed settlement is approved by the court and not overturned on appeal, then, notwithstanding oxychem's vigorous, good faith effort to contest the settlement proposed in the alden leeds litigation, the epa could attempt to compel oxychem to bear substantially all of the estimated cost to design and implement the ou2 and ou4 remedies, which would have a material adverse impact on oxychem and occidental's consolidated results of operations in the period recorded.
while the remedies for ou2 and ou4 are expected to take over ten years to complete, the epa may seek to require oxychem to provide financial assurance to secure its performance. the amount of financial assurance is not subject to estimation at this time, as it is uncertain when or to what extent the epa may take action to compel oxychem to perform further remediation in ou2 or ou4 or the amount of assurance oxychem would be required to post if the epa takes such actions before the proposed settlement at issue in alden leeds is resolved. for further information on the alden leeds litigation, see note 13 - lawsuits, claims, commitments and contingencies.
other information for the dass, oxychem has accrued a reserve relating to its estimated allocable share of the costs to perform the maintenance and monitoring required in the ou1 consent decree, the design and implementation of remedies selected in the ou2 rod and aoc and the ou4 rod, and the remedial investigation and feasibility study required in the ou3.
oxychem's accrued environmental remediation reserve does not reflect the potential for additional remediation costs or natural resource damages for the dass that oxychem believes are not reasonably estimable. oxychem's ultimate liability at the dass may be higher or lower than the reserved amount and the reasonably possible additional losses, and is subject to final design plans, further action by the epa and natural resource trustees, and the resolution of oxychem's allocable share with other potentially responsible parties, among other factors.
oxychem continues to evaluate the estimated costs currently recorded for remediation at the dass and other maxus-
indemnified sites, as well as the range of reasonably possible additional losses beyond those amounts currently recorded. given the complexity and extent of the remediation efforts, estimates of the remediation costs may increase or decrease over time as new information becomes available.
note 13 - lawsuits, claims, commitments and contingencies legal matters occidental or certain of its subsidiaries are involved, in the normal course of business, in lawsuits, claims and other legal proceedings that seek, among other things, compensation for alleged personal injury, breach of contract, property damage or other losses, punitive damages, civil penalties, or injunctive or declaratory relief.
occidental or certain of its subsidiaries also are involved in proceedings under cercla and similar federal, regional, state, provincial, tribal, local and international environmental laws. these environmental proceedings seek funding or performance of remediation and, in some cases, compensation for alleged property damage, natural resource damages, punitive damages, civil penalties, injunctive relief and government oversight costs. usually occidental or such subsidiaries are among many companies in these environmental proceedings and have to date been successful in sharing remediation costs with other financially sound companies. further, some lawsuits, claims and legal proceedings involve acquired or disposed assets with respect to which a third party or occidental or its subsidiary retains liability or indemnifies the other party for conditions that existed prior to the transaction.
in accordance with applicable accounting guidance, occidental or its subsidiaries accrue reserves for outstanding lawsuits, claims and proceedings when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the liability can be reasonably estimated. reserves for matters, other than for the arbitration award (disclosed below), tax matters or environmental remediation, that satisfy these criteria as of december 31, 2022 and 2021, were not material to occidental's consolidated balance sheets.
46oxy2022 form 10-k financial statementsfootnotes if unfavorable outcomes of these matters were to occur, future results of operations or cash flows for any particular quarterly or annual period could be materially adversely affected. occidental's estimates are based on information known about the legal matters and its experience in contesting, litigating and settling similar matters. occidental reassesses the probability and estimability of contingent losses as new information becomes available.
andes arbitration in 2016, occidental received payments from the republic of ecuador of approximately $ 1.0billion pursuant to a november 2015 arbitration award for ecuador's 2006 expropriation of occidental's participation contract for block
15. the awarded amount represented a recovery of occidental's 60% of the value of block 15. in 2017, andes commenced an arbitration, against oepc, claiming it is entitled to a 40% share of the judgment amount obtained by occidental. occidental contended that andes is not entitled to any of the amounts paid under the 2015 arbitration award because occidental's recovery was limited to occidental's own 60% economic interest in the block. on march
26, 2021, the arbitration tribunal issued an award in favor of andes and against oepc in the amount of $ 391million plus interest. in june 2021, oepc filed a motion to vacate the award due to concerns regarding the validity of the award. in december 2021, the u.s. district court for the southern district of new york confirmed the arbitration award, plus prejudgment interest, in the aggregate amount of $ 558million. oepc has appealed the judgment. oral argument with respect to oepc's appeal occurred on february 2, 2023, and a ruling is expected later this year.
andes has filed state court claims in new york and delaware against oepc, opc, and oxy usa to attempt to recover on its judgment against oepc during the pendency of the appeal. all occidental entities are vigorously defending against these actions. in addition, oepc commenced an arbitration against andes to recover significant additional claims not addressed by the prior arbitration tribunal relating to andes' 40% share of costs, liabilities, losses and expenses due under the parties' agreements. a hearing on these claims occurred in december 2022. a ruling from the arbitration tribunal is expected in the first half of 2023.
alden leeds litigation in december 2022, the epa and the doj filed a proposed consent decree with the federal district court in new jersey in the alden leeds litigation seeking court approval of a proposed settlement in which the epa seeks to release
85potentially responsible parties from all remediation costs in ou2 and ou4 of the dass for approximately $
150million. oxychem believes the proposed settlement relies, improperly, on an allocation report prepared by an epa contractor in which the contractor purports to assign a disproportionate share of the responsibility for remediation costs in ou2 and ou4 to oxychem. in the proposed settlement, the epa also seeks to bar oxychem from pursuing contribution claims against the 85 settling parties for remediation costs in ou2 and ou4. the settlement does not address the liability of any party with respect to ou3 or natural resource damages. oxychem intends to contest the proposed settlement vigorously.
the proposed epa settlement is subject to a public comment process that closes in march 2023. oxychem believes the proposed settlement exceeds the epa's statutory authority and is based on a flawed allocation process. oxychem also believes that process was unreasonably limited in scope and unreliably based on voluntary reporting by the settling parties, instead of sworn evidence, publicly available sampling results, and historical documents reflecting the operating history and disposal practices of the 85parties that the epa proposes to release as part of this settlement. oxychem expects to show that the epa's proposed settlement does not fairly and reasonably reflect the settling parties' contribution of hazardous substances to the dass, and, among other things, incorrectly attributes to oxychem substances that were contributed by one or more of the 85 settling parties.
oxychem has sought to intervene in the alden leeds proceeding to protect its rights under federal law to challenge the proposed settlement, seek contribution and cost recovery from potentially responsible parties, and obtain a judicial allocation of responsibility under cercla. it is unclear when the court will rule on oxychem's request to intervene or will address whether the underlying settlement will be approved. in the related cercla litigation, oxychem also intends to defend and prosecute vigorously its right to seek contribution and cost recovery from all potentially responsible parties to pay remediation costs in the dass. as the alden leeds case is in its early stages, oxychem is unable to estimate the timing of the court's decision, its outcome, or the outcome of any appeals from the court's decision.
maxus liquidating trust as described in note 12 - environmental liabilities and expenditures , maxus was contractually obligated to indemnify, defend, and hold harmless oxychem against environmental liabilities arising from the former operations of dscc. in june 2016, maxus filed for bankruptcy protection in the u.s. bankruptcy court for the district of delaware. in june 2017, the bankruptcy court approved a plan of liquidation to liquidate maxus and create the trust for the benefit of maxus' creditors, including oxychem, to pursue claims against maxus' current and former parents, ypf and repsol, certain of their respective subsidiaries and affiliates, and others to satisfy claims by oxychem and other creditors for past and future remediation and other costs. in july 2017, the court-approved plan of liquidation became final and the trust became effective. pursuant to the plan, the trust is governed by an independent trustee and is not controlled by oxychem. the plan authorizes the trust to distribute any assets it recovers from such litigation claims to the trust's beneficiaries, which include oxychem and other creditors, in accordance with the plan and governing trust agreement.

financial statementsfootnotes in june 2018, the trust filed its complaint against ypf and repsol in delaware bankruptcy court asserting claims based upon, among other things, fraudulent transfer and alter ego. during 2019, the bankruptcy court denied repsol's and ypf's motions to dismiss the complaint as well as their motions to move the case to a different court.
these rulings were upheld on appeal. the trust, ypf, and repsol each filed motions for summary judgment, and the bankruptcy court denied all but one motion in the second quarter of 2022. the bankruptcy court's summary judgment decision indicated that, at trial, the trust must establish a causal link between its claimed damages and the alter ego conduct of repsol and ypf. oxychem is currently uncertain what amount of recovery it will ultimately obtain from the trust. trial is scheduled for march and april 2023.
tax matters during the course of its operations, occidental is subject to audit by tax authorities for varying periods in various federal, state, local and international tax jurisdictions. tax years through 2020 for u.s. federal income tax purposes have been audited by the irs pursuant to its compliance assurance program and subsequent taxable years are currently under review. tax years through 2014 have been audited for state income tax purposes. significant audit matters in international jurisdictions have been resolved through 2010. during the course of tax audits, disputes have arisen and other disputes may arise as to facts and matters of law.
for anadarko, its taxable years through 2014 and tax year 2016 for u.s. federal tax purposes have been audited by the irs. tax years through 2010 have been audited for state income tax purposes. there is one outstanding significant tax matter in an international jurisdiction related to a discontinued operation. as stated above, during the course of tax audits, disputes have arisen and other disputes may arise as to facts and matters of law.
other than the matter discussed below, occidental believes that the resolution of these outstanding tax matters would not have a material adverse effect on its consolidated financial position or results of operations.
anadarko received an $ 881million tentative refund in 2016 related to its $ 5.2billion tronox adversary proceeding settlement payment in 2015. in september 2018, anadarko received a statutory notice of deficiency from the irs disallowing the net operating loss carryback and rejecting anadarko's refund claim. as a result, anadarko filed a petition with the u.s. tax court to dispute the disallowances in november 2018. in december 2022, the parties filed competing motions for partial summary judgment. the motions are not fully briefed. trial is set for may 2023.
occidental expects to continue pursuing resolution.
in accordance with asc 740's guidance on the accounting for uncertain tax positions, occidental has recorded no tax benefit on the tentative cash tax refund of $ 881million. as a result, should occidental not ultimately prevail on the issue, there would be no additional tax expense recorded relative to this position for financial statement purposes other than future interest. however, in that event, occidental would be required to repay approximately $
1.4billion in federal taxes, $ 28million in state taxes and accrued interest of $ 415million. a liability for this amount plus interest is included in deferred credits and other liabilities - other.
indemnities to third parties occidental, its subsidiaries, or both, have indemnified various parties against specified liabilities those parties might incur in the future in connection with purchases and other transactions that they have entered into with occidental or its subsidiaries. these indemnities usually are contingent upon the other party incurring liabilities that reach specified thresholds. as of december 31, 2022, occidental is not aware of circumstances that it believes would reasonably be expected to lead to indemnity claims that would result in payments materially in excess of reserves.
purchase obligations and commitments occidental, its subsidiaries, or both, have entered into agreements providing for future payments, primarily to secure terminal and pipeline capacity, and also for drilling rigs and services, electrical power, steam and certain chemical raw materials. occidental has certain other commitments under contracts, guarantees and joint ventures, including purchase commitments for goods and services at market-related prices and certain other contingent liabilities. the amounts that will be paid for such outstanding off-balance sheet purchase obligations as of december 31, 2022 are $ 3.0billion in 2023, $ 4.2billion in 2024 and 2025, $ 2.5billion in 2026 and 2027 and $
2.2billion in 2028 and thereafter.

(a) approximately $ 280million of cash was received as a result of the exercise of common stock warrants and options.
(b) consisted of issuances for the 2015 long-term incentive plan, the opc savings plan, dividend reinvestment plan and anadarko restricted stock awards.
(c) included purchases of 1,640,719shares from the trustee of occidental's defined contribution savings plan that are not part of publicly announced plans or programs.
(d) as of december 31, 2022, occidental had 104million outstanding warrants with a strike of $ 22per share and
83.9million of warrants with a strike of $ 59.62per share.
treasury stock under the share repurchase program announced and completed in 2022, occidental purchased 47.7million shares for $
3.0billion. additionally, occidental purchased shares from the trustee of its defined contribution savings plan in
2022, 2021 and 2020. as of december 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, treasury stock shares numbered 198.7million,
149.3million and 149.1million, respectively.
preferred stock in connection with the anadarko acquisition, occidental issued 100,000shares of series a preferred stock, having a face value of $ 100,000per share and a liquidation preference of $ 105,000per share plus unpaid accrued dividends.
the agreement includes a mandatory redemption provision that obligates occidental to redeem the preferred at 110%
of the par value on a dollar-for-dollar basis for every dollar distributed to common shareholders above $ 4.00per share, on a trailing 12-month basis. occidental cannot voluntarily redeem the preferred shares before august 2029.
after august 2029, occidental can voluntarily redeem the preferred shares at a 5% premium at par. dividends on the preferred stock will accrue on the face value at a rate per annum of 8%, but will be paid only when, as and if declared by occidental's board of directors. at any time, when such dividends have not been paid in full, the unpaid amounts will accrue dividends, compounded quarterly, at a rate per annum of 9%. following the payment in full of any accrued but unpaid dividends, the dividend rate will remain at 9% per annum. if preferred dividends are not paid in full, occidental is prohibited from paying dividends on common stock. occidental paid $ 200million in preferred stock dividends in each quarter of 2022.
as of december 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, occidental had 100,000shares of preferred stock issued and outstanding.
berkshire warrant in connection with the preferred stock issuance, occidental also issued the berkshire warrant. the berkshire warrant is exercisable at the holder's option, in whole or in part, until the first anniversary of the date on which no shares of preferred stock remain outstanding, at which time the berkshire warrant expires. the holder of the berkshire warrant and the preferred stock may redeem the preferred stock as payment for the exercise price of the warrant in lieu of cash payment upon exercise. as of december 31, 2022, the berkshire warrant would result in the issuance of 83.9million shares of occidental common stock, if exercised in full for its current strike price of
$ 59.624per share of occidental common stock.
common stock warrants on june 26, 2020, the board of directors declared common stock warrants, at a rate of 0.125warrants per share of occidental common stock. occidental issued approximately 116million common stock warrants on august 3, 2020 to holders of record of outstanding shares of occidental's common stock as of the close of business on july 6, 2020, and pursuant to occidental's outstanding equity-based incentive awards in connection with anti-dilution adjustments resulting from such distribution. the common stock warrants have an exercise price of $ 22.00per share and will expire on august 3, 2027. the common stock warrants are listed on the nyse and trade under the symbol "oxy ws".

financial statementsfootnotes the common stock warrants were measured at fair value on the declaration date using the black-scholes option model and were classified as equity in "additional paid-in capital". the following level 2 inputs were used in the black-
scholes option model: the expected life of the common stock warrants, a volatility factor and the exercise price.
the expected life is based on the estimated term of the common stock warrants, the volatility factor is based on historical volatilities of occidental common stock and the exercise of $ 22.00per share of occidental common stock.
earnings per share occidental's instruments containing rights to nonforfeitable dividends granted in stock-based awards are considered participating securities prior to vesting and, therefore, have been deducted from earnings in computing basic and diluted eps under the two-class method.
basic eps was computed by dividing net income attributable to common stock, net of income allocated to participating securities, by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during each period, including vested but unissued shares and share units. the computation of diluted eps reflects the additional dilutive effect of stock options, warrants and unvested stock awards.
the following table presents the calculation of basic and diluted eps for the years ended december 31:

50oxy2022 form 10-k financial statementsfootnotes note 15 - stock-based incentive plans occidental issues stock-based awards to employees in accordance with the terms of the plan, as amended and restated. an aggregate of 133million shares of occidental common stock were authorized for issuance and approximately 16.1million shares had been reserved for issuance for employee awards through december 31, 2022. as of december 31, 2022, approximately 57.0million shares were available for grants of future awards. the plan requires each share covered by an award (other than options) to be counted as if threeshares were issued in determining the number of shares that are available for future awards. accordingly, the number of shares available for future awards may be less than 57.0million depending on the type of award granted, and shares available for future awards may increase by the number of shares that are forfeited, canceled, or correspond to the portion of any stock-based awards settled in cash, including awards that were issued under a previous plan that remain outstanding. current outstanding awards include rsus, stock options, crocei awards and tsri awards.
during 2022, non-employee directors were granted awards for 33,575shares of common stock. compensation expense for these awards was measured using the closing quoted market price of occidental's common stock on the grant date and was fully recognized at that time.
occidental incurred expenses of $ 258million, $ 287million and $ 202million related to stock-based incentive plans in the years ended december 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively. the income tax benefit associated with this expense was $ 54million, $ 60million and $ 42million in the years ended december 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively.
as of december 31, 2022, unrecognized compensation expense for all unvested stock-based incentive awards was $
236million. this expense is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 1.8years. occidental accounts for forfeitures as they occur.
restricted stock units certain employees are awarded the right to receive rsus, some of which have performance criteria, and are in the form of, or equivalent in value to, actual shares of occidental common stock. depending on their terms, rsus may be settled in stock or may be cash settled liabilities. these awards vest from oneto three yearsfollowing the grant date. for certain rsus, dividend equivalents are paid during the vesting period.
cash-settled rsu liability awards the weighted-average, grant-date fair values of cash-settled rsus granted in 2022, 2021 and 2020 were $ 47.41, $
25.83and $ 40.86per share, respectively. cash-settled rsus resulted in payments of $ 203million, $ 4million and $
3million, during the years ended december 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively.
stock-settled rsu equity awards the weighted-average, grant-date fair values of the stock-settled rsus granted in 2022, 2021, and 2020 were $
45.14, $ 25.45and $ 41.60, respectively. the fair value of rsus settled in shares during the years ended december

total shareholder return incentive awards certain executives are awarded tsris that vest at the end of a three-yearperiod following the grant date. payout is based upon occidental's absolute total shareholder return and performance relative to its peers. tsris have payouts that range from 0% to 200% of the target award and settle in stock once certified. dividend equivalents for tsris are accumulated and paid upon certification of the award. the fair value of tsris settled in shares during the years ended december 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020 was zero, $ 4million and $ 9million, respectively.

financial statementsfootnotes the fair values of tsris are initially determined on the grant date using a monte carlo simulation model based on occidental's assumptions, noted in the following table, and the volatility from corresponding peer group companies.
the expected life is based on the term. the risk-free interest rate is the implied yield available on zero coupon treasury notes at the time of grant with a remaining term equal to the term. the dividend yield is the expected annual dividend yield over the term, expressed as a percentage of the stock price on the grant date. estimates of fair value may not accurately predict the value ultimately realized by the employees who receive the awards, and the ultimate value may not be indicative of the reasonableness of the original estimates of fair value made by occidental.
the grant-date assumptions used in the monte carlo simulation models for the estimated payout level of tsris were as follows:

financial statementsfootnotes note 16 - industry segments and geographic areas occidental conducts its operations through threesegments: (1) oil and gas; (2) chemical; and (3) midstream and marketing. the factors used to identify these segments are based on the nature of the operations that are undertaken in each segment. income taxes, interest income, interest expense, environmental remediation expenses, anadarko acquisition-related costs and unallocated corporate expenses are included under corporate and eliminations. intersegment sales eliminate upon consolidation and are generally made at prices approximating those that the selling entity would be able to obtain in third-party transactions. identifiable assets are those assets used in the operations of the segments. corporate assets consist of cash and restricted cash, certain corporate receivables and pp&e. the chief operating decision maker analyzes each segment's operating results to make decisions about resources to be allocated to the segment and to assess its performance as well as occidental's overall performance.

supplemental oil and gas information(unaudited)
supplemental oil and gas information oil and gas reserves the following tables set forth occidental's net interests in quantities of proved developed and undeveloped reserves of oil, ngl and natural gas and changes in such quantities. proved oil, ngl and natural gas reserves were estimated using the unweighted arithmetic average of the first-day-of-the-month price for each month within the year, unless prices were defined by contractual arrangements. oil, ngl and natural gas prices used for this purpose were based on posted benchmark prices and adjusted for price differentials including gravity, quality and transportation costs. the following table shows the pricing used in the reserve analysis for the periods presented:

reserves are stated net of applicable royalties. estimated reserves include occidental's economic interests under pscs and other similar economic arrangements. in addition, discussions of oil and gas production or volumes, in general, refer to sales volumes unless the context requires or it is indicated otherwise.
prices for oil, ngl and natural gas fluctuate widely. historically, the markets for oil, ngl and natural gas and refined products have been volatile and may continue to be volatile in the future. prolonged declines in oil, ngl and natural gas prices would reduce occidental's operating results and cash flows and could impact its future rate of growth and the recoverability of the carrying value of its assets.

64oxy2022 form 10-k supplemental oil and gas information(unaudited)
standardized measure, including year-to-year changes therein, of discounted future net cash flows for purposes of the following disclosures, future cash flows were computed by applying to occidental's proved oil and gas reserves the unweighted arithmetic average of the first-day-of-the-month price for each month within the years ended december 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively, unless prices were defined by contractual arrangements, and exclude escalations based upon future conditions. the realized prices used to calculate future cash flows vary by producing area and market conditions. future operating and capital costs were forecast using the current cost environment applied to expectations of future operating and development activities to develop and produce proved reserves at year end.
future income tax expenses were computed by applying, generally, year-end statutory tax rates (adjusted for permanent differences, tax credits, allowances and foreign income repatriation considerations) to the estimated net future pre-tax cash flows. the discount was computed by application of a 10% discount factor. the calculations assumed the continuation of existing economic, operating and contractual conditions as of december 31, 2022, 2021
and 2020. such assumptions, which are required by regulation, have not always proven accurate in the past. other valid assumptions would give rise to substantially different results.

(a) wells suspended or waiting on completion include exploration and development wells where drilling has occurred, but the wells are awaiting the completion of hydraulic fracturing or other completion activities or the resumption of drilling in the future. there were 42 mmboe of pud reserves primarily assigned to u.s. onshore development wells suspended or waiting on completion as of december 31, 2022. occidental expects to convert all of these pud reserves to developed status within five years of their initial disclosure.
as of december 31, 2022, occidental was participating in 135 and 37 gross pressure-maintenance projects in the united states and internationally, respectively. in the united states, these projects primarily consisted of waterfloods and co 2 floods, and in the middle east and north africa, these projects consisted mostly of waterfloods.

(a) acres spaced or assigned to productive wells.
(b) total acres in which interests are held.
(c) sum of the fractional interests owned based on working interests, or interests under pscs and other economic arrangements.
(d) acres on which wells have not been drilled or completed to a point that would permit the production of commercial quantities of oil and gas, regardless of whether the acreage contains proved reserves.
(e) occidental's fee mineral acreage is primarily undeveloped.
occidental's investment in developed and undeveloped acreage comprises numerous concessions, blocks and leases.
work programs are designed to ensure that the exploration potential of any property is fully evaluated before the contractual expiration date. in some instances, occidental may elect to relinquish acreage in advance of the contractual expiration date if the evaluation process is complete and there is not a business basis for extension.
in cases where additional time may be required to fully evaluate acreage, occidental has generally been successful in obtaining extensions. scheduled lease and concession expirations for undeveloped acreage over the next three years are not expected to have a material adverse impact on occidental.

oil, ngl and natural gas sales volumes per day the following tables set forth the sales volumes from ongoing operations of oil, ngl and natural gas per day for each of the three years in the period ended december 31, 2022. the differences between the sales and production volumes per day are negligible and are generally due to the timing of shipments at occidental's international locations where product is loaded onto tankers. natural gas volumes have been converted to boe based on energy content of six mcf of gas to one barrel of oil.

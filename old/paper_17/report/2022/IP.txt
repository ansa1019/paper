item 1a. risk factors the company faces risks in the normal course of business and through global, regional, and local events that could have an adverse impact on its reputation, operations, and financial performance. the board of directors exercises oversight of the company's enterprise risk management program, which includes strategic, operational and financial matters, as well as compliance and legal risks. the audit and finance committee coordinates the risk oversight role exercised by the board's standing committees and management, and it receives updates on the risk management processes twice per year.
in addition to the risks and uncertainties discussed elsewhere in this annual report on form 10-k (particularly in item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations), or in the company's other filings with the securities and exchange commission, the following are some important factors that could cause the company's actual results to differ materially from those projected in any forward-looking statement. if any of the events or circumstances described in any of the following risk factors occurs, our business, results of operations and/or financial condition could be materially and adversely affected, and our actual results may differ materially from those contemplated in any forward-looking statements we make in any public disclosures.
risks relating to market and economic factors adverse developments in general business and economic conditions could have an adverse effect on the demand for our products and our financial condition and results of operations. general economic conditions may adversely affect industrial non-durable goods production, consumer spending, commercial printing and advertising activity, white-collar employment levels and consumer confidence, all of which impact demand for our products, or otherwise adversely affect our business. we may also be adversely affected by catastrophic or other unforeseen events, including future health epidemics or pandemics, natural disasters, geopolitical events, terrorism, political, financial or social instability, or civil or social unrest. moreover, negative economic conditions or other adverse developments with respect to our business have resulted in, and may in the future result in impairment charges which could be material. volatility or uncertainty in the financial, capital and credit markets, which impacts interest rates, currency exchange rates and the availability of credit, could also have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and our results of operations.
macroeconomic conditions in the u.s. and globally continue to be challenging in various respects, including as the result of slow or negative gdp growth in recent quarters, significant inflationary pressures, elevated interest rates, challenging labor market conditions, and disruptions to supply networks. our operations have been adversely affected by, and are expected to continue to be adversely affected by, these negative macroeconomic conditions, including as the result of higher raw material and labor costs, supply chain constraints and disruptions, and a constrained transportation environment. moreover, any significant deterioration in current negative macroeconomic conditions, or any recovery therefrom that is significantly slower than anticipated, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition. further if current negative macroeconomic conditions result in significant disruptions to capital and financial markets, our cost of borrowing, our ability to access capital on favorable terms, and our overall liquidity could be adversely affected.
changes in international conditions or other risks arising from conducting business internationally could adversely affect our business and results of operations. our operating results and business prospects could be substantially affected by risks related to the countries outside the u.s. in which we have manufacturing facilities or sell our products. these risks, which can vary substantially by country, may include economic or political instability, geopolitical events (such as between ukraine and russia and/or increasing tensions between china and taiwan), corruption, anti-american sentiment, social and ethnic unrest, the regulatory environment (including the risks of operating in developing or emerging markets in which there are significant uncertainties regarding the interpretation and enforceability of legal requirements), fluctuations in the value of local currency versus the u.s. dollar, repatriating cash from foreign countries to the u.s., downturns or changes in economic conditions (including in relation to commodity inflation), adverse tax consequences or rulings, nationalization or any change in social, political or labor conditions in any of these countries or regions impacting matters such as sustainability, environmental regulations and trade policies and agreements, could negatively affect our financial results. trade protection measures in favor of local producers of competing products, including governmental subsidies, tax benefits and other measures giving local producers a competitive advantage over us, may also adversely impact our operating results and business prospects in these countries. likewise, disruption in existing trade agreements or increased trade friction between countries (such as in relation to the trade tensions between the u.s. and china), which can result in tariffs, could have a negative effect on our business and results of operations by restricting the free flow of goods and services across borders.
in addition, our international operations are subject to regulation under u.s. law and other laws related to operations in foreign jurisdictions. for example, the foreign corrupt practices act prohibits u.s. companies and their representatives from offering, promising, authorizing or making payments to foreign officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business abroad, and the u.s. department of treasury's office of foreign asset control and other non-u.s. government entities maintain economic sanctions targeting various countries, persons and entities. failure to comply with domestic or foreign laws could result in various adverse consequences, including the imposition of civil or criminal sanctions and the prosecution of executives overseeing our international operations.
risks related to climate and weather we are subject to physical, operational, transitional and financial risks associated with climate change and global, regional and local weather conditions as well as by legal, regulatory, and market responses to climate change. climate change impacts, including rising temperatures and the increasing severity and/or frequency of adverse weather conditions, may result in operational impacts on our facilities, supply chain disruptions and increased raw material and other costs. these adverse weather conditions and other physical impacts which may be exacerbated as the result of climate change include floods, hurricanes, tornadoes, earthquakes, hailstorms, wildfires, snow, ice storms and drought. climate change may also contribute to the decreased productivity of forests and adverse impacts on the distribution and abundance of species, the spread of disease and insect epidemics, any of which developments could adversely affect timber harvesting. the effects of climate change and global, regional and local weather conditions, including the resulting financial costs of compliance with legal or regulatory initiatives, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and business.
there has been an increased focus, including from investors, the general public and u.s. and foreign governmental and nongovernmental authorities, regarding environmental, social and governance (esg) matters, including with respect to climate change, ghg emissions, packaging and waste, sustainable supply chain practices, deforestation, and land, energy and water use. this increased awareness with respect to esg matters, including climate change, may result in more prescriptive reporting requirements with respect to esg metrics, an increased expectation that such metrics will be voluntarily disclosed by companies such as ours, and increased pressure to make commitments, set targets, or establish goals, and take action to meet them. as the result of this increased focus and our commitment to esg matters, we have voluntarily provided disclosure and established targets and goals with respect to various esg matters, including climate change. for example, we have made public commitments regarding our intended reduction of carbon emissions, including our vision 2030 goal of reducing scope 1, 2 and 3 ghg emissions by 35% and have received approval by sbti of these targets as consistent with levels required to meet the goals of the paris agreement. meeting these and other esg targets and goals have increased, and may continue to increase, our capital and operational costs. there also continues to be a lack of consistency in legal and regulatory initiatives regarding climate change across jurisdictions and various governmental entities. additionally, we may also incur additional expenses as a result of u.s. and international regulators requiring additional disclosures regarding ghg emissions. further, there can be no assurance regarding the extent to which our climate and other esg targets will be achieved, and the achievement of these targets is subject to various risks and uncertainties, some of which are outside our control. for example, there has been limited net change in our combined scope 1 and scope 2 emissions from 2019 to 2021, which we believe was largely due to increased mill production over this period, along with other factors driven by covid-19 disruption, mill operations, weather events and energy supplies. moreover, there is no assurance that investments made in furtherance of achieving such targets and goals will meet investor expectations or any binding or non-binding legal standards regarding sustainability performance. if we are unable to meet these climate and other esg targets and goals, this failure could adversely impact our reputation as well as investor, customer and other stakeholder relationships, which could adversely impact our business and results of operations. moreover, not all of our competitors may seek to establish climate or other esg targets and goals at a comparable level to ours, which could result in lower supply chain or operating costs for competitors.
other climate-related business risks that we face include risks related to the transition to a lower-carbon economy, such as increased prices for fuels; the introduction of a carbon tax; increased regulations; and more stringent and/or complex environmental and other permitting requirements. to the extent that climate-related business risks materialize, particularly if we are unprepared for them, we may incur unexpected costs, and our business may be materially and adversely affected.
risks related to our indebtedness the level of our indebtedness could adversely affect our financial condition and impair our ability to operate our business. as of december 31, 2022, we had approximately $5.6 billion of outstanding indebtedness. the level of our indebtedness could have important consequences to our financial condition, operating results and business, including the following:
•it may limit our ability to obtain additional debt or equity financing for working capital, capital expenditures, product development, dividends, share repurchases, debt service requirements, acquisitions and general corporate or other purposes;
•a portion of our cash flows from operations will be dedicated to payments on indebtedness and will not be available for other purposes, including operations, capital expenditures and future business opportunities;
•the debt service requirements of our indebtedness could make it more difficult for us to satisfy other obligations;
•it may limit our ability to adjust to changing market conditions, including to take actions in connection with rising interest rates (such as in the current rising interest rate environment), and place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less debt;
•it may increase our exposure to risks related to fluctuations in foreign currency as we earn profits in a variety of currencies around the world and our debt is denominated in u.s. dollars;
•it may increase our exposure to the risk of increased interest rates insofar as we are compelled to refinance indebtedness at higher interest rates, which risk is heightened by the current high interest rate environment; and
•it may increase our vulnerability to a downturn in general economic conditions or in our business, and may make us unable to carry out capital spending that is important to our growth.
in addition, we are subject to agreements governing our indebtedness that require us to meet and maintain certain financial ratios and covenants. a significant or prolonged downturn in general business and economic conditions, or other significant adverse developments with respect to our results of operations or financial condition, may affect our ability to comply with these covenants or meet those financial ratios and tests and could require us to take action to reduce our debt or to act in a manner contrary to our current business objectives. moreover, the restrictions associated with these financial ratios and covenants may prevent us from taking actions that we believe would be in the best interest of our business and may make it difficult for us to execute our business strategy successfully or effectively compete with companies that are not similarly restricted. additionally, despite these restrictions, we may be able to incur substantial additional indebtedness in the future, which might subject us to additional restrictive covenants that could affect our financial and operational flexibility and otherwise increase the risks associated with our indebtedness as noted above.
we are subject to risks associated with our variable rate debt and the upcoming transition from libor to sofr.
we have interest rate risk, primarily related to our short-term cash investments, variable rate debts, supply chain financing, short-term debt and the installment notes and loans in the temple inland timber monetization special purpose entities. interest rates rose significantly during 2022 and could remain high and volatile in 2023 and beyond. changes in interest rates impact how much we earn on our short term cash investments, the interest rate we pay on our variable rate debt and credit agreements, the cost of supply chain financing and the refinance rate of our short term debt.
in addition, as of december 31, 2022, $127 million of our variable rate debt continued to be priced based on the london interbank offered rate ("libor") with the remaining $195 million of our variable rate debt priced based on the secured overnight financing rate ("sofr"). the ice benchmark administration announced that it will cease calculating and publishing all usd libor tenors on june 30, 2023. all of our variable rate debt that continues to be priced based upon libor will need to either be amended, refinanced or paid off prior to the june 30, 2023 deadline, with any new variable rate debt needing to be based upon sofr. in addition, the installment notes and some of the loans in the temple inland timber monetization special purpose entities are also priced based on libor, and we are working to change the pricing index with respect to such notes and loan to sofr before the june 30, 2023 deadline. sofr is calculated differently from libor and has inherent differences from libor, which could give rise to risks and uncertainties, including the limited historical data and volatility in the benchmark rates. the full effects to us of the transition to sofr remain uncertain.
changes in credit ratings issued by nationally recognized statistical rating organizations could adversely affect our cost of financing and have an adverse effect on the market price of our securities. maintaining an investment-grade credit rating is an important element of our financial strategy, and a downgrade of the company's ratings below investment grade will likely eliminate our ability to access the commercial paper market, may limit our access to the capital markets, have an adverse effect on the market price of our securities, increase our cost of borrowing and require us to post collateral for derivatives in a net liability position. our desire to maintain the company's investment grade rating may cause us to take certain actions designed to improve our cash flow, including sale of assets, suspension or reduction of our dividend and reductions in capital expenditures and working capital.
under the terms of the agreements governing approximately $539 million of our debt as of december 31, 2022, the applicable interest rate on such debt may increase upon each downgrade in our credit rating below investment grade. as a result, a downgrade in our credit rating below investment grade may lead to an increase in our interest expense. there can be no assurance that such credit ratings will remain in effect for any given period of time or that such ratings will not be lowered, suspended or withdrawn entirely by the rating agencies, if, in each rating agency's judgment, circumstances so warrant. any such downgrade, suspension or withdrawal of our credit ratings could adversely affect our cost of borrowing, limit our access to the capital markets or result in more restrictive covenants in agreements governing the terms of any future indebtedness that we may incur.
downgrades in the credit ratings of banks issuing certain letters of credit will increase our cost of maintaining certain indebtedness and may result in the acceleration of deferred taxes. we are subject to the risk that a bank with currently issued irrevocable letters of credit supporting installment notes in connection with temple-inland's 2007 sales of forestlands, may be downgraded below a required rating. prior to 2013, certain banks had fallen below the required ratings threshold and were successfully replaced, or waivers were obtained regarding their replacement. as a result of continuing uncertainty in the banking environment, some of the letter-of-credit banks currently in place remain subject to risk of downgrade and the number of qualified replacement banks remains limited. the downgrade of one or more of these banks may subject us to additional costs of securing a replacement letter-of-credit bank or could result in an acceleration of payments of up to $485 million in deferred income taxes if replacement banks cannot be obtained. the deferred taxes are currently recorded in our consolidated financial statements. see note 15, variable interest entities, on pages 75 and 76, and note 13. income taxes, on pages 69 through 71, in item 8. financial statements and supplementary data for further information.
risks relating to our pension and healthcare costs our pension and health care costs are subject to numerous factors which could cause these costs to change. we have defined benefit pension plans covering substantially all u.s. salaried employees hired prior to july 1, 2004 (or later for certain acquired populations, as described in note 19. retirement plans, on pages 81 through 87, in item 8. financial statements and supplementary data) and substantially all hourly union and non-union employees regardless of hire date. we froze participation under these plans for u.s. salaried employees, including credited service and compensation on or after january 1, 2019; however, the pension freeze does not affect benefits accrued through december 31, 2018. we provide retiree health care benefits to certain former u.s. employees, as well as financial assistance towards the cost of individual retiree medical coverage for certain former u.s. salaried employees. our pension costs are dependent upon numerous factors resulting from actual plan experience and assumptions of future experience. pension plan assets are primarily made up of equity and fixed income investments. fluctuations in actual market returns on plan assets, changes in general interest rates and changes in the number of retirees may impact pension costs in future periods. likewise, changes in assumptions regarding current discount rates and expected rates of return on plan assets could increase pension costs. however, the impact of market fluctuations has been reduced as a result of investments in our pension plan asset portfolio which hedge the impact of changes in interest rates on the plan's funded status. drivers for fluctuating health costs include unit cost changes, health care utilization by participants, and potential changes in legal requirements and government oversight.
our u.s. funded pension plans are currently fully funded on a projected benefit obligation basis; however, the possibility exists that over time we may be required to make cash payments to the plans, reducing the cash available for our business. we record an asset or a liability associated with our pension plans equal to the surplus of the fair value of plan assets above the benefit obligation or the excess of the benefit obligation over the fair value of plan assets. at december 31, 2022, we had an overfunded pension asset balance. the benefit surplus recorded under the provisions of accounting standards codification ("asc") 715, "compensation - retirement benefits," at december 31, 2022 was $29 million. the amount and timing of future contributions, which could be material, will depend upon a number of factors, including the actual earnings and changes in values of plan assets and changes in interest rates.
risks related to the covid-19 pandemic the covid-19 pandemic has had an adverse effect on portions of our business, and could have material adverse effects on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows if public health conditions associated with covid-19 significantly deteriorate.  covid-19 has continued to result in a large number of hospitalizations and deaths in the u.s. and throughout the world, although the macroeconomic impact of the pandemic has decreased in comparison to the impact experienced earlier in the pandemic. the pandemic has had an adverse effect on portions of our business to varying degrees, including as the result of lower demand for certain of our products, supply chain and labor disruptions, and higher costs, and could continue to have adverse effects on our business depending on the future course of the pandemic. moreover, the pandemic could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, cash flow, liquidity, or financial condition if public health conditions significantly deteriorate. the ongoing impact of the pandemic on us will depend on numerous evolving factors and future developments, which are highly uncertain, including (a) the duration, severity and scope of the pandemic, including the potential spread of more contagious and/or virulent forms of the virus; (b) governmental and public health directives and/or actions taken by our customers, vendors and other private businesses in connection with the pandemic; (c) the availability, acceptance, effectiveness and administration of medical treatments, vaccines and booster shots for covid-19; and (d) the extent and duration of the pandemic's impact on economic conditions and social activity.
risks relating to industry conditions changes in the cost or availability of raw materials, energy and transportation have recently affected, and could continue to affect our profitability. we rely heavily on the use of certain raw materials (principally virgin wood fiber, recycled fiber, caustic soda, starch and adhesives), energy sources (principally biomass, natural gas, electricity and fuel oil) and third-party companies that transport our goods. the market price of virgin wood fiber varies based upon availability and source. the global supply and demand for recycled fiber may be affected by factors such as trade policies between countries, individual governments' legislation and regulations, and general macroeconomic conditions. in addition, the increase in demand of products manufactured, in whole or in part, from recycled fiber, on a global basis, may cause significant fluctuations in recycled fiber prices. taking into account ongoing inflationary conditions in the u.s. and globally, we have recently experienced, and expect to continue to experience, a significant increase in various costs, including recycled fiber, energy, freight, chemical, and other supply chain costs, which has adversely affected and is expected to continue to adversely affect our results of operations. energy prices, in particular prices for oil and natural gas, have fluctuated dramatically in the past and have recently increased (including as the result of the current energy crisis in europe associated with the russia-ukraine conflict), and may continue to increase and/or fluctuate in the future. moreover, the availability of labor and the market price for fuel may affect our costs for third-party transportation. in addition, because our businesses operate in highly competitive industry segments, we may not be able to recoup past or future increases in the costs of any raw materials, energy sources or transportation sources through price increases to our customers. our profitability has been, and will continue to be, affected by changes in the costs and availability of such raw materials, energy sources and transportation sources.
fluctuations in the prices of and the demand for our products due to factors such as economic cyclicality and changes in consumer preferences could materially affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. substantially all of our businesses have experienced, and are likely to continue to experience, cycles relating to industry capacity and general economic conditions. the length and magnitude of these cycles have varied over time and by product. in addition, changes in consumer preferences may increase or decrease the demand for our fiber-based products and non-fiber substitutes. moreover, consumer preferences are constantly changing based on, among other factors, cost, convenience and health concerns and perceptions and an increased awareness of esg considerations. these consumer preferences may affect the prices of our products. consequently, our financial results are sensitive to changes in the pricing and demand for our products. in addition, our results may be adversely affected if we fail to anticipate trends that would enable us to offer products that respond to changing customer preferences and technological and regulatory developments.
competition in the u.s. and internationally could negatively impact our financial results. we operate in a competitive environment, both in the u.s. and internationally, in all of our operating segments. our products compete with similar products produced by other forest products companies. product innovations, manufacturing and operating efficiencies, additional manufacturing capacity, marketing, distribution and pricing strategies pursued or achieved by competitors, and the entry of new competitors in to the markets we serve could negatively impact our financial results. in addition, our products also compete, in some instances, with companies in other industries that produce substitutes for wood-fiber products, such as plastics and various types of metal, and customer shifts away from wood-fiber products toward such substitute products may adversely affect our business.
risks relating to our operations material disruptions at one of our manufacturing facilities could negatively impact our financial results. we operate our facilities in compliance with applicable rules and regulations and take measures to minimize the risks of disruption at our facilities. a material disruption at our corporate headquarters or one of our manufacturing facilities could prevent us from meeting customer demand, reduce our sales and/or negatively impact our financial condition. any of our manufacturing facilities, or any of our machines within an otherwise operational facility, could cease operations unexpectedly due to a number of events, including:
•adverse weather events like fires, floods, earthquakes, hurricanes, winter storms and extreme cold, or other catastrophes (including adverse weather conditions that may be intensified by climate change);
•the effect of a drought or reduced rainfall on its water supply;
•disruption in the supply of raw materials or other manufacturing inputs;
•terrorism or threats of terrorism;
•information system disruptions or failures due to any number of causes, including cyber-attacks;
•domestic and international laws and regulations applicable to us and our business partners, including joint venture partners, around the world;
•unscheduled maintenance outages;
•prolonged power failures;
•an equipment failure;
•a chemical spill or release;
•explosion of a boiler or other equipment;
•damage or disruptions caused by third parties operating on or adjacent to one of our manufacturing facilities;
•disruptions in the transportation infrastructure, including roads, bridges, railroad tracks and tunnels;
•a widespread outbreak of an illness or any other communicable disease, such as the outbreak of the covid-19 virus, or any other public health crisis;
•failure of our third-party service providers and business partners to satisfactorily fulfill their commitments and responsibilities in a timely manner and in accordance with agreed upon terms;
•labor difficulties; and
•other operational problems.
any such downtime or facility damage could prevent us from meeting customer demand for our products and/or require us to make unplanned expenditures. if one of our machines or facilities were to incur significant downtime, our ability to meet our production targets and satisfy customer requirements could be impaired, resulting in lower sales and having a negative effect on our business and financial results.
certain operations are conducted by joint ventures that we cannot operate solely for our benefit. we have a 50% equity interest in ilim s.a., whose primary operations are in russia. we recently announced our entry into an agreement to sell this equity interest. in joint ventures, such as the ilim joint venture, we share ownership and management of a company with one or more parties who may or may not have the same goals, strategies, priorities or resources as we do. in general, joint ventures are intended to be operated for the benefit of all co-owners, rather than for our exclusive benefit. operating a business as a joint venture often requires additional organizational formalities as well as time-consuming procedures for sharing information and making decisions. in joint ventures, we are required to pay more attention to our relationship with our co-owners as well as with the joint venture, and if a co-owner changes, our relationship may be adversely affected. in addition, the benefits from a successful joint venture are shared among the co-owners, so we receive only our portion of those benefits.
our financial results and businesses, including our ilim joint venture, have been, and may continue to be, adversely affected by the current military conflict between russia and ukraine, including ongoing or future sanctions and export controls targeting russia and other responses to russia's invasion of ukraine. the global economy has been, and may continue to be, negatively impacted by russia's invasion of ukraine. as a result of russia's invasion of ukraine, the u.s., the united kingdom, the european union and other g7 countries, among other countries, have imposed coordinated financial and economic sanctions and export control measures on many industry sectors and parties in russia. the negative impacts arising from the conflict and these sanctions and export control measures as well as sanctions and other actions taken by russia have included and may continue to include reduced consumer demand, supply chain disruptions and increased costs for transportation, raw materials and energy, including recent energy increases which have been particularly acute in europe. we continue to carefully monitor the conflict and the potential impact of financial and economic sanctions and export control measures on the regional and global economy.
we have a 50% equity interest in ilim, the parent company of ilim group, whose primary operations are in russia. specifically, ilim group's facilities include three paper mills located in bratsk, ust-ilimsk, and koryazhma, russia, with combined total pulp and paper capacity of over 3.6 million metric tons. in joint ventures, such as the ilim joint venture, we share ownership and management of a company with one or more parties who may or may not have the same goals, strategies, priorities or resources as we do. ilim, and its directors and employees are not specially designated nationals or blocked persons or otherwise specifically identified in sanctions or export control measures issued by the u.s. or other countries.
the military conflict between russia and ukraine, including ongoing sanctions, actions by the russian government, and associated domestic and global economic and geopolitical conditions, has adversely affected and may continue to adversely affect our ilim joint venture and our businesses, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. in january 2023, we announced our entry into a definitive agreement to sell our equity interest in ilim; however, we cannot be certain if or when the completion of this sale may occur. our ability to complete this sale is subject to various risks, including (i) purchasers' inability to obtain necessary regulatory approvals or to finance the purchase pursuant to the terms of the agreement, (ii) adverse actions by the russian government, and (iii) new or expanded sanctions imposed by the u.s., the united kingdom, or the european union or its member countries. we are unable to predict the full impact that russia's ongoing invasion of ukraine, current or potential future sanctions or export control measures, ongoing or potential disruptions resulting from the conflict, the changing regulatory environment in russia, negative macroeconomic conditions arising from such conflict, supply chain disruptions, and/or geopolitical instability and shifts, may have on us or our ability to complete the sale of our interest in the ilim joint venture. in addition, any escalation of the current conflict, including as a result of the use of tactical nuclear weapons by russia or the expansion of the conflict to neighboring countries, could result in additional economic disruptions, capital market volatility, and significant geopolitical instability. in addition, developments with respect to the russia-ukraine conflict could heighten many of our known risks described elsewhere in this part i, item 1a "risk factors" in our annual report. such risks include, but are not limited to, adverse effects on global business and economic conditions, including volatility and increases in the price and demand of oil, natural gas and other energy products and inflation, demand for our products, increased cybersecurity risks, adverse changes in trade policies, taxes, government regulations, or our ability to implement and execute our business strategy including with respect to joint ventures, divestitures, spin-offs, capital investments and other corporate transactions that we have pursued or may pursue, disruptions in global supply chains, risks related to employees and contracts in the affected regions, our exposure to foreign currency fluctuations and potential nationalizations and asset seizures in russia, constraints, volatility, or disruption in the capital markets and our sources of liquidity, and our potential inability to service our remaining performance obligations and potential contractual breaches and litigations. additionally, fluctuations in the value of the russian ruble versus the u.s. dollar impacts our investment carrying value as well as financial results based on translation of ruble-denominated results into u.s. dollars and the re-measurement impact associated with non-functional currency financial assets and liabilities.
in particular, our investments in ilim involve certain legal, geopolitical, investment, repatriation, and transparency risks as a result of the conflict between russia and ukraine including: (i) the legal framework of russia continues to evolve and it is not possible to accurately predict the content or implications of changes in their statutes or regulations; and there has been a number of legislative proposals that, if adopted, could result in nationalization, expropriation, onerous or disadvantageous exit terms or other unfavorable regulations and could be introduced or enacted at any time without prior warning or consultation; (ii) current and future statutes and regulations may be unfairly or unevenly enforced, the courts may decline to enforce legal protections covering our investments altogether and/or the cost and difficulties of litigation in russia may make enforcement of our rights impractical or impossible; (iii) the risk we may inadvertently violate sanctions or export control measures that may be imposed by the u.s. or foreign governments, including russia, given the complexity and fluidity of the situation; (iv) financial and economic sanctions and export control measures imposed on certain industry sectors and parties in russia as well as counter-sanctions measures implemented by russia could lead to further disruptions in supply chains and adversely affect operations in russia; (v) increased risks of economic, political, or social instability, escalating military conflicts with ukraine or new conflicts with any other countries, war, or terrorism, which could adversely affect the economy of russia or lead to a material adverse change in the value of our investments in russia; and (vi) disclosure, accounting, and financial standards and requirements in russia may evolve and it is not possible to accurately predict the content or implications of changes in their disclosure requirements.
we may not achieve the expected benefits from strategic acquisitions, joint ventures, divestitures, spin-offs, capital investments and other corporate transactions that we have pursued or may pursue.  our strategy for long-term growth, productivity and profitability depends, in part, on our ability to accomplish prudent acquisitions, joint ventures, divestitures, spin-offs, capital investments and other corporate transactions that we may pursue and to realize the benefits we expect from such transactions. we are subject to the risk that we may not achieve the expected benefits from such transactions. this failure could require us to record an impairment charge for goodwill or other intangible assets, which could lead to decreased assets and reduced net earnings. among the benefits we expect from potential as well as completed acquisitions and joint ventures are synergies, cost savings, growth opportunities and access to new markets (or a combination thereof), and in the case of divestitures, the realization of proceeds from the sale of businesses and assets to purchasers who place higher strategic value on such businesses and assets than we do.
corporate transactions of this nature that we may pursue involve a number of special risks, including with respect to our inability to realize our business goals with to such transactions as noted above, the focus of our management's attention on these transactions and the assimilation of acquired businesses into our operations, the demands on our financial, operational and information technology systems resulting from acquired businesses, and the possibility that we may become responsible for substantial contingent or unanticipated legal liabilities as the result of acquisitions or other corporate transactions.
we believe that the spin-off of sylvamo corporation allows us and sylvamo corporation to pursue distinct strategies appropriate to our respective markets. however, there can be no assurance that we will realize any or all of the expected strategic, financial, operational or other benefits of the spin-off. a failure to realize expected benefits of the spin-off could result in a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.
we cannot guarantee that sylvamo corporation will be successful as a standalone entity. in the event that sylvamo corporation is not successful, it is possible that plaintiffs could assert a variety of claims against us. depending on their nature and number, such claims could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.
we could be exposed to claims from sylvamo corporation under our agreements with sylvamo corporation or otherwise. we previously entered into agreements with sylvamo corporation and its subsidiaries, including among others a separation and distribution agreement, registration rights agreement, transition services agreement, tax matters agreement, supply and offtake agreements, intellectual property agreements and other commercial arrangements in connection with the spin-off. our agreements with sylvamo corporation or its subsidiaries may not reflect terms that would have resulted from negotiations between unaffiliated parties and, in certain instances, may relate to the continuation of certain business arrangements among us and sylvamo corporation in existence prior to the spin-off. such agreements include, among other things, the parties' respective indemnification rights and obligations with respect to certain losses relating to specified liabilities as well as certain losses relating to specified information included in certain securities filings, the allocations of assets and liabilities, payment obligations and other obligations between us and sylvamo corporation. there can be no assurance that any remedies available under these arrangements will be sufficient to compensate us in the event of a dispute or non-performance. in addition, there can be no assurance that the attention we must pay, and resources we must devote, to our obligations under one or more of these agreements, or the results of any failure to perform those obligations, or successful claim by sylvamo corporation that we have failed to perform those obligations or have an indemnification obligation under these agreements, will not have a material impact on our own business performance, results of operations or financial condition.
we will rely on sylvamo corporation to satisfy its performance and payment obligations under these agreements entered into in connection with the spin-off. if sylvamo corporation fails to satisfy such obligations, it could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.
in addition, under the tax matters agreement, we could have significant payment obligations in connection with certain brazilian tax matters. under this agreement, we have agreed to pay 60% of the first $300 million of any liability resulting from the resolution of these brazilian tax matters (with sylvamo paying the remaining 40% of any such liability) and 100% of any liability resulting from the brazilian tax matters over $300 million. the assessments for the tax years 2007 - 2015 currently total approximately $111 million in tax and $361 million in interest, penalties and fees as of december 31, 2022 (adjusted for variation in currency exchange rates). see note 14 commitments and contingent liabilities on pages 71 through 75 of item 8. financial statements and supplementary data for further information.
we operate in a challenging market for talent and may fail to attract and retain qualified personnel, including key management personnel. our ability to operate and grow our business depends on our ability to attract and retain employees with the skills necessary to operate and maintain our facilities, produce our products and serve our customers. the market for both hourly workers and salaried workers has been, and remains, very competitive, particularly for employees with specialized technical and trade experience. for example, due to labor market constraints, we have recently had to increase overtime while we try to hire additional regular employees. this, along with the current competitive labor market and ongoing inflationary conditions, has led to higher labor costs, particularly at our converting facilities. moreover, despite our focused efforts to attract and retain employees, including by offering higher levels of compensation in certain instances, we experienced attrition rates within our workforce (particularly those early in their career) in the past two years that exceeded historical levels. in addition, we rely on key executive and management personnel to manage our business efficiently and effectively. the loss of key executive and management employees, particularly in a challenging market for attracting and retaining employees, could adversely affect our business.
moreover, changing demographics and labor work force trends, including remote work and work-life balance expectations for many individuals arising from the covid-19 pandemic, may make it difficult for us to replace retiring or departing employees. if we fail to attract and retain qualified personnel, or if we continue to experience excessive turnover, we may continue to experience higher labor costs and labor shortages, and our business may be adversely impacted.
in addition, a significant number of our employees are represented by unions. we may not be able to successfully negotiate new union contracts once our current contracts with unions expire without work stoppages or labor difficulties, or we may be unable to renegotiate such contracts on favorable terms. negotiations between the company and usw regarding the mill master collective bargaining agreement (which expires august 2023) and related mill joint pension counsel master agreement (which expires september 2023) are scheduled to begin on february 19, 2023. usw represents approximately 6,000 employees at the mills. we have also experienced work stoppages in the past and may experience them in the future. moreover, labor organizations may attempt to organize groups of additional employees from time to time, and potential changes in labor laws could make it easier for them to do so. if we experience any extended interruption of operations at any of our facilities as a result of strikes or other work stoppages or if unions are able to organize additional groups of our employees, our operating costs increase and our operational flexibility could be reduced.
we are subject to cybersecurity and information technology risks related to breaches of security pertaining to sensitive company, customer, employee and vendor information as well as breaches in the technology used to manage operations and other business processes. our business operations rely upon securely managed information technology systems, some of which are provided or managed by third parties, for data capture, processing, storage and reporting. we have invested in information technology security initiatives and information technology risk management, as well as incident response, business continuity and disaster recovery plans but we cannot eliminate all systematic risk. the development and maintenance of these measures is costly and requires ongoing monitoring, testing and updating as technologies and processes change, and efforts to overcome security measures become increasingly sophisticated. additionally, the regulatory environment surrounding information security data privacy and data protection is becoming increasingly restrictive and is evolving frequently.
the current cyber threat environment presents increased risk for all companies, including those in our industry. like other global companies, our systems are subject to recurring attempts by third parties to access information, manipulate data or disrupt our operations, and we have experienced cyber threats and incidents, although none have been material or had a material adverse effect on our business. despite careful security and controls design, implementation, updating and independent third party verification, our information technology systems, and those of our third-party providers or joint venture partners, could become subject to employee error or malfeasance, cyber-attacks, such as ransomware and data theft, by common hackers, criminal groups or nation-state organizations or social activist ("hacktivist") organizations, geopolitical events, natural disasters, failures or impairments of telecommunications networks or other catastrophic events. moreover, hardware, software or applications we use may have inherent vulnerabilities or defects of design, manufacture or operations or could be inadvertently or intentionally implemented or used in a manner that could compromise information security. in addition, the cybersecurity-related threats that we face may remain undetected for an extended period of time. network, system, application and data breaches, and other cybersecurity incidents, could result in operational disruptions, data loss or manipulation, or information misappropriation including, but not limited to, interruption to systems availability, denial of access to and misuse of applications required by our customers to conduct business with us. access to applications required to plan our operations, source materials, manufacture and ship finished goods and account for orders could be denied or misused. theft of intellectual property or trade secrets, and loss or inappropriate disclosure of confidential company, employee, customer or vendor information, could stem from such incidents. while we have significant security processes and initiatives in place, we may be unable to detect or prevent a breach or disruption. any significant cybersecurity incident or operational disruptions and/or misappropriation of information could result in lost sales, business delays, negative publicity, cause us to incur legal liability and increased costs to address such events and related security concerns which may include costs to recover data and institute additional controls to prevent future similar incidents and have a material effect on our business. additionally, while we have insurance coverage designed to address certain aspects of cyber risks in place, such insurance coverage may be insufficient to cover all losses or all types of claims that may arise in connection with such incidents.
risks relating to legal proceedings and compliance costs we are subject to a wide variety of laws, regulations and other government requirements that may change in significant ways, and the cost of compliance with such requirements could impact our business and results of operations. our operations are subject to regulation under a wide variety of u.s. federal and state and non-u.s. laws, regulations and other government requirements -- including, among others, those relating to the environment, health and safety, labor and employment, data privacy, tax, trade and health care. there can be no assurance that laws, regulations and government requirements will not be changed, applied or interpreted in ways that will require us to modify our operations and objectives or affect our returns on investments by restricting existing activities and products, or subjecting us to increased costs.
for example, as part of our business, we are subject to increasingly stringent federal, state, local and international laws governing the protection of the environment. we have incurred significant capital, operating and other expenditures complying with applicable environmental laws and regulations. in addition, new environmental laws, regulations or other requirements, including with respect to ghg emissions or climate change, may cause us to incur increased and unexpected compliance costs. moreover, there has historically been, and may continue to be, a lack of consistency between jurisdictions regarding legal requirements with respect to climate and ghg emission matters, which has created and may continue to create economic and regulatory uncertainty. our environmental expenditures include, among other areas, those related to air and water quality, waste disposal and the cleanup of contaminated soil and groundwater, including situations where we have been identified as a potentially responsible party. moreover, we may be directly impacted by, and are working to manage, the risks and costs to us, our customers and our vendors of the effects of climate change, ghgs, and the availability of energy and water resources. these risks include the potentially adverse impact on forestlands, which are a key resource in the production of our products, increased product costs and a change in the types of products that customers purchase. there can be no assurance that future remediation requirements and compliance with existing and new laws and requirements will not require significant expenditures, or that existing reserves for specific matters will be adequate to cover future costs. we could also incur substantial fines or sanctions, enforcement actions (including orders limiting our operations or requiring corrective measures), natural resource damages claims, cleanup and closure costs, third-party claims for property damage and personal injury and reputational harm as a result of violations of, or liabilities under, environmental laws, regulations, codes and common law. the amount and timing of environmental expenditures is difficult to predict, and, in some cases, liability may be imposed without regard to contribution or to whether we knew of, or caused, the release of hazardous substances.
our global operations subject us to complex and evolving u.s and international data privacy laws and regulations, such as european's union general data protection regulation ("gdpr"), the california consumer privacy act of 2018 ("ccpa") as amended, and china's personal information protection law ("pipl") which came into effect as of november 1, 2021. these laws require the company to comply with a range of compliance obligations regarding the handling of personal data. there are significant penalties for non-compliance including monetary fines, disruption of operations and reputational harm. moreover, other states and governmental authorities around the world have introduced or passed, or are considering, similar legislation which may impose varying standards and requirements on our data collection, use and processing activities.
this increasingly restrictive and evolving regulatory environment at the international, federal and state level related to data privacy and data protection may continue to require changes to our business practices and give rise to significantly expanded compliance burdens, costs and enforcement risks. moreover, many of these laws and regulations are subject to uncertain application, interpretation or enforcement standards that could result in claims, changes to our business practices, data processing and security systems, penalties, increased operating costs or other impacts on our businesses. these laws often provide for civil penalties for violations, as well as private rights of action for data breaches that may increase data breach litigation. we proactively use internal and external resources to monitor compliance with relevant legislation and continually evaluates and, where necessary, modifies its data processing practices and policies in order to comply with evolving privacy laws. nevertheless, relevant regulatory authorities could determine that our data handling practices fail to address all the requirements of certain new laws, which could subject us to penalties and/or litigation. in addition, there is no assurance that our security controls over personal data, the training of employees and vendors on data privacy and data security, and the policies, procedures and practices we implemented or may implement in the future will prevent the improper handling of, disclosure of or access to personal data. improper handling and disclosure of or access to personal data in violation of the gdpr, pipl, the ccpa and/or of other data privacy and protection laws could harm our reputation, cause loss of consumer confidence, subject us to government enforcement actions (including fines), or result in private litigation against us, which could result in loss of revenue, increased costs, liability for monetary damages, fines and/or criminal prosecution, all of which could negatively affect our business and operating results.
we are subject to taxes in the u.s. and various foreign jurisdictions, and changes in laws, regulation or interpretation of existing laws and regulations in the u.s. and other jurisdictions where we are subject to taxation, could increase our taxes and have an adverse effect on our financial results. in addition, the application of tax law is subject to interpretation and is subject to audit by taxing authorities. additionally, administrative guidance can be incomplete or vary from legislative intent, and therefore the application of the tax law is uncertain. while we believe the positions reported by the company comply with relevant tax laws and regulations, taxing authorities could interpret our application of certain laws and regulations differently.
we are currently subject to tax audits in the u.s. and other taxing jurisdictions around the world. in some cases, we have appealed and may continue to appeal, assessments by taxing authorities in the court system. as such, tax controversy matters may result in previously unrecorded tax expenses, accelerated cash tax payments, higher future tax expenses, or the assessment of interest and penalties.
results of legal proceedings could have a material effect on our consolidated financial results. we are a party to various legal, regulatory and governmental proceedings and other related matters, including with respect to environmental matters. in addition, we are and may become subject to other loss contingencies, both known and unknown, which may relate to past, present and future facts, events, circumstances and occurrences. should an unfavorable outcome occur in connection with our legal, regulatory or governmental proceedings or other loss contingencies, or if we become subject to any such loss contingencies in the future, there could be a material adverse impact on our financial results. see note 14 commitments and contingent liabilities on pages 71 through 75 of item 8. financial statements and supplementary data for further information.
if the spin-off of sylvamo corporation were to fail to qualify for non-recognition treatment for u.s. federal income tax purposes, then international paper and our shareholders may be subject to significant u.s. federal income taxes.  the company received an opinion of tax counsel and a private letter ruling from the u.s. internal revenue service (the "irs") regarding the qualification of the spin-off of sylvamo corporation and certain related transactions as a transaction that is generally tax-free to sylvamo corporation, the company and the shareholders of the company for u.s. federal income tax purposes. a tax opinion is not binding on the irs or the courts, and there can be no assurance that the irs or a court will not take a contrary position. in addition, the company's tax counsel and the irs relied on certain representations and covenants delivered by the company and sylvamo corporation in rendering such opinion and private letter ruling. if any of the representations or covenants relied upon for the tax opinion or private letter ruling become inaccurate, incomplete or not complied with by the company, sylvamo corporation or any of their respective subsidiaries, the tax opinion may be invalid and the conclusions reached therein could be jeopardized.
if the irs ultimately determines that the spin-off is taxable, then the spin-off could be treated as a taxable dividend or capital gain to the company's shareholders for u.s. federal income tax purposes, and the company could incur significant u.s. federal income tax liabilities. these income tax liabilities may be indemnifiable by sylvamo corporation pursuant to a tax matters agreement between the company and sylvamo. however, there can be no assurance that sylvamo would have the resources or liquidity required to indemnify the company for any such tax liability.
even if the spin-off otherwise qualifies for non-recognition of gain or loss under section 355 of the code, the spin-off may be taxable to the company (but not the shareholders of the company) pursuant to section 355(e) of the code if there is a 50% or more (by vote or value) change in ownership of either the company or sylvamo corporation, directly or indirectly, as part of a plan or series of related transactions that include the spin-off. for this purpose, any acquisitions of the company's or sylvamo corporation's common stock within two years before or after the spin-off are presumed to be part of such a plan, although the company or sylvamo corporation may be able to rebut that presumption based on either applicable facts and circumstances or a "safe harbor" described in the u.s. tax regulations.
item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes included in "financial statements and supplementary data" of this annual report on form 10-k. in addition to historical consolidated financial information, the following discussion contains forward-looking statements that reflect our plans, estimates, and beliefs that involve significant risks and uncertainties. our actual results could differ materially from those discussed in the forward-looking statements. factors that could cause or contribute to those differences include those discussed below and elsewhere in this annual report on form 10-k, particularly in "risk factors" and "forward-looking statements."
the following generally discusses 2022 and 2021 items and year-to-year comparisons between 2022 and 2021. discussion of historical items in 2020, and year-to-year comparisons between 2021 and 2020, can be found in our annual report on form 10-k for the fiscal year ended december 31, 2021, filed with the sec on february 18, 2022, under part ii, item 7, management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations.
executive summary full-year 2022 net earnings attributable to shareholders were $1.5 billion ($4.10 per diluted share) compared with $1.8 billion ($4.47 per diluted share) for full-year 2021.
during 2022, international paper grew revenue and earnings, driven by solid commercial and operational performance, while facing significant inflation and lower demand. our businesses generated improved earnings as profit improvement initiatives and price realization offset significant inflationary cost headwinds. we continued to make solid progress in our building a better ip initiatives, delivering $250 million of earnings benefits through initiatives focused on lowering our cost structure and accelerating profitable growth. as a result, we exceeded our full-year target and have strong momentum going forward. we made strategic investments, primarily in our industrial packaging business, in support of profitable growth and will continue to make such investments to grow earnings and cash generation by building additional capabilities and capacity in our u.s. box system. we made significant progress toward achieving value-creating returns in our global cellulose fibers business by delivering $100 million of earnings growth in 2022. the business expects to continue the earnings improvement in 2023. we generated full-year cash from operations of $2.2 billion and free cash flow of $1.2 billion. our continued solid cash generation enabled us to return $1.93 billion to shareholders, including $1.26 billion in share repurchases and $673 million in dividend payments. finally, we reached agreement to sell our 50% interest in ilim sa to our joint venture partners for $484 million. additionally, our partners have expressed interest in purchasing our shares in jsc ilim group for $24 million. upon sale of our interests in the ilim joint venture, which are subject to regulatory approval, we will no longer have investments in russia.
comparing our 2022 results to 2021, price and mix improved significantly for both the north american industrial packaging and global cellulose fibers businesses, with strong price realization across all of our channels, along with the benefits of commercial initiatives. volume was lower in our north american industrial packaging business following stronger packaging demand in 2021 as consumers had pulled forward purchases of goods during the pandemic. in
2022, demand was also negatively impacted as consumers shifted priorities toward both non-discretionary goods as well as services while dealing with inflation. operating costs were negatively impacted by lower volumes in our north american industrial packaging business. high inflation on materials and services also negatively impacted operating costs in our north american industrial packaging and global cellulose fibers businesses. rising supply chain costs negatively impacted both businesses during 2022. higher operating costs were partially offset by improved mill performance and reliability. maintenance outage expense increased, as planned, impacted by high inflation on equipment, parts and contracted services. input costs rose sharply across nearly all categories, with higher energy and fuel costs being the leading drivers. corporate expenses were favorable driven by overhead streamlining initiatives.
looking ahead to the first quarter 2023, as compared to the fourth quarter 2022, in our industrial packaging business, we expect price and mix to be lower based on prior price index movements and lower average export prices. volume is expected to be higher in the first quarter 2023 due to four more shipping days in north america, partially offset by normal seasonal declines in north america. operations and costs are expected to decrease earnings due to the non-repeat of favorable one-time items in the fourth quarter 2022, seasonally higher energy consumption and additional inflation on materials and services. maintenance outage expense is expected to be significantly higher as the first quarter will be our highest outage quarter this year, representing about 40% of total planned outage costs in 2023. input costs are expected to improve on lower average costs for energy, fuel and fiber. in our global cellulose fibers business, we expect price and mix to improve. we expect volume to decrease due to seasonally lower demand and customer inventory destocking in response to increased supply chain velocity. operations and costs are expected to increase on the non-repeat of a favorable one-time items in the fourth quarter 2022. operations and costs will also be impacted by higher unabsorbed fixed costs due to lower volumes, seasonally higher energy consumption and additional inflation on materials and services. maintenance outage expense is expected to increase as the first quarter 2023 will also be global cellulose fibers highest maintenance outage quarter in 2023. input costs are expected to decrease driven by lower energy and fiber.
looking to full-year 2023, we believe we have significant opportunities to reduce high marginal costs across our system and capture further benefits from our building a better ip initiatives. the building a better ip initiatives are focused on continuing to invest in projects to drive structural cost reduction through efficiency improvements and accelerating profitable growth. we expect continued momentum from these initiatives as we move into 2023 including meaningful earnings growth in our global cellulose fibers business as a result of our commercial strategy execution. we expect cash from operations ranging from $1.9 billion to $2.3 billion with free cash flow of $0.9 billion to $1.1 billion. included in both ranges is approximately $190 million for the tax settlement payment related to our timber monetization transaction. with respect to our capital allocation framework, we are targeting capital expenditures of $1.0 billion to $1.2 billion with increased investments in our us box system to build additional capabilities and support profitable growth with our customers. as previously mentioned, we returned approximately $1.9 billion of cash to shareowners in 2022. in october 2022, our board of directors authorized an additional $1.5 billion of share repurchases with a total current authorization of approximately $3.2 billion. going forward, we are committed to returning cash through maintaining our dividend and through opportunistic share repurchases.
adjusted operating earnings and adjusted operating earnings per share are non-gaap measures and are defined as net earnings (loss) attributable to international paper (a gaap measure) excluding discontinued operations, net special items and non-operating pension expense (income). net earnings (loss) and diluted earnings (loss) per share attributable to common shareholders are the most directly comparable gaap measures. the company calculates adjusted operating earnings by excluding the after-tax effect of discontinued operations, non-operating pension expense (income) and items considered by management to be unusual (net special items) from net earnings (loss) attributable to shareholders reported under gaap. adjusted operating earnings per share is calculated by dividing adjusted operating earnings by diluted average shares of common stock outstanding. management uses this measure to focus on on-going operations, and believes that it is useful to investors because it enables them to perform meaningful comparisons of past and present consolidated operating results from continuing operations. the company believes that using this information, along with the most direct comparable gaap measure, provides for a more complete analysis of the results of operations.
the following are reconciliations of earnings (loss) attributable to common shareholders to adjusted operating earnings (loss) attributable to common shareholders on a total and per share basis. additional detail is provided later in this form 10-k regarding the net special items referenced in the charts below:

cash provided by operations, including discontinued operations, totaled $2.2 billion and $2.0 billion for 2022 and 2021, respectively. the company generated free cash flow of approximately $1.2 billion in 2022 and $1.5 billion in 2021. free cash flow is a non-gaap measure and the most directly comparable gaap measure is cash provided by operations. management utilizes this measure in connection with managing our business and believes that free cash flow is useful to investors as a liquidity measure because it measures the amount of cash generated that is available, after reinvesting in the business, to maintain a strong balance sheet, pay dividends, repurchase stock, service debt and make investments for future growth. it should not be inferred that the entire free cash flow amount is available for discretionary expenditures. by adjusting for certain items that are not indicative of the company's ongoing underlying operational performance, we believe that free cash flow also enables investors to perform meaningful comparisons between past and present periods.
the following are reconciliations of free cash flow to cash provided by operations:

the non-gaap financial measures presented in this form 10-k as referenced above have limitations as analytical tools and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for an analysis of our results calculated in accordance with gaap. in addition, because not all companies utilize identical calculations, the company's presentation of non-gaap measures in this form 10-k may not be comparable to similarly titled measures disclosed by other companies, including companies in the same industry as the company.
results of operations business segment operating profits are used by international paper's management to measure the earnings performance of its businesses. management uses this measure to focus on on-going operations and believes that it is useful to investors because it enables them to perform meaningful comparisons of past and present operating results. international paper believes that using this information, along with net earnings, provides a more complete analysis of the results of operations by year.

business segment operating profits are defined as earnings (loss) from continuing operations before income taxes and equity earnings, but including the impact of less than wholly owned subsidiaries, and excluding interest expense, net, corporate expenses, net, corporate net special items, business net special items and non-operating pension expense. business segment operating profits is a measure reported to our management for purposes of making decisions about allocating resources to our business segments and assessing the performance of our business segments and is presented in our financial statement footnotes in accordance with asc 280.
international paper operates in two segments: industrial packaging and global cellulose fibers. the company recently announced an agreement to sell its ilim equity investment and, as a result, all current and historical results of the ilim investment are presented as discontinued operations, net of taxes and our equity investment is no longer a separate reportable industry segment. during 2021, as a result of the spin-off of our printing papers business along with certain mixed-use coated paperboard and pulp businesses and the associated reclassification of these businesses to discontinued operations, we no longer have a printing paper segment and the remaining sales and operating profits previously reported in the printing papers business have been reclassified for segment reporting for all periods presented.

business segment operating profit in 2022 was $213 million higher than in 2021 as the benefits from higher average sales price realizations net of an unfavorable mix ($2.2 billion) were partially offset by lower sales volumes ($160 million), higher operating costs ($657 million), higher input costs ($1.1 billion) and higher maintenance outage costs ($70 million).
the principal changes in operating profit by business segment were as follows:
•industrial packaging's operating profit of $1.7 billion was $104 million higher than in 2021 as the benefits of higher average sales price net of an unfavorable mix were partially offset by lower sales volumes, higher operating costs, higher input costs and higher maintenance outage costs.
•global cellulose fibers' operating profit (loss) improved $109 million to $106 million profit compared with 2021 as the benefits of higher average sales price, favorable mix and sales volumes were partially offset by higher operating costs, higher input costs and higher maintenance outage costs.
liquidity and capital resources including discontinued operations, international paper generated $2.2 billion of cash flow from operations for the year ended december 31, 2022, compared with $2.0 billion in 2021. capital spending for 2022 totaled $931 million, or 90% of depreciation and amortization expense. our liquidity position remains strong, supported by approximately $2.0 billion of credit facilities.
results of operations while the operating results for international paper's various business segments are driven by a number of business-specific factors, changes in international paper's operating results are closely tied to changes in general economic conditions in north america, europe, latin america, north africa and the middle east.
factors that impact the demand for our products include industrial non-durable goods production, consumer preferences, consumer spending and movements in currency exchange rates.
product prices are affected by a variety of factors including general economic trends, inventory levels, currency exchange rate movements and worldwide capacity utilization. in addition to these revenue-related factors, net earnings are impacted by various cost drivers, the more significant of which include changes in raw material costs, principally wood, recovered fiber and chemical costs; energy costs; freight costs; mill outage costs; salary and benefits costs, including pensions; and manufacturing conversion costs.
the following is a discussion of international paper's consolidated results of operations for the year ended december 31, 2022, and the major factors affecting these results compared to 2021.
for the year ended december 31, 2022, international paper reported net sales of $21.2 billion, compared with $19.4 billion in 2021. international net sales (based on the location of the seller and including u.s. exports) totaled $5.9 billion or 28% of total sales in 2022. this compares with international net sales of $5.2 billion in 2021.

income taxes a net income tax benefit from continuing operations of $236 million was recorded for 2022, including a tax benefit of $604 million related to the settlement of the timber monetization restructuring tax matter, a tax benefit of $66 million related to the tax-free exchange of our shares of sylvamo corporation and tax expense of $45 million related to a foreign deferred tax valuation allowance. excluding these items, a $37 million net tax benefit for other special items and a $48 million tax expense related to non-operating pension income, the operational tax provision (non-gaap) was $378 million, or 24% of pre-tax earnings before equity earnings.
a net income tax provision from continuing operations of $188 million was recorded for 2021. excluding a $87 million net tax benefit for other special items and a $49 million tax expense related to non-operating pension income, the operational tax provision (non-gaap) was $226 million, or 19% of pre-tax earnings before equity earnings.
the operational tax provision and rate are non-gaap measures and are calculated by adjusting the income tax provision from continuing operations and rate to exclude net special items and non-operating pension expense (income). management adjusts the income tax provision and rate to account for non-recurring, non-operational items as we believe it provides a more meaningful comparison of the income tax rate between past and present periods.
interest expense, equity earnings, net of taxes and noncontrolling interest net corporate interest expense totaled $325 million in 2022 and $337 million in 2021. net interest expense in 2022 includes $58 million of interest expense related to the timber monetization restructuring tax matter. the decrease in 2022 compared with 2021 was due to lower average outstanding debt.
equity earnings, net of taxes were a loss of $6 million and income of $2 million in 2022 and 2021, respectively.
net earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests were $2 million in 2021. there were no net earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests in 2022.

(b) recorded in the industrial packaging business segment.
description of business segments international paper's business segments discussed below are consistent with the internal structure used to manage these businesses. all segments are differentiated on a common product, common customer basis consistent with the business segmentation generally used in the forest products industry.
industrial packaging international paper is the largest manufacturer of containerboard in the united states. our u.s. production capacity is over 13 million tons annually. our products include linerboard, medium, whitetop, recycled linerboard, recycled medium and saturating kraft. about 80% of our production is converted into corrugated packaging and other packaging by our 176 north american corrugated packaging plants. additionally, we recycle approximately one million tons of occ and mixed and white paper through our 16 u.s. recycling plants. our corrugated packaging plants are supported by regional design centers, which offer total packaging solutions and supply chain initiatives. in emea, our operations include a recycled fiber containerboard mill in morocco and one in spain and 24 corrugated packaging plants in france, italy, spain, morocco and portugal.
global cellulose fibers our cellulose fibers product portfolio includes fluff, market and specialty pulps. international paper is the largest producer of fluff pulp which is used to make absorbent hygiene products like baby diapers, feminine care, adult incontinence and other non-woven products. our market pulp is used for tissue and paper products. we continue to invest in exploring new innovative uses for our products, such as our specialty pulps, which are used for non-absorbent end uses including textiles, filtration, construction material, paints and coatings, reinforced plastics and more. our products are made in the united states and canada and are sold around the world. international paper facilities have annual dried pulp capacity of about 3 million metric tons.
business segment results the following tables present net sales and operating profit (loss) which is the company's measure of segment profitability.
industrial packaging demand for industrial packaging products is closely correlated with non-durable industrial goods production, as well as with demand for e-commerce, processed foods, poultry, meat and agricultural products. in addition to prices and volumes, major factors affecting the profitability of industrial packaging are raw material and energy costs, freight costs, mill outage costs, manufacturing efficiency and product mix.

north american industrial packaging's average sales margins were higher reflecting higher prices for both containerboard and corrugated boxes. sales volumes decreased in 2022 compared with 2021 for corrugated boxes across our segments driven by the macroeconomic environment reflecting lower consumer spending on goods and retailer inventory destocking. containerboard sales volumes also decreased. total maintenance and economic downtime was about 956,000 short tons higher in 2022 compared with 2021, primarily due to economic downtime. operating and distribution costs increased, primarily due to inflation on materials and services and supply chain and labor constraints. planned maintenance downtime costs were $58 million higher in 2022 than in 2021. input costs were significantly higher, driven by higher energy, wood and chemical costs.
looking ahead to the first quarter of 2023, compared with the fourth quarter of 2022, sales volumes for corrugated boxes and containerboard are expected to increase reflecting four additional shipping days partially offset by the normal season decline. average sales margins are expected to be lower. operating costs are expected to increase. planned maintenance downtime costs are expected to be $95 million higher. input costs are expected to be lower primarily for recovered fiber and energy.

emea industrial packaging's average sales margins were higher in the eurozone driven by higher average sales price. average sales margins in morocco were lower reflecting the impact of an unfavorable product mix. sales volumes in 2022 were lower than in 2021 driven by the sale of our emea packaging business in turkey in may 2021. operating costs were higher driven by inflation on materials and services. planned maintenance outage costs were higher in 2022 compared with 2021. input costs were significantly higher, driven by unprecedented energy costs.
entering the first quarter of 2023, compared with the fourth quarter of 2022, sales volumes are expected to be higher driven by seasonality in morocco. average sales margins are expected to be higher, reflecting lower containerboard costs. operating costs are expected to be higher. planned maintenance outage costs are expected to be $4 million lower due to no planned outages in the first quarter. other input costs are expected to be stable.
global cellulose fibers demand for cellulose fibers products is closely correlated with changes in demand for absorbent hygiene products, primarily driven by the demographics and income growth in various geographic regions. it is further affected by changes in currency rates that can benefit or hurt producers in different geographic regions. principal cost drivers include manufacturing efficiency, raw material and energy costs, mill outage costs, and freight costs.

global cellulose fibers net sales for 2022 increased 18% to $3.2 billion, compared with $2.7 billion in 2021. operating profits in 2022 improved significantly compared to 2021. comparing 2022 with 2021, benefits from higher average sales price, a favorable mix and sales volumes ($552 million) were partially offset by higher operating costs ($257 million), higher input costs ($175 million) and higher maintenance outage costs ($11 million).
sales volumes in 2022 compared with 2021 were lower reflecting the challenging supply chain environment. total maintenance and economic downtime was about 13,000 short tons higher in 2022 compared with 2021, primarily due to economic downtime. average sales margins were higher, reflecting higher average fluff and market pulp prices. operating costs increased, driven by inflation on materials and services and supply chain related mill slowbacks and downtime. distribution costs were significantly higher driven by continuing global supply chain disruptions. planned maintenance outage costs were $11 million higher in 2022. input costs were significantly higher, driven by chemicals, wood and energy.
entering the first quarter of 2023, compared with the fourth quarter of 2022, sales volumes are expected to be lower reflecting seasonally lower demand and customer inventory destocking in response to increased supply chain velocity. average sales margins are expected to improve. operating costs are expected to be higher. planned maintenance outage costs are expected to be $13 million higher than in the fourth quarter of 2022. input costs are expected to be lower, primarily for energy.
equity earnings, net of taxes - ilim on january 24, 2023, the company announced it had reached an agreement to sell its equity investment in ilim and also received from the same purchasers an indication of interest to purchase its equity investment in ilim group. this transaction is discussed further in note 11 - equity method investments on pages 66 through 68 of item 8. financial statements and supplementary data.
all current and historical results of the ilim investment are presented as discontinued operations, net of taxes in the consolidated statement of operations. the company recorded equity earnings, net of taxes, related to ilim of $296 million in 2022, compared with earnings of $311 million in 2021.
higher sales volumes and better sales margins in 2022 were more than offset by higher input costs, shipping costs and repair expenses. sales volumes for the joint venture increased by 5% in 2022, primarily for softwood pulp and containerboard shipments to china, partially offset by lower shipments of softwood pulp and containerboard to other export markets. average sales margins were significantly higher for sales of softwood pulp and hardwood pulp reflecting higher average sales prices in all markets. average sales margins for shipments of containerboard declined reflecting lower average sales prices in all markets. input costs were higher, primarily for wood, fuel and chemicals. distribution costs were negatively impacted by higher transportation tariffs and other inflationary pressures. maintenance and repair expenses were higher due in part to repairs to recovery boiler no. 2 at the ust-ilimsk mill in the fourth quarter of 2022. the company received cash dividends from the joint venture of $204 million in 2022 and $154 million in 2021.
liquidity and capital resources overview a major factor in international paper's liquidity and capital resource planning is its generation of operating cash flow, which is highly sensitive to changes in the pricing and demand for our major products. while changes in key operating cash costs, such as raw material, energy, mill outage and distribution, do have an effect on operating cash generation, we believe that our focus on commercial and operational excellence, as well as our ability to tightly manage costs and working capital has improved our cash flow generation over an operating cycle.
use of cash during 2022 was primarily focused on working capital requirements, capital spending and returning cash to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases under the company's share repurchase program.

(a)reductions related to notes with interest rates ranging from 3.00% to 8.70% with original maturities from 2023 to 2048 for the years ended december 31, 2022 and 2021.
(b)amounts are included in restructuring and other charges in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations.
the company's early debt reductions in 2022 included debt tenders of $498 million with interest rates ranging from 6.40% to 8.70% and maturity dates ranging from 2023 to 2039. in addition, during 2022, the company had $5 million in open market repurchases related to debt with interest rates ranging from 4.35% to 4.40% and maturity dates ranging from 2047 to 2048. in addition to the early debt reductions, the company had debt reductions of $514 million in 2022 related primarily to capital leases, debt maturities, and international debt.
in january 2023, the company entered into a variable term loan agreement providing for a $600 million term loan which was fully drawn on the date of such loan agreement and matures in 2028. the $600 million debt was issued following the repayment of $410 million of commercial paper earlier in 2023 and will also be used to repay debt maturing later in 2023 and general corporate purposes.
other financing activities during 2022 included the net issuance of approximately 1.6 million shares of treasury stock. repurchases of common stock and payments of restricted stock withholding taxes totaled $1.3 billion, including $1.3 billion related to shares repurchased under the company's share repurchase program. the company has repurchased 114.4 million shares at an average price of $46.66, for a total of approximately $5.3 billion, since the repurchase program began in september 2013 through december 31, 2022. the company paid cash dividends totaling $673 million during 2022.
other financing activities during 2021 included the net issuance of approximately 1.9 million shares of treasury stock. repurchases of common stock and payments of restricted stock withholding taxes totaled $838 million, including $810.9 million related to shares repurchased under the company's share repurchase program. the company paid cash dividends totaling $780 million during 2021.
interest rate swaps our policy is to manage interest cost using a mixture of fixed-rate and variable-rate debt. to manage this risk, international paper utilizes interest rate swaps to change the mix of fixed and variable rate debt. during 2020, international paper terminated its interest rate swaps with a notional amount of $700 million and maturities ranging from 2024 to 2026 with an approximate fair value of $85 million. subsequent to the termination of the interest rate swaps, the fair value basis adjustment is amortized to earnings as interest income over the same period as a debt premium on the previously hedged debt. the company had no outstanding interest rate swaps for the years ended december 31, 2022 and 2021 (see note 17 derivatives and hedging activities on pages 78 through 81 of item 8. financial statements and supplementary data).
variable interest entities information concerning variable interest entities is set forth in note 15 variable interest entities on pages 75 and 76 of item 8. financial statements and supplementary data. in connection with the 2006 international paper installment sale of forestlands, we received $4.8 billion of installment notes. these installment notes were used by variable interest entities as collateral for borrowings from third-party lenders. these variable interest entities were restructured in 2015 when the installment notes and third-party loans were extended. the restructured variable interest entities held installment notes of $4.8 billion and third-party loans of $4.2 billion which both matured in august 2021. we settled the third-party loans at their maturity with the proceeds from the installment notes. this resulted in cash proceeds of approximately $630 million representing our equity in the variable interest entities. maturity of the installment notes and termination of the monetization structure also resulted in a $72 million tax liability that was paid in the fourth quarter of 2021. on september 2, 2022, the company and the internal revenue service agreed to settle the previously disclosed timber monetization restructuring tax matter. under this agreement, the company will fully resolve the matter and pay $252 million in u.s. federal income taxes. as a result, interest will also be charged upon closing of the audit. the amount of interest expense recognized through december 31, 2022 is $58 million. as of december 31, 2022, $89 million in u.s.
federal income taxes and $28 million in interest expense have been paid as a result of the settlement agreement. the remaining $163 million u.s. federal income tax liability and $30 million accrued interest liability are recorded as current liabilities in the balance sheet. the reversal of the company's remaining deferred tax liability associated with the 2015 financing entities of $604 million was recognized as a one-time tax benefit in the third quarter of 2022.
liquidity and capital resources outlook for 2023
we expect another year of solid cash generation in 2023. furthermore, we intend to continue to make choices for the use of cash that are consistent with our capital allocation framework to drive long-term value creation. these include maintaining a strong balance sheet and investment grade credit rating, returning meaningful cash to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases and making organic investments to maintain our world-class system and strengthen our businesses.
on october 11, 2022, our board of directors approved an additional $1.5 billion under our share repurchase program. this program does not have an expiration date and has approximately $3.2 billion aggregate amount of shares of common stock remaining authorized for purchase as of december 31, 2022. we may continue to repurchase shares under such authorization in open market transactions (including block trades), privately negotiated transactions or otherwise, subject to prevailing market conditions, our liquidity requirements, applicable securities laws requirements and other factors. in addition, we pay regular quarterly cash dividends and expect to continue to pay regular quarterly cash dividends in the foreseeable future. each quarterly dividend is subject to review and approval by our board of directors.
capital expenditures and long-term debt capital spending for 2023 is planned at approximately $1.0 billion to $1.2 billion, or about 91% to 109% of depreciation and amortization.
at december 31, 2022, international paper's credit agreements totaled $2.0 billion, which is comprised of the $1.5 billion contractually committed bank credit agreement and up to $500 million under the receivables securitization program. management believes these credit agreements are adequate to cover expected operating cash flow variability during the current economic cycle. the credit agreements generally provide for interest rates at a floating rate index plus a pre-determined margin dependent upon international paper's credit rating. at december 31,
2022, the company had no borrowings outstanding under the $1.5 billion credit agreement or the $500 million receivables securitization program. the company's credit agreements are not subject to any restrictive covenants other than the financial covenants as disclosed on pages 76 through 78 in note 16 - debt and lines of credit of item 8. financial statements and supplementary data, and the borrowings under the receivables securitization program being limited by eligible receivables. the company was in compliance with all its debt covenants at december 31, 2022 and was well below the thresholds stipulated under the covenants as defined in the credit agreements. further the financial covenants do not restrict any borrowings under the credit agreements.
under the terms of the company's commercial paper program, individual maturities on borrowings may vary, but not exceed one year from the date of issue. interest bearing notes may be issued either as fixed or floating rate notes. as of december 31, 2022, the company had $410 million outstanding under the program with remaining capacity of $590 million. as of december 31, 2022, the remaining credit agreement capacity was $1.1 billion.
international paper expects to be able to meet projected capital expenditures, service existing debt, meet working capital and dividend requirements and make common stock and/or debt repurchases for the next 12 months and for the foreseeable future thereafter with current cash balances and cash from operations, supplemented as required by its existing credit facilities. the company will continue to rely on debt and capital markets for the majority of any necessary long-term funding not provided by operating cash flows. funding decisions will be guided by our capital structure planning objectives. the primary goals of the company's capital structure planning are to maximize financial flexibility and maintain appropriate levels of liquidity to meet our needs while managing balance sheet debt and interest expense, and we have repurchased, and may continue to repurchase, our common stock (under our existing share repurchase program) and debt (including through open market purchases, privately negotiated transactions or otherwise) to the extent consistent with this capital structure planning. the majority of international paper's debt is accessed through global public capital markets where we have a wide base of investors. during 2020, management took various actions to further strengthen the company's liquidity position in response to the covid-19 pandemic. this included the company deferring the payment of our payroll taxes as allowed under cares act. the cares act allows for the deferral of the payment of the employer portion of social security taxes accrued between march 27,
2020 and december 31, 2020. under the cares act 50% of the deferred payroll taxes was paid in 2021 and the remainder was paid in 2022. we believe that our credit agreements and commercial paper program provide us with sufficient liquidity to operate in the current negative macroeconomic environment; however, an extended period of economic disruption could impact our access to additional sources of liquidity.
maintaining an investment grade credit rating is an important element of international paper's financing strategy. at december 31, 2022, the company held long-term credit ratings of bbb (stable outlook) and baa2 (stable outlook) by s&p and moody's, respectively.
contractual obligations for future payments under existing debt and lease commitments and purchase obligations at december 31, 2022, were as follows:

we consider the undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries as of december 31, 2022, to be permanently reinvested and, accordingly, no u.s. income taxes have been provided thereon (see note 13 income taxes on pages 69 through 71 of item 8. financial statements and supplementary data). we do not anticipate the need to repatriate funds to the united states to satisfy domestic liquidity needs arising in the ordinary course of business, including liquidity needs associated with our domestic debt service requirements.
pension obligations and funding at december 31, 2022, the projected benefit obligation for the company's u.s. defined benefit plans determined under u.s. gaap was approximately $29 million lower than the fair value of plan assets, excluding non-u.s. plans. approximately $297 million of this amount relates to plans that are subject to minimum funding requirements. under current irs funding rules, the calculation of minimum funding requirements differs from the calculation of the present value of plan benefits (the "projected benefit obligation") for accounting purposes. in december 2008, the worker, retiree and employer recovery act of 2008 ("wera") was passed by the u.s. congress which provided for pension funding relief and technical corrections. funding contributions depend on the funding method selected by the company, and the timing of its implementation, as well as on actual demographic data and the targeted funding level. the company continually reassesses the amount and timing of any discretionary contributions and elected not to make any voluntary contributions in 2020, 2021 or 2022. at this time, we do not expect to have any required contributions to our plans in 2023, although the company may elect to make future voluntary contributions. the timing and amount of future contributions, which could be material, will depend on a number of factors, including the actual earnings and changes in values of plan assets and changes in interest rates.
critical accounting policies and significant accounting estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires international paper to establish accounting policies and to make estimates that affect both the amounts and timing of the recording of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. some of these estimates require subjective judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain.
accounting policies whose application has had or is reasonably likely to have a material impact on the reported results of operations and financial position of international paper, and that can require a significant level of estimation or uncertainty by management that affect their application, include the accounting for contingencies, impairment or disposal of long-lived assets and goodwill, pensions and income taxes. the company has discussed the selection of critical accounting policies and the effect of significant estimates with the audit and finance committee of the company's board of directors and with its independent registered public accounting firm.
contingent liabilities accruals for contingent liabilities, including personal injury, product liability, environmental, asbestos and other legal matters, are recorded when it is probable that a liability has been incurred or an asset impaired and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. liabilities accrued for legal matters require judgments regarding projected outcomes and range of loss based on historical litigation and settlement experience and recommendations of legal counsel and, if applicable, other experts. liabilities for environmental matters require evaluations of relevant environmental regulations and estimates of future remediation alternatives and costs. the company estimated the probable liability associated with these environmental matters to be approximately $243 million ($251 million undiscounted) in the aggregate as of december 31, 2022 and $182 million ($191 million undiscounted) in the aggregate as of december 31, 2021. liabilities for asbestos-related matters require reviews of recent and historical claims data. the company's total recorded liability with respect to pending and future asbestos-related claims was $105 million and $103 million, net of estimated insurance recoveries, as of december 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. the company utilizes its in-house legal counsel and environmental experts to develop estimates of its legal, environmental and asbestos obligations, supplemented as needed by third-party specialists to analyze its most complex contingent liabilities.
we calculate our workers' compensation reserves based on estimated actuarially calculated development factors. the workers' compensation reserves are reviewed at least quarterly to determine the adequacy of the accruals and related financial statement disclosure. the company's total recorded workers' compensation reserve was $136 million and $159 million as of december 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. while we believe that our assumptions are appropriate, the ultimate settlement of workers' compensation reserves may differ significantly from amounts we have accrued in our consolidated financial statements.
impairment of long-lived assets and goodwill long-lived assets are reviewed for impairment upon the occurrence of events or changes in circumstances that indicate that the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable. a recoverability test is performed by comparing the undiscounted cash flows to carrying value of the assets. if the carrying amount is less than the undiscounted cash flows, the fair value of the assets is compared to the carrying value to determine if they are impaired. an impairment of a long-lived asset exists when the asset's carrying amount exceeds its fair value.
we perform an annual goodwill impairment as of october 1. additionally, interim assessments of possible impairments of goodwill are also made when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable through future operations. a goodwill impairment exists when the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its fair value.
the amount and timing of goodwill and long-lived asset impairment charges based on these assessments requires the estimation of future cash flows or the fair market value of the related assets based on management's best estimates of certain key factors, including future selling prices and volumes, operating, raw material, energy and freight costs, various other projected operating economic factors and other intended uses of the assets.
asu 2011-08, "intangibles - goodwill and other," allows entities testing goodwill for impairment the option of performing a qualitative assessment before performing the quantitative goodwill impairment test. if a qualitative assessment is performed, an entity is not required to perform the quantitative goodwill impairment test unless the entity determines that, based on that qualitative assessment, it is more likely than not that its fair value is less than its carrying value. the company performed its annual testing of its reporting units for possible goodwill impairments by applying the qualitative assessment to its north america industrial packaging reporting unit and the quantitative goodwill impairment test to its emea industrial packaging reporting unit as of october 1, 2022.
for the current year evaluation, the company assessed various assumptions, events and circumstances that would have affected the estimated fair value of the north america industrial packaging reporting unit under the qualitative assessment and the results of the qualitative assessments indicated that it was not more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit was less than its carrying value. our most recent quantitative goodwill impairment test for our na ipg reporting unit was performed as part of our 2020 annual goodwill impairment test. that quantitative goodwill impairment test indicated that the fair value of the na ipg reporting unit exceeded the carrying amount by approximately 100%.
the company also performed the quantitative goodwill impairment test which included comparing the carrying amount of the emea industrial packaging reporting unit to its estimated fair value. the estimated fair value of the reporting unit was calculated using a weighted approach based on discounted future cash flows, market multiples and transaction multiples. the determination of fair value using the discounted cash flow approach requires management to make significant estimates and assumptions related to forecasts of future revenues, operating profit margins, and discount rates. the determination of fair value using market multiples and transaction multiples requires management to make significant assumptions related to revenue multiples and adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization ("ebitda") multiples.
the results of our quantitative goodwill impairment test indicated that the carrying amount exceeded the estimated fair value of the emea industrial packaging reporting unit and it was determined that all of the goodwill in the reporting unit, totaling $76 million, was impaired. the decline in the fair value of emea industrial packaging and resulting impairment charge was due to the impacts of certain macroeconomic conditions, including the impacts from inflation and the geopolitical environment to the reporting unit.
due to the macroeconomic factors noted above, we also performed the long-lived asset impairment test for asset groups that represent the emea industrial packaging reporting unit prior to the goodwill impairment test and the respective assets groups were determined not to be impaired.
other-than-temporary impairment the company evaluates our investment in the ilim joint venture for other-than-temporary impairment (otti) when circumstances indicate the investment may be impaired. when a decline in fair value is deemed to be an otti, an impairment is recognized to the extent that the fair value is less than the carrying value of the investment. we consider various factors in determining whether a loss in value of an investment is other than temporary including: the length of time and the extent to which the fair value has been below cost, the financial condition of ilim joint venture, and our intent and ability to retain the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for recovery of value. management makes certain judgments and estimates in its assessment including but not limited to: identifying if circumstances indicate a decline in value is other than temporary, expectations about operations, as well as industry, financial, regulatory and market factors. during the fourth quarter of 2022, the company received a binding third-party offer to purchase our interest in the ilim joint venture which was then submitted to our joint venture partners under the preemption provisions of the ilim shareholders' agreement. the third-party offer resulted in an implied fair value that was less than our investment carrying value. this decrease in fair value below carrying value was not considered to be a temporary decline in value. as such, the company recorded a $533 million impairment in the fourth quarter of 2022 based on the agreed selling price for our 50% interest. the impairment charge included recognition of $375 million of foreign currency cumulative translation adjustment loss. the timing by which the sale of our investment will be completed is dependent on obtaining required regulatory approvals. in the meantime, we could recognize additional otti charges as the carrying value of our investment fluctuates relative to the approximate $500 million implied fair value, through additional equity earnings and foreign currency translation.
pension benefit obligations the charges recorded for pension benefit obligations are determined annually in conjunction with international paper's consulting actuary, and are dependent upon various assumptions including the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets, discount rates, projected future compensation increases and mortality rates.
the calculations of pension obligations and expenses require decisions about a number of key assumptions that can significantly affect liability and expense amounts, including the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets and the discount rate used to calculate plan liabilities.
benefit obligations and fair values of plan assets as of december 31, 2022, for international paper's pension plan were as follows:
in millions                              benefit   fair value of obligation   plan assets u.s. qualified pension              $8,548         $8,845
u.s. nonqualified pension              268         -
non-u.s. pension                        54                  18
the table below shows the discount rate used by international paper to calculate u.s. pension obligations for the years shown:
2022                                      2021          2020
discount rate           5.40   %      2.90   %      2.60   %
international paper determines these actuarial assumptions, after consultation with our actuaries, on december 31 of each year or more frequently if required, to calculate liability information as of that date and pension expense for the following year. the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets is based on projected rates of return for current asset classes in the plan's investment portfolio. the discount rate assumption was determined based on a hypothetical settlement portfolio selected from a universe of high quality corporate bonds.
the weighted average expected long-term rate of return on u.s. pension plan assets used to determine net periodic cost for the year ended december 31, 2022 was 6.00%.
increasing (decreasing) the expected long-term rate of return on u.s. plan assets by an additional 0.25% would decrease (increase) 2023 pension expense by approximately $20 million, while a (decrease)
increase of 0.25% in the discount rate would (increase) decrease pension expense by approximately $15 million.
actual rates of return earned on u.s. pension plan assets for each of the last 10 years were:
year           return        year         return
2022      (22.0)    %        2017      19.3    %
2021         7.7    %        2016       7.1    %
2020        24.7    %        2015       1.3    %
2019        23.9    %        2014       6.4    %
2018       (3.0)    %        2013      14.1    %
the 2013 and 2014 returns above represent weighted averages of international paper and temple-inland asset returns. international paper and temple-inland assets were combined in october 2014. the annualized time-weighted rate of return earned on u.s. pension plan assets was 4.7% and 7.1% for the past five and ten years, respectively.
asc 715, "compensation - retirement benefits," provides for delayed recognition of actuarial gains and losses, including amounts arising from changes in the estimated projected plan benefit obligation due to changes in the assumed discount rate, differences between the actual and expected return on plan assets, and other assumption changes. these net gains and losses are recognized in pension expense prospectively over a period that approximates the average remaining service period of active employees expected to receive benefits under the plans to the extent that they are not offset by gains and losses in subsequent years.
net periodic pension plan expenses, calculated for all of international paper's plans, were as follows:
in millions                      2022            2021                 2020        2019          2018
pension (income) expense u.s. plans                       $(116)          $(112)            $32         $93          $632
non-u.s. plans                   5                       4           5           6             4
net (income) expense             $(111)          $(108)            $37         $99          $636
the increase in 2022 pension income primarily reflects lower service cost, lower actuarial loss, and lower asset returns, slightly offset by higher interest cost.
assuming that discount rates, expected long-term returns on plan assets and rates of future compensation increases remain the same as of december 31, 2022, projected future net periodic pension plan expense (income) would be as follows:
in millions                           2024          2023
pension expense (income)
u.s. plans                         $38          $102
non-u.s. plans                       5             5
net (income) expense               $43          $107
the company estimates that it will record net pension expense of approximately $102 million for its u.s. defined benefit plans in 2023, compared to income of $116 million in 2022.
the market value of plan assets for international paper's u.s. qualified pension plan at december 31, 2022 totaled approximately $8.8 billion, consisting of approximately 16% equity securities, 67% debt securities, 9% real estate funds and 8% other assets. the company's funding policy for its qualified pension plans is to contribute amounts sufficient to meet legal funding requirements, plus any additional amounts that the company may determine to be appropriate considering the funded status of the plan, tax deductibility, the cash flows generated by the company, and other factors. the company continually reassesses the amount and timing of any discretionary contributions and could elect to make voluntary contributions in the future. there were no required contributions to the u.s. qualified plan in 2022. the nonqualified defined benefit plans are funded to the extent of benefit payments, which totaled $29 million for the year ended december 31, 2022.
income taxes international paper records its global tax provision based on the respective tax rules and regulations for the jurisdictions in which it operates. where the company believes that a tax position is supportable for income tax purposes, the item is included in its income tax returns. where treatment of a position is uncertain, liabilities are recorded based upon the company's evaluation of the "more likely than not" outcome considering technical merits of the position based on specific tax regulations and facts of each matter. changes to recorded liabilities are only made when an identifiable event occurs that changes the likely outcome, such as settlement with the relevant tax authority, the expiration of statutes of limitation for the subject tax year, change in tax laws, or recent court cases that are relevant to the matter. accrued interest related to these uncertain tax positions is recorded in our consolidated statement of operations in interest expense, net.
valuation allowances are recorded to reduce deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will not be realized. significant judgment is required in assessing the need for and magnitude of appropriate valuation allowances against deferred tax assets. this assessment is completed by tax jurisdiction and relies on both positive and negative evidence available, with significant weight placed on recent financial results. cumulative reported pre-tax income is considered objectively verifiable positive evidence of our ability to generate positive pre-tax income in the future. in accordance with gaap, when there is a recent history of pre-tax losses, there is little or no weight placed on forecasts for purposes of assessing the recoverability of our deferred tax assets. when necessary, we use systematic and logical methods to estimate when deferred tax liabilities will reverse and generate taxable income and when deferred tax assets will reverse and generate tax deductions. assumptions, judgment, and the use of estimates are required when scheduling the reversal of deferred tax assets and liabilities, and the exercise is inherently complex and subjective. the realization of these assets is dependent on generating future taxable income, as well as successful implementation of various tax planning strategies. the company's valuation allowance was $677 million and $708 million at december 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.
while international paper believes that these judgments and estimates are appropriate and reasonable under the circumstances, actual resolution of these matters may differ from recorded estimated amounts.
legal proceedings information concerning the company's environmental and other legal proceedings is set forth in note 14 commitments and contingent liabilities on pages 71 through 75 of item  8. financial statements and supplementary data. the company is not subject to any administrative or judicial proceeding arising under any federal, state or local provisions that have been enacted or adopted regulating the discharge of materials into the environment or primarily for the purpose of protecting the environment that is likely to result in monetary sanctions of $1 million or more.
recent accounting developments see note 2 recent accounting developments on page 57 of item 8. financial statements and supplementary data for a discussion of new accounting pronouncements.
effect of inflation inflationary increases in certain input costs, such as energy, wood, recycled fiber, freight and chemical costs, had an adverse impact on the company's operating results in 2021 and 2022, but had a minimal impact in 2020. we expect that inflationary pressures will continue to adversely impact our operating results in 2023. the effects of inflation have been more significant in recent years due to general inflationary conditions, including labor market conditions, economic activity, consumer behavior, supply shortages and disruptions. sales prices and volumes are primarily influenced by economic supply and demand factors in specific markets and by exchange rate fluctuations but are also currently being impacted by the current inflationary environment.
foreign currency effects international paper has operations in a number of countries. its operations in those countries also export to, and compete with imports from other regions. as such, currency movements can have a number of direct and indirect impacts on the company's financial statements. direct impacts include the translation of international operations' local currency financial statements into u.s. dollars and the remeasurement impact associated with non-functional currency financial assets and liabilities. indirect impacts include the change in competitiveness of imports into, and exports out of, the united states (and the impact on local currency pricing of products that are traded internationally). in general, a weaker u.s. dollar and stronger local currency is beneficial to international paper. the currency that has the most impact is the euro.
market risk we use financial instruments, including fixed and variable rate debt, to finance operations, for capital spending programs and for general corporate purposes. additionally, financial instruments, including various derivative contracts, are used to hedge exposures to interest rate, commodity and foreign currency risks. we do not use financial instruments for trading purposes. information related to international paper's debt obligations is included in note 16 debt and lines of credit on pages 76 through 78 of item 8. financial statements and supplementary data. a discussion of derivatives and hedging activities is included in note 17 derivatives and hedging activities on pages 78 through 81 of item 8. financial statements and supplementary data.
the fair value of our debt and financial instruments varies due to changes in market interest and foreign currency rates and commodity prices since the inception of the related instruments. we assess this market risk utilizing a sensitivity analysis. the sensitivity analysis measures the potential loss in earnings, fair values and cash flows based on a hypothetical 10% change (increase and decrease) in interest and currency rates and commodity prices.
interest rate risk our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to short- and long-term debt obligations and investments in marketable securities. we invest in investment-grade securities of financial institutions and money market mutual funds with a minimum rating of aaa and limit exposure to any one issuer or fund. our investments in marketable securities at december 31, 2022 and 2021 are stated at cost, which approximates market due to their short-term nature. our interest rate risk exposure related to these investments was not material.
we issue fixed and floating rate debt in a proportion that management deems appropriate based on current and projected market conditions. derivative instruments, such as interest rate swaps, may be used to execute this strategy. at december 31, 2022 and 2021, the fair value of the net liability of financial instruments with exposure to interest rate risk was approximately $4.3 billion and $6.7 billion, respectively. the potential increase in fair value resulting from a 10% adverse shift in quoted interest rates would have been approximately $328 million and $304 million at december 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.
commodity price risk the objective of our commodity exposure management is to minimize volatility in earnings due to large fluctuations in the price of commodities. commodity swap or forward purchase contracts may be used to manage risks associated with market fluctuations in energy prices. at december 31, 2022 and 2021, the net fair value of these contracts was $20 million asset and $10 million asset. the potential loss in fair value from a 10% adverse change in quoted commodity prices for these contracts would have been approximately $3 million and $2 million at december 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.
foreign currency risk international paper transacts business in many currencies and is also subject to currency exchange rate risk through investments and businesses owned and operated in foreign countries. our objective in managing the associated foreign currency risks is to minimize the effect of adverse exchange rate fluctuations on our after-tax cash flows. we address these risks on a limited basis by entering into cross-currency interest rate swaps, or foreign exchange contracts.
at december 31, 2022 and 2021, the net fair value of financial instruments with exposure to foreign currency risk was immaterial. the potential loss in fair value for such financial instruments from a 10% adverse change in quoted foreign currency exchange rates was also immaterial.

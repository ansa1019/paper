risk factor summary investing in our securities involves a high degree of risk and uncertainties. below is a summary of the risk factors that may have a material adverse impact on our business, financial performance, stock price, results of operations, operating flexibility, reputation, costs or liabilities. in addition to this summary and the more detailed description of each risk factor that immediately follows this summary, you should carefully consider the information included in other sections of this annual report on form 10-k, including but not limited to items 1. and 2. "business and properties," items 7. and 7a. "management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk" (md&a) and item 3. "legal proceedings" prior to investing in our securities. however, the risk factors described herein are not all of the risks we may face. other risks not presently known to us or that we currently believe are immaterial may materially affect our business if they occur and the trading price of our securities could decline, and you may lose part or all of your investment. moreover, new risks emerge from time to time. further, our business may also be affected by general risks that apply to all companies operating in the united states (u.s.) and globally, which have not been included.

financial risks fluctuations in the market prices of the commodities we produce have caused and may continue to cause significant volatility in our financial performance and in the trading prices of our common stock. extended material declines in the market prices of such commodities could adversely affect our financial condition and operating plans.
our financial results vary with fluctuations in the market prices of the commodities we produce, primarily copper and gold, and to a lesser extent molybdenum. extended material declines in market prices of such commodities could have a material adverse effect on our financial results and the value of our assets, may depress the price of our common stock, and may have a material adverse effect on our ability to comply with financial and other covenants in our debt agreements, service our debt and meet our other obligations. beginning in 2020 with the onset of the covid-19 pandemic and continuing in 2022 because of a series of macro-economic factors, there has been significant volatility in the financial and commodities markets, including the copper market. copper prices reached a record high of $4.87 per pound in first-quarter 2022 but dropped to a 2022 low of $3.18 in third-quarter 2022. for additional information regarding recent macro-economic factors, see risk factor below regarding the price and availability of consumables and components we purchase and constraints on supply and logistics, and transportation services.
fluctuations in commodities prices are caused by varied and complex factors beyond our control, including global supply and demand and inventory levels; global economic and political conditions (such as a potential global recession and russia's invasion of ukraine); international regulatory, trade and/or tax policies, including national tariffs; commodities investment activity and speculation; interest rates; expectations regarding future inflation rates; the strength of the u.s. dollar compared to foreign currencies; the price and availability of substitute products; and changes in technology. volatility in global economic growth, particularly in developing economies, has the potential to adversely affect future demand and prices for commodities. geopolitical uncertainty and protectionism, have the potential to inhibit international trade and negatively impact business confidence, which creates the risk of constraints on our ability to trade in certain markets and has the potential to increase price volatility.
in addition to the factors discussed above, copper prices may be affected by demand from china, which is currently the largest consumer of refined copper in the world, including as a result of geopolitical uncertainty between the u.s. and china as well as uncertainties about china's economy, including its covid-19 policies. the adoption and expansion of trade restrictions, changes in china-u.s. relations, or other governmental action related to tariffs or trade agreements or policies are difficult to predict and could adversely affect copper prices, demand for our products, our costs, our customers, our suppliers, and the u.s. economy, which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition.
copper prices also may be affected by the growing markets for automobiles and appliances, and the global focus on a transition to new technologies for clean energy, to advance communications and to enhance public health, inadequate investment in and limited production from copper mining operations in south america, as well as demand from north america, europe, and asian countries other than china. additional factors affecting gold prices may include purchases and sales of gold by governments and central banks, demand from china and india, two of the world's largest consumers of gold, and global demand for jewelry containing gold. for additional information regarding the historical fluctuations of the prices of copper, gold and molybdenum, refer to "markets" in md&a.
if market prices for the primary commodities we produce were to decline and remain low for a sustained period of time, we may have to revise our operating plans, including curtailing or modifying our mining and processing operations, as we had to do in early 2020 in response to the global covid-19 pandemic. we may be unable to decrease our costs in an amount sufficient to offset reductions in revenues, in which case we may incur losses, and those losses may be material.
declines in prices of commodities we sell could also result in metals inventory adjustments and impairment charges for our long-lived assets. refer to note 4 for additional information regarding metals inventory adjustments recorded for the three years ended december 31, 2022.
fluctuations in the price and availability of consumables and components for key machines and equipment we purchase, and constraints on supply and logistics could affect our profitability and operating plans. further, significant delays or increases in costs affecting transportation services may affect our business.
consumables and components for key machines and equipment we purchase are subject to price volatility caused by global economic factors that are beyond our control, including, but not limited to, supply chain disruptions, labor shortages, wage pressures, rising inflation and potential economic slowdown or recession, as well as fuel and energy costs (for example, the price of diesel), the impact of natural disasters, public health crises (such as covid-19), geopolitical conflicts (such as the conflict in ukraine), and foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, and other matters that have or could impact the global economy.
prices and availability of consumables used in our operations, such as natural gas, diesel, coal, ammonium nitrate, chemical reagents (including sulfuric acid), and steel-related products, and components impact the costs of production at our operations and the costs of development projects. these prices fluctuate and can be volatile. in 2022, we experienced price increases on certain consumables, including diesel fuel and coal, ammonium nitrate and sulfuric acid, grinding media and certain components. the cost increases have negatively impacted our operating results and further increases could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and could result in material changes to our operating plans. additional increases may occur in 2023 because of macroeconomic conditions discussed above, and such increases may be material.
ensuring continuity of supply of such consumables to our operations is critical to our business. we also rely on the availability of components from suppliers for key machines and equipment, which may be impacted by competition demands as well as the availability of input materials in the creation of such equipment. a supplier's failure to supply consumables or components in a timely manner or to meet our quality, quantity, cost requirements or our technical specifications, or our inability to obtain alternative sources of consumables or components on a timely basis or on terms acceptable to us, could adversely affect our operations. in 2022, we experienced longer lead times and logistical constraints on delivery of certain consumables, including fuel, lubricants, ammonium nitrate, cobalt sulfate, acid mist suppressant and acid. while these delays and logistical constraints did not significantly impact our results in 2022, these issues may continue in 2023 and such logistical constraints and delays may become material. further, delays and logistical constraints may occur as a result of violence, civil and religious strife, and activism, as described in the related risk factor below.
our business depends on the inbound transportation of consumables and components we use and the outbound transportation of the commodities we produce by truck, rail and ocean freight. there continue to be global shipping and logistics challenges, which began during the covid-19 pandemic. any significant increase in the cost of the transportation of consumables or components, as a result of increases in fuel or labor costs, higher demand for logistics services, or otherwise, would adversely affect our results of operations. additionally, if the transportation service providers fail to deliver consumables or components used in our operations to us or the commodities we produce to our customers in a timely manner or at all, such failure could adversely impact our ability to meet our production schedules, delay our projects and capital initiatives, negatively affect our customer relationships and have a material adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations.
our debt and other financial commitments may limit our financial and operating flexibility.
at december 31, 2022, our total consolidated debt was $10.6 billion (see md&a and note 8) and our total consolidated cash and cash equivalents was $8.1 billion. we also have various other financial commitments, including reclamation and environmental obligations, take-or-pay contracts and leases. although we have been successful in servicing debt in the past, refinancing our bank facilities and issuing new debt securities in capital markets transactions, there can be no assurance that we can continue to do so. in addition, we or our subsidiaries may incur additional debt in future periods or reduce our holdings of cash and cash equivalents in connection with funding existing operations, capital expenditures, dividends, share or debt repurchases, or in pursuing other business opportunities. for further information, see the risk factors below relating to mine closure and reclamation regulations and the increasing scrutiny and evolving expectations from stakeholders, including creditors, with respect to our esg practices, performance and disclosures.
our level of indebtedness and other financial commitments could have important consequences to our business, including the following:
•limiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in the industry in which we operate;
•increasing our vulnerability to general adverse economic, industry and regulatory conditions;
•limiting our ability to fund future working capital, capital expenditures, general corporate requirements and/or material contingencies, to engage in future development activities, or to otherwise realize the value of our assets and opportunities fully because of the need to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flows from operations to payments on our debt;
•requiring us to sell assets to reduce debt; or
•placing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less debt and/or fewer financial commitments.
any failure to comply with the financial and/or other covenants in our debt agreements may result in an event of default that would allow the creditors to accelerate maturities of the related debt, which in turn may trigger cross-acceleration or cross-default provisions in other debt agreements. our available cash and liquidity may not be sufficient to fully repay borrowings under our debt instruments that may be accelerated upon an event of default.
as of january 31, 2023, our senior unsecured debt was rated "baa3" with a stable outlook by moody's investors service, "bbb-" with a stable outlook by fitch ratings, and "bb+" with a stable outlook by standard & poor's. if we are unable to maintain our indebtedness and financial ratios at levels acceptable to these credit rating agencies, or should our business prospects deteriorate, our current credit ratings could be downgraded, which could adversely affect the value of our outstanding securities and existing debt, our ability to obtain new financing on favorable terms and could increase our borrowing costs.
changes in or the failure to comply with the requirements of mine closure and reclamation regulations could have a material adverse effect on our business.
we are required by u.s. federal and state laws and regulations to provide financial assurance sufficient to allow a third party to implement approved closure and reclamation plans for our mining properties if we are unable to do so. as of december 31, 2022, our financial assurance obligations totaled $1.5 billion for closure and reclamation/restoration costs of u.s. mining sites. refer to note 12 for additional information regarding our financial assurance obligations and items 1. and 2. "business and properties" for a discussion of certain of such u.s. federal and state laws and regulations applicable to us. a substantial portion of our financial assurance obligations are satisfied by guarantees by us and certain of our subsidiaries. our ability to continue to provide guarantees depends on state and other regulatory requirements, our financial performance and our financial condition. other forms of assurance, such as letters of credit and surety bonds, are costly to provide and, depending on our financial condition and market conditions, may be difficult or impossible to obtain. failure to provide or maintain the required financial assurance could result in the closure of the affected properties.
plans and provisions for mine closure and remediation may change over time as a result of changes in stakeholder expectations, legislation, standards, and technical understanding and techniques, which may cause our actual costs of closure and remediation to be higher than estimated for environmental and asset retirement obligations (aros) and could materially affect our financial position or results of operations. for example, our implementation of the global industry standard for tailings management (the tailings standard) (discussed in items 1. and 2. "business and properties" herein) has required changes and could require additional changes to our closure and reclamation plans or modifications to previously completed reclamation actions, although it is uncertain if these changes would result in material capital or operating cost increases. in addition, climate change could lead to changes in the physical risks posed to our operations, which could result in changes in our closure and reclamation plans to address such risks. any modifications to our closure and reclamation plans that may be required to address physical climate risks may increase our financial assurance obligations and may materially increase the actual costs associated with implementing closure and reclamation at any or all of our active or inactive mine sites or smelter sites. refer to notes 1 and 12 for further discussion of our environmental obligations and aros and see the risk factors below relating to the potential physical impacts of climate change and our related obligations as part of our commitment to implementing the tailings standard.
unanticipated litigation or negative developments in pending litigation or other contingencies could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition.
we are, and may in the future become, involved in various legal proceedings and subject to other contingencies that have arisen or may arise in the ordinary course of our business or are associated with environmental matters, including those described in note 12 and in item 3. "legal proceedings". we are also involved periodically in other reviews, inquiries, investigations and other proceedings initiated by or involving government agencies, some of which may result in adverse judgments, settlements, fines, penalties, injunctions or other relief. from time to time we are involved in disputes over the allocation of environmental remediation obligations at "superfund" and other sites. in addition, we may be held responsible for the costs of addressing contamination at the site of current or former activities or at third party sites, or be held liable to third parties for exposure to hazardous substances should those be identified in the future. the outcome of litigation is inherently uncertain and adverse developments or outcomes can result in significant monetary damages, penalties, other sanctions or injunctive relief against us, limitations on our property rights, or regulatory interpretations that increase our operating costs. management does not believe, based on currently available information, that the outcome of any individual legal proceeding will have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, although individual or cumulative outcomes could be material to our operating results for a particular period, depending on the nature and magnitude of the outcome and the operating results for the period.
regardless of the merit of particular claims, defending against litigation or responding to investigations can be expensive, time-consuming, disruptive to our operations and distracting to management. in recognition of these considerations, we may enter into agreements or other arrangements to settle litigation and resolve such challenges. there can be no assurance such agreements can be obtained on acceptable terms or that litigation will not occur.
further, we are a global business with operations in various jurisdictions. in the event of a dispute arising at our foreign operations, we may be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of foreign courts or arbitral panels, or may not be successful in subjecting foreign persons to the jurisdiction of courts or arbitral panels in the u.s. or in enforcing the judgment of a foreign court or arbitral panel against a sovereign nation. our inability to enforce our right and the enforcement of rights on a prejudicial basis by foreign courts or arbitral panels, including against a sovereign nation, could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position.
changes in tax laws and regulations could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition.
as a global business, we are subject to income, royalty, transaction and other taxes in the u.s. and various foreign jurisdictions. uncertainties exist with respect to our tax liabilities, including those arising from changes in laws in the countries in which we do business. we have significant net operating losses (nols) in the u.s. generated in prior years. these nols are available to offset future regular taxable income, which we believe will result in minimal estimated regular income tax liability in the u.s. over the next several years at current metals market prices.
in august 2022, the u.s. inflation reduction act of 2022 (the act) was signed into law, which includes, among other provisions, a new corporate alternative minimum tax (camt) of 15% on the adjusted financial statement income (afsi) of corporations with average afsi exceeding $1.0 billion over a three-year period. the provisions of the act are applicable to us beginning january 1, 2023. additional guidance related to how the camt provisions of the act will be applied or otherwise administered is yet to be released by the u.s. department of the treasury, and may differ from our interpretations. we will continue to analyze the impacts as additional guidance becomes available. we expect the camt provisions will impact our u.s. tax position, and may further limit our ability to benefit from our u.s. nols.
we are also continuing to monitor the progress of chile's proposed mining royalty changes and their impact on future operations.
further, recommendations from the organization for economic co-operation and development regarding a global minimum income tax and other changes being considered and/or implemented in countries where we operate could materially impact our provisions for income and non-income taxes, cash tax liability and effective tax rate.
international risks our international operations are subject to geopolitical, economic and social risks.
we are a u.s.-based mining company with substantial assets located outside of the u.s. risks of conducting business in countries outside the u.s. can include:
•delays in obtaining or renewing, or the inability to obtain, maintain or renew, or the renegotiation, cancellation, revocation or forced modification (including the inherent risk of these actions being taken unilaterally by government owned entities) of contracts, leases, licenses, permits, stability agreements or other agreements and/or approvals;
•expropriation or nationalization of property, protectionism, or restrictions on repatriation of earnings or capital;
•changes in and differing interpretations of the host country's laws, regulations and policies (which may be applied retroactively), including, but not limited to, those relating to labor, taxation, royalties, duties, tariffs, divestment, imports, exports (including restrictions on the export of copper concentrate and anode slimes, copper and/or gold), trade regulations, immigration, currency, human rights and environmental matters (including land use and water use), additional requirements on foreign operations and investment, and/or fines, fees and sanctions imposed for failure to comply with the laws and regulations of the jurisdictions in which we operate, the risk of any of which may increase with rising "resource nationalism" in countries around the world;
•geopolitical events, social and economic instability, bribery, extortion, corruption, civil unrest, blockades, acts of war, guerrilla activities, insurrection and terrorism, certain of which may result in, among other things, an inability to access our property or transport our commodities;
•risk of loss associated with trespass, illegal artisanal mining, theft, sabotage and vandalism;
•changes in u.s. trade, tariff, tax, immigration or other policies that may impact relations with foreign countries or result in retaliatory policies;
•increases in training and other costs and challenges relating to requirements by governmental entities to employ nationals of a country in which a particular operation is located;
•foreign exchange controls and fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates;
•reduced protection for intellectual property rights; and
•the risk of having to submit to the jurisdiction of an international court or arbitration panel or having to enforce the judgment of an international court or arbitration panel against a sovereign nation within its own territory.
our insurance does not cover most losses caused by the risks described above. for example, we do not have political risk insurance. accordingly, our exploration, development and production activities outside of the u.s. may be substantially affected by many external factors beyond our control, some of which could have a material adverse effect on our cash flows, results of operations and financial condition.
we are required to comply with a wide range of laws and regulations in the countries where we operate or do business. for example, our international operations must comply with the u.s. foreign corrupt practices act and similar anti-corruption and anti-bribery laws of the other jurisdictions in which we operate. we operate in jurisdictions that have experienced public and private sector corruption and where significant anti-corruption enforcement activities, prosecutions and settlements have occurred. we have a large number of contracts with local and foreign suppliers and contractors, who may take action contrary to or fail to adopt standards, controls and procedures, including health, safety, environment, human rights and community standards that are equivalent to our standards, controls and procedures. there can be no assurance that our internal control policies and procedures will always protect us from misinterpretation of or noncompliance with applicable laws and internal policies, recklessness, fraudulent behavior, dishonesty or other inappropriate acts committed by our affiliates, employees, agents, suppliers or contractors. as such, our corporate policies and processes may not prevent or detect all potential breaches of law or governance practices. any breaches could result in safety events that may result in injuries or fatalities, significant criminal or civil fines and penalties, litigation or regulatory action or inquiries, shareholder activism (such as to stop using a certain supplier or contractor), civil unrest or other adverse impacts on human rights, and loss of operating licenses or permits, and may damage our reputation, which could have a material adverse effect on our cash flows, results of operations and financial condition.
we conduct international mining operations and exploration activities in indonesia, peru and chile and other foreign jurisdictions. accordingly, in addition to the usual risks associated with conducting business in countries outside the u.s., our business may be adversely affected by political, economic, social and regional uncertainties in each of these countries. for example, we are involved in several significant tax proceedings and other tax disputes with indonesia and peru tax authorities (refer to note 12 for further discussion of these matters). other risks specific to certain countries in which we operate are discussed in more detail below.
because our mining operations in indonesia are a significant operating asset, our business may be adversely affected by political, economic and social uncertainties in indonesia.
maintaining a good working relationship with the indonesia government, pt indonesia asahan aluminium (persero) (pt inalum, also known as mind id), an indonesia state-owned enterprise and shareholder in pt-fi and the local population, is important because of the significance of our indonesia operations to our business, and because our mining operations there are among indonesia's most significant business enterprises. partially because of the grasberg minerals district's significance to indonesia's economy, the environmentally sensitive area where it is located, and the number of people employed, our indonesia operations have been the subject of political debates and criticism in the indonesia press, and have been the target of protests and occasional violence. improper management of our working relationship with the indonesia government, mind id or the local population could lead to a disruption of operations and/or impact our reputation in indonesia and in the region where we operate, which could adversely affect our business.
the mining industry is subject to extensive regulation within indonesia, and there have been major developments in laws and regulations applicable to mining concession holders, some of which have conflicted with pt-fi's contractual rights in the past. in particular, the enactment of law no. 4 of 2009 on coal and mineral mining on january 12, 2009 (the mining law) replaced the previous regulatory framework which allowed concession holders, including pt-fi, to conduct mining activities in indonesia under a contract of work system. notwithstanding provisions in pt-fi's former contract of work (cow) prohibiting it from doing so, the indonesia government sought to modify pt-fi's former cow to address provisions contained in the mining law and implementing regulations adopted thereunder, some of which were not required under or conflicted with pt-fi's former cow.
in early 2017, the indonesia government issued new regulations to address exports of unrefined metals, including copper concentrate and anode slimes, and other matters related to the mining sector. copper concentrate sales to pt smelting (pt-fi's 39.5% owned copper smelter and refinery located in gresik, indonesia) totaled over 10% of our consolidated revenues for each of the years ended december 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020. pt-fi's export license for copper concentrate is valid for one-year periods, subject to review by the indonesia government every six months, depending on greenfield smelter construction progress. pt-fi's current export license remains valid through march 19, 2023. refer to note 12 for further discussion of the administrative fine paid by pt-fi to the indonesia government in march 2022 for failing to achieve physical development progress on the greenfield smelter. the 2017 regulations also permit the export of anode slimes, which is necessary for pt smelting to continue operating. pt smelting's export license for anode slimes expires on november 3, 2023. as discussed in note 3, beginning in january 2023, pt-fi's commercial arrangement with pt smelting converted to a tolling arrangement, under which pt-fi pays pt smelting a tolling fee to smelt and refine its concentrate and will retain title to all products for sales to third parties.
notwithstanding pt-fi's rights to export copper concentrate through 2023 under its iupk (subject to force majeure considerations), its current copper concentrate export license and pt smelting's current anode slimes export license, pt-fi may not be able to obtain administrative approval for such exports if the indonesia government bans exports of copper concentrate and anode slimes prior to completion of the greenfield smelter and precious metals refinery (pmr). recent press reports have indicated that the indonesia government is considering a ban of copper concentrate exports effective in june 2023 under regulations that were issued in 2020 and 2021. in addition, pt smelting exports may also be restricted (contrary to the expiration date of pt smelting's current export license noted above). if such limitations on exports were to be instituted prior to pt-fi's greenfield smelter and pmr becoming operational (currently expected in 2024), pt-fi would be required to reduce production levels or be subject to additional costs.
further, even if the indonesia government does not ban exports of copper concentrate or anode slimes, we cannot predict when and if pt-fi's copper concentrate export license and pt smelting's anode slimes export license may be renewed. pt-fi's sales of copper concentrate and anode slimes could be interrupted if the export licenses are not timely renewed or if pt-fi or pt smelting is unable to operate because of other operational or financial constraints, which would adversely impact our revenues and operations.
there can be no assurance that future regulatory changes affecting the mining industry in indonesia will not be introduced or unexpectedly repealed, or that new interpretations of existing laws and regulations will not be issued, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
in 2022, the indonesia government divided the indonesia portion of the island of new guinea from two provinces into a total of six provinces, which has resulted in public protest and civil unrest. for further discussion of violence, civil and religious strife, and activism affecting our operations in indonesia, see the related risk factor below. further, we cannot predict the impact of splitting provinces on local and regional regulations, permits and other governmental administrative functions, which could have an adverse impact on our business.
in 2024, indonesia will hold national legislative elections. the presidential election will be held in february 2024. political considerations leading up to these elections could affect, among other things, the country's policies pertaining to foreign investment, permitting and export restrictions, which could adversely affect our indonesia mining operations.
pt-fi will not mine all of the ore reserves in the grasberg minerals district before the initial term of its iupk expires in 2031. pt-fi's iupk may not be extended through 2041 if pt-fi fails to abide by its terms and conditions and applicable laws and regulations.
on december 21, 2018, pt-fi was granted an iupk to replace its former cow, enabling pt-fi to conduct operations in the grasberg minerals district through 2041. under the terms of the iupk, pt-fi has been granted mining rights through 2031, with rights to extend its mining rights through 2041, subject to, among other things, pt-fi's completion of construction of additional domestic smelting capacity totaling 2 million dry metric tons of concentrate per year by the end of 2023 (an extension of which has been requested because of covid-19 mitigation measures, subject to the approval of the indonesia government), and fulfilling its defined fiscal obligations to the indonesia government. refer to note 13 for a summary of the iupk's key fiscal terms. the expansion of pt smelting is expected to be complete by the end of 2023 and the construction of the greenfield smelter is expected to be completed during 2024, which is subject to, among other things, no additional covid-19 related disruptions.
the iupk also requires pt-fi to pay duties on concentrate exports of 2.5% now that development progress for additional smelting capacity in indonesia has exceeded 30%, which may be eliminated upon receiving verification and approval from the indonesia government that development progress for additional smelting capacity in indonesia has exceeded 50%. refer to note 12 for further discussion of the administrative fine paid by pt-fi to the indonesia government for failing to achieve physical development progress on the greenfield smelter.
the current capital cost estimate for the greenfield smelter and related precious metal refinery approximates $3 billion (excluding capitalized interest, owner's costs and commissioning). capital expenditures for the indonesia smelter projects are being funded with proceeds from pt-fi's senior notes and its available revolving credit facility. pt-fi's ability to raise and service any additional sources of capital, if needed, would be a function of macroeconomic conditions, and future market prices as well as pt-fi's operational performance, cash flows and debt position, among other factors. additional financing may not be available if and when needed or, if available, the terms of such financing may not be favorable to pt-fi. see the risk factor below regarding increasing scrutiny and evolving expectations from stakeholders, including creditors, with respect to our esg practices, performance and disclosures.
our proven and probable mineral reserves in indonesia reflect estimates of minerals that can be recovered through the end of 2041, and pt-fi's current long-term mine plan and planned operations are based on the assumption that pt-fi will abide by the terms and conditions of the iupk and will be granted the 10-year extension from 2031 through 2041. as a result, pt-fi will not mine all of these mineral reserves during the initial term of the iupk. prior to the end of 2031, we expect to mine 46% of aggregate proven and probable recoverable mineral reserves at december 31, 2022, representing approximately half of our net equity share of recoverable copper and gold reserves.
if pt-fi does not complete the construction of additional domestic smelting capacity totaling 2 million metric tons of concentrate per year by the end of 2023 (an extension of which has been requested because of covid-19 mitigation measures, subject to the approval of the indonesia government), or fulfill its defined fiscal obligations to the indonesia government as set forth in the iupk, the iupk may not be extended from 2031 through 2041, and pt-fi would be unable to mine all of its proven and probable mineral reserves in the grasberg minerals district, which would adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial position.
pt-fi and the indonesia government have begun preliminary discussions regarding the extension of pt-fi's iupk beyond 2041. we cannot predict whether pt-fi will be successful in the extension of its iupk beyond 2041.
operational risks our mining operations are subject to operational risks that could adversely affect our business and our underground mining operations have higher risks than a surface mine.
we have assets in a variety of geographic locations, all of which exist in and around broader communities and environments. maintaining the operational integrity and performance of our assets is crucial to protect our people, the environment and communities in which we operate. our mines are very large in scale and, by their nature are subject to significant operational risks, some of which are outside of our control, and many of which are not covered fully, or in some cases even partially, by insurance. these operational risks, which could materially and adversely affect our business, operating results and cash flows, include earthquakes, rainstorms, floods, wildfires and other natural disasters; environmental hazards, including discharge of metals, concentrates, pollutants or hazardous chemicals; surface or underground fires; equipment failures; accidents, including in connection with mining equipment, milling equipment or conveyor systems, transportation of chemicals, explosives or other materials and in the transportation of employees and other individuals to and from sites (including where these services are provided by third parties such as vehicle and aircraft transport); wall failures and rock slides in our open-pit mines, and structural collapses of our underground mines or tailings impoundments; underground water and ore management;
lower than expected ore grades or recovery rates; and seismic activity resulting from unexpected or difficult geological formations or conditions (whether in mineral or gaseous form).
for a discussion of risks specific to our tailings management, see the risk factor below relating to our management of waste rock and tailings.
we are facing continued geotechnical challenges because of the older age of some of our open-pit mines and a trend toward mining deeper pits and more complex deposits. there can be no assurance that unanticipated geotechnical and hydrological conditions may or may not occur, nor whether these conditions may lead to events such as landslides and pit wall failures, in the future or that such events will be detected in advance. geotechnical instabilities can be difficult to predict and are often affected by risks and hazards outside of our control, such as seismic activity or severe weather, which may lead to floods, mudslides, pit-wall instability and possibly even slippage of material. in early 2019, our el abra operation in chile experienced heavy rainfall and electrical storms. as a result, our operating results for 2019 were impacted by a suspension of el abra's crushed leach stacking operations for approximately 35 days. we cannot predict whether similar events will occur in the future or the extent to which any such event would affect this, or any of our other operations.
our business is dependent upon our workforce being able to safely perform their jobs, including the potential for physical injuries or illness. underground mining operations can be particularly dangerous, and in may 2013, a tragic accident, which resulted in 28 fatalities and 10 injuries, occurred at the grasberg minerals district when the rock structure above the ceiling of an underground training facility collapsed. there can be no assurance that similar events will not occur in the future.
we experience mining induced seismic activity, including landslides, from time to time in the grasberg minerals district. the mine site is also in an active seismic area and has experienced earth tremors from time to time. in addition to the usual risks encountered in the mining industry, our indonesia mining operations involve additional risks given their location in steep mountainous terrain in a remote area of indonesia. these conditions have required us to overcome special engineering difficulties and develop extensive infrastructure facilities. the area also receives extreme rainfall, which has led to periodic floods and mudslides. since february 11, 2023, pt-fi's operations have been temporarily disrupted because of significant rainfall and landslides, which restricted access to infrastructure near its milling operations. recovery activities are in progress to clear debris from the affected areas and pt-fi is in the process of gradually resuming operations. operations are expected to be fully restored by the end of february 2023.
as a result of this disruption, we expect our first-quarter 2023 sales volumes to be lower than previously expected. if pt-fi is not able to resume operations as currently expected or on our anticipated timeline, our results of operations may be further impacted. we cannot predict whether additional occurrences of seismic activity, extreme rainfall or other unexpected geological activity will occur that could cause material schedule delays or additional revisions to pt-fi's mine plans, which could adversely affect our cash flows, results of operations and financial condition.
we maintain insurance at amounts we believe to be reasonable to cover some of these risks and hazards; however, our insurance may not sufficiently cover losses from certain natural or operating disasters. there can be no assurance that such insurance will continue to be available, maintained, or that it will be available at economically feasible premiums. we may elect to not purchase insurance for certain risks because of the high premium costs associated with insuring such risk or for various other reasons. we do not have coverage for certain environmental losses and other risks. the lack of, or insufficiency of, insurance coverage could adversely affect our cash flows and overall profitability.
the occurrence of one or more of these events in connection with our exploration activities and development of and production from mining operations may result in the death of, or personal injury to, our employees, other personnel or third parties, the loss of mining equipment, damage to or destruction of mineral properties or production facilities, significant repair costs, monetary losses, deferral or unanticipated fluctuations in production, extensive community disruption (including short- and long-term health and safety risks), loss of licenses, permits or necessary approvals to operate, loss of workforce confidence, loss of infrastructure and services, disruption to essential supplies or delivery of our products, environmental damage and potential legal liabilities, all of which may adversely affect our reputation, business, prospects, results of operations and financial position. further, the impacts of any serious incidents that occur may also be amplified if we fail to respond timely or in an appropriate manner.
our management of waste rock and tailings are subject to significant environmental, safety and engineering challenges and risks that could adversely affect our business.
the waste rock (including overburden) and tailings produced in our mining operations represent our largest volume of waste material. managing the volume of waste rock and tailings presents significant environmental, safety and engineering challenges and risks primarily relating to structural stability, geochemistry, water quality and dust generation. management of this waste is regulated in the jurisdictions where we operate and our programs are designed to comply with applicable national, state and local laws, permits and approved environmental impact studies.
we maintain large leach pads and tailings impoundments containing viscous material. tailings impoundments include large embankments that must be engineered, constructed and monitored to ensure structural stability and avoid structural collapse. our tailings impoundments in arid areas must have effective programs to suppress fugitive dust emissions, and we must effectively monitor, prevent and treat acid rock drainage at all of our operations. in indonesia, we use a river transport system for tailings management, which presents other risks discussed in more detail in the risk factor below relating to the environmental challenges at our indonesia mining operations.
as of january 31, 2023, subsidiaries of our company currently operate 15 active tailings storage facilities (13 in the u.s. and 2 in peru), of which 10 have an upstream design and 5 have a centerline design. we also manage 48 tailings storage facilities in the u.s. that are inactive or closed (41 with an upstream design, 5 with a centerline design and 2 with a downstream design) and another 9 with an upstream design that are deemed "safely closed" according to the definition in the tailings standard. in 2022, we produced approximately 331 million metric tons of tailings. the failure of tailings storage facilities and other embankments at any of our mining operations could cause severe, and in some cases catastrophic, property and environmental damage and loss of life, as well as adverse effects on our business and reputation. some of our tailings storage facilities are located in areas where a failure has the potential to impact individual dwellings and a limited number of impoundments are in areas where a failure has the potential to impact nearby communities or mining infrastructure. there can be no assurance that a severe or catastrophic failure of any of our facilities will not occur in the future. for additional information regarding the company's tailings management and stewardship program, including the tailings standard, refer to items 1. and 2. "business and properties" herein.
in addition, as part of our commitment to enhancing our resilience to climate change risks as well as our commitment to implement the tailings standard, we will be required to consider uncertainties as a result of climate change, incorporate that assessment into the relevant knowledge base for our tailings facilities, use this knowledge base to enhance the resilience of our approach to the impacts of climate change using an adaptive management approach, incorporate that knowledge into facility operations, and take measures to mitigate both environmental impact and potential failure risks at our active and inactive tailings facilities, including those arising from climate change. these obligations will likely require future changes at our tailings facilities, which could increase our operational expenses or require further capital investments. for further discussion of potential physical impacts of climate change see the related risk factor below.
based on observations from tailings failures at unaffiliated mines, in addition to fatalities and severe personal, property and environmental damages, these events could result in limited or restricted access to mine sites, suspension of operations, decrease in mineral reserves, legal liability, government investigations, additional regulations and restrictions on mining operations in response to any such failure, increased monitoring costs and production costs, increased insurance costs or inability to obtain insurance, increased costs and/or limited access to capital, remediation costs, inability to comply with any additional safety requirements or obtain necessary certifications, evacuation or relocation of communities or other emergency action, and other impacts, which could have a material adverse effect on our operations and financial position.
our indonesia mining operations are susceptible to difficult and costly environmental challenges, and future changes in indonesia environmental laws could increase our costs.
mining operations on the scale of our indonesia operations involve significant environmental risks and challenges. our primary challenge is to dispose of the large amount of tailings. in 2022, pt-fi produced approximately 67 million metric tons of tailings. our tailings management plan, which has been approved by the indonesia government, uses an unnavigable river in the highlands to transport the tailings from the mill to an engineered tailings management area in the lowlands. levees have been constructed along both sides of the lowlands tailings management area to act as containment structures to laterally contain the footprint of the tailings deposition within the approved tailings management area.
another major environmental challenge at pt-fi is managing overburden, which is rock that was required to be moved aside in the open pit mining process to reach the ore in the grasberg open pit. in the presence of air, water and naturally occurring bacteria, some overburden can generate acid rock drainage, or acidic water containing dissolved metals that, if not properly managed, can adversely affect the environment. in addition, the grasberg overburden stockpiles have experienced erosion over time, caused by the large amounts of rainfall, with the eroded stockpile material eventually entering into the lowlands tailings management area. this eroded overburden affects the volume as well as the physical and chemical characteristics of the sediment material deposited in the lowlands tailings management area, which can result in environmental impacts. pt-fi's current tailings deposition management plan as well as robust environmental monitoring programs take into account the presence of this overburden in the lowlands tailings management area.
as part of its ongoing management and monitoring program, pt-fi expanded the scope of its monitoring and analyses used to assess possible impacts to the environment and human health from overburden erosion and tailings, including conducting and updating a human health risk assessment. during 2022, pt-fi continued routine assessment of surface waters, groundwaters, sediments and soils, dust and terrestrial and aquatic tissues. furthermore, pt-fi has been assisting local health authorities with an extensive regency-wide community health survey, which is providing further data on community health issues, including any potential impacts from operations. the ongoing community health work will assist in determining what additional monitoring and mitigation efforts may be required in the future.
in the past, the indonesia government has raised questions with respect to our tailings and overburden management plans, including a suggestion that we implement a tailings pipeline and dam rather than the river transport system for tailings management. our indonesia mining operations are remotely located in steep mountainous terrain and in an active seismic area, which also experiences extreme weather events; such that, the pipeline infrastructure required to convey the volume of material is not feasible, and would be more prone to failure, and could therefore involve significant potentially adverse environmental issues. based on our own studies and others conducted by third parties, we believe that our controlled riverine transport system is the best site-specific option for tailings management at the indonesia site.
overtopping or failure of any tailings containment structures (levees or protection structures) induced by extreme weather events such as floods, a major seismic event or naturally-occurring weak ground under the structures, are potential risks. the potential impacts from any such occurrence could vary significantly depending upon the specific location of the failure. unanticipated structural failure of these structures in certain areas in the future could result in flooding of the nearby communities and related loss of lives and/or severe personal, property and environmental damages. under certain conditions, a failure may necessitate evacuation or relocation of communities or other emergency action, financial assistance to the communities impacted, and remediation costs to repair and compensate for the social, cultural and economic impacts.
in addition, in the southern portion of the approved tailings management area, tailings have the potential to create depositional impacts outside of the approved boundary unless the protection structures (as proposed by pt-fi) are extended. an extension of these protection structures is planned and is currently awaiting permitting, which continues to progress. if the permitting for these protection structures is not received in a timely manner, or not received at all, there is a risk that the tailings in the lower portion of the tailings management area could create depositional impacts outside of our approved footprint and potentially impact the environment and communities. refer to items 1. and 2. "business and properties" for further discussion of our environmental obligations in indonesia.
managing these environmental challenges at our indonesia operations could result in reputational harm and increased costs that could be significant.
there can be no assurance that future environmental changes affecting the mining industry in indonesia will not be introduced or unexpectedly altered or repealed, or that new interpretations of existing indonesia environmental laws and regulations will not be issued, which could have a significant impact on pt-fi.
violence, civil and religious strife, and activism could result in loss of life and disrupt our operations.
indonesia has long faced separatist movements and civil and religious strife in a number of provinces. several separatist groups have sought increased political independence for the province of central papua, where our grasberg minerals district is located. in central papua, there have been attacks on civilians by separatists and conflicts between separatists and the indonesia military and police. in addition, illegal artisanal miners have clashed with police who have attempted to move them away from our facilities. social, economic and political instability in central papua could materially and adversely affect us if it results in damage to our property or interruption of our indonesia operations.
starting in 2009, shooting incidents have occurred within the pt-fi project area, including along the road leading to our mining and milling operations, and there have been 22 fatalities and more than 75 injuries to our employees, contractor employees, government security personnel and civilians. there were several shooting incidents in the first half of 2020, including an incident near a pt-fi office building where one employee was killed and two others injured. in january 2021, a helicopter contracted to pt-fi was fired upon and struck by a single gunshot in an area adjacent to the project area. in 2022, outside of the pt-fi operational area but within the province of central papua, there were at least 30 incidents of separatist violence, resulting in 29 fatalities. separatist security incidents, including shootings, continue to occur in central papua. pt-fi actively monitors security conditions and the occurrence of incidents both within the project area and regionally.
the safety of our workforce is a critical concern, and pt-fi continues to work with the indonesia government to enhance security and address security-related issues within the pt-fi project area and in nearby areas. although we have implemented measures and safeguards consistent with both international standards and our own internal standards relating to the use of force and respect for human rights, the implementation of these measures and safeguards does not guarantee that personnel, national police or other security forces will uphold these standards in every instance. we continue to limit the use of the road leading to pt-fi's mining and milling operations to secured convoys, including transport of personnel by armored vehicles in designated areas.
we cannot predict whether additional incidents will occur that could result in loss of life, or disruption or suspension of pt-fi's operations. if other disruptive incidents occur, they could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition in ways that we cannot predict at this time.
south america countries have historically experienced uneven periods of economic growth, as well as recession, periods of high inflation and general economic and political instability. since 2019, both peru and chile have experienced significant civil unrest unrelated to our operations. for example, in 2022, an unaffiliated copper producer in southern peru repeatedly curtailed or suspended operations because of repeated and sustained community protests on the government-designated concentrate transport route along public roads, which have constrained such producer and at times other local producers from shipping their products. such protests are ongoing. other operations in the region have encountered significant issues with trespassers, illegal artisanal miners, and civil demonstrations that impact their current operations, expansion projects, logistical supply and product transport. such protests have occasionally been accompanied by acts of violence and property damage, and continue intermittently in the region.
although such civil unrest has not significantly impacted our results, similar events in the future could cause our south america operations to be materially impacted, in which case, we may not be able to meet our production and sales targets. political uncertainty has created potential instability in the regulatory environment in peru. in december 2022, peru's congress impeached president castillo, who was subsequently taken into custody by peruvian authorities, and vice president boluarte was sworn in as president. following these events, there have been widespread and sometimes violent political protests, including attacks on civil infrastructure and businesses, which have resulted in delays in the transport of supplies, products and people at our cerro verde mine. other mining operations in the region have temporarily halted mining activities as a result of the civil unrest. a national state of emergency has been declared, and military forces deployed to augment national police, which have resulted in civilian and police fatalities. although there has been a limited impact on cerro verde's operations, the situation in peru remains uncertain, and a prolonged disruption of logistics and supply chains could impact future operations. in chile, despite the overwhelming electoral approval of a proposal to rewrite the constitution in a 2020 referendum, the product of the constitutional assembly was rejected by over 60% of voters in 2022. while support for constitutional reform remains strong, uncertainty in the resolution of constitutional reform may contribute to incidents of social unrest. we cannot predict whether similar or more significant incidents of civil unrest or political instability will occur in the future in peru or chile.
our mining operations, including future expansions or developments, depend on the availability of significant quantities of secure water supplies.
we recognize that access to clean, safe and reliable water supplies is vital to the health and livelihood of our host communities. our mining operations require physical availability and secure legal rights to significant quantities of water, and the increasing pressure on water resources requires us to consider both current and future conditions in our approach. we aim to balance our operational water requirements with those of the local communities, environment and ecosystems. most of our north america and south america mining operations are in areas where competition for water supplies is significant, and where climate change may lead to increasing scarcity of water resources in the future. continuous production at our mines and any future expansions or developments are dependent on many factors, including our ability to maintain our water rights and claims, and the continuing physical availability of the water supplies. current and long-term water risks include those that arise from our operations and events that we do not control (such as extreme weather and other physical risks associated with climate change). for further discussion of the potential physical impacts of climate change, see the related risk factor below.
as discussed in item 3. "legal proceedings," in arizona, where our operations use both surface water and groundwater, we are a participant in an active adjudication in which arizona courts have been attempting, for over 45 years, to quantify and prioritize surface water claims for the gila river watershed, one of the state's largest river systems. if we are not able to satisfactorily resolve the issues being addressed in the adjudications, water uses could be diminished or curtailed, and our operations at morenci, safford and sierrita could be adversely affected unless we are able to acquire alternative resources.
water for our cerro verde operation in peru comes from renewable sources through a series of storage reservoirs on the rio chili watershed that collects water primarily from seasonal precipitation and from wastewater collected from the city of arequipa and treated at a wastewater treatment plant constructed by us. as a result of occasional drought conditions, temporary supply shortages that could affect our cerro verde operation are possible.
water for our el abra mining operation in chile comes from the continued pumping of groundwater from the salar de ascotán aquifer. in 2010, el abra obtained regulatory approval for the continued pumping of groundwater from the salar de ascotán aquifer for its sulfide processing plant, which began operations in 2011. our current permit will expire in 2029. the agreement to pump from this aquifer is subject to continued monitoring through 2029 of the aquifer water levels and select flora species to ensure that environmentally sensitive areas are not impacted by our pumping. if impact occurs, reductions in pumping are required to restore water levels, which could have an adverse effect on production from el abra. for further discussion, see the risk factor above relating to the geopolitical, economic and social risks associated with our international operations.
although we typically have sufficient water for our indonesia operations, the area receives considerable rainfall that makes us susceptible to periodic floods and mudslides, the nature and magnitude of which cannot be predicted. for further discussion of the overburden and related environmental challenges, including as a result of flooding in indonesia, see the related risk factor above.
although each of our mining operations currently has access to sufficient water supplies to support current operational demands, as discussed above, the availability of additional supplies for potential future expansions or development will require additional investments and will take time to develop, if available. while we are taking actions to acquire additional back-up water supplies, such supplies may not be available at acceptable cost, or at all, so that the loss of a water right or currently available water supply could force us to curtail operations or force premature closures, and the ability to obtain future water supplies could prevent future expansions or developments, thereby increasing and/or accelerating costs or foregoing profitable operations.
major public health crises, including the covid-19 pandemic, may have an adverse impact on our business.
pandemics, epidemics, widespread illness or other health crises, such as the covid-19 pandemic (including any new variants), that interfere with the ability of our employees, suppliers, customers, financing sources or others to conduct business have and could adversely affect the global economy and our operations and business, including demand for the commodities we produce and our profit margins. for further information, see the risk factor above regarding fluctuations in market prices of the commodities we produce and the risk factor below regarding the prices and availability of the consumables and components we purchase and constraints on supply and logistics.
actions taken by governmental authorities and third parties to contain and mitigate the risk of spread of any major public health crisis, including covid-19, may negatively impact our business, including a disruption of or change to our operating plans. for example, in mid-march 2020, we had to temporarily transition our cerro verde mine to care and maintenance status and adjust operations to prioritize critical activities in response to a decree issued by the peru government relating to covid-19.
our business and results of operations could be adversely affected if significant portions of our workforce are unable to work effectively, including because of illness, quarantines, government actions or other restrictions, or if workplace entry and travel are restricted resulting in the delay of key personnel or external consultants accessing our sites. there can be no assurance that our actions in response would be effective in containing and mitigating the risk of spread or a major outbreak of any public health crisis (including covid-19) at our operating sites. a major health crisis at any of our operating sites, and particularly at pt-fi's remote operating site, could disrupt or change our operating plans, which may have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.
our information technology systems may be adversely affected by disruptions, damage, failure and risks associated with implementation and integration.
our industry has become increasingly supported by and dependent on digital technologies. our strategy of operating large, long-lived, geographically diverse assets has been increasingly dependent on our ability to become fully integrated and highly automated. many of our business and operational processes are heavily dependent on traditional and emerging technology systems to conduct day-to-day operations, improve safety and efficiency, and lower costs.
as our dependence on information systems, including those of our third-party service providers and vendors, grows, we become more vulnerable to an increasing threat of continually evolving cybersecurity risks. in recent years, cybersecurity events have increased in frequency and magnitude. these incidents may include, but are not limited to, installation of malicious software, phishing, ransomware, credential attacks, unauthorized access to data and other advanced and sophisticated cybersecurity breaches and threats, including threats that increasingly target critical operational technologies and process control networks. if any of these threats materialize, we could be subject to manipulation or improper use of our systems and networks, production downtimes, communication interruption or other disruptions and delays to our operations or to the transportation of products or infrastructure utilized by our operations, unauthorized release of proprietary, commercially sensitive, confidential or otherwise protected information, a misappropriation or loss of funds, the corruption of data, significant health and safety consequences, environmental damage, loss of intellectual property, fines and litigation, damage to our reputation or financial losses from remedial actions, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our cash flows, results of operations and financial condition. we have experienced targeted and non-targeted cybersecurity events in the past and may experience them in the future. while these cybersecurity events did not result in any material loss to us or interrupt our day-to-day operations, as of january 31, 2023, there can be no assurance that we will not experience any such losses or interruption in the future. given the unpredictability of the timing and the evolving nature and scope of information technology disruptions, the various procedures and controls we use to monitor and protect against these threats and to mitigate our potential risks to such threats may not be sufficient in preventing cybersecurity events from materializing. further, as cybersecurity threats continue to evolve, we may be required to expend significant additional resources to continue to modify or enhance our protective measures or to investigate and remediate vulnerabilities to cybersecurity threats.
we could also be adversely affected by system or network disruptions if new or upgraded information technology systems are defective, not installed properly or not properly integrated into our operations. system modification failures could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position and results of operations and could, if not successfully implemented, adversely impact the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting.
further, we increasingly depend on our information technology infrastructure for electronic communications among our locations, personnel, customers and suppliers around the world, including as a result of remote working and flexible working arrangements. these information technology systems, some of which are managed by third parties that we do not control, may be susceptible to damage, disruptions or shutdowns because of failures during the process of upgrading or replacing software, databases or components thereof, cutover activities in our restructuring and simplification initiatives, power outages, hardware failures, telecommunication failures, user errors, catastrophic events or other problems.
human capital risks labor disputes or labor unrest could disrupt our operations.
our business is dependent on maintaining good relations with our workforce. a significant portion of our employees are represented by labor unions in a number of countries under various collective bargaining agreements with varying durations and expiration dates. refer to items 1. and 2. "business and properties" of this annual report on form 10-k for additional information regarding labor matters, and expiration dates of such agreements. as of december 31, 2022, approximately 30% of our global labor force was covered by collective bargaining agreements and approximately 2% of our global labor force was covered by agreements that will or were scheduled to expire during 2023 or that had expired as of december 31, 2022, and continue to be negotiated.
labor agreements are negotiated on a periodic basis, and may not be renewed on reasonably satisfactory terms to us or at all. if we do not successfully negotiate new collective bargaining agreements with our union workers, we may incur prolonged strikes and other work stoppages at our mining operations, which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. additionally, if we enter into a new labor agreement with any union that significantly increases our labor costs relative to our competitors, our ability to compete may be materially and adversely affected.
we have in the past and could in the future experience labor disruptions such as work stoppages, work slowdowns, union organizing campaigns, strikes, or lockouts that could adversely affect our operations. for example, in third-quarter 2020, we experienced a five-day labor-related work stoppage related to covid-19 travel restrictions when a small group of workers at pt-fi staged protests and a blockade restricting access to the main road to the mining operations area. we reached an amicable resolution with the group of workers while upholding our covid-19 safety protocols. there were no strikes or lockouts at any of our operations in 2021 or 2022.
we cannot predict whether additional labor disruptions will occur. significant reductions in productivity or protracted work stoppages at one or more of our operations could significantly reduce our production and sales volumes or disrupt operations, which could adversely affect our cash flows, results of operations and financial condition.
our success depends on our ability to recruit, retain, develop and advance qualified personnel.
our success is dependent on the contributions of our highly skilled and experienced workforce. our business depends on our ability to recruit, retain, develop and advance a qualified, inclusive and diverse workforce at all levels. our ability to recruit qualified personnel is affected by the available pool of workers with the training and skills necessary to fill the available positions, the impact on the labor supply because of general economic conditions and our ability to offer competitive compensation and benefit packages. beginning in 2021 and during 2022, we experienced an increasingly competitive labor market and labor shortages at our north america operations. as a result of this labor shortage, we hired more contract workers in 2022, which increased our costs. if we fail to recruit, retain, develop and advance qualified, inclusive and diverse personnel necessary for the efficient operation of our business, this could result in decreased profitability, productivity and efficiency, safety performance challenges, and the delay of current and potential development projects, any of which may have a material adverse effect on our performance.
risks related to development projects and mineral reserves development projects are inherently risky and may require more capital and have lower economic returns than anticipated, and the operation and development of our underground mines are also subject to other unique risks.
mine development projects typically require a number of years and significant expenditures during the development phase before production is possible. there are many risks and uncertainties inherent in all development projects including, but not limited to, unexpected or difficult geological formations or conditions, potential delays (including the ability and timeframe to obtain permits, or because of weather, social or political unrest and major public health crisis), cost overruns, availability of economic sources and reliable access to water, power and infrastructure, lower levels of production during ramp-up periods, shortages of material or labor, construction defects, equipment breakdowns and injuries to persons and property.
all of our copper and gold production in indonesia comes from underground mining in the grasberg minerals district. the operation and development of our underground mines is also subject to other unique risks including, but not limited to, underground fires or floods, ventilating harmful gases, fall-of-ground accidents, and seismic activity resulting from unexpected or difficult geological formations or conditions. for example, we experience mining induced seismic activity from time to time in the grasberg minerals district. while we anticipate taking all measures that we deem reasonable and prudent in connection with the development of our underground mines to safely manage production, there can be no assurance that these risks will not cause schedule delays, revised mine plans, injuries to persons and property, or increased capital costs, any of which may have a material adverse impact on our cash flows, results of operations and financial condition. additionally, although we devote significant time and resources to our project planning, approval and review processes, many of our development projects are highly complex and rely on factors that are outside of our control, which may cause the actual time and capital required to complete a development project to exceed our estimates.
exploration is highly speculative, and our exploration activities may not result in additional discoveries to replace mineral reserves.
our existing mineral reserves will be depleted over time by production from our operations. because our profits are primarily derived from our mining operations, our ability to replenish our mineral reserves is essential to our long-term success. depleted mineral reserves can be replaced in several ways, including expanding known ore bodies, reducing operating costs that could extend the life of a mine by allowing us to cost-effectively process ore types that were previously considered uneconomic, by locating new deposits or acquiring interests in mineral reserves from third parties. exploration is highly speculative in nature, involves many risks and uncertainties, requires substantial capital expenditures and, in some instances, advances in processing technology, and is frequently unsuccessful in discovering significant mineral resources since new, large, long-life deposits are increasingly scarce. accordingly, our current or future exploration programs may not result in the discovery of additional deposits that can be produced profitably. even if significant mineral resources are discovered, it will likely take many years from the initial phases of exploration until commencement of production, during which time the economic feasibility of production may change. we may not be able to discover, enhance, develop or acquire mineral reserves in sufficient quantities to maintain or grow our current reserve levels, which could negatively affect our cash flows, results of operations and financial condition.
estimates of mineral reserves and mineral resources are uncertain and the volume and grade of ore actually recovered may vary from our estimates.
our estimates of mineral reserves and mineral resources have been prepared in accordance with the disclosure requirements of subpart 1300 of u.s. securities and exchange commission (sec) regulation s-k. there are numerous uncertainties inherent in mineral estimates. such estimates are, to a large extent, based on assumed long-term prices for the commodities we produce, primarily copper, gold and molybdenum, and interpretations of geologic data obtained from drill holes and other exploration techniques, which may not necessarily be indicative of future results. our mineral estimates are based on the latest available geological and geotechnical studies. we conduct ongoing studies of our ore bodies to optimize economic values and to manage risk. we revise our mine plans and estimates of recoverable proven and probable mineral reserves as required in accordance with the latest available studies. geological assumptions about our mineral resources that are valid at the time of estimation may change significantly when new information becomes available.
estimates of mineral reserves, or the cost at which we anticipate the mineral reserves will be recovered, are based on assumptions, such as metal prices and other economic inputs. changes to such assumptions may require revisions to mineral reserve estimates which could affect our asset carrying values and may also negatively impact our future financial condition and results. until mineral reserves are actually mined and processed, the quantity of ore and grades must be considered as an estimate only.
in addition, if the market prices for the commodities we produce decline from assumed levels, if production costs increase or recovery rates decrease, or if applicable laws and regulations are adversely changed, there can be no assurance that the indicated level of recovery will be realized or that mineral reserves can be mined or processed profitably. if we determine that certain of our estimated recoverable proven and probable mineral reserves have become uneconomic, this may ultimately lead to a reduction in our aggregate reported mineral reserves, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
additionally, the term "mineral resources" does not indicate recoverable proven and probable mineral reserves as defined by the sec. estimates of mineral resources are subject to further exploration and evaluation of development and operating costs, grades, recoveries and other material factors, and, therefore, are subject to considerable uncertainty. mineral resources do not meet the threshold for mineral reserve modifying factors, such as engineering, legal and/or economic feasibility, that would allow for the conversion to mineral reserves. accordingly, there can be no assurance that the estimated mineral resources not included in mineral reserves will become recoverable proven and probable mineral reserves.
regulatory, environmental and social risks the costs of compliance with environmental, health and safety laws and regulations applicable to our operations may constrain existing operations or expansion opportunities. related permit and other approval requirements may delay or result in a suspension of our operations.
our operations are subject to extensive and complex laws and regulations, including environmental laws and regulations governing the generation, storage, treatment, transportation and disposal of hazardous substances; solid waste disposal; air emissions; wastewater discharges; remediation, restoration and reclamation of environmental contamination, including mine closures and reclamation; protection of endangered and threatened species and designation of critical habitats; and other related matters. these laws and regulations are subject to change and to changing interpretation by governmental agencies and other bodies vested with broad supervisory authority. as a mining company, compliance with environmental, health and safety laws and regulations is an integral and costly part of our business. in addition, we must obtain regulatory permits and approvals to start, continue and expand operations.
certain federal and similar state laws and regulations may expose us to joint and several liability for environmental damages caused by our operations, or by previous owners or operators of properties we acquired or are currently operating or at sites where we previously sent materials for processing, recycling or disposal. as discussed in more detail in the risk factor below relating to costs incurred for remediating environmental conditions on our properties that are no longer in operation, we have substantial obligations for environmental remediation on properties previously owned or operated by freeport minerals corporation (fmc) and certain of its affiliates. noncompliance with these laws and regulations could result in material penalties or other liabilities. in addition, compliance with these laws may from time to time result in delays in or changes to our development or expansion plans. compliance with these laws and regulations imposes substantial costs, which we expect will continue to increase over time because of increased regulatory oversight, adoption of increasingly stringent environmental standards, and other factors.
new or revised environmental regulatory requirements are frequently proposed, many of which have resulted and may in the future result in substantially increased costs for our business, including those regarding financial obligations. regulations have been considered at various governmental levels to increase financial responsibility requirements for mine closure and reclamation. adoption of such environmental regulations or more stringent application of existing regulations may materially increase our costs, threaten certain operating activities and constrain our expansion opportunities. in addition, there can be no assurance that restrictions relating to conservation will not have an adverse impact on expansion of our operations or not result in delays in project development, or constraints on exploration or operations in impacted areas.
we have incurred and expect to incur environmental capital expenditures and other environmental costs (including our joint venture partners' shares) to comply with applicable environmental laws and regulations that affect our operations. the timing and amounts of estimated payments could change as a result of changes in regulatory requirements, changes in scope and costs of reclamation activities, the settlement of environmental matters and the rate at which actual spending occurs on continuing matters.
we are also subject to extensive regulation of worker health and safety. our mines are inspected on a regular basis by government regulators who may issue citations and orders when they believe a violation has occurred under applicable mining regulations. if inspections result in an alleged violation, we may be subject to fines and penalties and, in instances of alleged significant violations, our mining operations or industrial facilities could be subject to temporary or extended closures.
many other governmental bodies regulate other aspects of our operations, and our failure to comply with these legal requirements can result in substantial penalties. in addition, new laws and regulations, including executive orders, or changes to or new interpretations of existing laws and regulations by courts or regulatory authorities occur regularly, but are difficult to predict. any such variations could negatively impact the mining sector, including our business, substantially increase costs to achieve compliance or otherwise could have a material adverse effect on our cash flows, results of operations and financial condition.
for additional information regarding the various regulations affecting us, see items 1. and 2. "business and properties" of this annual report on form 10-k.
we incur significant costs for remediating environmental conditions on properties that have not been operated in many years.
fmc and its subsidiaries, and many of their affiliates and predecessor companies, have been involved in exploration, mining, milling, smelting and manufacturing in the u.s. for more than a century. activities that occurred in the late 19th century and the 20th century prior to the advent of modern environmental laws were not subject to environmental regulation and were conducted before u.s. industrial companies fully understood the long-term effects of their operations on the surrounding environment.
companies like fmc are now legally responsible for remediating hazardous substances released into the environment on or from properties owned or operated by them as well as properties where they arranged for disposal of such substances, irrespective of when the release into the environment occurred or who caused it. that liability is often asserted on a joint and several basis with other prior and subsequent owners, operators and arrangers, meaning that each owner or operator of the property is, and each arranger may be, held fully responsible for the remediation, although in many cases some or all of the other responsible parties no longer exist, do not have the financial ability to respond or cannot be found. as a result, because of our acquisition of fmc, many of the subsidiary companies we now own are potentially responsible for a wide variety of environmental remediation projects throughout the u.s., and we expect to spend substantial sums annually for many years to address those remediation issues. we are also subject to claims where the release of hazardous substances is alleged to have damaged natural resources.
at december 31, 2022, we had more than 100 active remediation projects in 24 u.s. states. in addition, fmc and certain affiliates and predecessor companies were parties to agreements relating to the transfer of businesses or properties that contained indemnification provisions relating to environmental matters, and from time to time these provisions become the source of claims against us.
our environmental obligation estimates are primarily based upon:
•our knowledge and beliefs about complex scientific and historical facts and circumstances that in many cases occurred many decades ago;
•our beliefs and assumptions regarding the nature, extent and duration of remediation activities that we will be required to undertake and the estimated costs of those remediation activities, which are subject to varying interpretations; and
•our beliefs regarding the requirements that are imposed on us by existing laws and regulations and, in some cases, the clarification of uncertain regulatory requirements that could materially affect our environmental obligation estimates.
significant adjustments to these estimates are likely to occur in the future as additional information becomes available. the actual environmental costs may exceed our current and future accruals for these costs, and any such changes could be material.
in addition, remediation standards imposed by the u.s. environmental protection agency and state environmental agencies have generally become more stringent over time and may become even more stringent in the future. imposition of more stringent remediation standards, particularly for arsenic and lead in soils, poses a risk that additional remediation work could be required at our active remediation sites and at sites that we have already remediated to the satisfaction of the responsible governmental agencies, and may increase the risk of toxic tort litigation.
refer to items 1. and 2. "business and properties" and note 12 for further discussion of our environmental obligations.
we face increasing, complex and changing regulatory and stakeholder expectations relating to our climate and energy transition plans, which may adversely affect our business. further, we may not be able to timely or successfully transition from fossil fuel sources for our significant energy needs, which may result in reputational damage.
our operations require significant energy, much of which is currently from fossil fuel sources and is obtained from third parties under long-term contracts. energy represented approximately 21% of our copper mine site operating costs in 2022, and is expected to approximate 24% in 2023. the principal sources of energy consumption at our mining operations are: diesel fuel, which powers mine trucks and other transportation equipment; purchased electricity, which powers core facilities and certain on-site metal processing operations; and coal and natural gas, which provides electricity at certain operations.
existing and proposed governmental conventions, laws, rules, regulations, policies and standards as well as existing and proposed voluntary disclosure standards and frameworks (both in the u.s. and internationally), including those related to climate and greenhouse gas (ghg) emissions, may in the future add significantly to our operating costs, limit or modify our operations, impact the competitiveness of the commodities we produce, and require more resources to comply and remediate in response. for additional information on climate change conventions, laws, regulations and standards applicable to fcx, refer to items 1. and 2. "business and properties".
if we do not adapt to the expectations of stakeholders regarding a low-carbon future in a timely manner, it may result in reputational damage with key stakeholders, which can impact investor confidence, market value and access to, and cost of, capital. in response to climate change and societal and stakeholder demands for action, we have announced 2030 ghg emissions reduction targets and a 2050 net zero aspiration, which will result in additional costs to us, the totality of which we cannot currently estimate with accuracy, and we cannot guarantee that we will be able to achieve any current or future ghg emissions targets or aspirations.
while we strive to transition to more renewable power sources for our mining operations, as a commercial consumer of power, our ability to reduce our ghg emissions associated with our power consumption demand is dependent upon the mix of our suppliers and locally-available renewable energy resources at our various sites. the transition to renewable and other energy sources could, among other things, increase our capital expenditures, operating and energy costs, depending on the scope, magnitude and timing of increased regulation of fossil-fuel based energy production, including ghg emissions, as well as the availability of alternative energy sources.
in certain aspects of our operations, our ability to reduce our ghg emissions is directly dependent on the actions of third parties and technological solutions and innovation, and our ability to make significant, rapid changes in our ghg emissions in response to potential future regulations may be limited. for example, our diesel-fueled haul trucks are a significant contributor to ghg emissions at our north america and south america operations, but reduction of emissions from such haul trucks will depend upon the development and availability of commercially viable alternative-fueled mining equipment by our third-party suppliers. at our remote operations in indonesia, we own and operate a coal-fired power plant, and our ability to transition to commercially viable alternative sources of energy will depend on, among other things, additional studies, technological considerations and permit approvals.
the physical impacts of climate change may adversely affect our mining operations, workforce, communities, supply chains and customers, which may result in increased costs.
we recognize that as the climate changes, our operations, workforce, communities, supply chains and customers may be exposed to changes in the frequency, intensity and/or duration of intense storms, drought, flooding (including from sea level rise at our coastal operations), wildfire, and other extreme weather events and patterns (such as extreme heat). such potential physical impacts of climate change on our operations are highly uncertain, and would vary by operation based on particular geographic circumstances. at many of our mine sites, climate change is projected to impact local precipitation regimes, resulting in shorter-duration, higher-intensity storm events, and the potential for less precipitation overall. we could face increased operational costs associated with managing additional volumes of storm water during more intense future events, including supply disruption, delays, damage to or inaccessibility of our facilities and increased pricing of consumables and components we purchase. in addition, the potential for overall decreases in precipitation could affect the availability of water needed for our operations, leading to increased operating costs, or in extreme cases, disruptions to our mining operations. for additional information regarding risks relating to availability of water, see related risk factor above.
increasing scrutiny, action and evolving expectations from stakeholders with respect to our esg practices, performance, commitments and disclosures may impact our reputation, increase our costs and impact our access to capital or business strategy.
stakeholder scrutiny related to our esg practices, commitments, performance and disclosures continues to increase. we have adopted certain policies and programs, including with respect to responsible production frameworks, climate change, water stewardship, biodiversity and land management, tailings management and stewardship, waste management, safety and health, human capital management, human rights, social performance and community and indigenous peoples relations, political activity and spending practices, and supply chains/responsible sourcing. it is possible, however, that our stakeholders might not be satisfied with our esg practices, goals, initiatives, commitments, performance and/or disclosures, or the speed of their adoption, implementation and measurable success. at the same time, certain stakeholders might not be satisfied that we have adopted esg goals, initiatives and commitments at all. if we do not meet our stakeholders' evolving expectations, including any failure or perceived failure to achieve our stated goals and targets or industry standards or any allegations that our stated goals or targets should be altered, our reputation, access to and cost of capital, business strategy and stock price could be negatively impacted.
investor advocacy groups, certain institutional investors, investment funds, creditors and other influential investors are increasingly focused on our esg practices and in recent years have placed increasing importance on the esg implications of their investments and lending decisions.
organizations that provide information to investors and financial institutions on esg performance and related matters have developed quantitative and qualitative data collection processes and ratings processes for evaluating companies on their approach to esg matters. such ratings are used by some investors to inform their investment and voting decisions. in addition, many investors have created their own proprietary ratings that inform their investment and voting decisions. unfavorable ratings or assessment of our esg practices, including our compliance with certain voluntary disclosure standards and frameworks, may lead to negative investor sentiment toward us, which could have a negative impact on our stock price and our access to and cost of capital.
similarly, many financial institutions are increasingly incorporating esg ratings or assessments into their credit risk assessments, and screen companies based on their esg practices and performance when making lending decisions. if we are unable to meet the esg lending criteria set by our creditors or are required to take certain remediation steps to satisfy such criteria, our access to capital on terms we find favorable may be limited and our costs may increase.
as we continue to focus on our esg practices, goals, initiatives, commitments, performance and disclosures, and as esg-related regulations and voluntary disclosure standards and frameworks continue to evolve, we have expanded our public disclosures in these areas. such disclosures may reflect goals, aspirations, commitments, cost estimates and other expectations and assumptions, including over long timeframes, which are necessarily uncertain and may not be realized.
further, the voluntary disclosure standards or frameworks we choose to align with are evolving and may change over time and our interpretation of such disclosure standards and frameworks may differ from those of others, either of which may result in a lack of consistent or meaningful comparative data from period to period and/or significant revisions to our goals and aspirations or reported progress in achieving such goals and aspirations.
ensuring that there are adequate systems and processes in place to comply with the various esg tracking and disclosure obligations will require management's time and expense. if we do not adapt to or comply with investor or stakeholder expectations, including with respect to evolving esg disclosure standards and frameworks, or if we are perceived to have not responded appropriately, regardless of whether there is a legal requirement to do so, we may suffer from reputational damage and our business, financial condition, cost of capital and/or stock price could be materially and adversely affected.
in addition, our customers and end users may require that we implement certain additional esg procedures or standards before they will start or continue to do business with us, which could lead to preferential buying based on our esg practices compared to our competitors' esg practices. further, being associated with activities by suppliers, contractors or other affiliates that have or are perceived to have individual or cumulative adverse impacts on the environment, climate, biodiversity and land management, water access and management, human rights or cultural heritage could negatively affect our reputation and impose additional costs.
failure or the perceived failure to manage our relationships with the communities and/or indigenous peoples where we operate or that are near our operations could harm our reputation and social license to operate.
our relationships with the communities and/or indigenous peoples where we operate or that are adjacent to or near our operations are critical to the long-term success of our existing operations and the development of any future projects. there is ongoing and increasing stakeholder concern relating to a company's social license to operate and the perceived effects of mining activities on the environment and on communities impacted by such activities. we may engage in activities, such as exploration, production, construction or expansion of our operations that have or are perceived to have adverse impacts on the local communities and their relevant stakeholders, society as a whole, indigenous peoples, cultural heritage, human rights and the environment, among other things. for example, our operations may take place on or adjacent to indigenous peoples' ancestral lands, and such indigenous peoples may assert rights to the lands where we operate. further, we may be required or expected by our stakeholders to consult with and/or obtain consent from indigenous peoples with respect to these operations.
in addition, our assets are generally long-lived and stakeholders' perceptions and expectations can change over the life of the mine. changes in the aspirations and expectations of local communities and/or indigenous peoples where we operate, with respect to our employee health and safety performance and our contributions to infrastructure, community development, environmental management and other factors could affect our social license to operate and reputation, and could lead to delays and/or increased costs if expansions or new projects are blocked either temporarily or for extended periods. failure to effectively engage with communities on an ongoing basis, including the withdrawal of consent or support of indigenous peoples, or other stakeholders, could adversely impact our business, damage our reputation and/or result in loss of rights to explore, operate or develop our projects.
risks related to our common stock our holding company structure may impact our ability to service our debt, declare dividends, and repurchase shares and debt.
we are a holding company with no material assets other than the capital stock and intercompany receivables of our subsidiaries. as a result, our ability to service our indebtedness, pay dividends, and repurchase shares and debt is dependent on the generation of cash flows by our subsidiaries and their ability to make such cash available to us, by dividend, loan, debt repayment or otherwise. our subsidiaries do not have any obligation to make funds available to us to service our indebtedness, pay dividends, or repurchase shares and debt. dividends from subsidiaries that are not wholly owned are shared with other equity owners. cash at our international operations is also typically subject to foreign withholding taxes upon repatriation into the u.s.
in addition, our subsidiaries may not be able to, or be permitted to, make distributions to us or repay loans to us, to enable us to service our indebtedness, pay dividends, or repurchase shares and debt. each of our subsidiaries is a distinct legal entity and, under certain circumstances, legal restrictions, as well as the financial condition and operating requirements of our subsidiaries, may limit our ability to obtain cash from our subsidiaries. certain of our subsidiaries are parties to credit agreements that restrict their ability to make distributions or loan repayments to us if such subsidiary is in default under such agreements, or to transfer substantially all of the assets of such subsidiary without the consent of the lenders. our rights to participate in any distribution of our subsidiaries' assets upon their liquidation, reorganization or insolvency would generally be subject to the prior claims of the subsidiaries' creditors, including any trade creditors.
as more fully described in note 10, during 2021, our board of directors (board) adopted a performance-based payout framework, which currently includes base and variable dividends and a share repurchase program. our ability to continue to pay dividends (base or variable) and the timing and amount of any share repurchases is at the discretion of our board and management, respectively, and is subject to a number of factors, including maintaining our net debt target, capital availability, our financial results, cash requirements, global economic conditions, changes in laws, contractual restrictions and other factors deemed relevant by our board or management, as applicable. repurchases of our common stock under our repurchase program are discretionary up to the board-approved limit, and our share repurchase program may be modified, increased, suspended or terminated at any time at the board's discretion. our dividend payments and share repurchases may change, and there can be no assurance that we will continue to declare dividends or repurchase shares at all or in any particular amounts. a reduction or suspension in our dividend payments or share repurchases could have a negative effect on the price of our common stock.
anti-takeover provisions in our charter documents and delaware law may make an acquisition of us more difficult.
anti-takeover provisions in our charter documents and delaware law may make an acquisition of us more difficult. these provisions may discourage potential takeover attempts, discourage bids for our common stock at a premium over market price or adversely affect the market price of, and the voting and other rights of the holders of, our common stock. these provisions could also discourage proxy contests and make it more difficult for stockholders to elect directors other than the candidates nominated by the board. refer to exhibit 4.1 for further discussion of our anti-takeover provisions.
further, our by-laws provide to the fullest extent permitted by law that unless we consent in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, the court of chancery of the state of delaware (or, if the court of chancery does not have, or declines to accept, jurisdiction, the u.s. district court for the district of delaware) will be the sole and exclusive forum for any (i) derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf, (ii) action asserting a claim that is based upon a violation of a duty by any of our current or former directors, officers, employees or stockholders in such capacity, (iii) action asserting a claim arising pursuant to any provision of the delaware general corporation law or to which the delaware general corporation law confers jurisdiction upon the court of chancery of the state of delaware, (iv) action asserting a claim governed by the internal affairs doctrine, or (v) action asserting an "internal corporate claim" as that term is defined in section 115 of the delaware general corporation law. the exclusive forum provision may increase costs to bring a claim, discourage claims or limit a stockholder's ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that it finds favorable for disputes with us or our directors, officers or other employees, which may discourage such lawsuits against us or our directors, officers and other employees. alternatively, if a court were to find the exclusive forum provision contained in our by-laws to be inapplicable or unenforceable in an action, we may incur additional costs associated with resolving such action in other jurisdictions. the exclusive forum provision in our by-laws will not preclude or contract the scope of exclusive federal or concurrent jurisdiction for actions brought under the federal securities laws including the securities exchange act of 1934, as amended, or the securities act of 1933, as amended, or the respective rules and regulations promulgated thereunder.
in addition, because we are incorporated in delaware, we are governed by the provisions of section 203 of the delaware general corporation law, which may prohibit large stockholders from consummating a merger with, or acquisition of, us.
these provisions may deter an acquisition of us that might otherwise be attractive to our stockholders.
management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk" contained in part ii of our annual report on form 10-k for the fiscal year ended december 31, 2021.
overview we are a leading international mining company with headquarters in phoenix, arizona. we operate large, long-lived, geographically diverse assets with significant proven and probable mineral reserves of copper, gold and molybdenum.
we are one of the world's largest publicly traded copper producers. our portfolio of assets includes the grasberg minerals district in indonesia, one of the world's largest copper and gold deposits; and significant mining operations in north america and south america, including the large-scale morenci minerals district in arizona and the cerro verde operation in peru.
our results for 2022 reflect solid execution of our operating plan, which resulted in strong operating performance and cash flow generation allowing for increased cash returns to shareholders. our execution led to growth in consolidated copper and gold production and sales volumes when compared to the prior year. despite lower average realized copper prices, increased production and delivery costs, and economic uncertainty, we continued to generate positive operating income and operating cash flows. we believe the actions we have taken in recent years to build a solid balance sheet, successfully expand low-cost operations, and maintain flexible organic growth options while maintaining liquidity allow us to continue to execute our business plans in a prudent manner and preserve substantial future asset values.
75
table of contents net income attributable to common stock totaled $3.5 billion in 2022 and $4.3 billion in 2021. our results in 2022, compared to 2021, primarily reflect lower average realized copper prices and increased costs for energy, sulfuric acid, and maintenance and supplies, partly offset by higher copper and gold sales volumes. refer to "consolidated results" for discussion of items impacting our consolidated results for the two years ended december 31, 2022.
at december 31, 2022, we had consolidated debt of $10.6 billion and consolidated cash and cash equivalents of $8.1
billion, resulting in net debt of $2.5 billion ($1.3 billion excluding net debt for the greenfield smelter and precious metals refinery (pmr) in indonesia - collectively, the indonesia smelter projects). refer to "net debt"
for reconciliations of consolidated debt and consolidated cash and cash equivalents to net debt.
during 2022, we purchased approximately $1.1 billion aggregate principal amount of our senior notes in open-market transactions for a total cost of $1.0 billion, resulting in annual cash interest savings of approximately $50
million. in october 2022, we entered into a $3.0 billion revolving credit facility that matures in october 2027 and replaced our prior revolving credit facility. at december 31, 2022, we had no borrowings and $3.0 billion available under our revolving credit facility, and pt freeport indonesia (pt-fi) and cerro verde had $1.3 billion and $350
million, respectively, of availability under their revolving credit facilities. refer to note 8 and "capital resources and liquidity" for further discussion.
during 2022, we acquired 35.1 million shares of our common stock under our share repurchase program for a total cost of $1.3 billion ($38.36 average cost per share) and declared cash dividends totaling $0.60 per share on our common stock (which included both base and variable, performance-based cash dividends). approximately $3.2 billion remains available under our $5.0 billion share repurchase program. refer to note 10 and "capital resources and liquidity" for further discussion.
we have significant mineral reserves, mineral resources and future development opportunities within our portfolio of mining assets. at december 31, 2022, our estimated consolidated recoverable proven and probable mineral reserves totaled 111.0 billion pounds of copper, 26.9 million ounces of gold and 3.53 billion pounds of molybdenum. refer to note 17 and "critical accounting estimates - mineral reserves" for further discussion.
during 2022, production from our mines totaled 4.2 billion pounds of copper, 1.8 million ounces of gold and 85
million pounds of molybdenum. following is the allocation of our consolidated copper, gold and molybdenum production in 2022 by geographic location:
copper       gold       molybdenum north america        35  %       1  %            73  %    a south america        28          -               27
indonesia            37         99                -
100  %     100  %           100  %
a. our north america copper mines produced 34% of consolidated molybdenum production, and our henderson and climax molybdenum mines produced 39%.
copper production from the morenci mine in north america, cerro verde mine in peru and the grasberg minerals district in indonesia together totaled 75% of our consolidated copper production in 2022.
outlook our financial results vary as a result of fluctuations in market prices primarily for copper, gold and, to a lesser extent, molybdenum, as well as other factors. world market prices for these commodities have fluctuated historically and are affected by numerous factors beyond our control. beginning in 2020, with the onset of the covid-19 pandemic, and continuing in 2022 because of a series of macro-economic factors, there has been significant volatility in the financial and commodities markets, including the copper market. market sentiment improved beginning in late 2022 and we believe the outlook for copper fundamentals in the medium- and long-term are favorable. refer to "markets" and item 1a. "risk factors" contained in part i of our annual report on form 10-k for the year ended december 31, 2022, for further discussion. because we cannot control the price of our products, the key measures that management focuses on in operating our business are sales volumes, unit net cash costs, operating cash flows and capital expenditures. in addition, to the measures noted below and as further discussed in note 3, beginning january 1, 2023, our economic interest in pt-fi changes from approximately 81% to 48.76%, and accordingly, net income attributable to noncontrolling interests is expected to increase in 2023.

table of contents sales volumes following are our projected consolidated sales volumes for 2023 and actual consolidated sales volumes for 2022:
2023            2022
-projected         -actual copper(millions of recoverable pounds):
north america copper mines                      1,460           1,469
south america mining                            1,200           1,162

gold(thousands of recoverable ounces)           1,700           1,823
molybdenum(millions of recoverable                 80    a         75
pounds)
a. includes 50 million pounds from our north america and south america copper mines and 30 million pounds from our molybdenum mines.
projected sales volumes are dependent on operational performance, weather-related conditions, timing of shipments, pt-fi's continued ability to export copper concentrate, including the extension of pt-fi's export license after march 19, 2023, pt smelting and pt-fi's continued ability to export anode slimes and other factors.
since february 11, 2023, pt-fi's operations have been temporarily disrupted because of significant rainfall and landslides, which restricted access to infrastructure near its milling operations. recovery activities are in progress to clear debris from the affected areas and pt-fi is in the process of gradually resuming operations.
operations are expected to be fully restored by the end of february 2023.
as a result of this disruption, we expect our first-quarter 2023 sales volumes to be lower than previously expected. if pt-fi is not able to resume operations as currently expected or on our anticipated timeline, our results of operations may be further impacted.
for further discussion of the february 2023 weather event at pt-fi's operations and other important factors that could cause results to differ materially from projections, refer to "cautionary statement" below and item 1a. "risk factors" contained in part i of our annual report on form 10-k for the year ended december 31, 2022.
consolidated unit net cash costs our operations have been impacted by inflationary cost pressures, including increased costs for energy, sulfuric acid, and maintenance and supplies. historically, copper prices have been correlated to various input costs, including energy and other commodity-related consumables. during 2022, prices for a number of commodity-related consumables increased at a time when copper prices declined. while prices for a number of commodity-related consumables have retreated from the highs of 2022, most cost elements remain high relative to long-term correlations. in addition, labor constraints, particularly in the u.s., continue to limit production levels. we plan to continue to carefully manage costs and drive efficiencies to mitigate cost increases.
assuming average prices of $1,900 per ounce of gold and $20.00 per pound of molybdenum and achievement of current sales volume and cost estimates, consolidated unit net cash costs (net of by-product credits) for our copper mines are expected to average $1.60 per pound of copper in 2023. the impact of price changes on 2023 consolidated unit net cash costs would approximate $0.04 per pound of copper for each $100 per ounce change in the average price of gold and $0.02 per pound of copper for each $2 per pound change in the average price of molybdenum. quarterly unit net cash costs vary with fluctuations in sales volumes and realized prices, primarily for gold and molybdenum.
consolidated operating cash flows our consolidated operating cash flows vary with sales volumes; prices realized from copper, gold and molybdenum sales; production costs; income taxes; other working capital changes; and other factors. based on current sales volume and cost estimates, and assuming average prices of $4.00 per pound of copper, $1,900 per ounce of gold and
$20.00 per pound of molybdenum, our consolidated operating cash flows are estimated to approximate $7.2 billion
(including $0.1 billion of working capital and other sources) for the year 2023. estimated consolidated operating cash flows in 2023 also reflect a projected income tax provision of $2.5 billion (refer to "consolidated results -
income taxes" for further discussion of our projected income tax rate, including potential impacts of the provisions of the u.s. inflation reduction act of 2022 (the act), for the year 2023). the impact of price changes
77
table of contents during 2023 on operating cash flows would approximate $440 million for each $0.10 per pound change in the average price of copper, $170 million for each $100 per ounce change in the average price of gold and $120 million for each
$2 per pound change in the average price of molybdenum.
consolidated capital expenditures capital expenditures for the year 2023 are expected to approximate $5.2 billion (including $2.3 billion for major mining projects and $1.8 billion for the indonesia smelter projects). projected capital expenditures for major mining projects include $1.3 billion for planned projects primarily associated with underground mine development in the grasberg minerals district and supporting mill and power capital costs and $1.0 billion for discretionary growth projects (primarily for development of kucing liar, a mill recovery project with the installation of a new copper cleaner circuit at pt-fi, an electronic material recycle project at atlantic copper and an expansion project at lone star). we closely monitor market conditions and will continue to adjust our operating plans, including capital expenditures, to protect our liquidity and preserve our asset values, as necessary.
capital expenditures for the indonesia smelter projects are being funded with proceeds from pt-fi's senior notes and its available revolving credit facility. construction of the additional domestic smelter capacity will result in the elimination of export duties, providing an offset to the economic cost associated with the indonesia smelter projects.
noncontrolling interests net income attributable to noncontrolling interests is primarily associated with pt-fi, cerro verde and el abra and totaled $1.0 billion for the year 2022 (which represented 15% of our consolidated income before income taxes). as further described in note 3, in december 2018, we completed the transaction with the indonesia government regarding pt-fi's long-term mining rights and share ownership (the 2018 transaction). the arrangements related to the 2018
transaction provided for us and the other pre-transaction pt-fi shareholders to initially retain the economics of the revenue and cost sharing arrangements under the former unincorporated joint venture with rio tinto plc (rio tinto). as a result, our economic interest in pt-fi approximated 81% through 2022, and beginning january 1, 2023, is 48.76% (refer to note 3 for further discussion of attribution of pt-fi net income). therefore, beginning in
2023, net income attributable to noncontrolling interests will reflect the noncontrolling parties' 51.24% share of pt-fi net income. based on current sales volume and cost estimates and assuming average prices of $4.00 per pound of copper, $1,900 per ounce of gold and $20.00 per pound of molybdenum and taking into account the change in our economic interest in pt-fi, net income attributable to noncontrolling interests is estimated to approximate $2.3
billion for the year 2023 (which would represent 29% of our consolidated income before income taxes). the actual amount will depend on many factors, including relative performance of each business segment, commodity prices, costs and other factors.
markets world prices for copper, gold and molybdenum can fluctuate significantly. during the period from january 2013
through december 2022, the london metal exchange (lme) copper settlement price varied from a low of $1.96 per pound in 2016 to a record high of $4.87 per pound in 2022; the london bullion market association (london) pm gold price fluctuated from a low of $1,049 per ounce in 2015 to a record high of $2,067 per ounce in 2020, and the platts metals daily molybdenum dealer oxide weekly average price ranged from a low of $4.46 per pound in 2015 to a high of
$31.37 per pound in 2022. copper, gold and molybdenum prices are affected by numerous factors beyond our control as described further in item 1a. "risk factors" contained in part i of our annual report on form 10-k for the year ended december 31, 2022.

table of contents this graph presents lme copper settlement prices and the combined reported stocks of copper at the lme, commodity exchange inc., and the shanghai futures exchange from january 2013 through december 2022. for the year 2022, the lme copper settlement prices ranged from a high of $4.87 per pound in march (record high) to a low for the year of
$3.18 per pound in july, closed at $3.80 per pound on december 30, 2022, and averaged $3.99 per pound for the year.
current physical market conditions are strong as evidenced by low levels of global exchange stocks, and our global customer base reports continued healthy demand for copper. improved market sentiment beginning in late 2022 was associated with prospects for improved demand from china, rising demand from global decarbonization initiatives, supply constraints, united states (u.s.) dollar exchange rates and low inventories. despite near-term uncertainties in the global economy and potential volatility in the copper market, we believe the outlook for copper fundamentals in the medium- and long-term are favorable, with third-party studies indicating that demand for copper may double in 15 years as a result of global decarbonization trends. we believe substantial new mine supply development will be required to meet the goals of the global energy transition, and higher copper prices will be required to support new mine supply development. the lme copper settlement price was $4.12 per pound on january 31, 2023.
we believe long-term fundamentals for copper are favorable and that future demand will be supported by copper's role in the global transition to renewable power, electric vehicles and other carbon-reduction initiatives, and continued urbanization in developing countries. the small number of approved, large-scale projects beyond those that have been announced, the long lead times required to permit and build new mines and declining ore grades at existing operations continue to highlight the fundamental supply challenges for copper.

$1,800 per ounce and closed at $1,814 per ounce on december 29, 2022. gold prices were positively impacted at the end of 2022, by market views that the strength of the u.s. dollar will not be sustained. the london pm gold price was $1,924 per ounce on january 31, 2023.

30, 2022. higher molybdenum prices at the end of 2022 reflect tight supply and steady demand. the platts metals daily molybdenum dealer oxide weekly average price was $36.75 per pound on january 31, 2023.
critical accounting estimates md&a is based on our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles (gaap) in the u.s. the preparation of these statements requires that we make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. we base these estimates on historical experience and on assumptions that we consider reasonable under the circumstances;
however, reported results could differ from those based on the current estimates under different assumptions or conditions. the areas requiring the use of management's estimates are also discussed in note 1 under the subheading
"use of estimates." management has reviewed the following discussion of its development and selection of critical accounting estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors (the board).
taxes refer to note 11 and item 1a. "risk factors" contained in part i of our annual report on form 10-k for the year ended december 31, 2022, for further discussion of our consolidated income taxes.
in preparing our consolidated financial statements, we estimate the actual amount of income taxes currently payable or receivable as well as deferred income tax assets and liabilities attributable to temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases.
deferred income tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which these temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. the effect on deferred income tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates or laws is recognized in income in the period in which such changes are enacted.

table of contents our operations are in multiple jurisdictions where uncertainties arise in the application of complex tax regulations. some of these tax regimes are defined by contractual agreements with the local government, while others are defined by general tax laws and regulations. we and our subsidiaries are subject to reviews of our income tax filings and other tax payments, and disputes can arise with the taxing authorities over the interpretation of our contracts or laws. refer to note 11 for net charges recorded for historical contested tax matters in indonesia.
in august 2022, the act was signed into law, which had no impact on our 2022 financial results. the provisions of the act are applicable to us beginning january 1, 2023. additional guidance related to how the corporate alternative minimum tax (camt) provisions of the act will be applied or otherwise administered is yet to be released by the u.s. department of the treasury, and may differ from our interpretations. we will continue to analyze the impacts as additional guidance is available. we expect the camt provisions will impact our u.s. tax position, and may further limit our ability to benefit from our u.s. net operating losses (nols). refer to
"consolidated results" for further discussion of the act.
we operate in the u.s. and multiple international tax jurisdictions, and our income tax returns are subject to examination by tax authorities in those jurisdictions who may challenge any tax position on these returns.
uncertainty in a tax position may arise because tax laws are subject to interpretation. we use significant judgment to (1) determine whether, based on the technical merits, a tax position is more likely than not to be sustained and
(2) measure the amount of tax benefit that qualifies for recognition.
we have uncertain tax positions related to income tax assessments in indonesia and peru, including penalties and interest, which have not been recorded at december 31, 2022. final taxes paid may be dependent upon many factors, including negotiations with taxing authorities. in certain jurisdictions, we pay a portion of the disputed amount before formally appealing an assessment. such payment is recorded as a receivable if we believe the amount is collectible. refer to note 12 for further discussion.
a valuation allowance is provided for those deferred income tax assets for which the weight of available evidence suggests that the related benefits will not be realized. in determining the amount of the valuation allowance, we consider estimated future taxable income or loss as well as feasible tax planning strategies in each jurisdiction.
if we determine that we will not realize all or a portion of our deferred income tax assets, we will increase our valuation allowance. conversely, if we determine that we will ultimately be able to realize all or a portion of the related benefits for which a valuation allowance has been provided, all or a portion of the related valuation allowance will be reduced. our valuation allowances totaled $4.0 billion at december 31, 2022, which covered all of our u.s. foreign tax credits and u.s. federal nols, substantially all of our u.s. state nols, as well as a portion of our u.s. federal, state and foreign deferred tax assets and foreign nols. during 2022, valuation allowances decreased by $102 million.
environmental obligations refer to notes 1 and 12, and item 1a. "risk factors" contained in part i of our annual report on form 10-k for the year ended december 31, 2022, for further discussion of environmental obligations, including a summary of changes in our estimated environmental obligations for the three years ended december 31, 2022.
our current and historical operating activities are subject to various national, state and local environmental laws and regulations that govern the protection of the environment, and compliance with those laws requires significant expenditures. environmental expenditures are charged to expense or capitalized, depending upon their future economic benefits. the guidance provided by u.s. gaap requires that liabilities for contingencies be recorded when it is probable that obligations have been incurred, and the cost can be reasonably estimated. at december 31, 2022, environmental obligations recorded in our consolidated balance sheet totaled $1.7 billion, which reflect obligations for environmental liabilities attributed to the comprehensive environmental response, compensation, and liability act of 1980 (cercla) or analogous state programs and for estimated future costs associated with environmental matters.
accounting for environmental obligations represents a critical accounting estimate because (i) changes to environmental laws and regulations and/or circumstances affecting our operations could result in significant changes to our estimates, which could have a significant impact on our results of operations, (ii) we will not incur most of these costs for a number of years, requiring us to make estimates over a long period, (iii)
calculating the discounted cash flows for certain of our environmental obligations requires management to estimate the amounts and timing of projected cash flows and make long-term assumptions about inflation rates and (iv)
changes in
82
table of contents estimates used in determining our environmental obligations could have a significant impact on our results of operations.
we perform a comprehensive annual review of our environmental obligations and also review changes in facts and circumstances associated with these obligations at least quarterly. judgments and estimates are based upon currently available facts, existing technology, presently enacted laws and regulations, remediation experience, whether or not we are a potentially responsible party (prp), the ability of other prps to pay their allocated portions and take into consideration reasonably possible outcomes. our cost estimates can change substantially as additional information becomes available regarding the nature or extent of site contamination, updated cost assumptions (including increases and decreases to cost estimates), changes in the anticipated scope and timing of remediation activities, the settlement of environmental matters, required remediation methods and actions by or against governmental agencies or private parties.
asset retirement obligations refer to notes 1 and 12, and item 1a. "risk factors" contained in part i of our annual report on form 10-k for the year ended december 31, 2022, for further discussion of reclamation and closure costs, including a summary of changes in our asset retirement obligations (aros) for the three years ended december 31, 2022.
we record the fair value of our estimated aros associated with tangible long-lived assets in the period incurred.
fair value is measured as the present value of cash flow estimates after considering inflation and a market risk premium. our cost estimates are reflected on a third-party cost basis and comply with our legal obligation to retire tangible long-lived assets in the period incurred. these cost estimates may differ from financial assurance cost estimates for reclamation activities because of a variety of factors, including obtaining updated cost estimates for reclamation activities, the timing of reclamation activities, changes in scope and the exclusion of certain costs not considered reclamation and closure costs. at december 31, 2022, aros recorded in our consolidated balance sheet totaled $3.0 billion.
generally, aro activities are specified by regulations or in permits issued by the relevant governing authority, and management's judgment is required to estimate the extent and timing of expenditures. accounting for aros represents a critical accounting estimate because (i) we will not incur most of these costs for a number of years, requiring us to make estimates over a long period, (ii) reclamation and closure laws and regulations could change in the future and/or circumstances affecting our operations could change, either of which could result in significant changes to our current plans, (iii) our implementation of the global industry standard on tailings management, which could result in changes to our plans and the scope of work required (iv) the methods used or required to plug and abandon non-producing oil and gas wellbores, remove platforms, tanks, production equipment and flow lines, and restore the wellsite could change, (v) calculating the fair value of our aros requires management to estimate projected cash flows, make long-term assumptions about inflation rates, determine our credit-adjusted, risk-free interest rates and determine market risk premiums that are appropriate for our operations and (vi) given the magnitude of our estimated reclamation, mine closure and wellsite abandonment and restoration costs, changes in any or all of these estimates could have a significant impact on our results of operations.
mineral reserves refer to note 17, items 1. and 2. "business and properties" and item 1a. "risk factors" contained in part i of our annual report on form 10-k for the year ended december 31, 2022, for further information regarding, and risks associated with, our estimated recoverable proven and probable mineral reserves.
recoverable proven and probable mineral reserves were determined from the application of relevant modifying factors to geological data, in order to establish an operational, economically viable mine plan and have been prepared in accordance with the disclosure requirements of subpart 1300 of securities and exchange commission (sec) regulation s-k. the determination of mineral reserves involves numerous uncertainties with respect to the ultimate geology of the ore bodies, including quantities, grades and recoveries. estimating the quantity and grade of mineral reserves requires us to determine the size, shape and depth of our ore bodies by analyzing geological data, such as samplings of drill holes, tunnels and other underground workings. in addition to the geology of our mines, assumptions are required to determine the economic feasibility of mining these reserves, including estimates of future commodity prices and demand, the mining methods we use and the related costs incurred to develop and mine our mineral reserves. our estimates of recoverable proven and probable mineral reserves are prepared by and are the responsibility of our employees. these estimates are reviewed and verified regularly by independent experts in mining, geology and reserve determination.

table of contents our consolidated estimated recoverable proven and probable mineral reserves shown below were assessed using long-
term price assumptions of $3.00 per pound of copper, $1,500 per ounce of gold and $12 per pound of molybdenum at december 31, 2022, compared with long-term price assumptions of $2.50 per pound of copper, $1,200 per ounce of gold and $10 per pound of molybdenum at december 31, 2021. the following table summarizes changes in our estimated consolidated recoverable proven and probable copper, gold and molybdenum mineral reserves during 2022:

a. includes estimated recoverable metals contained in stockpiles. see below for additional discussion of recoverable copper in stockpiles.
b. primarily reflects the impact of a higher long-term price assumption for copper at december 31, 2022, compared with december 31, 2021.
as discussed in note 1, we depreciate our life-of-mine mining and milling assets and values assigned to proven and probable mineral reserves using the unit-of-production (uop) method based on our estimated recoverable proven and probable mineral reserves. because the economic assumptions used to estimate mineral reserves may change from period to period and additional geological data is generated during the course of operations, estimates of mineral reserves may change, which could have a significant impact on our results of operations, including changes to prospective depreciation rates and impairments of long-lived asset carrying values. based on projected copper sales volumes, if estimated copper reserves at our mines were 10% higher at december 31, 2022, we estimate that our annual depreciation, depletion and amortization (dd&a) expense for 2023 would decrease by approximately $106
million (approximately $39 million to net income attributable to common stock), and a 10% decrease in copper reserves would increase dd&a expense by approximately $130 million (approximately $47 million to net income attributable to common stock). we perform annual assessments of our existing assets in connection with the review of mine operating and development plans. if it is determined that assigned asset lives do not reflect the expected remaining period of benefit, any change could affect prospective dd&a rates.
as discussed below and in note 1, we review and evaluate our long-lived assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the related carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable, and changes to our estimates of recoverable proven and probable mineral reserves could have an impact on our assessment of asset recoverability.
recoverable copper in stockpiles refer to note 1 for further discussion of our accounting policy for recoverable copper in stockpiles and to note 4
and "consolidated results" for discussion of adjustments to stockpile inventory volumes.
we record, as inventory, applicable costs for copper contained in mill and leach stockpiles that are expected to be processed in the future based on proven processing technologies. mill and leach stockpiles are evaluated periodically to ensure that they are stated at the lower of weighted-average cost or net realizable value (nrv).
accounting for recoverable copper from mill and leach stockpiles represents a critical accounting estimate because
(i) it is impracticable to determine copper contained in mill and leach stockpiles by physical count, thus requiring management to employ reasonable estimation methods and (ii) recoveries from leach stockpiles can vary significantly.
at december 31, 2022, estimated consolidated recoverable copper was 1.8 billion pounds in leach stockpiles (with a carrying value of $2.2 billion) and 0.3 billion pounds in mill stockpiles (with a carrying value of $0.4 billion).
84
table of contents impairment of long-lived assets as discussed in note 1, we assess the carrying values of our long-lived mining assets when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the related carrying amounts of such assets may not be recoverable. in evaluating our long-lived mining assets for recoverability, we use estimates of pre-tax undiscounted future cash flows of our mines.
estimates of future cash flows are derived from current business plans, which are developed using near-term metal price forecasts reflective of the current price environment and management's projections for long-term average metal prices. in addition to near- and long-term metal price assumptions, other key assumptions include estimates of commodity-based and other input costs; proven and probable mineral reserves estimates, including the timing and cost to develop and produce the mineral reserves; value beyond proven and probable mineral reserve estimates; and the use of appropriate discount rates in the measurement of fair value. we believe our estimates and models used to determine fair value are similar to what a market participant would use. as quoted market prices are unavailable for our individual mining operations, fair value is determined through the use of after-tax discounted estimated future cash flows.
during the two-year period ended december 31, 2022, no material impairments of our long-lived mining assets were recorded.
in addition to decreases in future metal price assumptions, other events that could result in future impairment of our long-lived mining assets include, but are not limited to, decreases in estimated recoverable proven and probable mineral reserves and any event that might otherwise have a material adverse effect on mine site production levels or costs. refer to item 1a.

sales volumes . copper and gold sales volumes were higher in 2022, compared to 2021, primarily reflecting increased operating rates at the grasberg minerals district and cerro verde. refer to "operations" for further discussion of sales volumes at our mining operations.
realized prices . our consolidated revenues can vary significantly as a result of fluctuations in the market prices of copper, gold and molybdenum. in 2022, our average realized prices, compared with 2021, were 10% lower for copper, 1% lower for gold and 20% higher for molybdenum.
as discussed in "disclosures about market risks - commodity price risk," substantially all of our copper concentrate and cathode sales contracts provide final copper pricing in a specified future month (generally one to
86
table of contents four months from the shipment date). we record revenues and invoice customers at the time of shipment based on then-current lme prices, which results in an embedded derivative on provisionally priced concentrate and cathode sales that is adjusted to fair value through earnings each period, using the period-end forward prices, until final pricing on the date of settlement. to the extent final prices are higher or lower than what was recorded on a provisional basis, an increase or decrease to revenues is recorded each reporting period until the date of final pricing. accordingly, in times of rising copper prices, our revenues benefit from adjustments to the final pricing of provisionally priced sales pursuant to contracts entered into in prior periods; in times of falling copper prices, the opposite occurs.
consolidated revenues include net (unfavorable) favorable adjustments to current year provisionally priced copper sales ( i.e., provisionally priced sales during the years 2022 and 2021) totaling $(539) million for 2022 and $256
million for 2021. refer to note 14 for a summary of total adjustments to prior period and current period provisionally priced sales.
prior year provisionally priced copper sales . net favorable adjustments to prior years' provisionally priced copper sales ( i.e., provisionally priced copper sales at december 31, 2021 and 2020) recorded in consolidated revenues totaled $60 million in 2022 and $169 million in 2021. refer to "disclosures about market risks - commodity price risk" for further discussion of our provisionally priced copper sales, and to note 14 for a summary of total adjustments to prior period and current period provisionally priced copper sales.
purchased copper . lower revenues associated with purchased copper in 2022 compared to 2021, primarily reflects lower volumes and prices. we purchased copper cathode primarily for processing by our rod & refining operations, totaling 124 million pounds in 2022 and 173 million pounds in 2021.
atlantic copper revenues . lower atlantic copper revenues in 2022, compared with 2021, primarily reflect reduced operations as a result of a scheduled major maintenance turnaround resulting in a 78-day shutdown and lower copper prices.
treatment charges . revenues from our concentrate sales are recorded net of treatment charges ( i.e., fees paid to smelters that are generally negotiated annually), which will vary with the sales volumes and the price of copper.
the increase in the treatment charges during 2022 primarily reflects higher copper sales volumes.
royalties and export duties . royalties are primarily on pt-fi sales and vary with the volume of metal sold and the prices of copper and gold. in late 2022, pt-fi's export duty rate declined from 5% to 2.5% as a result of smelter development progress. higher royalties and export duties during 2022, compared to 2021, are primarily associated with increased copper and gold sales volumes, partly offset by the decline in metal prices. refer to "operations -
indonesia mining" for further discussion of the current progress on additional smelting capacity in indonesia and to note 13 for a summary of pt-fi's royalties and export duties.
production and delivery costs consolidated production and delivery costs totaled $13.0 billion in 2022, compared with $12.0 billion in 2021.
higher consolidated production and delivery costs in 2022 are primarily associated with significant inflationary cost pressures, principally associated with materials and supplies including sulfuric acid and explosives (41% of our site operating costs), labor (27% of our site operating costs) and energy prices (21% of our site operating costs). during 2022, prices for a number of commodity-related consumables increased at a time when copper prices declined. while prices for a number of commodity-related consumables have retreated from the highs of 2022, most cost elements remain high relative to long-term correlations.
consolidated production and delivery costs also includes net charges totaling $157 million in 2022, primarily associated with aro adjustments and an administrative fine at pt-fi; and $415 million in 2021, primarily associated with aro adjustments and other net charges at pt-fi and nonrecurring labor-related costs at cerro verde for collective labor agreements, partly offset by refunds of arizona transaction privilege taxes related to purchased electricity and favorable adjustments to prior-years' profit sharing at cerro verde. refer to note 16 for details of production and delivery costs by operating segment.
mining unit site production and delivery costs . site production and delivery costs for our copper mining operations primarily include labor, energy and commodity-based inputs, such as sulfuric acid, reagents, liners, tires and explosives. consolidated unit site production and delivery costs (before net noncash and other costs) for our copper mines averaged $2.19 per pound of copper in 2022 and $1.93 per pound in 2021. higher consolidated unit site
87
table of contents production and delivery costs in 2022, compared with 2021, primarily reflect higher energy prices and increased costs for consumables such as sulfuric acid, explosives, key equipment parts and other supplies and services. refer to "operations - unit net cash costs" for further discussion of unit net cash costs associated with our operating divisions, and to "product revenues and production costs" for reconciliations of per pound costs by operating division to production and delivery costs applicable to sales reported in our consolidated financial statements.
our copper mining operations require significant amounts of energy, principally diesel, electricity, coal and natural gas, most of which is obtained from third parties under long-term contracts. our take-or-pay contractual obligations for electricity totaled approximately $0.3 billion at december 31, 2022. we do not have take-or-pay contractual obligations for other energy commodities. energy represented approximately 21% of our copper mine site operating costs in 2022, including purchases of approximately 230 million gallons of diesel fuel; approximately
8,400 gigawatt hours of electricity at our north america and south america copper mining operations (we generate all of our power at our indonesia mining operation); approximately 820 thousand metric tons of coal for our coal power plant in indonesia; and approximately 1 million mmbtu (million british thermal units) of natural gas at certain of our north america mines. based on current cost estimates, energy will approximate 24% of our copper mine site operating costs for 2023.
depreciation, depletion and amortization depreciation will vary under the uop method as a result of changes in sales volumes and the related uop rates at our mining operations. consolidated dd&a totaled $2.0 billion in both 2022 and 2021.
metals inventory adjustments unfavorable metals inventory adjustments totaled $29 million in 2022 and $16 million in 2021. adjustments in 2022
reflect nrv inventory adjustments related to lower market prices for copper and higher costs at morenci and bagdad.
adjustments in 2022 also include $10 million for stockpile write-offs at cerro verde. adjustments in 2021 were primarily related to a leach stockpile adjustment at morenci.
environmental obligations and shutdown costs environmental obligation costs reflect net revisions to our long-term environmental obligations, which vary from period to period because of changes to environmental laws and regulations, the settlement of environmental matters and/or circumstances affecting our operations that could result in significant changes in our estimates (refer to
"critical accounting estimates - environmental obligations" for further discussion). shutdown costs include care-
and-maintenance costs and any litigation, remediation or related expenditures associated with closed facilities or operations.
net charges for environmental obligations and shutdown costs totaled $121 million in 2022, including $44 million for a proposed settlement related to historical environmental litigation and $22 million in net unfavorable adjustments to environmental obligations. net charges for the year 2021 totaled $91 million, including net unfavorable adjustments to environmental obligations totaling $41 million. refer to note 12 for further discussion of environmental obligations and litigation matters.
net gain on sales of assets net gain on sales of assets totaled $2 million in 2022 and $80 million in 2021. gains on sales of assets in 2021
were primarily associated with the sale of our remaining freeport cobalt assets and the sale of carbon dioxide emissions credits at atlantic copper. refer to note 2 for further discussion of dispositions.
net gain on early extinguishment of debt net gain on early extinguishment of debt totaled $31 million in 2022, consisting primarily of $44 million associated with senior note purchases, partly offset by a charge of $10 million associated with the repayment of the pt-fi term loan. refer to note 8 for further discussion.
interest expense, net consolidated interest costs (before capitalization) totaled $710 million in 2022 and $674 million in 2021. higher interest costs (before capitalization) in 2022, compared with 2021, primarily reflects additional interest costs associated with pt-fi senior notes sold in april 2022, partly offset by lower interest costs associated with the repayment and purchase of certain fcx senior notes. refer to note 8 for further discussion.
88
table of contents capitalized interest varies with the level of expenditures for our development projects and average interest rates on our borrowings and totaled $150 million in 2022 and $72 million in 2021. the increase in capitalized interest in
2022, compared with 2021, is primarily associated with development activities related to indonesia smelter projects. refer to "operations" and "capital resources and liquidity - investing activities" for further discussion of current development projects.
other income (expense), net other income (expense), net, totaled $207 million in 2022 and $(105) million in 2021. the year 2022 primarily includes interest income totaling $136 million and credits totaling $76 million associated with favorable adjustments to penalties on historical contested tax matters. the year 2021 primarily includes charges totaling
$208 million associated with historical contested tax matters at pt-fi, partly offset by gains on currency exchange rate movements and other net credits. refer to note 11 for discussion of historical tax matters.

in august 2022, the act was signed into law, which includes, among other provisions, a new camt of 15% on the adjusted financial statement income (afsi) of corporations with average afsi exceeding $1.0 billion over a three-
year period, and a new excise tax of 1% on the fair market value of net corporate stock repurchases. the act had no impact on our consolidated financial statements for the year ended december 31, 2022. the provisions of the act are applicable to us beginning january 1, 2023. additional guidance related to how the camt provisions of the act will be applied or otherwise administered is yet to be released by the u.s. department of the treasury, and may differ from our interpretations. we will continue to analyze the impacts as additional guidance is available. we expect the camt provisions will impact our u.s. tax position, and may further limit our ability to benefit from our u.s.
nols.
assuming achievement of current sales volume and cost estimates and average prices of $4.00 per pound for copper,
$1,900 per ounce for gold and $20.00 per pound for molybdenum for 2023, we estimate our consolidated effective tax rate for the year 2023 would approximate 33%. changes in projected sales volumes and average prices during 2023
would incur tax impacts at estimated effective rates of 39% for peru, 38% for indonesia and 0% for the u.s., which excludes any potential impact from the act. our projected estimated effective tax rate of 0% for the u.s. for the year 2023 may be adjusted as additional guidance is released by the u.s. department of the treasury on key provisions of the act, including guidance on the camt.

operations responsible production the copper mark . we are committed to maintaining the validation of all of our copper producing sites with the copper mark, a comprehensive assurance framework designed to demonstrate the copper industry's responsible production practices. to achieve the copper mark, each site is required to complete an external assurance process to assess conformance with 32 environmental, social and governance (esg) requirements. in february 2023, pt-fi was awarded the copper mark and we have now achieved the copper mark at all 12 of our eligible copper producing sites globally.
in fourth-quarter 2022, the copper mark announced an extension of its framework to include molybdenum producers, among other metal producers. in february 2023, our climax and henderson molybdenum mines were awarded the molybdenum mark, making fcx the first molybdenum miner to achieve this distinction. our four copper mines that produce byproduct molybdenum (bagdad, cerro verde, morenci and sierrita) have also been awarded the molybdenum mark.
icmm . we are a founding member of the international council on mining & metals (icmm), an organization dedicated to a safe, fair and sustainable mining and metals industry, aiming continuously to strengthen esg performance across the global mining and metals industry. as a member company, we are required to implement the 10 mining principles that define good esg practices, and associated position statements, while also meeting 39 performance expectations and producing an externally verified sustainability report in accordance with the global reporting initiative sustainability reporting standards subject to the icmm assurance & validation procedure.
2021 annual report on sustainability . in april 2022, we published our 2021 annual report on sustainability, which is available on our website at fcx.com/sustainability. we have a long history of esg programs, and we are focused on leading as a responsible copper producer. refer to item 1a. "risk factors" contained in part i of our annual report on form 10-k for the year ended december 31, 2022, for discussion of esg-related risks.
2021 climate report . in september 2022, we published our updated climate report which details our ongoing initiatives to reduce our greenhouse gas (ghg) emissions, improve energy efficiency, evaluate and integrate the use of lower carbon and renewable energy sources and enhance our resilience to future climate-related risks. we continue to advance ghg emissions reduction initiatives across our global operations and established our 2030 ghg reduction targets that collectively cover nearly 100% of our scope 1 and 2 ghg emissions. refer to item 1a. "risk factors" contained in part i of our annual report on form 10-k for the year ended december 31, 2022, for further discussion of climate-related risks.
leaching innovation initiatives we are advancing efforts to improve copper recovery from our leach processes, including initiatives across our north america and south america operations to incorporate new applications, technologies and data analytics. we believe these leach innovation initiatives provide potential opportunities to produce incremental copper from our large existing leach stockpiles and lower-grade material currently classified as waste. initial results support the potential for incremental low-cost additions to our production and reserve profile and we have identified opportunities to achieve an annual run rate of 200 million pounds of copper per year through these initiatives by the end of 2023.
feasibility and optimization studies we are engaged in various studies associated with potential future expansion projects primarily at our mining operations. the costs for these studies are charged to production and delivery costs as incurred and totaled $141
million for 2022 and $59 million for 2021. we estimate the costs of these studies will approximate $200 million for the year 2023 (including approximately $70 million in first-quarter 2023).
north america copper mines we operate seven open-pit copper mines in north america - morenci, bagdad, safford (including lone star), sierrita and miami in arizona, and chino and tyrone in new mexico. all of the north america mining operations are wholly owned, except for morenci. we record our 72% undivided joint venture interest in morenci using the proportionate consolidation method.
90
table of contents the north america copper mines include open-pit mining, sulfide-ore concentrating, leaching and solution extraction/electrowinning (sx/ew) operations. a majority of the copper produced at our north america copper mines is cast into copper rod by our rod & refining segment. the remainder of our north america copper production is sold as copper cathode or copper concentrate, a portion of which is shipped to atlantic copper (our wholly owned smelter). molybdenum concentrate, gold and silver are also produced by certain of our north america copper mines .
operating and development activities . we have substantial reserves and future opportunities in the u.s., primarily associated with existing mining operations.
following our response to the covid-19 pandemic in early 2020, we began ramping up mining rates at the north america mines during 2021, which continued into 2022. however, a tight labor market and increased competition from other employers in north america represent strategic challenges that are impacting our ability to further expand current mining rates.
lone star, at our safford mine, is increasing its operating rates to achieve targeted production of approximately
300 million pounds of copper per year from oxide ores in 2023 (compared with the initial design capacity of 200
million pounds of copper per year). the oxide project at lone star advances the opportunity for development of the underlying, large-scale sulfide resources. we are conducting follow-on exploration in the area to support metallurgical testing and mine development planning for a potential significant long-term investment to build additional scale on an economically attractive basis.
we are planning an expansion to double the concentrator capacity of the bagdad operation in northwest arizona. we are engaging stakeholders and conducting a feasibility study, which is expected to be completed in 2023. we are advancing plans for expanded tailings infrastructure projects to support bagdad's long-range plans. the timing of future development will be dependent on market conditions, labor and supply chain considerations and other economic factors.

our north america copper mines have varying cost structures because of differences in ore grades and characteristics, processing costs, by-product credits and other factors. during 2022, our mining operations experienced significant cost inflation, principally associated with higher energy, labor, maintenance and supplies, explosives and sulfuric acid, resulting in higher average unit net cash costs (net of by-product credits) for the north america copper mines of $2.35 per pound of copper in 2022, compared with $1.89 per pound of copper in 2021.
however, average unit net cash costs for our north america copper mines in 2022, compared with 2021, benefited from higher sales volumes.
because certain assets are depreciated on a straight-line basis, north america's average unit depreciation rate may vary with asset additions and the level of copper production and sales.
revenue adjustments primarily result from changes in prices on provisionally priced copper sales recognized in prior periods. refer to "consolidated results - revenues" for further discussion of adjustments to prior period provisionally priced copper sales.

table of contents average unit net cash costs (net of by-product credits) for our north america copper mines are expected to approximate $2.45 per pound of copper in 2023, based on achievement of current sales volume and cost estimates and assuming an average molybdenum price of $20.00 per pound. north america's expected average unit net cash costs for the year 2023 would change by approximately $0.03 per pound for each $2 per pound change in the average price of molybdenum.
south america mining we operate two copper mines in south america - cerro verde in peru (in which we own a 53.56% interest) and el abra in chile (in which we own a 51.0% interest), which are consolidated in our financial statements.
south america mining includes open-pit mining, sulfide-ore concentrating, leaching and sx/ew operations. production from our south america mines is sold as copper concentrate or cathode under long-term contracts. our south america mines also sell a portion of their copper concentrate production to atlantic copper. in addition to copper, the cerro verde mine produces molybdenum concentrate and silver.
beginning in late 2022, heightened tensions, protests and social unrest emerged in peru following a change in the country's political leadership. demonstrations have continued in early 2023, and the civil unrest continues to disrupt commerce and supply chains in peru. to date, there has been a limited impact on cerro verde's operations.
we continue to monitor the situation while prioritizing safety and security. a prolonged disruption of logistics and supply chains could impact future operations.
operating and development activities . increased operating rates at cerro verde and higher mining and stacking activities at el abra resulted in a 12% increase in copper production from south america mining for the year 2022, compared with the year 2021 (which was impacted by covid-19 protocols).
el abra's large sulfide resource supports a potential major mill project similar to the large-scale concentrator constructed at cerro verde in 2015. technical and economic studies continue to be evaluated to determine the optimal scope and timing for the sulfide project. we are advancing plans to invest in water infrastructure to provide options to extend existing operations, while continuing to monitor potential changes in chile's regulatory and fiscal matters. we will defer major investment decisions pending clarity on such matters.

a. includes charges totaling $0.09 per pound of copper associated with nonrecurring labor-related costs at cerro verde.
our south america mines have varying cost structures because of differences in ore grades and characteristics, processing costs, by-product credits and other factors. during 2022, our mining operations experienced significant cost inflation, principally associated with higher energy, sulfuric acid, explosives and other input costs, resulting in higher average unit net cash costs (net of by-product credits) for south america mining of $2.34 per pound of copper in 2022, compared with $2.05 per pound of copper in 2021. however, average unit net cash costs for south america mining in 2022, compared with 2021, benefited from higher sales volumes.
revenues from cerro verde's concentrate sales are recorded net of treatment charges, which will vary with cerro verde's sales volumes and the price of copper.
because certain assets are depreciated on a straight-line basis, south america's unit depreciation rate may vary with asset additions and the level of copper production and sales.

indonesia mining pt-fi operates one of the world's largest copper and gold mines at the grasberg minerals district in central papua, indonesia. pt-fi produces copper concentrate that contains significant quantities of gold and silver. we have a
48.76% ownership interest in pt-fi and manage its mining operations. pt-fi's results are consolidated in our financial statements.
as discussed in note 3, under the terms of the divestment agreement and related documents entered into in 2018, our economic interest in pt-fi approximated 81% through 2022, and beginning january 1, 2023, our economic interest in pt-fi is 48.76%. this arrangement was developed to replicate the economics of pt-fi's former joint venture partner interests, which were acquired by the indonesia government in 2018.
substantially all of pt-fi's copper concentrate is sold under long-term contracts. during 2022, 34% of pt-fi's copper concentrate was sold to pt smelting (pt-fi's 39.5% owned copper smelter and refinery in gresik, indonesia).
see "smelting and refining" below for a discussion of pt-fi's tolling arrangement with pt smelting that commenced in 2023.
operating and development activities . pt-fi currently has three underground operating mines in the grasberg minerals district: grasberg block cave, deep mill level zone (dmlz) and big gossan.
pt-fi's milling rates for ore extracted from its underground mines averaged 192,600 metric tons of ore per day in
2022. the installation of additional milling facilities at pt-fi is currently expected to be completed in late
2023, which would increase milling capacity to approximately 240,000 metric tons of ore per day to provide for continued annualized copper and gold production volumes of approximately 1.6 billion pounds of copper and 1.6
million ounces of gold. pt-fi is also advancing a mill recovery project with the installation of a new copper cleaner circuit that is expected to be completed in 2024, which is expected to provide incremental metal production of approximately 60 million pounds of copper and 40 thousand ounces of gold per year.
kucing liar . long-term mine development activities are ongoing for pt-fi's kucing liar deposit in the grasberg minerals district, which is expected to produce over 6 billion pounds of copper and 6 million ounces of gold between 2028 and the end of 2041. pre-production development activities commenced in 2022 and are expected to continue over an approximate 10-year timeframe. capital investments are estimated to average approximately $400
million per year over this period (including approximately $470 million for the year 2023). at full operating rates of approximately 90,000 metric tons of ore per day, annual production from kucing liar is expected to approximate
550 million pounds of copper and 560 thousand ounces of gold, providing pt-fi with sustained long-term, large-scale and low-cost production. kucing liar will benefit from substantial shared infrastructure and pt-fi's experience and long-term success in block-cave mining.
indonesia smelter . in connection with pt-fi's 2018 agreement with the indonesia government to secure the extension of its long-term mining rights, pt-fi committed to construct additional domestic smelting capacity totaling 2
million dry metric tons of concentrate per year by the end of 2023 (subject to force majeure provisions). in accordance with indonesia regulations, pt-fi submits a smelter progress report to the indonesia government for review every six months (refer to note 12).
pt-fi is actively engaging in the following projects for additional domestic smelting capacity:
• construction of a greenfield smelter in gresik, indonesia with a capacity to process approximately 1.7 million metric tons of copper concentrate per year. at december 31, 2022, smelter construction was approximately 50%
complete. the facility is expected to be commissioned during 2024 at an estimated cost of $3.0 billion, including
$2.8 billion for a construction contract (excluding capitalized interest, owner's costs and commissioning) and $0.2
billion for investment in a desalinization plant.
• expansion of pt smelting's capacity by 30% to 1.3 million metric tons of copper concentrate per year, which is expected to be completed by the end of 2023. pt-fi is funding the cost of the expansion, estimated to approximate
$250 million, with a loan that will convert to equity, increasing pt-fi's ownership in pt smelting upon project completion (refer to note 3).
95

• construction of a pmr to process gold and silver from the greenfield smelter and pt smelting at an estimated cost of $400 million. construction is in progress with commissioning expected during 2024.
capital expenditures for the indonesia smelter projects totaled $0.8 billion for the year 2022 and are expected to approximate $1.8 billion for the year 2023. capital expenditures for the indonesia smelter projects are being funded with proceeds received from pt-fi's april 2022 senior notes offering and availability under its revolving credit facility.
construction of the additional domestic smelter capacity will result in the elimination of export duties, which mitigates the economic cost associated with the indonesia smelter projects. in late 2022, pt-fi received approval, based on construction progress achieved, for a reduction in export duties from 5% to 2.5%. upon receiving verification and approval from the indonesia government that construction progress has exceeded 50%, pt-fi expects export duties to be eliminated.
indonesia regulations require pt-fi to renew its export license annually, subject to review by the indonesia government every six months, depending on, among other things, greenfield smelter construction progress. the current license is scheduled for renewal in march 2023 and pt-fi is preparing its renewal application. pt-fi's special mining license (iupk) provides that exports continue through 2023, subject to force majeure considerations.
pt-fi plans to work cooperatively with the indonesia government to continue exports beyond 2023 as required until the smelter is fully commissioned. refer to note 12 and item 1a. "risk factors" contained in part i of our annual report on form 10-k for the year ended december 31, 2022, for further discussion of risks associated with pt-fi's export of copper concentrate.
mining rights . pt-fi and the indonesia government continue to engage in preliminary discussions regarding the extension of pt-fi's mining rights under its iupk beyond 2041. pt-fi believes an extension beyond 2041 would enable continuity of operations and the identification of additional resource development opportunities in the grasberg minerals district. refer to item 1a. "risk factors" contained in part i of our annual report on form 10-k for the year ended december 31, 2022, for further discussion of risks associated with pt-fi's iupk.

a. includes charges associated with aro adjustments totaling $0.07 per pound of copper in 2022 and $0.26 per pound of copper in 2021.
a significant portion of pt-fi's costs are fixed and unit costs vary depending on volumes and other factors. pt-
fi's unit net cash costs (including gold and silver credits) of $0.09 per pound of copper in 2022, were lower than unit net cash costs of $0.19 per pound of copper in 2021, primarily reflecting higher copper and gold sales volumes, partly offset by higher energy costs and the impact of increased operating rates.
treatment charges vary with the volume of metals sold and the price of copper, and royalties vary with the volume of metals sold and the prices of copper and gold.
97
table of contents pt-fi's export duties totaled $307 million in 2022 and $218 million in 2021, and pt-fi's royalties totaled $357
million in 2022 and $319 million in 2021. the increase in export duties and royalties in 2022, compared with 2021, primarily reflects higher sales volumes. as noted above, in late 2022, pt-fi's export duty rate declined from 5% to
2.5%. refer to note 13 for further discussion of pt-fi's export duties and royalties.
because certain assets are depreciated on a straight-line basis, pt-fi's unit depreciation rate may vary with asset additions and the level of copper production and sales. the decrease in the dd&a rate per pound of copper in 2022, compared with 2021, primarily reflects higher volumes associated with increased operating rates and the depletion of the doz underground mine during 2021, partly offset by significant underground development assets being placed into service.
revenue adjustments primarily result from changes in prices on provisionally priced copper sales recognized in prior periods. refer to "consolidated results - revenues" for further discussion of adjustments to prior period provisionally priced copper sales.
pt smelting intercompany profit (loss) represents the change in the deferral of 39.5% of pt-fi's profit on sales to pt smelting. refer to "smelting and refining" below for further discussion.
assuming an average gold price of $1,900 per ounce for 2023 and achievement of current sales volume and cost estimates, unit net cash costs (including gold and silver credits) for pt-fi are expected to approximate $0.22 per pound of copper in 2023. pt-fi's expected average unit net cash costs for the year 2023 would change by approximately $0.10 per pound of copper for each $100 per ounce change in the average price of gold.
pt-fi's projected sales volumes and unit net cash costs for the year 2023 are dependent on a number of factors, including operational performance, weather-related conditions, timing of shipments and the indonesia government's extension of pt-fi's export permit. refer to "cautionary statement" below and item 1a. "risk factors" contained in part i of our annual report on form 10-k for the year ended december 31, 2022, for further discussion of factors that could cause results to differ materially from projections, including the february 2023 weather event at pt-
fi's operations.
molybdenum mines we have two wholly owned molybdenum mines in colorado - the henderson underground mine and the climax open-pit mine. the henderson and climax mines produce high-purity, chemical-grade molybdenum concentrate, which is typically further processed into value-added molybdenum chemical products. the majority of the molybdenum concentrate produced at the henderson and climax mines, as well as from our north america and south america copper mines, is processed at our own conversion facilities.
operating and development activities . production from the molybdenum mines totaled 33 million pounds of molybdenum in 2022 and 30 million pounds in 2021. refer to "consolidated results" for our consolidated molybdenum operating data, which includes sales of molybdenum produced at our molybdenum mines and from our north america and south america copper mines. refer to "outlook" for projected consolidated molybdenum sales volumes.
unit net cash costs per pound of molybdenum . unit net cash costs per pound of molybdenum is a measure intended to provide investors with information about the cash-generating capacity of our mining operations expressed on a basis relating to the primary metal product for our respective operations. we use this measure for the same purpose and for monitoring operating performance by our mining operations. this information differs from measures of performance determined in accordance with u.s. gaap and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of performance determined in accordance with u.s. gaap. this measure is presented by other metals mining companies, although our measure may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies.
average unit net cash costs for our molybdenum mines of $11.43 per pound of molybdenum in 2022 were higher than
$8.87 per pound of molybdenum in 2021, primarily reflecting increased contract labor and higher energy and other input costs, partly offset by higher molybdenum production. based on current sales volume and cost estimates, average unit net cash costs for the molybdenum mines are expected to approximate $13.80 per pound of molybdenum in
2023.

table of contents refer to "product revenues and production costs" for a reconciliation of unit net cash costs per pound to production and delivery costs applicable to sales reported in our consolidated financial statements.
smelting & refining we wholly own and operate the miami smelter in arizona, the el paso refinery in texas and atlantic copper, a smelter and refinery in spain. additionally, pt-fi has a 39.5% ownership interest in pt smelting (refer to note 3).
treatment charges for smelting and refining copper concentrate consist of a base rate per pound of copper and per ounce of gold and are generally fixed. treatment charges represent a cost to our mining operations and income to atlantic copper. thus, higher treatment charges benefit the smelter operations and adversely affect our mining operations. our north america copper mines are less significantly affected by changes in treatment charges because these operations are largely integrated with our miami smelter and el paso refinery. through this form of downstream integration, we are able to assure placement of a significant portion of our concentrate production.
miami smelter . in 2021, our miami smelter completed a major maintenance turnaround and incurred maintenance charges and idle facility costs totaling $87 million. major maintenance turnarounds are anticipated to occur approximately every two or three years for the miami smelter. the next major maintenance turnaround is scheduled for the last half of 2024.
atlantic copper . atlantic copper smelts and refines copper concentrate and markets refined copper and precious metals in slimes. following is an allocation of atlantic copper's concentrate purchases from unaffiliated third parties and our copper mining operations for the years ended december 31:

in 2022, atlantic copper completed a 78-day major maintenance turnaround and incurred maintenance charges and idle facility costs totaling $41 million. atlantic copper's major maintenance turnarounds typically occur approximately every eight years, with shorter-term maintenance turnarounds in the interim.
at december 31, 2022, atlantic copper had take-or-pay contractual obligations for the procurement of copper concentrate totaling $3.6 billion, which provide for deliveries of specified volumes at market-based prices.
pt smelting . prior to 2023, pt-fi's contract with pt smelting provided for pt-fi to supply 100% of the copper concentrate requirements (subject to a minimum or maximum treatment charge rate) necessary for pt smelting to produce 205,000 metric tons of copper annually on a priority basis. pt-fi could also then sell copper concentrate to pt smelting at market rates for quantities in excess of 205,000 metric tons of copper annually.
beginning in 2023, pt-fi's commercial arrangement with pt smelting converted to a tolling arrangement. under the arrangement, pt-fi pays pt smelting a tolling fee to smelt and refine its concentrate and will retain title of all products for sale to third parties. this arrangement is not expected to result in a significant change in pt-fi's economics but will impact the timing of pt-fi's sales during 2023. we estimate that approximately 90 million pounds of copper and 120 thousand ounces of gold from pt-fi's first-quarter 2023 production will remain in inventory until final sale later in 2023.
pt smelting received a one-year extension of its anode slimes export license, which currently expires november 3,
2023. refer to item 1a. "risk factors" contained in part i of our annual report on form 10-k for the year ended december 31, 2022, for further discussion of risks associated with pt smelting's export of anode slimes.
pt smelting's maintenance turnarounds (which range from two weeks to a month to complete) typically are expected to occur approximately every two years, with short-term maintenance turnarounds in the interim. pt smelting completed a 30-day maintenance turnaround during december 2020 and an 18-day maintenance turnaround in october 2022. pt smelting has a planned 75-day shutdown scheduled for mid-2023 associated with its expansion project and a 7-day shutdown scheduled in fourth-quarter 2023 to complete final tie-in of the expansion project.
99
table of contents we defer recognizing profits on sales from our mining operations to atlantic copper and on 39.5% of pt-fi's sales to pt smelting until final sales to third parties occur. changes in these deferrals attributable to variability in intercompany volumes resulted in net additions (reductions) to operating income totaling $52 million ($33 million to net income attributable to common stock) in 2022 and $(188) million ($(106) million to net income attributable to common stock) in 2021. our net deferred profits on our inventories at atlantic copper and pt smelting to be recognized in future periods' operating income totaled $250 million at december 31, 2022. quarterly variations in ore grades, the timing of intercompany shipments and changes in product prices will result in variability in our net deferred profits and quarterly earnings. as noted above, beginning in 2023, pt-fi's commercial arrangement with pt smelting converted to a tolling arrangement. under the arrangement, pt-fi pays pt smelting a tolling fee to smelt and refine its concentrate and will retain title to all products for sale to third parties ( i.e., there are no further sales from pt-fi to pt smelting).
capital resources and liquidity our consolidated operating cash flows vary with sales volumes; prices realized from copper, gold and molybdenum sales; production costs; income taxes; other working capital changes; and other factors. see "consolidated results"
and item 1a. "risk factors" contained in part i of our annual report on form 10-k for the year ended december 31,
2022, for further discussion of our energy requirements and related costs.
we believe the actions we have taken in recent years to build a solid balance sheet, successfully expand low-cost operations and maintain flexible organic growth options while maintaining sufficient liquidity, will allow us to continue to execute our business plans in a prudent manner during periods of economic uncertainty while preserving substantial future asset values. we closely monitor market conditions and will adjust our operating plans to protect liquidity and preserve our asset values, if necessary. we expect to maintain a solid balance sheet and strong liquidity position as we focus on building long-term value in our business, executing our operating plans safely, responsibly and efficiently, and prudently managing costs and capital expenditures.
based on current sales volume, cost and metal price estimates discussed in "outlook", our available cash and cash equivalents plus our projected consolidated operating cash flows of $7.2 billion for the year 2023 exceed our expected consolidated capital expenditures of $5.2 billion (which includes $1.8 billion for the indonesia smelter projects that are being funded with proceeds from pt-fi's senior notes and its available credit facility).
we have cash on hand and the financial flexibility to fund capital expenditures and our other cash requirements for the year, including noncontrolling interest distributions, income tax payments, debt repayments, current common stock dividends (base and variable) and any share repurchases. at december 31, 2022, we had $8.1 billion of consolidated cash and cash equivalents (which includes $1.8 billion of cash for indonesia smelter projects). in october 2022, we entered into a $3.0 billion, five-year, fully available unsecured revolving credit facility that replaced our prior revolving credit facility and pt-fi and cerro verde have $1.3 billion and $350 million, respectively, of availability under their revolving credit facilities. refer to "outlook" for further discussion of projected operating cash flows and capital expenditures for 2023 and to "debt" below and note 8 for further discussion.
financial policy . our financial policy is aligned with our strategic objectives of maintaining a solid balance sheet and increasing cash returns to shareholders while advancing opportunities for future growth. the policy includes a base dividend and a performance-based payout framework, whereby up to 50% of available cash flows generated after planned capital spending and distributions to noncontrolling interest would be allocated to shareholder returns and the balance to debt reduction and investments in value enhancing growth projects, subject to us maintaining our net debt at a level not to exceed the net debt target of $3.0 billion to $4.0 billion
(excluding project net debt for additional smelting capacity in indonesia). the board will review the structure of the performance-based payout framework at least annually.
at december 31, 2022, our net debt, excluding net debt for the indonesia smelter projects, totaled $1.3 billion.
refer to "net debt" for further discussion.
in december 2022, our board declared cash dividends totaling $0.15 per share on our common stock (including a
$0.075 per share quarterly base cash dividend and a $0.075 per share quarterly variable, performance-based cash dividend), which was paid on february 1, 2023, to shareholders of record as of january 13, 2023. based on current market conditions, the base and variable dividends on our common stock are anticipated to total $0.60 per share for
2023 (including the dividends paid on february 1, 2023), comprised of a $0.30 per share base dividend and $0.30 per share variable dividend. the declaration and payment of dividends (base or variable) is at the discretion of our
100
table of contents board and will depend on our financial results, cash requirements, global economic conditions and other factors deemed relevant by our board.
refer to item 1a. "risk factors" contained in part i of our annual report on form 10-k for the year ended december

cash held at our international operations is generally used to support our foreign operations' capital expenditures, operating expenses, debt repayments, working capital or other cash needs. management believes that sufficient liquidity is available in the u.s. from cash balances and availability from our revolving credit facility. we have not elected to permanently reinvest earnings from our foreign subsidiaries, and we have recorded deferred tax liabilities for foreign earnings that are available to be repatriated to the u.s. from time to time, our foreign subsidiaries distribute earnings to the u.s. through dividends that are subject to applicable withholding taxes and noncontrolling interests' share. see item 1a. "risk factors" contained in part i of our annual report on form 10-k for the year ended december 31, 2022, for further discussion of our holding company structure and the potential impact of changes in tax laws.
debt at december 31, 2022, consolidated debt totaled $10.6 billion (including $1.0 billion of 3.875% senior notes maturing in march 2023, which we expect to pay using cash on hand), with a related weighted-average interest rate of 5.0%. substantially all of our outstanding debt is fixed rate. we had no borrowings and $8 million in letters of credit issued under our $3.0 billion revolving credit facility. additionally, no amounts were drawn under pt-fi's
$1.3 billion revolving credit facility or cerro verde's $350 million revolving credit facility.
refer to note 8 for further discussion of the above items and for information regarding our debt arrangements.
operating activities we generated consolidated operating cash flows of $5.1 billion in 2022 (net of $1.5 billion from working capital and other uses) and $7.7 billion in 2021 (including $0.8 billion from working capital and other sources).
lower operating cash flows for 2022, compared with 2021, primarily reflect the timing of tax payments at our international operations and lower copper prices, partly offset by higher copper and gold sales volumes, and other working capital changes.
investing activities capital expenditures . capital expenditures, including capitalized interest, totaled $3.5 billion for the year
2022, including $1.7 billion for major mining projects primarily associated with the underground development activities in the grasberg minerals district and $0.8 billion for the indonesia smelter projects.
capital expenditures, including capitalized interest, totaled $2.1 billion for the year 2021, including $1.25
billion for major projects primarily associated with underground development activities in the grasberg minerals district.
a large portion of the capital expenditures relate to projects that are expected to add significant production and cash flow in future periods, enabling us to continue to generate operating cash flows exceeding capital expenditures in future years. refer to "outlook" for further discussion of projected capital expenditures for 2023.

table of contents proceed from sales of assets . in september 2021, we completed the sale of our remaining freeport cobalt assets to jervois global limited (jervois) for $208 million, including net cash proceeds of $150 million and shares of jervois. in may 2022, we sold all our shares in jervois for proceeds of $60 million. refer to note 2 for further discussion.
loans to pt smelting for expansion . pt-fi made loans to pt smelting totaling $65 million in 2022 and $36 million in 2021 to fund pt smelting's expansion project. refer to note 3 and "operations - indonesia mining" for further discussion.
acquisition of minority interest in pt smelting . on april 30, 2021, pt-fi acquired 14.5% of the outstanding common stock of pt smelting for $33 million, increasing its ownership interest from 25.0% to 39.5%. refer to note 2 for further discussion.
financing activities debt transactions . net borrowings of debt totaled $1.2 billion in 2022 and net repayments of debt totaled $0.3
billion in 2021. net borrowings for 2022 included pt-fi's $3.0 billion senior notes offering that was completed in april 2022, partly offset by the purchases of our senior notes in open market transactions ($1.0 billion), and the repayment of borrowings under pt-fi's term loan ($0.6 billion) and cerro verde's term loan ($0.3 billion).
net repayments of debt totaled $0.3 billion in 2021, primarily reflecting the redemption of $0.5 billion of senior notes and repayments of $0.2 billion under cerro verde's term loan, partly offset by borrowings under the pt-fi term loan ($0.4 billion).
refer to note 8 for further discussion.
cash dividends on common stock . we paid cash dividends on our common stock totaling $0.9 billion in 2022 and $0.3
billion in 2021. the increase in cash dividends in 2022 relates to the quarterly variable, performance-based cash dividend paid on our common stock. the declaration and payment of dividends (base or variable) is at the discretion of our board and will depend on our financial results, cash requirements, global economic conditions and other factors deemed relevant by our board. refer to item 1a. "risk factors" contained in part i of our annual report on form 10-k for the year ended december 31, 2022, "cautionary statement" below.
cash dividends and distributions paid to noncontrolling interests . cash dividends and distributions paid to noncontrolling interests at our international operations totaled $0.8 billion in 2022 and $0.6 billion in 2021.
based on the current sales volume, cost estimates and assumed average prices in 2023 discussed in "outlook," and the change in fcx's economic interest in pt-fi (refer to note 3), we currently expect cash dividends and distributions paid to noncontrolling interests to exceed $1.8 billion in 2023. cash dividends and distributions to noncontrolling interests vary based on the operating results and cash requirements of our consolidated subsidiaries.
treasury stock purchases . in july 2022, the board authorized an increase in the share repurchase program up to
$5.0 billion. we have acquired 47.86 million shares of our common stock for a total cost of $1.8 billion ($38.35
average cost per share), including 35.12 million shares for a total cost of $1.3 billion ($38.36 cost per share)
during 2022 and 12.74 million shares for a total cost of $0.5 billion ($38.32 cost per share) in 2021.
as of february 15, 2023, $3.2 billion remains available under the share repurchase program. the timing and amount of share repurchases is at the discretion of management and will depend on a variety of factors. the share repurchase program may be modified, increased, suspended or terminated at any time at the board's discretion. refer to item 1a. "risk factors" contained in part i of our annual report on form 10-k for the year ended december 31,
2022, "cautionary statement" below and discussion of our financial policy above.
contributions from noncontrolling interests . we received equity contributions totaling $0.2 billion in both 2022
and 2021 from pt indonesia asahan aluminum (persero) (pt inalum, also known as mind id) for its share of capital spending on the underground mine development projects in the grasberg minerals district. beginning on january 1,
2023, capital spending at pt-fi is being shared in accordance with the shareholders' ownership interests.
stock-based awards . proceeds from exercised stock options totaled $125 million in 2022 and $210 million in 2021, and payments for related employee taxes totaled $55 million in 2022 and $29 million in 2021. see note 10 for a discussion of stock-based awards.

"risk factors" contained in part i of our annual report on form 10-k for the year ended december 31, 2022, for further information about contingencies associated with environmental matters and aros.
environmental the cost of complying with environmental laws is a fundamental and substantial cost of our business. at december
31, 2022, we had $1.7 billion recorded in our consolidated balance sheet for environmental obligations attributed to cercla or analogous state programs and for estimated future costs associated with environmental obligations that are considered probable based on specific facts and circumstances.
we incurred environmental capital expenditures and other environmental costs (including our joint venture partners'
shares) to comply with applicable environmental laws and regulations that affect our operations totaling $0.4
billion in 2022 and $0.3 billion in 2021. for 2023, we expect to incur approximately $0.6 billion of aggregate environmental capital expenditures and other environmental costs. the timing and amount of estimated payments could change as a result of changes in regulatory requirements, changes in scope and timing of remediation, the settlement of environmental matters and the rate at which actual spending occurs on continuing matters.
asset retirement obligations we recognize aros as liabilities when incurred, with the initial measurement at fair value. these obligations, which are initially estimated based on discounted cash flow estimates, are accreted to full value over time through charges to cost of sales. mine reclamation costs for disturbances are recorded as an aro and as a related asset retirement cost (included in property, plant, equipment and mine development costs) in the period of disturbance.
for non-operating properties without mineral reserves, changes to the aro are recorded in earnings. our cost estimates are reflected on a third-party cost basis and comply with our legal obligation to retire tangible, long-
lived assets. at december 31, 2022, we had $3.0 billion recorded in our consolidated balance sheet for aros, including $0.3 billion related to our oil and gas properties. spending on aros totaled $0.2 billion in 2022 and
2021 (including $0.1 billion in 2022 and 2021 for our oil and gas operations). for 2023, we expect to incur approximately $0.2 billion in aggregate aro expenditures (including $0.1 billion for our oil and gas operations).
pt-fi recorded aro adjustments of $131 million in 2022 and $397 million in 2021, of which $116 million and $340
million, respectively, were charged to production and delivery costs as they relate to the depleted grasberg open pit. our morenci and bagdad mines recorded aro adjustments in 2022 totaling $118 million and $65 million, respectively, associated with their updated closure strategies and plans for stockpiles and tailings impoundments that were submitted to the arizona department of environmental quality for approval.

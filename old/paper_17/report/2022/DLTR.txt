item 1a. risk factors an investment in our common stock involves a high degree of risk. any failure to meet market expectations, including our comparable store sales growth rate, earnings and earnings per share or new store openings, could cause the market price of our stock to decline. you should carefully consider the specific risk factors listed below together with all other information included or incorporated in this report and other filings that we make from time to time with the sec, including our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. however, the risks and uncertainties that we face are not limited to those described below and those set forth in our sec filings. additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently believe to be immaterial may also arise. in such event, our business, financial condition, results of operations or prospects could be materially adversely affected.
profitability and operational risks our profitability is vulnerable to increases in merchandise, shipping, freight and fuel costs, wage and benefit costs and other operating costs.
future increases in costs such as the cost of merchandise (including the substitution of higher cost domestic goods), wage and benefit costs, ocean shipping rates, domestic freight costs, fuel and energy costs, duties and tariffs, merchandise loss (due to theft, damage, or errors) and store occupancy costs would reduce our profitability. we experienced material increases in wage rates and labor costs as well as in shipping rates, freight and fuel costs in 2022, and we expect further increases in certain cost categories in 2023. we have incurred additional costs as a result of recent minimum wage increases by certain states and localities and we expect additional minimum wage increases by states and localities in 2023. in addition, the federal minimum wage may increase depending on the outcome of legislation proposed in congress, and the current administration may consider raising the minimum salary for store managers who have exempt status under the fair labor standards act. separately, government or industry actions addressing the impact of climate change, or shifts in customer preferences for more sustainable, energy-efficient products, may result in increases in our merchandise or operating costs.
in our dollar tree segment, we raised our primary price point on merchandise to $1.25 in fiscal 2021. in addition, we continue to implement our dollar tree plus initiative which provides our customers with discretionary categories priced at the $3 and $5 price points and beginning in fiscal 2022, we added $3, $4 and $5 frozen and refrigerated product in 3,500 stores. although we have increased our price points at our dollar tree stores, our ability to adjust our product assortment, to operate more efficiently or to increase our comparable store net sales in order to offset cost increases is critical to maintaining our profitability levels. supply chain constraints and higher commodity costs could make it more difficult for us to obtain sufficient quantities of certain products and could negatively affect our product assortment and merchandise costs. we can give no assurance that we will be able to adjust our product assortment, operate more efficiently or increase our comparable store net sales in the future. although family dollar, unlike dollar tree, can more easily raise the price of merchandise, customers may buy fewer products if prices were to increase. please see "item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations" for further discussion of the effect of economic factors on our operations.
we are experiencing higher costs and disruptions in our distribution network, which have had and could have an adverse impact on our sales, margins and profitability.
our success is dependent on our ability to import or transport merchandise to our distribution centers and store, pick and ship merchandise to our stores in a timely and cost-effective manner. we rely heavily on third parties including ocean carriers and truckers in these processes. we may not anticipate, respond to or control all of the challenges of operating our distribution network. additionally, when our distribution centers fail to operate effectively, we could experience increased freight or operational costs or merchandise shortages that could lead to lost sales. we have also experienced trucking shortages, and increased trucking and fuel costs. some of the factors that have had and could have an adverse effect on our distribution network or costs in 2023 are:
•shipping costs. we have experienced significantly higher international and domestic freight costs. domestically, diesel fuel prices have been and are expected to remain higher and may increase further because of international tensions. a significant increase in our freight costs could have a material adverse impact on our business and results of operations. changes in import duties, import quotas and other trade sanctions could also increase our costs.
•shipping disruptions. we have experienced disruptions in the global supply chain, including issues with shipping capacity, port congestion and pandemic-related port closings and ship diversions. our receipt of imported merchandise has been and may be further disrupted or delayed as a result of these or other factors. delays could potentially have a material adverse impact on future product availability, product mix, sales and merchandise margin, especially at dollar tree. in addition, our supply chain may be disrupted as a result of other international events such as armed conflict, war, economic sanctions or acts of terrorism.
•efficient operations and management. distribution centers and other aspects of our distribution network are complex and difficult to operate efficiently, and we have experienced and could continue to experience a reduction in operating efficiency resulting in delayed shipments of merchandise to our stores as a result of challenges in attracting and retaining an adequate and reliable workforce. although we have offered sign-on bonuses, enhanced wages and other inducements in certain markets to address the shortage of labor at our distribution centers, such measures have increased our costs and are expected to continue to increase our costs, which could have an adverse effect on our margins and profitability. there can be no assurances that such measures will be adequate to attract and retain the workforce necessary for the efficient operation of our distribution centers.
•trucking costs. we have experienced significant increases in trucking costs in recent years due to a truck driver shortage and other factors. the truck driver shortage also required us to increase our use of more expensive surge carriers to transport our merchandise.
•diesel fuel costs. we have experienced volatility in diesel fuel costs and are expecting increases to continue in fiscal 2023 and may worsen, for example, because of the impact of international events such as trade restrictions on russia on oil prices.
•vulnerability to natural or man-made disasters, including climate change. a fire, explosion or natural disaster at a port or any of our distribution or store support facilities could result in a loss of merchandise and impair our ability to adequately stock our stores. some facilities are vulnerable to earthquakes, hurricanes, tornadoes or floods, and an increase in the severity and frequency of extreme weather events and patterns may increase our operating costs, disrupt manufacturing or our supply chain, change customer buying patterns, result in closures of our stores or distribution and store support centers and impede physical access to our stores.
•labor disagreement. labor disagreements, disruptions or strikes, including at ports, rail networks or transportation companies, may result in lost sales due to shipping delays or disruptions in the delivery of merchandise to our distribution centers or stores and increase our costs.
•direct-to-store deliveries. we rely on a limited number of suppliers for certain consumable merchandise, including frozen and refrigerated products. in fiscal 2022, we purchased and delivered approximately 15% of our merchandise for our family dollar segment, and to a lesser extent for our dollar tree segment, through our relationship with mclane company, inc., which distributes consumable merchandise from multiple manufacturers. we also rely on third parties to deliver frozen and refrigerated product, as well as chocolate in the summer, to our dollar tree stores. to the extent that supply chain disruptions and higher costs affect our suppliers, we may be subject to delays or reductions in deliveries and higher costs for merchandise. a substantial disruption in our relationship with or in service levels from these suppliers could have a material adverse impact on our business and results of operations.
we may stop selling or recall certain products for safety-related or other issues.
we may stop selling or recall certain products, including our private label brands, for safety-related or other issues, including product contamination, product content, improper manufacturing processes, improper testing, product mislabeling or product tampering. we may also stop selling or recall products if the products, the operations of our suppliers, or our operations violate applicable laws or regulations, including food, drug and cosmetic safety laws, or raise potential health and safety-related issues, including improper storage, product mishandling, contamination or other adulteration, or when products could cause injury, illness or death. any recall may require significant management attention, and we could experience significant costs, lost sales, compliance or enforcement actions by governmental authorities which could result in fines or other penalties, and/or product liability legal claims and consumer lawsuits. recalls may also subject us to public claims of false or deceptive advertising and other criticism. a significant product liability or other legal judgment against us, a regulatory enforcement action or a product recall could materially and adversely affect our reputation, financial condition and/or results of operations. moreover, the negative publicity surrounding assertions against the products we sell or the standards we uphold could materially and adversely affect our business, reputation and/or profitability. additionally, any product recall may lead to increased scrutiny of our operations by regulatory agencies, requiring further management attention and potential legal fees and other expenses.
we have experienced the foregoing risks in connection with a retail-level recall that was initiated on february 18, 2022 in relation to our family dollar distribution center 202 in arkansas ("dc 202"). for more information, see "litigation, arbitration and government proceedings may adversely affect our business, financial condition and/or results of operations" on page 17 which includes, among other things, a description of legal proceedings relating to issues associated with dc 202.
our business and results of operations could be materially harmed if we experience a decline in consumer confidence and spending as a result of consumer concerns about the quality and safety of our products or our brand standards.
we could experience a decline in consumer confidence and spending if our customers become concerned about the quality and safety of the products we sell. to date, other than with respect to the stores temporarily closed to permit the removal and destruction of relevant inventory, we have not experienced significant lost sales in connection with the recall, but there can be no assurances that consumer confidence in the quality and safety of our products resulting from the recall will not decline in the future. if there is a decline in consumer confidence in our products or brands, our reputation may be adversely affected and we may experience additional lost sales which could have a material adverse impact on our business and results of operations.
inflation or other adverse change or downturn in economic conditions could impact our sales or profitability.
a deterioration in economic conditions could reduce consumer spending or cause customers to shift their spending to products we either do not sell or do not sell as profitably. adverse economic conditions such as a recession could disrupt consumer spending and significantly reduce our sales, decrease our inventory turnover, cause greater markdowns or reduce our profitability due to lower margins. other factors that could result in or exacerbate adverse economic conditions include inflation, higher unemployment, consumer debt levels, trade disputes, as well as adverse climate or weather conditions, worsening or new epidemics, terrorism or international tensions, including armed conflict and economic sanctions.
furthermore, factors that could adversely affect consumer disposable income could decrease our customers' spending on products we sell most profitably. in fiscal 2022, we experienced a material shift in consumer purchasing from higher-margin discretionary merchandise to lower-margin consumable goods which has negatively impacted our product mix and margins. factors that could reduce our customers' disposable income and over which we exercise no influence include but are not limited to, inflation in food, housing, fuel or other energy costs, increased unemployment, increases in interest rates, lack of available credit, higher tax rates and other changes in tax laws, increasing healthcare costs, and changes in, decreases in, or elimination of, government subsidies such as unemployment and food assistance programs.
although governmental authorities adopted substantial measures, including fiscal and monetary stimulus, to provide economic assistance to individual households and businesses and support economic stability during the covid-19 pandemic, certain of the government assistance payments to households were temporary and were permitted to expire. there can be no assurance that current or future governmental efforts to support the economy during the pandemic or a recession will be sufficient to support future consumer spending at levels experienced previously or mitigate the negative effect of the pandemic on the economy. if consumer spending on the goods we sell declines as a result, there could be a material adverse impact on our business and results of operations.
many of the factors identified above that affect disposable income, as well as merchandise costs, commodity rates, transportation costs (including the costs of diesel fuel), costs of labor, insurance and healthcare, foreign exchange rate fluctuations, lease costs, barriers or increased costs associated with international trade and other economic factors also affect our ability to implement our corporate strategy effectively, our cost of goods sold and our selling, general and administrative expenses, and may have other adverse consequences which we are unable to fully anticipate or control, all of which may adversely affect our sales or profitability. we have limited or no ability to control many of these factors.
if the covid-19 pandemic and associated disruptions worsen or continue longer than expected, there could be a material adverse impact on our business and results of operations.
the continuing covid-19 pandemic arising from a novel strain of coronavirus and its variants has caused on-going direct and indirect economic disruptions that have adversely affected, and are expected to continue to adversely affect, elements of our business. the covid-19 pandemic, related public health measures and associated economic and social impacts have already contributed to, among other things, significant increases in the cost of operating our stores and distribution centers, disruptions in the patterns of consumer demand and traffic, and an increase in demand for online sales (which is an insignificant part of our business), home deliveries (which we began providing in 2021 through our partnership with instacart) or curbside deliveries (which we do not offer), and changes in the labor markets.
there continues to be uncertainty and unpredictability about the lingering impact of covid-19-related issues on our financial and operating results in future periods. if the pandemic worsens or continues longer than expected (as new variants emerge), governments may reinstate or extend business or personal restrictions, and we could be forced to curtail or restrict operations or incur additional costs. if major new variants emerge, we might also experience new disruptions in our supply chain and sources of supply, suffer facility closures or encounter additional difficulties in hiring or retaining the workforce required for our business. these circumstances, if applicable for an extended duration or across significant parts of our operating footprint, or if they fall during particularly meaningful holiday seasons, could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.
we are unable to predict the full extent to which covid-19-related issues will affect the economy and our customers, associates, suppliers, vendors, other business partners or our business, results of operations and financial condition. if the economic consequences of the pandemic linger and/or worsen, it could amplify many of the other risks described in this report.
risks associated with our domestic and foreign suppliers could adversely affect our financial performance.
we are dependent on our vendors, including direct ship vendors, to supply merchandise in a timely and efficient manner. if a vendor fails to deliver on its commitments due to financial or other difficulties, we could experience merchandise shortages which could lead to lost sales or increased merchandise costs if alternative sources must be used.
we rely on the timely availability of imported goods at favorable wholesale prices. merchandise imported directly typically accounts for approximately 41%-43% of our dollar tree segment's total retail value purchases and approximately 15%-17% of our family dollar segment's total retail value purchases. in addition, we believe that a significant portion of our goods purchased from domestic vendors is imported. imported goods are generally less expensive than domestic goods and result in higher profit margins. a disruption in the flow of our imported merchandise or an increase in the cost of those goods may significantly decrease our profits. risks associated with our reliance on imported goods may include disruptions in the flow of or increases in the cost of imported goods because of factors such as:
•duties, tariffs or other restrictions on trade, including section 301 tariffs that have already been imposed on imported chinese goods;
•raw material shortages, work stoppages, government restrictions, strikes and political unrest, including any impact on vendors or shipping arising from epidemics, such as the covid-19 pandemic;
•economic crises in the united states or abroad and international disputes or conflicts, including war and economic sanctions;
•changes in currency exchange rates or government policies and local economic conditions, including inflation (including energy prices and raw material costs) in the country of origin;
•potential changes to international trade agreements or the failure of the united states to maintain normal trade relations with china and other countries;
•changes in leadership and the political climate in countries from which we import products and their relations with the united states; and
•failure of manufacturers outside the united states to meet food, drug and cosmetic safety and labeling requirements or environmental standards set by government regulators or consumer expectations.
our supply chain may be disrupted by changes in united states trade policy with china.
we rely on domestic and foreign suppliers to provide us with merchandise in a timely manner and at favorable prices. among our foreign suppliers, china is the source of a substantial majority of our imports. a disruption in the flow of our imported merchandise from china or an increase in the cost of those goods may significantly decrease our profits.
while the united states scaled back punitive section 301 tariffs on certain chinese imports based on an agreement reached with china in 2020, the imposition of any new u.s. tariffs on chinese imports or the taking of other actions against china in the future, and any responses by china, could impair our ability to meet customer demand and could result in lost sales or an increase in our cost of merchandise, which would have a material adverse impact on our business and results of operations.
our growth is dependent on our ability to increase sales in existing stores and to expand our square footage profitably.
existing store sales growth is critical to good operating results and is dependent on a variety of factors, including merchandise quality, relevance and availability, store operations and customer satisfaction. in addition, increased competition could adversely affect our sales. failure to meet our sales targets could result in our needing to record material non-cash impairment charges related to our intangible assets. we believe increasing sales at family dollar depends in significant part on several initiatives, including price reductions, some of which remain in the early stages.
our highest sales periods are during the christmas and easter seasons, and we generally realize a disproportionate amount of our net sales and our operating and net income during the fourth quarter. in anticipation, we stock extra inventory and hire many temporary employees to prepare our stores and help ship product from our distribution centers. a reduction in sales during these periods could adversely affect our operating results, particularly operating and net income, to a greater extent than if a reduction occurred at other times of the year. untimely merchandise delays due to receiving or distribution problems could have a similar effect.
when easter is observed earlier in the year, the selling season is shorter and, as a result, our sales could be adversely affected. easter was observed on april 17, 2022 and will be observed on april 9, 2023.
expanding our square footage profitably depends on a number of uncertainties, including our ability to locate, lease, build out and open or expand stores in suitable locations on a timely basis under favorable economic terms. we also open or expand stores within our established geographic markets, where new or expanded stores may draw sales away from our existing stores. obtaining an increasing number of profitable stores is an ever-increasing challenge.
in addition, our expansion is dependent upon third-party developers' abilities to acquire land, obtain financing, and secure necessary permits and approvals. we have experienced higher commodity and other costs associated with the build-out of new stores and the renovation of existing stores. we have also experienced delays in new store openings and the renovation of existing stores due to inspection, permitting and contractor delays. in addition, we have experienced delays in new store openings due to limitations on the availability of certain fixtures and equipment. we anticipate these increased costs and delays may continue for the foreseeable future, which could adversely affect our sales and profitability. further, we may not manage our expansion effectively, and our failure to achieve our expansion plans could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
our profitability is affected by the mix of products we sell.
our gross profit margin decreases when we increase the proportion of higher cost goods we sell. for example, some of our consumable products carry higher costs than other goods, so our gross profit margin will be negatively impacted as the percentage of our sales from higher cost consumable products increases. imported merchandise and private label goods generally carry lower costs than domestic goods. our product mix is affected by the supply of goods, including imported goods, and could be negatively impacted by various factors, including those described under "we are experiencing higher costs and disruptions in our distribution network, which have had and could have an adverse impact on our sales, margins and profitability" on page 11.
in our family dollar segment, our success also depends on our ability to select and obtain sufficient quantities of relevant merchandise at prices that allow us to sell such merchandise at profitable and appropriate prices. a sales price that is too high causes products to be less attractive to our customers and our sales at family dollar could suffer. we are continuing to refine our pricing strategy at family dollar to drive customer loyalty and have a strategic pricing team to improve our value and to increase profitability. our inability to successfully implement our pricing strategies at family dollar could have a negative effect on our business.
in addition, our family dollar segment has a substantial number of private brand items and the number of such items has been increasing. we believe our success in maintaining broad market acceptance of our private brands depends on many factors, including our pricing, costs, quality and customer perception. we may not achieve or maintain our expected sales for our private brands and, as a result, our business and results of operations could be adversely impacted. additionally, the increased number of private brands could negatively impact our existing relationships with our non-private brand suppliers.
pressure from competitors may reduce our sales and profits.
the retail industry is highly competitive. the marketplace is highly fragmented as many different retailers compete for market share by utilizing a variety of store formats and merchandising strategies, including mobile and online shopping. we expect competition to increase in the future. there are no significant economic barriers for others to enter our retail sector. some of our current or potential competitors have greater financial resources than we do. we cannot guarantee that we will continue to be able to compete successfully against existing or future competitors, and we believe that doing so may require substantial capital expenditures. please see "item 1. business" for further discussion of the effect of competition on our operations.
our business could be adversely affected if we fail to attract and retain qualified associates and key personnel.
our growth and performance are dependent on the skills, experience and contributions of our associates, executives and key personnel for both dollar tree and family dollar. various factors, including the pandemic, constraints on overall labor availability, wage rates, regulatory or legislative impacts, and benefit costs could impact our ability to attract and retain qualified associates at our stores, distribution centers and corporate offices.
we are experiencing a shortage of associates and applicants to fill staffing requirements at our distribution centers, stores and corporate offices due to the current labor shortage affecting businesses. this has adversely affected the operating efficiency of our distribution centers and stores and our ability to transport merchandise from our distribution centers to our stores. if we are unable to attract and retain qualified associates for our distribution centers and stores in the future, our business and results of operations may be adversely affected.
risks relating to strategic initiatives we may not be successful in implementing or in anticipating the impact of important strategic initiatives, and our plans for implementing such initiatives may be altered or delayed due to various factors, which may have an adverse impact on our business and financial results.
we completed the conversion of our predominant product price from $1.00 to $1.25 for the vast majority of merchandise in all dollar tree stores during the first quarter of fiscal 2022. although to date the increase in the price point has more than offset the decline in the number of units sold, there can be no assurances that the price increase will not have an adverse effect on our business in the future. in addition, we are continuing to implement our important strategic initiatives that are designed to create growth, improve our results of operations and drive long-term shareholder value, including:
•the expansion of a multi-price initiative in dollar tree stores;
•the introduction of selected dollar tree merchandise into family dollar stores;
•the roll-out of the combo store format that combines a dollar tree store and family dollar store in a single location;
•the renovation of family dollar stores to the h2 and other formats;
•our partnership with instacart to provide home delivery of merchandise purchased online; and
•our plans relating to new store openings for dollar tree and family dollar generally.
the implementation, timing and results of these strategic initiatives are subject to various risks and uncertainties, including the acceptance of multi-priced merchandise by dollar tree customers; customer acceptance of new store concepts and merchandise offerings; construction and permitting delays relating to new and renovated stores; the availability of desirable real estate locations for lease at reasonable rates; the lingering impact of the covid-19 pandemic and associated economic issues; the success of our strategies; and other factors beyond our control. in addition, several of these initiatives depend on the timeliness, cost and availability of adequate levels of the appropriate domestic and imported merchandise, our ability to execute on our plans and expectations with respect to those initiatives and our ability to implement those initiatives within budget and with the expected return. to the extent that shipping delays, supply chain disruptions and other distribution logistics adversely affect the availability of merchandise necessary to implement our strategic initiatives, we may delay or reduce our planned rate of implementation of one or more of those initiatives.
in addition, building on our current initiatives, we are currently developing plans to make additional multi-year strategic investments across the dollar tree and family dollar banners to further position the company for long-term sustained growth. we anticipate that these investments will relate to four key areas of our business: our associates, our distribution center network and supply chain, our product pricing and value proposition, and our technology infrastructure. within these areas, the focus of these investments is expected to be on associate wages, improved store execution, enhanced safety and working conditions, increased supply chain efficiencies, competitive pricing at family dollar, and enhancements to our systems infrastructure. there is a risk that our investments in these initiatives may increase our costs and reduce our margins and profitability if the initiatives do not achieve their intended purposes.
there can be no assurance that we will be able to implement important strategic initiatives in accordance with our expectations or that they will generate expected returns, which may result in an adverse impact on our business and financial results.
we could incur losses due to impairment of long-lived assets, goodwill and intangible assets.
under u.s. generally accepted accounting principles, we review our long-lived assets for impairment whenever economic events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable. identifiable intangible assets with an indefinite useful life, including goodwill, are not amortized but are evaluated annually for impairment. a more frequent evaluation is performed if events or circumstances indicate that impairment could have occurred.
should we experience business challenges or significant negative industry or general economic trends, we could recognize impairments to our goodwill, intangible assets and other long-lived assets. we monitor key assumptions and other factors utilized in our goodwill impairment analysis, and if business or other market conditions develop that are materially different than we currently anticipate, we will conduct an additional impairment evaluation. any reduction in or impairment of the value of goodwill or intangible assets will result in a charge against earnings, which could have a material adverse impact on our reported results of operations and financial condition. for additional information on goodwill impairments, please refer to note 1 to our consolidated financial statements under the caption "goodwill and nonamortizing intangible assets."
cybersecurity and technology risks we rely on computer and technology systems in our operations, and any material failure, inadequacy, interruption or security failure of those systems, including because of a cyber-attack, could harm our ability to effectively operate and grow our business and could adversely affect our financial results.
we rely extensively on our computer and technology systems and, in certain cases, those of third-party service providers to support nearly all key functions in our business, including managing inventory, operating our stores, processing credit card and customer transactions and summarizing results. our ability to effectively manage our business and coordinate the distribution and sale of our merchandise depends significantly on the capabilities, confidentiality, integrity and availability of these systems and on our ability to successfully acquire and integrate upgraded or replacement systems as needed to support our business requirements and strategic initiatives. we also rely on third-party providers and platforms for many of these computer and technology systems and support.
although we have operational safeguards in place, they may not be effective in preventing the failure of these systems or platforms to operate effectively and be available to us. this may be as the result of deliberate breach in the security of these systems or platforms by bad actors, including through malicious software, ransomware and other cyber-attacks, which may originate from state actors and may increase during times of international tensions. failures may also be caused by various other factors, including power outages, catastrophic events, physical theft, computer and network failures, inadequate or ineffective redundancy, obsolescence or failure of vendor support, problems with transitioning to upgraded or replacement systems or platforms and related business process changes, flaws in third-party software or services, errors or improper use by our employees or third-party service providers.
we plan to make investments in our information technology systems in fiscal 2023 to support the growth of our business. if our information technology systems are not adequate to support our strategic initiatives, our growth and the success of our initiatives may be adversely affected. if these systems are damaged or fail to function adequately, we may incur substantial costs to repair or replace them, may experience loss of critical data and interruptions or delays in our ability to manage inventories or process customer transactions and may receive negative publicity, which could adversely affect our results of operations and business. in addition, remediation of any problems with our systems could take an extensive amount of time and could result in significant, unplanned expenses.
the potential unauthorized access to customer information may violate privacy laws and could damage our business reputation, subject us to negative publicity, litigation and costs, and adversely affect our results of operations or business.
many of our information technology systems, such as those we use for our point-of-sale, web and mobile platforms, including online and mobile payment systems, and for administrative functions, including human resources, payroll, accounting, and internal and external communications, contain personal, financial or other confidential information that is entrusted to us by our customers and associates as well as proprietary and other confidential information related to our business and suppliers.
the security measures that we and/or our third-party suppliers put in place cannot provide absolute security to safeguard our customers' personal information (including debit and credit card information), our associates' private data, suppliers' data, and our business records and intellectual property and other sensitive information.
cybercriminals, who may include well-funded state actors or organized criminal groups, are rapidly evolving their cyberattack techniques and tactics, which are becoming increasingly more sophisticated and challenging to detect. we and/or our third-party suppliers may be vulnerable to and unable to anticipate, detect, and appropriately respond to cyber-security attacks, including data security breaches and data loss.
we are also subject to laws and regulations in various jurisdictions in which we operate regarding privacy, data protection and data security, including those related to the collection, storage, handling, use, disclosure, transfer and security of personal data. these laws permit regulators to assess potentially significant fines for data privacy violations and may create a right for individuals to bring class action suits seeking damages for violations. our efforts to comply with consumer privacy laws and other similar privacy and data protection laws may impose significant costs and challenges that are likely to increase over time, and we could incur substantial penalties or be subject to litigation related to violation of existing or future data privacy laws and regulations.
likewise, we are subject to the payment card industry data security standards ("pci-dss") which is mandated by the card brands and administered through the payment card industry security standards council. as a level 1 merchant, we are subject to assessment and attestation for pci-dss compliance on an annual basis. a failure to meet and maintain compliance with pci-dss requirements could result in our inability to continue to accept credit cards as a form of payment, which would materially impact our ability to sell our products. in addition, our credibility and reputation within the business community and with our customers may be affected, which could result in our customers discontinuing the use of debit or credit cards in our stores or not shopping in our stores altogether. non-compliance with pci-dss requirements also may subject us to recurring and accumulating fines until compliance is achieved. considerable investments to strengthen our information security could also be required should we ever be deemed to be non-compliant.
moreover, significant additional capital investments and other expenditures could also be required to continue to strengthen our overall cyber-security posture and prevent future security breaches, including costs associated with additional security technologies, personnel, experts and services (e.g., credit-monitoring services) for those whose data has been breached. these costs, which could be material, could adversely impact our results of operations in the period in which they are incurred and may not meaningfully limit the success of future attempts to breach our information technology systems.
the unavailability of our information technology systems or the failure of those systems or software to perform as required to support our business needs for any reason and any inability to respond to, or recover from, such events, could disrupt our business, decrease performance and increase overhead costs. if we are unable to secure our customers' credit card and confidential information, or other private data relating to our associates, suppliers or our business, we could be subject to negative publicity, costly government enforcement actions or private litigation and increased costs. if our information technology systems and processes are insufficiently provisioned or improperly designed and implemented to support our business, our strategic initiatives may not deliver anticipated results. any of these factors could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or business.
legal and regulatory risks litigation, arbitration and government proceedings may adversely affect our business, financial condition and/or results of operations.
our business is subject to the risk of litigation and arbitration involving employees, consumers, suppliers, competitors, shareholders, government agencies, or others through private actions, class actions, derivative actions, governmental investigations, administrative proceedings, regulatory actions, mass arbitration or other similar actions.
in addition, due to the types of products that we sell, our operations are subject to regulatory oversight by the fda, the usda, the occupational health and safety administration, and other federal, state, local and applicable foreign governmental authorities. if such authorities believe that we have failed to comply with applicable regulations and/or procedures, they may require prompt corrective action, and/or proceed directly to other forms of enforcement action, including the imposition of operating restrictions, including a ceasing of operations in one or more facilities, enjoining and restraining certain violations of applicable law pertaining to products, seizure of products, and assessing civil or criminal sanctions or penalties. any adverse regulatory action, depending on its magnitude, may restrict us from effectively selling our products and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and/or results of operations.
from january 11, 2022 through february 11, 2022, dc 202 was inspected by the fda and usda. on february 11, 2022, the fda issued form 483 observations primarily regarding rodent infestation at dc 202, as well as other items that require remediation. in connection therewith, on february 18, 2022, we initiated a retail-level product recall of fda and usda-regulated products stored and shipped to approximately 400 stores from dc 202 from january 1, 2021 through such date (the "recall"). we temporarily closed dc 202 for extensive cleaning, temporarily closed the affected stores to permit the removal and destruction of inventory subject to the recall, ceased sales of relevant inventory subject to the recall, committed to the fda to continue to cease the shipment of fda-regulated products from dc 202 until fda approval is received, and initiated corrective actions at dc 202. in june 2022, we stopped shipping to stores from dc 202 and have since closed the facility and disposed of all of the inventory that was in the facility. on november 9, 2022 we received an fda warning letter in connection with the dc 202 inspection. the conditions and issues detailed in the warning letter are generally the same as those described in the form 483 observations or were otherwise observed during the inspection. the warning letter acknowledged certain remedial actions we have taken in response to the form 483 observations, including conducting the recall and closing the facility. we are taking this matter extremely seriously and continue to cooperate with the fda. if the fda and/or other governmental authorities are not satisfied with these corrective actions or observe issues in our other distribution centers or stores, they may initiate other enforcement or administrative actions, which may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and/or results of operations. also see "we may stop selling or recall certain products for safety-related or other issues" on page 12.
since february 22, 2022, we have received 14 putative class action complaints related to issues noted above associated with dc 202. the lawsuits are proceeding in federal court in tennessee using the federal court's multi-district litigation ("mdl") process. an amended consolidated complaint seeking class action status was filed october 17, 2022 alleging violations of the mississippi, arkansas, louisiana, tennessee, alabama and missouri consumer protection laws, breach of warranty, negligence, misrepresentation, deception and unjust enrichment related to the sale of products that may be contaminated by virtue of rodent infestation and other unsanitary conditions. plaintiffs seek damages, attorney fees and costs, punitive damages and the replacement of, or refund of, money paid to purchase the relevant products, and any other legal relief available for their claims (in each case in unspecified amounts), including equitable and injunctive relief. on april 28, 2022, the state of arkansas filed a complaint in state court alleging violations of the arkansas deceptive trade practices act, gross negligence and negligence, strict liability in tort, unjust enrichment and civil conspiracy related to the same underlying matters as the putative class actions above. the state of arkansas is seeking injunctive relief, restitution, disgorgement, damages, civil penalties, punitive damages and suspension or revocation of our authorization to do business in arkansas.
we have defended and intend to continue defending ourselves vigorously in the foregoing litigations. we filed a motion to dismiss the amended consolidated complaint and a ruling on the motion by the court is expected in early 2023. if our motion is denied in whole or in part (including on appeal), the case would move to class certification, which we intend to oppose. we are unable to determine at this time whether our motion to dismiss will be granted or whether a class can be certified. we do not believe that the cases will, individually or in the aggregate, have a material adverse effect on our business or financial condition. however, we cannot assure that these litigations, individually or in the aggregate, will not have a material adverse effect on our results of operations for the period or year in which they are reserved or resolved.
on march 1, 2022, a federal grand jury subpoena was issued to us by the eastern district of arkansas requesting the production of information, documents and records pertaining to pests, sanitation and compliance with law regarding certain of our procedures and products. in connection with this matter, we have been investigating the condition of fda-regulated product shipped from dc 202. we are cooperating fully with the u.s. department of justice investigation, including having produced documents and provided additional information. as part of this cooperation, we may engage in discussions with the government in an effort to reach a negotiated resolution. due to the inherent uncertainties associated with this matter, no assurance can be given as to the timing or outcome of this matter, which could include penalties and company undertakings.
our products could also cause illness or injury, harm our reputation, and subject us to litigation. we are dependent on our vendors to ensure that the products we buy comply with all applicable safety standards. however, product liability, personal injury or other claims may be asserted against us relating to product adulteration, product tampering, mislabeling, recall and other safety issues with respect to the products that we sell, or with respect to our handling or storage of such products, including as a result of the issues raised by the pending arkansas fda matter (which has led to increased scrutiny of our operations by regulatory agencies, requiring further management attention and potential legal fees and other expenses). a significant product liability, consumer fraud, or other legal judgment against us, a related regulatory compliance or enforcement action or a product recall could materially and adversely affect our reputation, financial condition and/or results of operations. moreover, even if a product liability, consumer fraud or other claim is unsuccessful, has no merit or is not pursued, the negative publicity surrounding assertions against the products we sell could materially and adversely affect our reputation. we seek but may not be successful in obtaining contractual indemnification from our vendors, where appropriate, or insurance coverage, and if we do not have adequate contractual indemnification or insurance available, such claims could adversely affect our business, financial condition and/or results of operations. our ability to obtain the benefit of contractual indemnification from vendors may be hindered by our ability to enforce contractual indemnification obligations against such vendors, for example because the vendors are overseas or lack financial resources. our litigation-related expenses could increase as well, which also could have a materially negative impact on our financial condition and/or results of operations even if a claim is unsuccessful or is not fully pursued.
the outcome of such matters is difficult to assess or quantify. plaintiffs in these types of lawsuits or proceedings may seek recovery of very large or indeterminate amounts, and the magnitude of the potential loss may remain unknown for substantial periods of time. in addition, certain of these matters, if decided adversely to us or settled by us, may result in an expense that may be material to our financial statements as a whole or may negatively affect our operating results if changes to our business operations are required. if we experienced a material loss arising from these matters, we could also become subject to shareholder derivative suits and securities litigation. the cost to defend current and future litigation or proceedings, including arbitrations, may be significant. there also may be adverse publicity associated with litigation, including litigation related to product or food safety, customer information and environmental or safety requirements, which could negatively affect customer perception of our business, regardless of whether the allegations are valid or whether we are ultimately found liable.
for a discussion of current legal matters, please see "item 3. legal proceedings" and note 4 to our consolidated financial statements under the caption "contingencies." resolution of these matters, if decided against us, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, accrued liabilities or cash flows.
changes in laws and government regulations or in other stakeholder expectations concerning business conduct, or our failure to adequately estimate the impact of such changes or expectations, could increase our expenses, expose us to legal risks or otherwise adversely affect us.
our business is subject to a wide array of laws and regulations, and changes to those laws and regulations could have an adverse effect on our business. for example, various municipalities regulate the placement or proximity of our stores or may place requirements on the types of products we sell. in addition, the adoption of new environmental laws and regulations in connection with climate change and the proposed transition to a low carbon economy, including any federal or state laws enacted to regulate or tax greenhouse gas emissions, could significantly increase our operating or merchandise costs or reduce the demand for our products. these laws and regulations may include, but are not limited to, requirements relating to hazardous waste materials, recycling, single-use plastics, extended producer responsibility, use of refrigerants, carbon pricing or carbon taxes, product energy efficiency standards and product labeling. if carbon pricing or carbon taxes are adopted, there is a significant risk that the cost of merchandise from our suppliers will increase and adversely affect our business and results of operations.
in addition, significant changes in laws or regulations that impact our relationship with our workforce, such as minimum wage increases, health care, labor laws or workplace safety, could increase our expenses and adversely affect our operations. an increase in federal corporate tax rates also could adversely affect our profitability. changes in other regulatory areas, such as consumer credit, privacy and information security, product and food safety, energy or environmental protection, and tariff and other trade restrictions, among others, could cause our expenses to increase or result in product recalls. further, if we fail to comply with applicable laws and regulations, including wage and hour laws, we could be subject to legal risk, including government enforcement action and class action civil litigation, which could adversely affect our results of operations.
we operate in an increasingly regulated environment across a large and diverse geographic footprint, and we devote substantial resources to ensure effective compliance. if our programs do not adequately anticipate emerging regulatory expectations or requirements, or if we fail to appropriately design and maintain an effective enterprise compliance program and system of controls to prevent and detect non-compliance, including implementing and communicating a strong culture of compliance, there is a possibility any failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations would subject us to enhanced legal risks and adverse outcomes.
in addition to the legal requirements above, we are subject to the influence of a wide range of non-governmental stakeholders whose expectations on topics related to those described above may impact our business. we may be pressured by our shareholders, associates or customers, or others in the communities where we operate to adopt practices or policies that are more prescriptive than those required by law. similar influences may impact our merchandise and other vendors which would indirectly affect our business. to the extent that these influences result in changes to our operations, we could experience higher costs, and there can be no assurance we will experience offsetting positive effects on our results of operations. if our stakeholders perceive that we have not adequately addressed their expectations, our reputation could be negatively affected which could have an adverse impact on our business and results of operations.
risks relating to indebtedness our substantial indebtedness could adversely affect our financial condition, limit our ability to obtain additional financing, restrict our operations and make us more vulnerable to economic downturns and competitive pressures.
our substantial level of indebtedness could adversely affect our ability to fulfill our obligations and have a negative impact on our financing options and liquidity position. as of january 28, 2023, our total indebtedness is $3.45 billion. we may in the future incur substantial additional indebtedness. in addition, we have $1.5 billion of additional borrowing availability under our revolving credit facility, less amounts outstanding for letters of credit totaling $4.4 million.
in addition, our credit ratings impact the cost and availability of future borrowings and, accordingly, our cost of capital. our ratings reflect the opinions of the ratings agencies of our financial strength, operating performance and ability to meet our debt obligations. there can be no assurance that we will achieve a particular rating or maintain a particular rating in the future.
the terms of the agreements governing our indebtedness may restrict our current and future operations, particularly our ability to respond to changes or to pursue our business strategies, and could adversely affect our capital resources, financial condition and liquidity.
the agreements that govern our indebtedness contain a number of restrictive covenants that impose significant operating and financial restrictions on us and may limit our ability to engage in acts that may be in our long-term best interests, including, among other things, restrictions on our ability to incur liens; make changes in lines of business, subject to certain exceptions; and consolidate or merge with or into, or sell all or substantially all of our assets to, another person.
in addition, certain of these agreements require us to comply with certain financial maintenance covenants. our ability to satisfy these financial maintenance covenants can be affected by events beyond our control, and we cannot assure you that we will meet them.
a breach of the covenants under these agreements could result in an event of default under the applicable indebtedness, which, if not cured or waived, could result in us having to repay our borrowings before their due dates. such default may allow the debt holders to accelerate the related debt and may result in the acceleration of any other debt to which a cross-acceleration or cross-default provision applies. if we are forced to refinance these borrowings on less favorable terms or if we were to experience difficulty in refinancing the debt prior to maturity, our results of operations or financial condition could be materially affected. in addition, an event of default under our credit facilities may permit the lenders to terminate all commitments to extend further credit. in the event our lenders or holders of notes accelerate the repayment of such borrowings, we cannot assure you that we will have sufficient assets to repay such indebtedness.
as a result of these restrictions, we may be limited in how we conduct our business; unable to raise additional debt financing to operate during general economic or business downturns; or unable to compete effectively, take advantage of new business opportunities or grow in accordance with our plans.
our variable-rate indebtedness subjects us to interest rate risk, which could cause our annual debt service obligations to increase significantly.
our revolving credit facility is subject to variable rates that expose us to interest rate risk. we may also incur additional indebtedness subject to variable rates in the future. interest rates have increased in fiscal 2022 and further increases are anticipated. when interest rates increase, our debt service obligations on the variable rate indebtedness increase even though the amount borrowed remains the same, and our net income decreases. although we may enter into interest rate swaps involving the exchange of floating for fixed-rate interest payments, to reduce interest rate volatility, we cannot assure you we will choose to or be able to do so.
borrowings under our revolving credit facility bear interest at a rate derived from the secured overnight financing rate ("sofr"). as a result of the discontinuation of libor as a reference rate in june 2023, there is uncertainty as to whether the transition from libor to sofr or another reference rate will result in financial market disruptions or higher interest costs to borrowers, which could increase our interest expense and have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations. additionally, any successor rate to sofr under our revolving credit facility may not have the same characteristics as sofr or libor. as a result, the amount of interest we may pay on our revolving credit facility is difficult to predict.
risks relating to our common stock our business or the value of our common stock could be negatively affected as a result of actions by shareholders.
we value constructive input from investors and regularly engage in dialogue with our shareholders regarding strategy and performance. the board of directors and management team are committed to acting in the best interests of all of our shareholders. there is no assurance that the actions taken by the board of directors and management in seeking to maintain constructive engagement with our shareholders will be successful. shareholders who disagree with our strategy or the way we are managed may seek to effect change in the future, through various strategies that could include private engagement, publicity campaigns, proxy contests, and litigation. responding to these actions may be costly and time-consuming, disrupt our operations, divert the attention of our board of directors, management and employees, and impact our relationship with investors, vendors, and other third parties. shareholder engagement also may result in changes to our business plans, operations, strategies, initiatives, governance, management and risk factors. the perceived uncertainty as to our future direction resulting from these actions of shareholders could also affect the market price and volatility of our common stock.
the price of our common stock is subject to market and other conditions and may be volatile.
the market price of our common stock may fluctuate significantly in response to a number of factors. these factors, some of which may be beyond our control, include the perceived prospects and actual results of operations of our business; changes in estimates of our results of operations by analysts, investors or us; trading activity by our large shareholders; trading activity by sophisticated algorithms (high-frequency trading); our actual results of operations relative to estimates or expectations; actions or announcements by us or our competitors; litigation and judicial decisions; legislative or regulatory actions or changes; and changes in general economic or market conditions. in addition, the stock market in general has from time to time experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations. these market fluctuations could reduce the market price of our common stock for reasons unrelated to our operating performance.
certain provisions in our articles of incorporation and by-laws could delay or discourage a change of control transaction that may be in a shareholder's best interest.
our articles of incorporation and by-laws contain provisions that may delay or discourage a takeover attempt that a shareholder might consider in his/her best interest. these provisions, among other things:
•provide that only the board of directors, the chairman or vice chairman of the board, the chief executive officer or shareholders who own 15% or more of the outstanding shares of our common stock may call special meetings of the shareholders;
•establish certain advance notice procedures for nominations of candidates for election as directors and for shareholder proposals to be considered at shareholders' meetings; and
•permit the board of directors, without further action of the shareholders, to issue and fix the terms of preferred stock, which may have rights senior to those of the common stock.
however, we believe that these provisions allow our board of directors to negotiate a higher price in the event of a takeover attempt which would be in the best interest of our shareholders.
item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations this section of form 10-k generally discusses 2022 and 2021 events and results and year-to-year comparisons between 2022 and 2021. discussions of 2020 items and year-to-year comparisons between 2021 and 2020 that are not included in this form 10-k can be found in "management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations" in part ii, item 7 of our annual report on form 10-k for the fiscal year ended january 29, 2022.
in management's discussion and analysis, we explain the general financial condition and the results of operations for our company, including, factors that affect our business, analysis of annual changes in certain line items in the consolidated financial statements, performance of each of our operating segments, expenditures incurred for capital projects and sources of funding for future expenditures. as you read management's discussion and analysis, please refer to our consolidated financial statements and related notes, included in "item 8. financial statements and supplementary data" of this form 10-k.
initiatives and recent developments our initiatives, as well as other recent developments that have had or are expected to have an impact on our business or results of operations are listed below:
•dollar tree
◦in september 2021, we announced our new $1.25 price point initiative and we completed the rollout of this initiative to all dollar tree stores during the first quarter of fiscal 2022, increasing the price point on a majority of our $1 merchandise to $1.25. to date, the increase in the price point has more than offset the decline in the number of units sold. during fiscal 2022, we began investing in new products and modifying existing products to provide greater value for our customers and increase customer traffic and store productivity. while our gross margin was higher in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022 compared with the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021, because of the investments in new products, the increase was not as high as it was in the first three quarters of fiscal 2022 and we expect dollar tree's gross margin to be lower in the first half of fiscal 2023.
◦we began testing the instacart online delivery service at dollar tree stores in the third quarter of fiscal 2021 and began rolling it out in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021. as of january 28, 2023, the instacart platform covers more than 7,800 dollar tree stores. this enables our customers to shop online and receive same-day delivery without having to visit a store.
◦in fiscal 2022, we continued to implement our dollar tree plus initiative which introduces products priced at the $3 and $5 price points and provides our customers with extraordinary value in discretionary categories. as of january 28, 2023, we have approximately 2,500 dollar tree plus stores. we plan to accelerate the implementation of the dollar tree plus initiative in fiscal 2023 by adding the concept to an additional 1,800, or more, stores. in addition, beginning in fiscal 2022, we added $3, $4 and $5 frozen and refrigerated product to 3,500 stores.
◦the rollout of our crafter's square initiative to all of our dollar tree stores was completed during fiscal 2020. the crafter's square assortment carries mark-ups which are higher than our average mark-up.
•family dollar
◦in fiscal 2022, we continued to implement our h2 initiative. our h2 stores have significantly improved merchandise offerings throughout the store, including the addition of dollar tree $1.25 merchandise items and establishing a minimum number of freezer and cooler doors. these stores have higher customer traffic and provide a higher average comparable store net sales lift, when compared to non-renovated stores, in the first year following renovation. h2 stores perform well in a variety of locations and especially in locations where our family dollar stores have been most challenged in the past. as of january 28, 2023, we have approximately 4,360 h2 stores.
◦building on the success of the h2 format, in march 2021, we announced the development of a new combination store format. combo stores leverage the strengths of the dollar tree and family dollar brands under one roof to serve small towns across the country. we are taking family dollar's great value and assortment and blending in select dollar tree merchandise categories, creating a new store format targeted for small towns and rural communities with populations of 3,000 to 4,000 residents. as of january 28, 2023, we operated approximately 810 combo stores.
◦after a successful pilot program in 2020, we entered into a partnership with instacart in february 2021, which covers more than 7,500 family dollar stores across the united states as of january 28, 2023.
◦we added adult beverage to approximately 570 stores in fiscal 2022. we believe the addition of adult beverage to our assortment drives traffic to our stores. as of january 28, 2023, there were more than 3,300 stores selling adult beverage products.
◦on february 11, 2022, the food and drug administration issued form 483 observations primarily regarding rodent infestation at our west memphis, arkansas distribution center ("dc 202"), as well as other items that require remediation. during the first quarter of fiscal 2022, approximately 400 stores serviced by dc 202 were temporarily closed in connection with a retail-level product recall. we incurred approximately $65.0 million in costs related to the product recall, remediation efforts and asset impairment during fiscal 2022. remediation-related costs included merchandise disposal costs, payroll and legal costs.
•strategic investments building on our current initiatives, we are currently developing plans to make additional multi-year strategic investments across both banners to further position the company for long-term sustained growth. we anticipate that these investments will relate to four key areas of our business: our associates, our distribution center network and supply chain, our product pricing and value proposition, and our technology infrastructure. within these areas, the focus of these investments is expected to be on associate wages, improved store execution, enhanced safety and working conditions, increased supply chain efficiencies, competitive pricing at family dollar, and enhancements to our systems infrastructure.
•supply chain
◦inventory: during fiscal 2021, we experienced significant disruptions in our supply chain which impacted our ability to ship products from overseas on a timely basis. during the second and third quarters of fiscal 2022 these challenges subsided; however, as a result of receiving inventory more timely, our inventory levels exceeded the storage capacity of some of our distribution centers. as a result, we arranged for temporary offsite warehouse storage facilities and incurred detention costs and incremental drayage costs that increased our cost of goods sold.
◦freight costs: we experienced significantly higher international and domestic freight costs as a result of disruptions in the global supply chain during the second half of fiscal 2021 and into the first half of fiscal 2022. domestically, diesel fuel prices were higher in fiscal 2022 than in the prior year and may increase further in fiscal 2023 because of international tensions. we are a large importer of merchandise from asia and rely heavily on domestic freight to transport goods to our distribution centers and stores, which makes us particularly sensitive to freight costs. due to these trends, in fiscal 2022, import and domestic freight costs were higher compared to fiscal 2021; however, we expect freight costs to be lower in fiscal 2023 compared with fiscal 2022.
•long-term debt
◦during the fourth quarter of 2021, we completed the registered offering of $800.0 million of 2.65% senior notes due 2031 and $400.0 million of 3.375% senior notes due 2051 and used the proceeds of the offering to redeem the $1.0 billion 2023 notes, which resulted in our incurring a $43.8 million prepayment penalty and we accelerated the expensing of $2.7 million of deferred financing and original issue discount costs associated with the 2023 notes;
◦during the fourth quarter of 2021, we entered into a credit agreement for a $1.5 billion revolving credit facility, which replaced our then-existing $1.25 billion revolving credit facility.
for additional information regarding the risks related to our business and operations, including risks relating to the implementation of our initiatives, see "item 1a. risk factors."
overview we are a leading operator of more than 16,300 retail discount stores and we conduct our operations in two reporting segments. our dollar tree segment is the leading operator of discount variety stores offering merchandise predominantly at the fixed price of $1.25. our family dollar segment operates general merchandise retail discount stores providing consumers with a selection of competitively-priced merchandise in convenient neighborhood stores.
our net sales are derived from the sale of merchandise. two major factors tend to affect our net sales trends. first is our success at opening new stores. second is the performance of stores once they are open which can be impacted by a number of factors including operational performance, competition, inflation and changes in the product assortment, pricing, or quality. sales vary at our existing stores from one year to the next. we refer to this as a change in comparable store net sales, because we include only those stores that are open throughout both of the periods being compared, beginning after the first fifteen months of operation. we include sales from stores expanded or remodeled during the year in the calculation of comparable store net sales, which has the effect of increasing our comparable store net sales. the term 'expanded' also includes stores that are relocated. stores that have been re-bannered are considered to be new stores and are not included in the calculation of the comparable store net sales change until after the first fifteen months of operation under the new brand.
at january 28, 2023, we operated stores in 48 states and the district of columbia, as well as stores in five canadian provinces. a breakdown of store counts and square footage by segment for the years ended january 28, 2023 and january 29, 2022 is as follows:

the average size of stores opened in 2022 was approximately 8,660 selling square feet (or about 10,710 gross square feet) for the dollar tree segment and 9,160 selling square feet (or about 11,210 gross square feet) for the family dollar segment. for 2023, we continue to plan to open stores that are 8,000 - 10,000 selling square feet (or about 10,000 - 12,000 gross square feet) for both the dollar tree segment and the family dollar segment. we believe that these size stores are in the ranges of our optimal sizes operationally and give our customers a shopping environment which invites them to shop longer, buy more and make return visits.
fiscal 2022, fiscal 2021 and fiscal 2020 each included 52 weeks.

comparable store net sales are positively affected by our expanded and relocated stores, which we include in the calculation, and are negatively affected when we open new stores, re-banner stores or expand stores near existing stores.
results of operations our results of operations and year-over-year changes are discussed in the following section. note that gross profit margin is calculated as gross profit (i.e., net sales less cost of sales) divided by net sales. the selling, general and administrative expense rate and operating income margin are calculated by dividing the applicable amount by total revenue.

the increase in net sales from 2021 to 2022 was a result of comparable store net sales increases in the dollar tree and family dollar segments and sales of $758.6 million at new stores.
enterprise comparable store net sales increased 5.9% in 2022, as a result of an 8.9% increase in average ticket, partially offset by a 2.7% decrease in customer traffic. comparable store net sales increased 9.0% in the dollar tree segment and increased 2.4% in the family dollar segment.

the increase in gross profit margin from 2021 to 2022 was a result of the net of the following:
•merchandise cost, which includes freight, decreased 255 basis points resulting primarily from higher initial mark-on, partially offset by higher freight costs and increased sales of lower margin consumable merchandise on the family dollar segment.
•occupancy costs decreased 30 basis points due to leverage from the comparable store net sales increase.
•distribution costs decreased 5 basis points due to leverage from the comparable store net sales increase and higher capitalized amounts resulting from increases in inventory levels, partially offset by higher maintenance and compliance costs and higher hourly wages in our distribution centers.
•shrink costs increased 30 basis points resulting from unfavorable inventory results in relation to accruals.
•markdown costs increased 45 basis points primarily due to higher promotional and clearance markdowns on the family dollar segment and higher clearance markdowns resulting from a move to a higher value assortment at the $1.25 price point on the dollar tree segment.

expense rate the increase in the selling, general and administrative expense rate from 2021 to 2022 was the result of the following:
•other selling, general and administrative expenses increased 70 basis points primarily due to long-lived asset impairments related to certain family dollar stores and the family dollar west memphis, arkansas distribution center, higher legal fees, including costs related to the reconstitution of the board of directors, unfavorable development of general liability claims and inflationary pressure across several expense categories.
•store facility costs increased 35 basis points primarily due to an increase in repairs and maintenance expenses as we focus on store conditions for our customers and associates, higher utility costs and costs associated with the removal of product from certain family dollar stores in connection with the retail-level product recall.
•payroll expenses increased 10 basis points primarily due to minimum wage increases and other investments in store payroll and higher stock compensation expenses, partially offset by leverage from the comparable store net sales increase.
•depreciation and amortization expense was unchanged as a percentage of total revenue, as capital expenditures related to store renovations and improvements were offset by leverage from the comparable store net sales increase.

interest expense, net decreased $53.6 million in fiscal 2022 compared to the prior year, resulting from the refinancing of our debt in the fourth quarter of 2021, which resulted in prepayment penalties of $43.8 million and the acceleration of the expensing of $2.7 million of amortizable non-cash deferred financing costs. higher interest income on investments more than offset interest expense on credit facility borrowings in the current year.

the effective tax rate for 2022 was 23.5% compared to 18.6% for 2021. the 2022 effective rate increased compared to the prior year rate primarily due to a deferred tax benefit in the prior year related to state entity restructuring as well as higher non-deductible executive compensation and lower work opportunity tax credits as a percentage of pre-tax income in the current year.
segment information we operate more than 16,300 retail discount stores in 48 states and five canadian provinces. our operations are conducted in two reporting business segments: dollar tree and family dollar. we define our segments as those operations whose results our chief operating decision maker ("codm") regularly reviews to analyze performance and allocate resources.
we measure the results of our segments using, among other measures, each segment's net sales, gross profit and operating income. the codm reviews these metrics for each of our reporting segments. we may revise the measurement of each segment's operating income, as determined by the information regularly reviewed by the codm. if the measurement of a segment changes, prior period amounts and balances are reclassified to be comparable to the current period's presentation. corporate, support and other consists primarily of store support center costs that are considered shared services and therefore these selling, general and administrative costs are excluded from our two reporting business segments. these costs include operating expenses for our store support center and the results of operations for our summit pointe property in chesapeake, virginia. the family dollar segment "operating income" includes advertising revenue, which is a component of "other revenue" in the accompanying consolidated income statements.

net sales for the dollar tree segment increased $1,483.6 million, or 10.7%, in 2022 compared to 2021 due to an increase in comparable store net sales of 9.0% and $372.8 million of new store sales. average ticket increased 13.4% and customer traffic declined 3.9% in 2022. net sales were positively impacted by our $1.25 price point initiative which increased the selling price of the majority of our $1 merchandise to $1.25. the rollout of this initiative was completed during the first quarter of fiscal 2022. the increase in price point more than offset the decline in the number of units sold during the year.
gross profit margin for the dollar tree segment increased to 37.5% in 2022 from 33.1% in 2021. the increase is due to the net of the following:
•merchandise cost, which includes freight, decreased 410 basis points primarily due to higher initial mark-on, partially offset by higher freight costs.
•occupancy costs decreased 60 basis points primarily due to leverage from the comparable store net sales increase.
•distribution costs decreased 10 basis points due to leverage from the comparable store net sales increase and higher capitalized balances resulting from increases in inventory levels partially offset by higher hourly wages in our distribution centers.
•shrink costs increased 20 basis points resulting from unfavorable inventory results in relation to accruals.
•markdown costs increased 20 basis points resulting primarily from markdowns for clearance items as we move to a higher value assortment at the $1.25 price point.
operating income margin for the dollar tree segment increased to 16.5% in 2022 from 11.5% in 2021 as a result of the gross profit margin increase noted above and a decrease in the selling, general and administrative expense rate. the selling, general and administrative expense rate decreased to 21.0% in 2022 compared to 21.5% in 2021 as a result of the net of the following:
•payroll expenses decreased 85 basis points primarily due to leverage from the comparable store net sales increase, partially offset by minimum wage increases and other investments in store payroll.
•depreciation and amortization expense decreased 5 basis points primarily due to leverage from the comparable store net sales increase, partially offset by capital expenditures related to store renovations and improvements.
•store facility costs increased 15 basis points primarily due to an increase in repairs and maintenance expenses as we focus on store conditions for our customers and associates and higher utility costs, partially offset by leverage from the comparable store net sales increase.
•other selling, general and administrative expenses increased 25 basis points primarily due to unfavorable development of general liability claims, the benefit in the prior year associated with the realization of certain tax credits and inflationary pressure across several expense categories in the current year.

net sales for the family dollar segment increased $524.8 million, or 4.2%, in 2022 compared to 2021 due to $385.8 million of new store sales and a comparable store net sales increase of 2.4%. average ticket increased 3.4% and customer traffic declined 1.0% in 2022. during the first quarter of 2022, approximately 400 stores serviced by the west memphis, arkansas distribution center were temporarily closed in connection with a retail-level product recall. the family dollar comparable store net sales increased 2.8% when excluding the effect of the store closures. net sales in the prior year were positively impacted by significant government stimulus dollars provided to our customers.
gross profit margin for the family dollar segment decreased to 24.4% in 2022 compared to 25.2% in 2021. the decrease is due to the net of the following:
•markdown costs increased 80 basis points primarily due to higher promotional and clearance markdowns.
•shrink costs increased 45 basis points resulting from unfavorable inventory results in relation to accruals.
•distribution costs were unchanged as a percentage of sales compared to the prior year as higher capitalized balances resulting from increases in inventory levels in the current year were offset by higher maintenance and compliance costs and higher hourly wages in our distribution centers.
•merchandise cost, which includes freight, decreased 40 basis points primarily due to higher initial mark-on, partially offset by higher sales of lower margin consumable merchandise and higher freight costs.
operating income margin for the family dollar segment decreased to 1.0% in 2022 from 4.4% in 2021, resulting from the gross profit margin decrease noted above and an increase in the selling, general and administrative expense rate. the selling, general and administrative expense rate increased to 23.4% in 2022 from 20.9% in 2021 as a result of the following:
•other selling, general and administrative expenses increased 95 basis points primarily due to long-lived asset impairments related to certain stores and the west memphis, arkansas distribution center, higher legal fees and inflationary pressure across several expense categories.
•payroll expenses increased 85 basis points primarily due to minimum wage increases and other investments in store payroll.
•store facility costs increased 60 basis points primarily due to an increase in repairs and maintenance expenses as we focus on store conditions for our customers and associates, higher utility costs and costs associated with the removal of product from certain stores in connection with a voluntary retail-level product recall.
•depreciation and amortization expense increased 15 basis points primarily due to capital expenditures related to store renovations and improvements.
liquidity and capital resources we invest capital to build and open new stores, expand and renovate existing stores, expand our distribution network and operate our existing stores. our working capital requirements for existing stores are seasonal in nature and typically reach their peak in the months of september and october. historically, we have satisfied our seasonal working capital requirements for existing stores and have funded our store opening and distribution network expansion programs from internally generated funds and borrowings under our credit facilities.

operating activities net cash provided by operating activities increased $183.3 million in 2022 compared to 2021 primarily as a result of higher current year earnings, net of non-cash items, and smaller decreases in liability balances, partially offset by higher inventory levels and a smaller increase in accounts payable.
investing activities net cash used in investing activities increased $233.9 million in 2022 compared with 2021 primarily due to higher capital expenditures in the current year.
financing activities net cash used in financing activities decreased $149.7 million in 2022 compared to 2021 primarily due to the following:
•in 2022, we paid $647.5 million in cash for stock repurchases compared to $950.0 million in the prior year.
•in 2021, we completed the registered offering of $800.0 million aggregate principal amount of senior notes due 2031 and $400.0 million aggregate principal amount of senior notes due 2051 and used the proceeds of the offering to redeem the $1.0 billion 2023 notes, which resulted in our incurring a $43.8 million prepayment penalty. in addition, in connection with the registering of these senior notes and the refinancing of our revolving line of credit, we paid $15.5 million in deferred financing costs.
at january 28, 2023, our long-term borrowings were $3.45 billion and we had $1.5 billion available under our revolving credit facility, less amounts outstanding for standby letters of credit totaling $4.4 million. for additional detail on our long-term borrowings and other commitments, refer to the discussion of funding requirements below, as well as note 4 and note 5 to our consolidated financial statements.
share repurchases we repurchased 4,613,696, 9,156,898 and 3,982,478 shares of common stock on the open market in fiscal 2022, fiscal 2021 and fiscal 2020, respectively, for $647.5 million, $950.0 million and $400.0 million, respectively. at january 28, 2023, we had $1.85 billion remaining under our board repurchase authorization.
funding requirements overview we expect our cash needs for opening new stores and expanding existing stores in fiscal 2023 to total approximately $690.0 million, which includes capital expenditures, initial inventory and pre-opening costs. our total estimated capital expenditures for fiscal 2023 are approximately $2.0 billion, including planned expenditures for our new and expanded stores, store renovations, supply chain and information technology investments, and other property improvements. we believe that we can adequately fund our working capital requirements and planned capital expenditures for the foreseeable future from net cash provided by operations and potential borrowings under our revolving credit facility.
our material contractual obligations consist of long-term debt and related interest payments and operating lease obligations. additionally, we have commitments related to ocean shipping contracts, software license and support agreements, telecommunication services and store technology assets and maintenance for our stores. other commitments include letters of credit for imported merchandise, standby letters of credit that serve as collateral for our large-deductible insurance programs and surety bonds that serve as collateral for utility payments at our stores and self-insured insurance programs. for additional information regarding these obligations, including amounts outstanding at january 28, 2023, refer to note 4, note 5 and note 6 to our consolidated financial statements.
critical accounting estimates the preparation of financial statements requires the use of estimates. certain of our estimates require a high level of judgment and have the potential to have a material effect on the financial statements if actual results vary significantly from those estimates. following is a discussion of the estimates that we consider critical.
inventory valuation as discussed in note 1 to our consolidated financial statements under the caption "merchandise inventories," inventories at the distribution centers are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value with cost determined on a weighted-average basis. cost is assigned to store inventories using the retail inventory method on a weighted-average basis. under the retail inventory method, the valuation of inventories at cost and the resulting gross margins are computed by applying a calculated cost-to-retail ratio to the retail value of inventories. the retail inventory method is an averaging method that is widely used in the retail industry and results in valuing inventories at lower of cost or market when markdowns are taken as a reduction of the retail value of inventories on a timely basis.
inventory valuation methods require certain management estimates and judgments, including estimates of future merchandise markdowns and shrink, which significantly affect the ending inventory valuation at cost as well as the resulting gross margins. the averaging required in applying the retail inventory method and the estimates of shrink and markdowns could, under certain circumstances, result in costs not being recorded in the proper period.
we estimate our markdown reserve based on the consideration of a variety of factors, including, but not limited to, quantities of slow moving or seasonal carryover merchandise on hand, historical markdown statistics and future merchandising plans. the accuracy of our estimates can be affected by many factors, some of which are outside of our control, including changes in economic conditions and consumer buying trends. historically, we have not experienced significant differences in our estimated reserve for markdowns compared with actual results.
our accrual for shrink is based on the actual, historical shrink results of our most recent physical inventories adjusted, if necessary, for current economic conditions and business trends. these estimates are compared to actual results as physical inventory counts are taken and reconciled to the general ledger. our physical inventory counts are generally taken between january and october of each year; therefore, the shrink accrual recorded at january 28, 2023 is based on estimated shrink for most of 2022, including the fourth quarter. the amounts recorded in the current year reflect the dollar tree and family dollar segments' historical results. we periodically adjust our shrink estimates to reflect our best estimates based on the factors described and, historically, these adjustments have not been material.
our management believes that our application of the retail inventory method results in an inventory valuation that reasonably approximates cost and results in carrying inventory at the lower of cost or market each year on a consistent basis.
self-insurance liabilities the liabilities related to our self-insurance programs for workers' compensation and general liability are estimates that require judgment and the use of assumptions. semiannually, we obtain third-party actuarial valuations to aid in valuing the liabilities and in determining the amount to accrue during the year. these actuarial valuations are estimates based on our historical loss development factors and the related accruals are adjusted as management's estimates change.
management's estimate for self-insurance liabilities could vary from the ultimate loss sustained given the difficulty in predicting future events; however, historically, the net total of these differences has not had a material effect on our financial condition or results of operations.
goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are initially recorded at their fair values. these assets are not amortized but are evaluated annually for impairment. a more frequent evaluation is performed if events or circumstances indicate that impairment could have occurred. such events or circumstances could include, but are not limited to, significant negative industry or economic trends, unanticipated changes in the competitive environment and a significant sustained decline in the market price of our stock.
for purposes of our goodwill impairment evaluation, the reporting units are family dollar, dollar tree and dollar tree canada. goodwill has been assigned to the reporting units based on prior business combinations related to the brands. we have the option to initially perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value is less than the carrying amount. alternatively, we may bypass the qualitative assessment and proceed directly to performing the quantitative impairment test.
in connection with the fiscal 2022 annual impairment evaluation, management's qualitative assessment did not indicate that it was more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting units were less than their carrying values. however, due to recent executive level management changes and investments being made with respect to the family dollar reporting unit, management elected to perform a quantitative assessment of both the family dollar goodwill and trade name.
we estimate the fair value using a combination of a market multiple method and a discounted cash flow method. under the market multiple approach, we estimate a fair value based on comparable companies' market multiples of revenues and earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization ("ebitda") and adjusted for a control premium. under the discounted cash flow approach, we project future cash flows which are discounted using a weighted-average cost of capital analysis that reflects current market conditions, adjusted for specific reporting unit risks (primarily the uncertainty of achieving projected operating cash flows). if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess.
the family dollar goodwill and trade name comprise a substantial portion of our goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets and management's judgment utilized in the family dollar goodwill and trade name impairment evaluations is critical. the computations require management to make estimates and assumptions and actual results may differ significantly, particularly if there are significant adverse changes in the operating environment. critical assumptions that are used as part of a quantitative family dollar goodwill evaluation include:
•the potential future revenue, ebitda and cash flows of the reporting unit. the projections use management's assumptions about economic and market conditions over the projected period as well as our estimates of future performance and reporting unit revenue, gross margin, expenses and other factors. the resulting revenue, ebitda and cash flow estimates are based on our most recent business operating plans, and various growth rates are assumed for years beyond the current business plan period. these operating plans include anticipated investments in associate wages, improved store execution, enhanced safety and working conditions, increased supply chain efficiencies, competitive pricing, and enhancements to our technology infrastructure. we believe that the assumptions, estimates and rates used in our fiscal 2022 impairment evaluations are reasonable; however, variations in the assumptions, estimates and rates could result in significantly different estimates of fair value.
•selection of an appropriate discount rate. calculating the present value of future cash flows requires the selection of an appropriate discount rate, which is based on a weighted-average cost of capital analysis. the discount rate is affected by changes in short-term interest rates and long-term yield as well as variances in the typical capital structure of marketplace participants. given current economic conditions, it is possible that the discount rate will fluctuate in the near term. we engaged third party experts to assist in the determination of the weighted-average cost of capital used to discount the cash flows for our family dollar reporting unit. the weighted-average cost of capital used to discount the cash flows for our evaluation was 9.5% for our fiscal 2022 analysis.
our evaluation of goodwill did not result in impairment charges being recorded in fiscal 2022, 2021 or 2020.
indefinite-lived intangible assets, such as the family dollar trade name, are not subject to amortization but are reviewed at least annually for impairment. the indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment evaluations are performed by comparing the fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible assets to their carrying values. we estimate the fair value of our trade name intangible asset based on an income approach using the relief-from-royalty method. this approach is dependent upon a number of factors, including estimates of future growth and trends, royalty rates, discount rates and other variables. we base our fair value estimates on assumptions we believe to be reasonable, but which are inherently uncertain. the discount rate includes a premium compared to the discount rate used for the family dollar goodwill impairment evaluation due to the inherently higher risk profile of intangible assets compared to the overall reporting unit.
our evaluation of the family dollar trade name did not result in impairment charges during fiscal 2022, 2021 or 2020.
for additional information related to goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets, including the related impairment evaluations, refer to note 1 to our consolidated financial statements under the caption "goodwill and nonamortizing intangible assets." for additional information related to uncertainties associated with the key assumptions and any potential events and/or circumstances that could have a negative effect on the key assumptions, please refer to "item 1a. risk factors" and elsewhere within this "item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations." if our assumptions and related estimates change in the future, we may be required to record impairment charges against earnings in future periods. any impairment charges that we may take in the future could be material to our results of operations and financial condition.

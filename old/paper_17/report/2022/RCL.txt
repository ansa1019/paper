item 1a. risk factors the risk factors set forth below and elsewhere in this annual report on form 10-k are important factors that could cause actual results to differ from expected or historical results. it is not possible to predict or identify all such risks. there may be additional risks that we consider not to be material, or which are not known, and any of these risks could affect our operations. the ordering of the risk factors set forth below is not intended to reflect a risk's potential likelihood or magnitude. see item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations for a cautionary note regarding forward-looking statements.
macroeconomic, business, market and operational risks adverse economic or other conditions could reduce the demand for cruises and passenger spending, adversely impacting our operating results, cash flows and financial condition including impairing the value of our goodwill, ships, trademarks and other assets and potentially affecting other critical accounting estimates where the impact may be material to our operating results.
demand for cruises is affected by international, national, and local economic conditions. weak or uncertain economic conditions may impact consumer confidence and pose a risk as vacationers postpone or reduce discretionary spending. this, in turn, may result in cruise booking slowdowns, decreased cruise prices and lower onboard revenues. given the global nature of our business, we are exposed to many different economies, and our business could be negatively impacted by challenging conditions in any of the markets in which we operate, and/or related reactions by our competitors in such markets.
our operating costs could increase due to market forces and economic or geopolitical factors beyond our control.
our operating costs, including fuel, food, payroll and benefits, airfare, taxes, insurance, and security costs, can be and have been subject to increases due to market forces and economic or geopolitical conditions or other factors beyond our control, including global inflationary pressures, which have increased our operating costs. increases in these operating costs have affected, and may continue to adversely affect, our future profitability.
in particular, increases in fuel prices have and could continue to materially and adversely affect our business as fuel prices impact not only our fuel costs, but also some of our other expenses, such as crew travel, freight, and commodity prices. mandatory fuel restrictions may also create uncertainty related to the price and availability of certain fuel types potentially impacting operating costs.
price increases for commercial airline services for our guests or major changes or reduction in commercial airline services and/or availability could adversely impact the demand for cruises and undermine our ability to provide reasonably priced vacation packages to our guests.
many of our guests depend on scheduled commercial airline services to transport them to or from the ports where our cruises embark or disembark. increases in the price of airfare would increase the overall price of the cruise vacation to our guests, which may adversely impact demand for our cruises. in addition, changes in the availability and/or regulations governing commercial airline services could adversely affect our guests' ability to obtain air travel, as well as our ability to transfer our guests to or from our cruise ships, which could adversely affect our results of operations.
terrorist attacks, war, and other similar events could have a material adverse impact on our business and results of operations.
we are susceptible to a wide range of adverse events, including terrorist attacks, war, conflicts, civil unrest and other hostilities. the occurrence of these events or an escalation in the frequency or severity of them, and the resulting political instability, travel restrictions and advisories and concerns over safety and security aspects of traveling or the fear of any of the foregoing, have had, and could have in the future, a significant adverse impact on demand and pricing in the travel and vacation industry. these events could also result in additional security measures taken by local authorities which have, and may in the future, impact access to ports and/or destinations. in addition, such events have led, and could lead, to disruptions, instability and volatility in global markets, supply chains and industries, increased operating costs, such as fuel and food, and disruptions affecting our newbuild construction and fleet modernization efforts, any of which could materially and adversely impact our business and results of operations. further, such events could have the effect of heightening the other risks we have described in this report, any of which also could materially and adversely affect our business and results of operations.
disease outbreaks and an increase in concern about the risk of illness could adversely impact our business and results of operations, and may cause significant disruptions, create new risks, and exacerbate existing risks.
disease outbreaks and increased concern related to illness when traveling to, from, and on our ships such as covid-19 could cause a drop in demand for cruises, guest cancellations, travel restrictions, an unavailability of ports and/or destinations, cruise cancellations, ship redeployments and an inability to source our crew, provisions or supplies from certain places. in addition, we may be subject to increased concerns that cruises are more susceptible than other vacation alternatives to the spread of infectious diseases. for example, the unprecedented responses by governments and other authorities to control and contain the covid-19 outbreak, including related variants, led to our voluntary suspension of our global cruise operations starting in march 2020. while we have resumed our global cruise operations, there is no assurance that our cruise operations will continue uninterrupted. in response to disease outbreaks, our industry, including our passengers and crew, may be subject to enhanced health and safety requirements in the future which may be costly and take a significant amount of time to implement across our fleet. for example, local governments may establish their own set of rules for self-quarantines and/or require proof of individuals' health status or vaccination prior to or upon visiting. based on our assessment of these requirements and recommendations, or for other reasons, we may determine it necessary to cancel or modify certain of our global brands' cruise sailings. the impact of any of these factors could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. in addition, any operating or health protocols that we may develop or that may be required by law in the future in response to infectious diseases may be costly to develop and implement and may be less effective than we expected in reducing the risk of infection and spread of such disease on our cruise ships, all of which will negatively impact our operations and expose us to reputational and legal risks.
incidents on ships, at port facilities, land destinations and/or affecting the cruise vacation industry in general, and the associated negative media coverage and publicity, have affected and could continue to affect our reputation and impact our sales and results of operations.
cruise ships, private destinations, port facilities and shore excursions operated and/or offered by us and third parties may be susceptible to the risk of accidents, illnesses, mechanical failures, environmental incidents and other incidents which could bring into question safety, health, security and vacation satisfaction and negatively impact our sales, operations and reputation. incidents involving cruise ships, and, in particular the safety, health and security of guests and crew and the media coverage thereof, including those related to the covid-19 pandemic, have impacted and could continue to impact demand for our cruises and pricing in the industry. in particular, we cannot predict the impact on our financial performance and the public's concern regarding the health and safety of travel, especially by cruise ship, and related decreases in demand for travel and cruising. moreover, our ability to attract and retain guests and crew depends, in part, upon the perception and reputation of our company and our brands and the public's concerns regarding the health and safety of travel generally, as well as regarding the cruising industry and our ships specifically. our reputation and our business could also be damaged by continued or additional negative publicity regarding the cruise industry in general, including publicity regarding the spread of contagious disease such as covid-19, over-tourism in key ports and destinations and the potentially adverse environmental impacts of cruising. the considerable expansion in the use of social and digital media has compounded the potential scope and reach of any negative publicity. in addition, incidents involving cruise ships may result in additional costs to our business, increasing government or other regulatory oversight and, in certain cases, potential litigation.
significant weather, climate events and/or natural disasters could adversely impact our business and results of operations.
natural disasters (e.g., earthquakes, volcanos, wildfires), weather and/or climate events (including hurricanes and typhoons) could impact our source markets and operations resulting in travel restrictions, guest cancellations, an inability to source our crew or our provisions and supplies from certain places. we are often forced to alter itineraries and occasionally cancel a cruise or a series of cruises or to redeploy our ships due to these types of events, which could have an adverse effect on our sales, operating costs and profitability in the current and future periods. increases in the frequency, severity or duration of these types of events could exacerbate their impact and disrupt our operations or make certain destinations less desirable or unavailable impacting our revenues and profitability further. any of the foregoing could have an adverse impact on our results of operations and on industry performance.
our sustainability activities, including environmental, social and governance (esg) matters, could result in reputational risks, increased costs and other risks.
customers, investors, lenders, regulators and other industry stakeholders have placed increasing importance on corporate esg practices and on the implications and social cost of their investments, which could cause us to incur additional costs and changes to our operations. if our esg practices or disclosures do not meet stakeholders' evolving expectations and standards, our customer and employee retention, our access to certain types of capital, including export credit financing, and our brands and reputation may be negatively impacted, which could affect our business operations and financial condition. we could also incur additional costs and require additional resources to monitor, report and comply with various esg practices, which could increase our operating costs and affect our results of operations and financial condition.
in addition, from time to time, we communicate certain initiatives regarding climate change and other esg matters. we could fail or be perceived to fail to achieve such initiatives, which may negatively affect our reputation. the future adoption of new technology or processes to achieve the initiatives could also result in the impairment of existing assets.
our reliance on shipyards, their subcontractors and our suppliers to implement our newbuild and ship upgrade programs and to repair and maintain our ships exposes us to risks which could adversely impact our business.
we rely on shipyards, their subcontractors and our suppliers to effectively construct our new ships and to repair, maintain, and upgrade our existing ships on a timely basis and in a cost effective manner. there are a limited number of shipyards with the capability and capacity to build, repair, maintain and/or upgrade our ships. as such, any disruptions affecting the newbuild or fleet modernization supply chain will adversely impact our business as there are limited substitutes.
suspensions and/or slowdowns of work at shipyards, have impacted and could continue to impact our ability to construct new ships as planned, our ability to timely and cost-effectively procure new capacity, and our ability to execute scheduled drydocks and/or fleet modernizations. for instance, the effects of the covid-19 pandemic on the shipyards, their subcontractors, and our suppliers have resulted in delays in our previously scheduled ship deliveries. variations from our plan could have a significant negative impact on our business operations and financial condition.
building, repairing, maintaining and/or upgrading a ship is sophisticated work that involves significant risks. material increases in commodity and raw material prices, and other cost pressures impacting the construction of a new ship, such as the cost of labor and financing, could adversely impact the shipyard's ability to build the ship on a cost-effective basis. we may be impacted if shipyards, their subcontractors, and/or our suppliers encounter financial difficulties, supply chain, technical or design problems when building or repairing a ship. these problems have impacted and may in the future impact the timely delivery or cost of new ships or the ability of shipyards to repair and upgrade our fleet in accordance with our needs or expectations. in addition, delays, mechanical faults and/or unforeseen incidents may result in cancellation of cruises or delays of new ship orders or necessitate unscheduled drydocks. such events could result in lost revenue, increased operating expenses, or both, and thus adversely affect our results of operations.
an increase in capacity worldwide or excess capacity in a particular market could adversely impact our cruise sales and/or pricing.
although our ships can be redeployed, cruise sales and/or pricing may be impacted by the introduction of new ships into the marketplace, reductions in cruise capacity, overall market growth and deployment decisions of ourselves and our competitors. as of december 31, 2022, a total of 63 new ships with approximately 143,000 berths were on order for delivery through 2028 in the cruise industry, including 10 ships currently scheduled to be delivered to our global and partner brands. the further net growth in capacity from these new ships and future orders, without an increase in the cruise industry's demand and/or share of the vacation market, could depress cruise prices and impede our ability to achieve yield improvement.
in addition, to the extent that we or our competitors deploy ships to a particular itinerary/region and the resulting capacity in that region exceeds the demand, it may negatively affect our pricing and profitability. any of the foregoing could have an adverse impact on our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition, including potentially impairing the value of our ships and other assets.
unavailability of ports of call may adversely affect our results of operations.
we believe that port destinations are a major reason why guests choose to go on a particular cruise or on a cruise vacation. the availability of ports and destinations is affected by a number of factors, including industry demand and competition for key ports and destinations, existing capacity constraints, constraints related to the size of certain ships, security, financial limitations on port development, exclusivity arrangements that ports may have with our competitors, geopolitical developments, local governmental regulations, environmental regulations, and governmental response to disease outbreaks. higher fuel costs also may adversely impact the destinations on certain of our itineraries as they become too costly to include.
in addition, certain ports and destinations have faced a surge of both cruise and non-cruise tourism which, in certain cases, has fueled anti-tourism sentiments and related countermeasures to limit the volume of tourists allowed in these destinations. in certain destinations, countermeasures to limit the volume of tourists have been contemplated and/or put into effect, including proposed limits on cruise ships and cruise passengers, which could limit the itinerary and destination options we can offer our passengers going forward.
increased demand and competition for key ports of call or destinations, limitations on the availability or feasibility of use of specific ports of call and/or constraints on the availability of shore excursions and other service providers at such ports or destinations could adversely affect our operations and financial results.
we may lose business to competitors throughout the vacation market.
we operate in the vacation market and cruising is one of many alternatives for people choosing a vacation. we, therefore, risk losing business not only to other cruise lines, but also to other vacation operators, which provide other leisure options, including hotels, resorts, internet-based alternative lodging sites and package holidays and tours.
we face significant competition from other cruise lines on the basis of cruise pricing, travel advisor preference and also in terms of the nature of ships, services and destinations that we offer to guests. our revenues are sensitive to the actions of other cruise lines in many areas including pricing, scheduling, capacity and promotions, which can have a substantial adverse impact not only on our revenues, but also on overall industry revenues.
in the event that we do not effectively market or differentiate our cruise brands from our competitors or otherwise compete effectively with other vacation alternatives and new or existing cruise companies, our results of operations and financial position could be adversely affected.
if we are unable to appropriately manage our cost and capital allocation strategies with our goal of satisfying guest expectations, it may adversely impact our business success.
we strive to provide high quality products and deliver high quality services. there can be no assurance that we can successfully balance these goals with our cost management and capital allocation strategies. our business also requires us to make capital allocation decisions across a broad scope of investment options with varying return profiles and time horizons for value realization. these include significant capital investment decisions such as ordering new ships, upgrading our existing fleet, enhancing our technology and/or data capabilities and expanding our portfolio of land-based assets, based on expected market preferences, competition and projected demand. there can be no assurance that our strategies will be successful, which could adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations. for example, our ownership and operation of older tonnage, in particular during the business disruption caused by covid-19, has resulted in impaired asset values due to expected returns less than the carrying value of the assets.
our attempts to expand our business into new markets and new ventures may not be successful.
we opportunistically seek to grow our business through, among other things, expansion into new destinations or source markets and establishment of new ventures complementary to our current offerings. these attempts to expand our business increase the complexity of our business, require significant levels of investment and can strain our management, personnel, operations and systems. in addition, we may be unable to execute our attempts to expand our business. there can be no assurance that these business expansion efforts will develop as anticipated or that we will succeed, and if we do not, we may be unable to recover our investment, which could adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.
risks associated with our development and operation of key land-based destination projects may adversely impact our business or results of operations.
we have invested, either directly or indirectly through joint ventures and partnerships, in a growing portfolio of key land-based projects including port and terminal facilities, private destinations and multi-brand destination projects. these investments can increase our exposure to certain key risks depending on the scope, location, and the ownership and management structure of these projects. these risks include susceptibility to weather events, exposure to local political/regulatory developments and policies, logistical challenges and human resource and labor risks and safety, environmental, and health risks, including challenges posed by the covid-19 pandemic and its effects locally where we have these projects and relationships.
our reliance on travel advisors to sell and market our cruises exposes us to certain risks which could adversely impact our business.
we rely on travel advisors to generate bookings for our ships. accordingly, we must maintain competitive commission rates and incentive structures. if we fail to offer competitive compensation packages or fail to maintain our relationships, these agencies may be incentivized to sell cruises offered by our competitors, which could adversely impact our operating results. our reliance on third-party sellers is particularly pronounced in certain markets. in addition, the travel advisor community is sensitive to economic conditions that impact discretionary income of consumers. significant disruptions, such as those caused by the covid-19 pandemic, or contractions in the industry could reduce the number of travel advisors available for us to market and sell our cruises, which could have an adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations. additionally, the strength of our recovery from suspended operations could be delayed if we are not aligned and partnered with key travel advisors.
business activities that involve our co-investments with third parties may subject us to additional risks.
partnerships, joint ventures and other business structures involving our co-investments with third parties generally include some form of shared control over the operations of the business and create additional risks, including the possibility that other investors in such ventures become bankrupt or otherwise lack the financial resources to meet their obligations or could have or develop business interests, policies or objectives that are inconsistent with ours. in addition to financial risks, our co-investment activities have also presented managerial and operational risks and expose us to reputational or legal concerns. these or other issues related to our co-investments with third parties could adversely impact our operations or liquidity. further, due to the arrangements we have in place with our partners in these ventures, we are limited in our ability to control the strategy of these ventures, or their use of capital and other key factors to their results of operation, which could adversely affect our investments and impact our results of operations.
past or pending business acquisitions or potential acquisitions that we may decide to pursue in the future carry inherent risks which could adversely impact our financial performance and condition.
the company, from time to time, has engaged in acquisitions and may pursue acquisitions in the future, which are subject to, among other factors, the company's ability to identify attractive business opportunities and to negotiate favorable terms for such opportunities. accordingly, the company cannot make any assurances that potential acquisitions will be completed timely or at all, or that if completed, we would realize the anticipated benefits of such acquisitions. acquisitions also carry inherent risks such as, among others: (i) the potential delay or failure of our efforts to successfully integrate business processes and realizing expected synergies; (ii) difficulty in aligning procedures, controls and/or policies; and (iii) future unknown liabilities and costs that may be associated with an acquisition. in addition, acquisitions may adversely impact our liquidity and/or debt levels, and the recognized value of goodwill and other intangible assets can be negatively affected by unforeseen events and/or circumstances, which may result in an impairment charge. any of the foregoing events could adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations.
we rely on supply chain vendors and third-party service providers who are integral to the operations of our businesses. these vendors and service providers may be unable or unwilling to deliver on their commitments or may act in ways that could harm our business.
we rely on supply chain vendors to deliver key products to the operations of our businesses around the world. any event impacting a vendor's ability to deliver goods of the expected quality at the location and time needed could negatively impact our ability to deliver our cruise experience. events impacting our supply chain could be caused by factors beyond the control of our suppliers or us, including inclement weather, natural disasters, new laws and regulations, labor actions, increased demand, problems in production or distribution, cybersecurity events, and/or disruptions in third-party logistics or transportation systems, including those caused by the covid-19 pandemic. any such interruptions to our supply chain could increase our costs and could limit the availability of products critical to our operations. in addition, increased regulation or stakeholder expectations regarding sourcing practices, or supplier conduct that does not meet such standards, could cause our operating costs to increase or result in publicity that negatively affects our reputation.
in order to achieve cost and operational efficiencies, we outsource to third-party vendors certain services that are integral to the operations of our global businesses, such as our onboard concessionaires, certain of our call center operations, guest port services, logistics distribution and operation of a large part of our information technology systems. we are subject to the risk that certain decisions are subject to the control of our third-party service providers and that these decisions may adversely affect our activities. a failure to adequately monitor a third-party service provider's compliance with a service level agreement or regulatory or legal requirements could result in significant economic and reputational harm to us. there is also a risk the confidentiality, privacy and/or security of data held by third parties or communicated over third-party networks or platforms could become compromised.
the potential unavailability of insurance coverage, an inability to obtain insurance coverage at commercially reasonable rates or our failure to have coverage in sufficient amounts to cover our incurred losses may adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations.
we seek to maintain appropriate insurance coverage at commercially reasonable rates. we normally obtain insurance based on the cost of an asset rather than replacement value, and we also elect to self-insure, co-insure, or use deductibles in certain circumstances for certain risks such as loss of use of a ship or other business interruption. the limits of insurance coverage we purchase are based on the availability of the coverage, evaluation of our risk profile and cost of coverage. we do not carry business interruption insurance and accordingly we have no insurance coverage for loss of revenues or earnings from our ships or other operations. accordingly, we are not protected against all risks and cannot be certain that our coverage will be adequate for liabilities actually incurred which could result in an unexpected decrease in our revenue and results of operations in the event of an incident we are members of four protection and indemnity ("p&i") clubs, which are part of a worldwide group of 12 p&i clubs, known as the international group of p&i clubs (the "ig"). p&i coverage provided by the clubs is on a mutual basis, and we are subject to additional premium calls in the event of a catastrophic loss incurred by any member of the 12 p&i clubs, whereby the reinsurance limits purchased by the ig are exhausted. we are also subject to additional premium calls based on investment and underwriting shortfalls experienced by our own individual insurers.
we cannot be certain that insurance and reinsurance coverage will be available to us and at commercially reasonable rates in the future or at all or, if available, that it will be sufficient to cover potential claims. additionally, if we or other insureds sustain significant losses, the result may be higher insurance premiums, cancellation of coverage, or the inability to obtain coverage. such events could adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations.
disruptions in our shoreside or shipboard operations or our information systems may adversely affect our results of operations.
our principal executive office and principal shoreside operations are located in florida, and we have shoreside offices throughout the world. actual or threatened natural disasters (e.g., hurricanes/typhoons, earthquakes, tornadoes, fires or floods), municipal lockdowns, curfews, quarantines, or similar events in these locations may have a material impact on our business continuity, reputation and results of operations. in addition, substantial or repeated information system failures, computer viruses or cyber attacks impacting our shoreside or shipboard operations could adversely impact our business. we do not generally carry business interruption insurance for our shoreside or shipboard operations or our information systems. as such, any losses or damages incurred by us could have an adverse impact on our results of operations.
provisions of our articles of incorporation, by-laws and liberian law could inhibit a change of control and may prevent efforts by our shareholders to change our management.
certain provisions of our articles of incorporation and by-laws and liberian law may inhibit third parties from effectuating a change of control of the company without approval from our board of directors which could result in the entrenchment of current management. these include provisions in our articles of incorporation that prevent third parties, other than a. wilhelmsen as and cruise associates and their permitted transferees, from acquiring beneficial ownership of more than 4.9% of our outstanding shares without the consent of our board of directors.
we may not be able to achieve our fiscal 2025 financial and climate-related performance goals.
in november 2022, we announced that we are targeting certain financial and climate-related performance goals for fiscal 2025. our ability to achieve these goals is dependent on a number of factors, including the other risk factors described in this section. if we are not able to achieve these goals, the price of our common stock and reputation may be negatively affected.
financial risks we may not be able to obtain sufficient financing or capital for our needs or may not be able to do so on terms that are acceptable or consistent with our expectations.
to fund our capital expenditures (including new ship orders), operations and scheduled debt payments, we have historically relied on a combination of cash flows provided by operations, drawdowns under available credit facilities, the incurrence of additional indebtedness and the sale of equity or debt securities in private or public securities markets. any circumstance or event which leads to a decrease in consumer cruise spending, such as worsening global economic conditions or significant incidents impacting the cruise industry, such as the covid-19 pandemic, negatively affects our operating cash flows. as result of the covid-19 pandemic and the resulting suspension of our operations, we have experienced credit rating downgrades, which have reduced our ability to incur secured indebtedness by reducing the amount of indebtedness that we are permitted to secure, and may negatively impact our access to, and cost of, debt financing. additionally, our ability to raise additional financing, whether or not secured, could be limited if our credit rating is further downgraded, and/or if we fail to comply with applicable covenants governing our outstanding indebtedness, and/or if overall financial market conditions worsen.
our ability to access additional funding as and when needed, our ability to timely refinance and/or replace our outstanding debt securities and credit facilities on acceptable terms and our cost of funding will depend upon numerous factors including, but not limited to, the strength of the financial markets, global market conditions, including inflationary pressures, interest rate fluctuations, our recovery and financial performance, the recovery and performance of our industry in general and the size, scope and timing of our financial needs. in addition, even where financing commitments have been secured, significant disruptions in the capital and credit markets could cause our banking and other counterparties to breach their contractual obligations to us or could cause the conditions to the availability of such funding not to be satisfied. this could include failures of banks or other financial service companies to fund required borrowings under our loan agreements or to pay us amounts that may become due or return collateral that is refundable under our interest rate derivative instruments or other agreements. if any of the foregoing occurs for a prolonged period of time it will have a long-term negative impact on our cash flows and our ability to meet our financial obligations.
our substantial debt requires a significant amount of cash to service and could adversely affect our financial condition.
we have a substantial amount of debt and significant debt service obligations. as of december 31, 2022, we had total debt of $23.4 billion. our substantial debt has required us to dedicate a large portion of our cash flow from operations to service debt and fund repayments on our debt, thereby reducing the availability of our cash flow to fund working capital, capital expenditures and other general corporate expenses.
our ability to make future scheduled payments on our debt service obligations or refinance our debt depends on our future operating and financial performance and ability to generate cash. this will be affected by our ability to successfully implement our business strategy, as well as general economic, financial, competitive, regulatory and other factors beyond our control, such as the disruption caused by the covid-19 pandemic. if we cannot generate sufficient cash to meet our debt service obligations or fund our other business needs, we may, among other things, need to refinance all or a portion of our debt, obtain additional financing, delay planned capital expenditures or sell assets. we cannot assure that we will be able to generate sufficient cash through any of the foregoing. if we are not able to refinance any of our debt, obtain additional financing or sell assets on commercially reasonable terms or at all, we may not be able to satisfy our obligations with respect to our debt.
our substantial debt could also result in other negative consequences for us. for example, it could increase our vulnerability to adverse general economic or industry conditions; limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business or the industry in which we operate; place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less debt; make us more vulnerable to downturns in our business, the economy or the industry in which we operate; limit our ability to raise additional debt or equity capital in the future to satisfy our requirements relating to working capital, capital expenditures, development projects, strategic initiatives or other purposes; restrict us from making strategic acquisitions, introducing new technologies or exploiting business opportunities; limit or restrict our ability to obtain and maintain performance bonds to cover our financial responsibility requirements in various jurisdictions for non-performance of guest travel, casualty and personal injury; make it difficult for us to satisfy our obligations with respect to our debt; and increase our exposure to the risk of increased interest rates as certain of our borrowings are (and may in the future be) at a variable rate of interest.
despite our leverage, we may incur more debt, which could adversely affect our business.
we may incur substantial additional debt in the future. except for the restrictions under the indentures governing our secured notes, our priority guaranteed notes, and certain of our other debt instruments, including our unsecured bank and export credit facilities, we are not restricted under the terms of our debt instruments from incurring additional debt. although the indentures governing the secured notes, the priority guaranteed notes, and certain of our other debt instruments, including our unsecured bank and export credit facilities, contain restrictions on the incurrence of additional debt, these restrictions are subject to a number of significant qualifications and exceptions, and under certain circumstances the amount of debt that could be incurred in compliance with these restrictions could be substantial. if new debt is added to our existing debt levels, the related risks that we now face would increase. additionally, there is no guarantee that financing will be available in the future or that such financing will be available with similar terms or terms that are commercially acceptable to us. as of december 31, 2022, we have commitments for approximately $7.1 billion of debt to finance the purchase of 7 ships on order by our royal caribbean international, celebrity cruises and silversea cruises brands, all of which are guaranteed by the export credit agencies in the countries in which the ships are being built. the ultimate size of each facility will depend on the final contract price (including change orders and owner's supply) as well as fluctuations in the eur/usd exchange rate. refer to note 8. debt to our consolidated financial statements under item 8. financial statements and supplementary data for further information regarding our "secured notes" and "priority guaranteed notes".
we are subject to restrictive debt covenants that may limit our ability to finance our future operations and capital needs and to pursue business opportunities and activities. in addition, if we fail to comply with any of these restrictions, it could have a material adverse effect on us.
certain of our debt instruments, including our indentures and our unsecured bank and export credit facilities, limit our flexibility in operating our business. for example, certain of our loan agreements and indentures restrict or limit our and our subsidiaries' ability to, among other things, incur or guarantee additional indebtedness; pay dividends or distributions on, or redeem or repurchase capital stock and make other restricted payments; make investments; consummate certain asset sales; engage in certain transactions with affiliates; grant or assume certain liens; and consolidate, merge or transfer all or substantially all of our assets. in addition, both our export credit facilities and our non-export credit facilities contain covenants that require us, among other things, to maintain a minimum liquidity, a specified minimum fixed charge coverage ratio, and limit our net debt-to-capital ratio. in addition, our eca facilities also require us to maintain a minimum stockholders' equity. refer to note 8. debt to our consolidated financial statements under item 8. financial statements and supplementary data for further discussion on our covenants and existing waivers.
all of these limitations are subject to significant exceptions and qualifications. despite these exceptions and qualifications, we cannot assure you that the operating and financial restrictions and covenants in certain of our debt instruments will not adversely affect our ability to finance our future operations or capital needs or engage in other business activities that may be in our interest. any future indebtedness may include similar or other restrictive terms and we may be required to further encumber our assets. in addition, our ability to comply with these covenants and restrictions may be affected by events beyond our control. these include prevailing economic, financial and industry conditions. if we breach any of these covenants or restrictions, we could be in default under such indebtedness and certain of our other debt instruments, and the relevant debt holders or lenders could elect to declare the debt, together with accrued and unpaid interest and other fees, if any, immediately due and payable and proceed against any collateral securing that debt. if the debt under certain of our debt instruments that we enter into were to be accelerated, our liquid assets may be insufficient to repay in full such indebtedness. borrowings under other debt instruments that contain cross-default provisions also may be accelerated or become payable on demand. in these circumstances, our assets may not be sufficient to repay in full that indebtedness and our other indebtedness then outstanding.
in addition, our ability to maintain our credit facilities may also be impacted by changes in our ownership base. more specifically, we may be required to prepay our non-eca and eca facilities if any person acquires ownership of more than 50% of our common stock or, subject to certain exceptions, during any 24-month period, a majority of our board of directors is no longer comprised of individuals who were members of our board of directors on the first day of such period. our debt securities also contain change of control provisions that would be triggered by a third-party acquisition of greater than 50% of our common stock coupled with a ratings downgrade, which would require us to offer to repurchase our debt securities in the event of such change of control.
if we elect to settle conversions of our convertible notes in shares of our common stock or a combination of cash and shares of our common stock, conversions of our convertible notes will result in dilution for our existing shareholders. furthermore, new equity or convertible debt issuances will also result in dilution for our existing shareholders.
we have an aggregate principal amount of $1.7 billion in convertible notes outstanding. if note holders elect to convert, the notes will be converted into our shares of common stock, cash, or a combination of common stock and cash, at our discretion. prior to march 15, 2023, august 15, 2023, and may 15, 2025, our convertible notes issued in june 2020, october 2020, and august 2022, respectively, will be convertible at the option of holders during certain periods only upon satisfaction of certain conditions. beyond those dates, the convertible notes will be convertible at any time until the close of business on the second scheduled trading day immediately preceding their maturity date. conversions of our convertible notes into shares of our common stock or a combination of common stock and cash, will result in dilution to our shareholders. additionally, if we raise additional funds through equity or convertible debt issuances, our shareholders could experience dilution of their ownership interest, and these equity or convertible debt securities could have rights, preferences, and privileges that are superior to that of holders of our common stock.
we did not declare quarterly dividends on our common stock in the quarter ended december 31, 2022 and do not expect to pay dividends on our common stock for the foreseeable future.
we have not declared a dividend since the first quarter of 2020. we expect that any income received from operations will be devoted to our future operations and recovery. we do not expect to pay cash dividends on our common stock for the foreseeable future. in addition, in the event we thereafter declare a dividend, we will need to repay our amounts deferred under the export credit facilities. payment of dividends would, in any case, depend upon our profitability at the time, cash available for those dividends, and other factors as our board of directors may consider relevant.
increased regulatory oversight, and the phasing out of libor may adversely affect the value of a portion of our indebtedness.
the publication of certain libor settings ceased after december 31, 2021, and uncertainty regarding alternative reference rates remains as many market participants await a wider adoption of replacement products prior to the cessation of the remaining usd libor tenors (currently scheduled for june 30, 2023). when libor ceases to exist, the level of interest payments on the portion of our indebtedness that bears interest at variable rates might be affected if we, the agent, and/or the lenders holding a majority of the outstanding loans or commitments under such indebtedness fail to amend such indebtedness to implement a replacement rate. regardless, such replacement rate will give due consideration to any evolving or then-existing conventions for similar credit facilities, which may result in different than expected interest payments.
compliance and regulatory risks changes in u.s. or other countries' foreign travel policy have affected, and may continue to affect our results of operations.
changes in u.s. and other countries' foreign policy have in the past and could in the future result in the imposition of travel restrictions or travel bans on persons to certain countries or result in the imposition of travel advisories, warnings, rules, regulations or legislation exposing us to penalties or claims of monetary damages. in addition, some countries have adopted restrictions against u.s. travelers, and we currently cannot predict when those restrictions will be eased. the timing and scope of these changes and regulations can be unpredictable, and they could cause us to cancel scheduled sailings, possibly on short notice, or could result in litigation against us. this, in turn, could decrease our revenue, increase our operating costs and otherwise impair our profitability.
factors associated with climate change, including an increasing global regulatory focus, could adversely affect our business.
there is increasing global regulatory focus on climate change, greenhouse gas and other emissions. these regulatory efforts,both internationally and in the u.s., are still developing, including the international alignment of such efforts, and we cannot yet determine what the final regulatory programs or their impact will be on our business. however, such climate change-related regulatory activity in the future may adversely affect our business and financial results by requiring us to reduce our emissions, pay for our emissions, modify our itineraries and may increase our exposure, if any, to climate change-related litigation. such activity may also impact us by increasing our operating costs, including fuel costs. for example, the european union has proposed a series of significant carbon reforms under its fit for 55 package designed to meet its 2030 emission goals, which would require us, among other things, to increase the use of low carbon fuel onboard our vessels as well as connectivity to shore power. the proposed legislation also includes updates to the european union emission trading system which would impose requirements to purchase carbon emission allowances beginning in 2024. in addition, the u.s. and various state and foreign government or regulatory agencies have enacted, or may enact, environmental regulations or policies, such as requiring the use of low sulfur fuels (e.g., imo sulfur limit) or the incoming carbon intensity indicator regulation, that have or could increase our direct cost to operate in certain markets, increase our cost of fuel, limit the supply of compliant fuel, cause us to incur significant expenses to purchase and/or develop new equipment and adversely impact the cruise vacation industry. if enacted, these regulations may individually or collectively have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations due to increased costs associated with compliance and modified itineraries in the affected regions.
there has also been growing environmental scrutiny of the environmental impact of the cruise vacation industry, and some environmental groups are advocating for more stringent regulation of ship emissions at berth and at sea. this negative publicity of the cruise industry and any related measures may lead to changes in consumer preferences, such as methods or frequency of travel, which could adversely impact our operations and financial results and subject us to reputational impacts and costs.
labor, health and safety, financial responsibility and other maritime regulations and measures could affect operations and increase operating costs.
we are subject to various international, national, state and local laws, regulations and treaties that govern, among other things, discharge from our ships, safety standards applicable to our ships, treatment of disabled persons, health and sanitary standards applicable to our guests, security standards on board our ships and at the ship/port interface areas, and financial responsibilities to our guests. these issues are, and we believe will continue to be, an area of focus by the relevant authorities throughout the world. this could result in the enactment of more stringent regulation of cruise ships that could subject us to increasing compliance costs in the future and may increase our exposure, if any, to environmental-related litigation.
a change in our tax status under the u.s. internal revenue code, or other jurisdictions, may have adverse effects on our results of operations.
royal caribbean cruises ltd. and a number of our subsidiaries are foreign corporations that derive income from a u.s. trade or business and/or from sources within the u.s. in connection with the year end audit, each year, faegre drinker biddle & reath llp, our u.s. tax counsel, delivers to us an opinion, based on certain representations and assumptions set forth in it, to the effect that this income, to the extent derived from or incidental to the international operation of a ship or ships, is excluded from gross income for u.s. federal income tax purposes pursuant to section 883 of the internal revenue code. we believe that most of our income (including that of our subsidiaries) is derived from or incidental to the international operation of ships.
our ability to rely on section 883 could be challenged or could change in the future. provisions of the internal revenue code, including section 883, are subject to legislative change at any time. moreover, changes could occur in the future with respect to the identity, residence or holdings of our direct or indirect shareholders, trading volume or trading frequency of our shares, or relevant foreign tax laws of liberia or the bahamas, such that they no longer qualify as equivalent exemption jurisdictions, that could affect our eligibility for the section 883 exemption. accordingly, there can be no assurance that we will continue to be exempt from u.s. income tax on u.s. source shipping income in the future. if we were not entitled to the benefit of section 883, we and our subsidiaries would be subject to u.s. taxation on a portion of the income derived from or incidental to the international operation of our ships, which would reduce our net income.
additionally, portions of our business are operated by companies that are within the united kingdom tonnage tax regime. further, some of our operations are conducted in jurisdictions where we rely on tax treaties to provide exemption from taxation. to the extent the united kingdom tonnage tax laws change or we do not continue to meet the applicable qualification requirements or if tax treaties are changed or revoked, we may be required to pay higher income tax in these jurisdictions, adversely impacting our results of operations.
numerous countries are considering implementation of the oecd's 15% global minimum tax, which may materially impact us. in addition, as budgetary constraints may adversely impact fiscal policy in the jurisdictions in which we operate, we may be subject to changes in our existing tax treatment or other tax reform, as well as increased tax audits.
we are not a u.s. corporation and, as a result, our shareholders may be subject to the uncertainties of a foreign legal system in protecting their interests.
our corporate affairs are governed by our articles of incorporation and by-laws and by the business corporation act of liberia. the provisions of the business corporation act of liberia resemble provisions of the corporation laws of a number of states in the u.s. however, there are very few judicial cases in liberia interpreting the business corporation act of liberia. while the business corporation act of liberia provides that it is to be applied and construed to make the laws of liberia, with respect of the subject matter of the business corporation act of liberia, uniform with the laws of the state of delaware and other states with substantially similar legislative provisions (and adopts their case law to the extent it is non-conflicting), there have been few liberian court cases interpreting the business corporation act of liberia, and we cannot predict whether liberian courts would reach the same conclusions as united states courts. we understand that legislation has been proposed but not yet adopted by the liberian legislature which amends the provisions regarding the adoption of non-liberian law to, among other things, provide for the adoption of the statutory and case law of delaware and not also states with substantially similar legislative provisions, and potentially provide the courts of liberia discretion in application of non-statutory corporation law of delaware in cases when the laws of liberia are silent. the right of shareholders to bring a derivative action in liberian courts may be more limited than in u.s. jurisdictions. there may also be practical difficulties for shareholders attempting to bring suit in liberia, and liberian courts may or may not recognize and enforce foreign judgments. thus, our shareholders may have more difficulty challenging actions taken by management, directors or controlling shareholders than would shareholders of a corporation incorporated in a u.s. jurisdiction.
general risk factors conducting business globally results in increased costs and other risks.
we operate our business globally, which exposes us to a number of risks, including increased exposure to a wider range of regional and local economic conditions, volatile local political conditions, potential changes in duties and taxes, including changing and/or uncertain interpretations of existing tax laws and regulations, required compliance with additional laws and policies affecting cruising, vacation or maritime businesses or governing the operations of foreign-based companies, currency fluctuations, interest rate movements, difficulties in operating under local business environments, port quality and availability in certain regions, u.s. and global anti-bribery laws and regulations, imposition of trade barriers and restrictions on repatriation of earnings.
our future growth strategies increasingly depend on the growth and sustained profitability of international markets. factors that will be critical to our success in these markets include our ability to continue to raise awareness of our products and our ability to adapt our offerings to best suit rapidly evolving consumer demands. the execution of our planned growth strategies is dependent on meeting the governmental and regulatory measures and policies in each of these markets. our ability to realize our future growth strategy is highly dependent on our ability to satisfy country-specific policies and requirements in order to return to service, as well as meet the needs of region-specific consumer preferences as services come back online. these factors may cause us to reevaluate some of our international business strategies.
operating globally also exposes us to numerous and sometimes conflicting legal, regulatory and tax requirements. in many parts of the world, including countries in which we operate, practices in the local business communities might not conform to international business standards. we cannot guarantee consistent interpretation, application, and enforcement of newly issued rules and regulations, which could place limits on our operations or increase our costs, as well as negatively impact our future growth strategies in our key growth markets. we must adhere to policies designed to promote legal and regulatory compliance as well as applicable laws and regulations. however, we might not be successful in ensuring that our employees, agents, representatives and other third parties with whom we associate properly adhere to applicable laws and regulations. in addition, we may be exposed to the risk of penalties and other liabilities if we fail to comply with all applicable legal and regulatory requirements. failure by us, our employees or any of these third parties to adhere to our policies or applicable laws or regulations could result in penalties, sanctions, damage to our reputation and related costs, which in turn could negatively affect our results of operations and cash flows.
as a global operator, our business also may be impacted by changes in u.s. policy or priorities in areas such as trade, immigration and/or environmental or labor regulations, among others. depending on the nature and scope of any such changes, they could impact our domestic and international business operations. any such changes, and any international response to them, could potentially introduce new barriers to passenger or crew travel and/or cross border transactions, impact our guest experience and/or increase our operating costs.
if we are unable to address these risks adequately, our financial position and results of operations could be adversely affected, including impairing the value of our ships and other assets.
the terms of our existing debt financing gives, and any future preferred equity or debt financing may give, holders of any preferred securities or debt securities rights that are senior to rights of our common shareholders.
the holders of our existing debt have rights, preferences and privileges senior to those of holders of our common stock in the event of liquidation. if we incur additional debt or raise equity through the issuance of preferred stock or convertible securities, the terms of the debt or the preferred stock issued may give the holders rights, preferences and privileges senior to those of holders of our common stock, particularly in the event of liquidation. if we raise funds through the issuance of additional equity, the ownership percentage of our existing shareholders would be diluted.
fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, fuel prices and interest rates could affect our financial results.
we are exposed to market risk attributable to changes in foreign currency exchange rates, fuel prices and interest rates. significant changes in any of the foregoing could have a material impact on our financial results, net of the impact of our hedging activities and natural offsets. our operating results have been and will continue to be impacted, often significantly, by changes in each of these factors a portion of our indebtedness bears interest at variable rates that are linked to changing market interest rates. as a result, an increase in market interest rates would increase our interest expense and our debt service obligations. as of december 31, 2022, we had approximately $6.0 billion of indebtedness that bears interest at variable rates, which is net of our interest rate swap agreements. this amount represented approximately 25.0% of our total indebtedness. as of december 31, 2022, a hypothetical 1% increase in prevailing interest rates would increase our forecasted 2023 interest expense by approximately $34.8 million. additionally, the value of our earnings in foreign currencies is adversely impacted by a strong u.s. dollar.
any further impairment of our goodwill, long-lived assets, equity investments and notes receivable could adversely affect our financial condition and operating results.
we evaluate goodwill for impairment on an annual basis, or more frequently when circumstances indicate that the carrying value of a reporting unit may not be recoverable. a challenging operating environment, conditions affecting consumer demand or spending, the deterioration of general macroeconomic conditions, expected ship deliveries, or other factors could result in a change to the future cash flows we expect to derive from our operations. reductions of cash flows used in the valuation analyses may result in the recording of impairments, which could adversely affect our financial condition and operating results.
the loss of key personnel, our inability to recruit or retain qualified personnel, or disruptions among our shipboard personnel could adversely affect our results of operations.
our success depends, in large part, on the skills and contributions of key executives and other employees and on our ability to recruit, develop and retain high quality personnel as well as having adequate succession plans and back-up operating plans for when critical executives are unable to serve. as demand for qualified personnel in the industry grows, we must continue to effectively recruit, train, motivate and retain our employees, both shoreside and on our ships, in order to effectively compete in our industry, maintain our current business and support our projected global growth.
we have in the past and may in the future experience difficulty recruiting and retaining qualified personnel primarily due to competitive labor markets. a prolonged shortage of qualified personnel and/or increased turnover may inhibit our ability to operate our business in an optimal manner, and may result in increased costs if we need to hire temporary personnel, and/or increased wages and/or benefits in order to attract and retain employees, all of which may negatively impact our results of operations.
as of december 31, 2022, approximately 88% of our shipboard employees were covered by collective bargaining agreements. a dispute under our collective bargaining agreements could result in a work stoppage of those employees covered by the agreements. we may not be able to satisfactorily renegotiate these collective bargaining agreements when they expire. in addition, existing collective bargaining agreements may not prevent a strike or work stoppage on our ships. we may also be subject to or affected by work stoppages unrelated to our business or collective bargaining agreements. any such work stoppages or potential work stoppages could have a material adverse effect on our financial results, as could a loss of key employees, our inability to recruit or retain qualified personnel or disruptions among our personnel.
if we are unable to keep pace with developments, design, and implementation in technology, our operations or competitive position could become impaired.
our business continues to demand the use of sophisticated technology and systems. these technologies and systems require significant investment and must be proven, refined, updated, upgraded and/or replaced with more advanced systems in order to continue to meet our customers' demands and expectations as well as to process our information effectively. if we are unable to do so in a timely manner or within reasonable cost parameters, if there are any disruptions, delays or deficiencies in design or if we are unable to appropriately and timely train our employees to operate any of these new systems, our business could suffer. we also may not achieve the benefits that we anticipate from any new technology or system, which could impair our operating results.
we may be unable to procure appropriate technology in a timely manner or at all or we may incur significant costs in doing so. a failure to adopt the appropriate technology, or a failure or obsolescence in the technology that we have adopted, could adversely affect our results of operations.
we are exposed to cyber security attacks and data breaches and the risks and costs associated with protecting our systems and maintaining data integrity and security.
we are subject to cyber security attacks. these cyber attacks can vary in scope and intent from attacks with the objective of compromising our systems, networks, and communications for economic gain or with the objective of disrupting, disabling or otherwise compromising our maritime and/or shoreside operations. the attacks can encompass a wide range of methods and intent, including phishing attacks, illegitimate requests for payment, theft of intellectual property, theft of confidential or non-public information, installation of malware, installation of ransomware and theft of personal or business information. the frequency and sophistication of, and methods used to conduct, these attacks, have increased over time.
a successful cyber security attack may target us directly, or it may be the result of a third party's inadequate care, or resulting from vulnerabilities in licensed software. in either scenario, the company may suffer damage to its systems and data that could interrupt our operations, adversely impact our brand reputation, and expose us to increased risks of governmental investigation, litigation, fines, and other liability, any of which could adversely affect our business. furthermore, responding to such an attack and mitigating the risk of future attacks could result in additional operating and capital costs in technology, personnel, monitoring and other investments.
we are also subject to various risks associated with the collection, handling, storage, and transmission of sensitive information. in the regular course of business, we collect employee, customer, and other third-party data, including personally identifiable information and individual payment data, for various business purposes. although we have policies and procedures in place to safeguard such sensitive information, this information has been and could be subject to cyber security attacks and the aforementioned risks. in addition, we are subject to federal, state, and international laws relating to the collection, use, retention, security and transfer of personally identifiable information and individual payment data. those laws include, among others, the european union general data protection regulation and regulations of the new york state department of financial services and similar state agencies that impose additional cyber security requirements as a result of our provision of certain insurance products. complying with these and other applicable laws has caused, and may cause, us to incur substantial costs or require us to change our business practices, and our failure to do so may expose us to substantial fines, penalties, restrictions, litigation, or other expenses and adversely affect our business. further, any changes to laws or regulations, including new restrictions or requirements applicable to our business, or an increase in enforcement of existing laws and regulations, could expose us to additional costs and liability and could limit our use and disclosure of such information.
while we continue to evolve our cyber security practices in line with our business' reliance on technology and the changing external threat landscape, and we invest time, effort and financial resources to secure our systems, networks and communications, our security measures cannot provide absolute assurance that we will be successful in preventing or defending from all cyber security attacks impacting our operation. there can be no assurance that any breach or incident will not have a material impact on our operations and financial results.
any breach, theft, loss, or fraudulent use of guest, employee, third-party or company data, could adversely impact our reputation and brand and our ability to retain or attract new customers, and expose us to risks of data loss, business disruption, governmental investigation, litigation and other liability, any of which could adversely affect our business. significant capital investments and other expenditures could be required to remedy the problem and prevent future breaches, including costs associated with additional security technologies, personnel, experts and credit monitoring services for those whose data has been breached. further, if we or our vendors experience significant data security breaches or fail to detect and appropriately respond to significant data security breaches, we could be exposed to government enforcement actions and private litigation.
litigation, enforcement actions, fines or penalties could adversely impact our financial condition or results of operations and/or damage our reputation.
our business is subject to various u.s. and international laws and regulations that could lead to enforcement actions, fines, civil or criminal penalties or the assertion of litigation claims and damages. in addition, improper conduct by our employees, agents or joint venture partners could damage our reputation and/or lead to litigation or legal proceedings that could result in civil or criminal penalties, including substantial monetary fines. in certain circumstances it may not be economical to defend against such matters and/or our legal strategy may not ultimately result in us prevailing in a matter. such events could lead to an adverse impact on our financial condition or results of operations. we cannot predict the quantum or outcome of any such proceedings and the impact that they will have on our financial results, but any such impact may be material. while some of these claims are covered by insurance, we cannot be certain that all of them will be, which could have an adverse impact on our financial condition or results of operations.

overview the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is organized to present the following:
•a review of our critical accounting policies and estimates and of our financial presentation, including discussion of certain operational and financial metrics we utilize to assist us in managing our business;
•a discussion of our results of operations for the year ended december 31, 2022 compared to the same period in 2021; and
•a discussion of our liquidity and capital resources, including our future capital and material cash requirements and potential funding sources.
a discussion of our results of operations, and sources and uses of cash for the year ended december 31, 2021 compared to the year ended december 31, 2020 is included in part ii. item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations of our annual report on form 10-k for the year ended december 31, 2021, filed with the sec on march 1, 2022 and is incorporated by reference into this form 10-k.
critical accounting policies and estimates our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america ("gaap"). (refer to note 1. general and note 2. summary of significant accounting policies to our consolidated financial statements under item 8. financial statements and supplementary data). certain of our accounting policies are deemed "critical," as they require management's highest degree of judgment, estimates and assumptions. we have discussed these accounting policies and estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors. we believe our most critical accounting policies and estimates are as follows:
management's plan and liquidity in the face of the global pandemic impact of covid-19, we paused our guest cruise operations in march 2020 and began resuming guest cruise operations in 2021, with our full fleet in service by june 2022.
as part of our liquidity management, we rely on estimates of our future liquidity which include numerous assumptions that are subject to various risks and uncertainties. the principal assumptions used to estimate our future liquidity consist of:
•expected timing of cash collections for cruise bookings;
•expected sustained increase in revenue per available passenger cruise day;
•expected increase in occupancy levels, reaching historical levels in the spring of 2023; and
•inflationary increases to our operating costs, mostly impacting the expected cost of fuel and food as compared to 2019.
we will continue to pursue various opportunities to raise additional capital to fund obligations associated with future debt maturities and/or to extend the maturity dates associated with our existing indebtedness or facilities. actions to raise capital may include issuances of debt, convertible debt or equity in private or public transactions or entering into new or extended credit facilities.
ship accounting ships represent our most significant assets and are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization. depreciation of ships is generally computed net of a 10%-15% projected residual value, using the straight-line method over the estimated useful life of the asset, which is generally 30-35 years. the 30-35 year useful life and 10%-15% residual value is the weighted-average of all major components of a ship. our useful life and residual value estimates take into consideration the impact of anticipated technological changes, long-term cruise and vacation market conditions and historical useful lives of similarly-built ships. in addition, we take into consideration our estimates of the weighted-average useful lives of the ships' major component systems, such as hull, superstructure, main electric, engines and cabins. we employ a cost allocation methodology at the component level, in order to support the estimated weighted-average useful lives and residual values, as well as to determine the net cost basis of assets being replaced. given the very large and complex nature of our ships, our accounting estimates related to ships and determinations of ship improvement costs to be capitalized require considerable judgment and are inherently uncertain. we do not have cost segregation studies performed to specifically componentize our ship systems. however, we estimate the costs, useful lives and residual values of component systems based principally on general and technical information known about major ship component systems and their lives, as well as our knowledge of the cruise vacation industry. we do not identify and track depreciation by ship component systems, but instead utilize these estimates to determine the net cost basis of assets replaced or refurbished. improvement costs that we believe add value to our ships are capitalized as additions to the ship and depreciated over the shorter of the improvements' estimated useful lives or that of the associated ship. the estimated cost and accumulated depreciation of replaced or refurbished ship components are written off and any resulting losses are recognized within cruise operating expenses in our consolidated statements of comprehensive loss.
we periodically review estimated useful lives and residual values for ongoing reasonableness, considering long term views on our intended use of each class of ships and the planned level of improvements to maintain and enhance vessels within those classes. in the event a factor is identified that may trigger a change in the estimated useful lives and residual values of our ships, a review of the estimate is completed.
we use the deferral method to account for drydocking costs. under the deferral method, drydocking costs incurred are deferred and charged to expense on a straight-line basis over the period to the next scheduled drydock, which we estimate to be a period of thirty to sixty months based on the vessel's age as required by class. deferred drydock costs consist of the costs to drydock the vessel and other costs incurred in connection with the drydock which are necessary to maintain the vessel's class certification. class certification is necessary in order for our cruise ships to be flagged in a specific country, obtain liability insurance and legally operate as passenger cruise ships. the activities associated with those drydocking costs cannot be performed while the vessel is in service and, as such, are done during a drydock as a planned major maintenance activity. the significant deferred drydock costs consist of hauling and wharfage services provided by the drydock facility, hull inspection and related activities (e.g., scraping, pressure cleaning, bottom painting), maintenance to steering propulsion, thruster equipment and ballast tanks, port services such as tugs, pilotage and line handling, and freight associated with these items. we perform a detailed analysis of the various activities performed for each drydock and only defer those costs that are directly related to planned major maintenance activities necessary to maintain class. the costs deferred are related to activities not otherwise routinely periodically performed to maintain a vessel's designed and intended operating capability. repairs and maintenance activities are charged to expense as incurred.
we use judgment when estimating the period between drydocks, which can result in adjustments to the estimated amortization of drydock costs. if the vessel is disposed of before the next drydock, the remaining balance in deferred drydock is written-off to the gain or loss on disposal of vessel in the period in which the sale takes place. we also use judgment when identifying costs incurred during a drydock which are necessary to maintain the vessel's class certification as compared to those costs attributable to repairs and maintenance which are expensed as incurred.
we believe we have made reasonable estimates for ship accounting purposes. however, should certain factors or circumstances cause us to revise our estimates of ship useful lives or projected residual values, depreciation expense could be materially higher or lower. if circumstances cause us to change our assumptions in making determinations as to whether ship improvements should be capitalized, the amounts we expense each year as repairs and maintenance costs could increase, partially offset by a decrease in depreciation expense. if we had reduced our estimated average ship useful life by one year, depreciation expense for 2022 would have increased by approximately $85.0 million. if our ships were estimated to have no residual value, depreciation expense for 2022 would have increased by approximately $307.6 million. we have evaluated our estimated ship useful lives and projected residual values in light of our current environment and determined that there are no changes to these estimates.
valuation of goodwill, indefinite-lived intangible assets and long-lived assets we review goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment at the reporting unit level annually or, when events or circumstances dictate, more frequently. the impairment review for goodwill consists of a qualitative assessment of whether it is more-likely than-not that a reporting unit's fair value is less than its carrying value, and if necessary, a goodwill impairment test. factors to consider when performing the qualitative assessment include general economic conditions, limitations on accessing capital, changes in forecasted operating results, changes in fuel prices and fluctuations in foreign exchange rates.
the goodwill impairment analysis consists of a comparison of the fair value of the reporting unit with its carrying value. we typically estimate the fair value of our reporting units using a discounted cash flow model, which may also include a combination of a market-based valuation approach. the estimation of fair value utilizing discounted expected future cash flows includes numerous uncertainties which require our significant judgment when making assumptions of expected revenues, operating costs, marketing, selling and administrative expenses, interest rates, ship additions and retirements as well as assumptions regarding the cruise vacation industry's competitive environment and general economic and business conditions, among other factors. the principal assumptions used in the discounted cash flow model for our 2022 impairment assessment consisted of:
•forecasted revenues per available passenger cruise day;
•occupancy rates from existing and expected ship deliveries;
•vessel operating expenses;
•terminal growth rate; and
•weighted average cost of capital (i.e., discount rate).
the discounted cash flow model uses the most current projected operating results for the upcoming fiscal year as a base. we discount the projected cash flows using rates specific to the reporting unit based on its weighted-average cost of capital.
if the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying value, no write-down of goodwill is required. as amended by asu no. 2017-04, intangibles - goodwill and other (topic 350) - simplifying the test for goodwill impairment, if the fair value of the reporting unit is less than the carrying value of its net assets, an impairment is recognized based on the amount by which the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, not to exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to such reporting unit. refer to note 4. goodwill to our consolidated financial statements under item 8. financial statements and supplementary data for further information on goodwill.
the impairment review for indefinite-life intangible assets can be performed using a qualitative or quantitative impairment assessment. the quantitative assessment consists of a comparison of the fair value of the asset with its carrying value. we estimate the fair value of these assets using a discounted cash flow model and various valuation methods depending on the nature of the intangible asset, such as the relief-from-royalty method, for trademarks and trade names. the principal assumptions used in the discounted cash flow model for our 2022 impairment assessment consisted of:
•forecasted revenues per available passenger cruise day;
•occupancy rates from existing and expected ship deliveries;
•terminal growth rate;
•royalty rate; and
•weighted average cost of capital (i.e., discount rate).
if the carrying value exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess. if the fair value exceeds its carrying value, the indefinite-life intangible asset is not considered impaired. other intangible assets assigned finite useful lives are amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives. refer to note 5. intangible assets to our consolidated financial statements under item 8. financial statements and supplementary data for further information on indefinite-life intangible assets.
we review our ships and other long-lived assets, including right-of-use assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate, based on recent and projected cash flow performance and remaining useful lives, that the carrying value of these assets may not be fully recoverable. we evaluate asset impairment at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities. the lowest level for which we maintain identifiable cash flows that are independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities is at the ship level for our ships. if estimated undiscounted future cash flows are less than the carrying value of an asset, an impairment charge is recognized to the extent its carrying value exceeds fair value. refer to note 6. property and equipment to our consolidated financial statements under item 8. financial statements and supplementary data for further information on determination of fair value for long-lived assets.
we estimate fair value based on quoted market prices in active markets, if available. if active markets are not available, we base fair value on independent appraisals, sales price negotiations and projected future cash flows discounted at a rate estimated by management to be commensurate with the business risk. quoted market prices are often not available for individual reporting units and for indefinite-life intangible assets. accordingly, we estimate the fair value of a reporting unit and an indefinite-life intangible asset using an expected present value technique.
royal caribbean international reporting unit during the fourth quarter of 2022, we performed a qualitative assessment of the royal caribbean international reporting unit. based on our qualitative assessment, we concluded that it was more-likely-than-not that the estimated fair value of the royal caribbean international reporting unit exceeded its carrying value and thus, we did not proceed to the two-step goodwill impairment test. no indicators of impairment exist primarily because the reporting unit's fair value has consistently exceeded its carrying value by a significant margin and forecasts of operating results expected to be generated by the reporting unit appear sufficient to support its carrying value. as of december 31, 2022, the carrying amount of goodwill attributable to our royal caribbean reporting unit was $296.4 million.
we did not perform interim impairment evaluations of royal caribbean international's goodwill during 2022 as no triggering events were identified.
silversea cruises reporting unit during the fourth quarters of 2022 and 2021, we performed our annual impairment review of silversea cruises goodwill. we did not perform qualitative assessments but instead proceeded directly to the goodwill impairment tests. as of november 30, 2022, and november 30, 2021, the fair value of the silversea cruises reporting unit was determined using a discounted cash flow model in combination with a market-based valuation approach. as a result of the tests, we determined the fair value of the silversea cruises reporting unit exceeded its carrying value by approximately 26% and 35% as of november 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively, resulting in no impairment to silversea cruises' goodwill. the carrying value of goodwill attributable to our silversea cruises reporting unit was $508.6 million as of december 31, 2022 and 2021.
during the fourth quarters of 2022 and 2021, we performed our annual impairment reviews of the silversea cruises trade name. as a result of the quantitative tests, we determined that the fair value of the silversea cruises' trade name exceeded its carrying value by approximately 25% and 19%, as of november 30, 2022 and november 30, 2021, respectively, resulting in no impairment to silversea cruises' trade name.
as of december 31, 2022 and 2021, the carrying value of indefinite-life intangible assets was $321.5 million, which primarily relates to the silversea cruises trade name.
we did not perform interim impairment evaluations of silversea cruises's goodwill or trade names during 2022 and 2021, as no triggering events were identified.
derivative instruments we enter into various forward, swap and option contracts to manage our interest rate exposure and to limit our exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and fuel prices. these instruments are recorded on the balance sheet at their fair value and the vast majority are designated as hedges. we also use non-derivative financial instruments designated as hedges of our net investment in our foreign operations and investments. although some of our derivative financial instruments do not qualify for hedge accounting or are not accounted for under hedge accounting, we do not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading or other speculative purposes. we account for derivative financial instruments in accordance with authoritative guidance. refer to note 2. summary of significant accounting policies and note 16. fair value measurements and derivative instruments to our consolidated financial statements under item 8. financial statements and supplementary data for more information on related authoritative guidance, the company's hedging programs and derivative financial instruments.
on a regular basis, we enter into foreign currency forward contracts, interest rate swaps, fuel swaps and options with third-party institutions in over-the-counter markets. we estimate the fair value of our foreign currency forward contracts and interest rate swaps using expected future cash flows based on the instruments' contract terms and published forward prices for foreign currency exchange and interest rates. we value floors which are embedded within our interest rate swaps using standard option pricing models with inputs based on the options' contract terms, such as exercise price and maturity, and readily available market data, such as forward interest rates and interest rate volatility. we apply present value techniques to convert the expected future cash flows to the current fair value of the instruments.
we estimate the fair value of our fuel swaps using expected future cash flows based on the swaps' contract terms and forward prices. we derive forward prices from published forward fuel curves which in turn are based on actual market transactions and published price quotes for similar assets. we apply present value techniques to convert the expected future cash flows to the current fair value of the instruments. we also corroborate our fair value estimates using valuations provided by our counterparties.
we adjust the valuation of our derivative financial instruments to incorporate credit risk.
we believe it is unlikely that materially different estimates for the fair value of our foreign currency forward contracts, interest rate swaps, fuel swaps and options would be derived from other appropriate valuation models using similar assumptions, inputs or conditions suggested by actual historical experience.
contingencies-litigation on an ongoing basis, we assess the potential liabilities related to any lawsuits or claims brought against us. while it is typically difficult to determine the timing and ultimate outcome of such actions, we use our best judgment to determine if it is probable that we will incur an expense related to the settlement or final adjudication of such matters and whether a reasonable estimation of such probable loss, if any, can be made. in assessing probable losses, we take into consideration estimates of the amount of insurance recoveries, if any, which are recorded as assets when recoverability is probable. we accrue a liability when we believe a loss is probable and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. due to the inherent uncertainties related to the eventual outcome of litigation and potential insurance recoveries, it is possible that certain matters may be resolved for amounts materially different from any provisions or disclosures that we have previously made.
seasonality our revenues are seasonal based on demand for cruises. demand has historically been strongest for cruises during the northern hemisphere's summer months and holidays. in order to mitigate the impact of the winter weather in the northern hemisphere and to capitalize on the summer season in the southern hemisphere, our brands have historically focused on deployment to the caribbean, asia and australia during that period. this seasonal trend was disrupted with the voluntary suspension of our global cruise operations effective march 2020 in response to the covid-19 outbreak. we resumed our global cruise operations commencing in the second half of 2021, with our full fleet in service by june 2022. since our full fleet is in service, we expect to return to seasonal trends financial presentation description of certain line items revenues our revenues are comprised of the following:
•passenger ticket revenues, which consist of revenue recognized from the sale of passenger tickets and the sale of air transportation to and from our ships; and
•onboard and other revenues, which consist primarily of revenues from the sale of goods and/or services onboard our ships not included in passenger ticket prices, cancellation fees, sales of vacation protection insurance, pre- and post-cruise tours and fees for operating certain port facilities. onboard and other revenues also include revenues we receive from independent third party concessionaires that pay us a percentage of their revenues in exchange for the right to provide selected goods and/or services onboard our ships, as well as revenues received for procurement and management related services we perform on behalf of our unconsolidated affiliates.
cruise operating expenses our cruise operating expenses are comprised of the following:
•commissions, transportation and other expenses, which consist of those costs directly associated with passenger ticket revenues, including travel advisor commissions, air and other transportation expenses, port costs that vary with passenger head counts and related credit card fees;
•onboard and other expenses, which consist of the direct costs associated with onboard and other revenues, including the costs of products sold onboard our ships, vacation protection insurance premiums, costs associated with pre- and post-cruise tours and related credit card fees, as well as the minimal costs associated with concession revenues, as the costs are mostly incurred by third-party concessionaires and costs incurred for the procurement and management related services we perform on behalf of our unconsolidated affiliates;
•payroll and related expenses, which consist of costs for shipboard personnel (costs associated with our shoreside personnel are included in marketing, selling and administrative expenses);
•food expenses, which include food costs for both guests and crew;
•fuel expenses, which include fuel and related delivery, storage and emission consumable costs and the financial impact of fuel swap agreements; and
•other operating expenses, which consist primarily of operating costs such as repairs and maintenance, port costs that do not vary with passenger head counts, vessel related insurance, entertainment and gains and/or losses related to the sale of our ships, if any.
we do not allocate payroll and related expenses, food expenses, fuel expenses or other operating expenses to the expense categories attributable to passenger ticket revenues or onboard and other revenues since they are incurred to provide the total cruise vacation experience.
selected operational and financial metrics we utilize a variety of operational and financial metrics which are defined below to evaluate our performance and financial condition. as discussed in more detail herein, certain of these metrics are non-gaap financial measures. these non-gaap financial measures are provided along with the related gaap financial measures as we believe they provide useful information to investors as a supplement to our consolidated financial statements, which are prepared and presented in accordance with gaap. the presentation of non-gaap financial information is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for, or superior to, the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with gaap.
adjusted ebitda is a non-gaap measure that represents ebitda (as defined below) excluding certain items that we believe adjusting for is meaningful when assessing our profitability on a comparative basis. for the periods presented, these items included (i) other expenses, which includes our loss contingency in connection with the ongoing havana docks litigation recorded in 2022; (ii) impairment and credit losses; (iii) restructuring charges and other initiative expenses; (iv) equity investment asset impairments; (v) net insurance recoveries or costs related to the collapse of the drydock structure at the grand bahama shipyard involving oasis of the seas; (vi) pullmantur reorganization settlement; (vii) the net gain recognized in 2021 in relation to the sale of the azamara brand; (viii) the noncontrolling interest adjustment to exclude the impact of the contractual accretion requirements associated with the put option held by heritage cruise holding ltd. and (ix) transaction costs related to the 2018 silversea cruises acquisition. a reconciliation of net income (loss) attributable to royal caribbean cruises ltd. to adjusted ebitda is provided below under results of operations.
adjusted loss per share ("adjusted eps") is a non-gaap measure that represents adjusted net loss attributable to royal caribbean cruises ltd. (as defined below) divided by weighted average shares outstanding or by diluted weighted average shares outstanding, as applicable. we believe that this non-gaap measure is meaningful when assessing our performance on a comparative basis. a reconciliation of loss per share to adjusted loss per share is provided below under results of operations.
adjusted net loss attributable to royal caribbean cruises ltd. is a non-gaap measure that represents net loss less net income attributable to noncontrolling interest, excluding certain items that we believe adjusting for is meaningful when assessing our performance on a comparative basis. for the periods presented, these items included (i) loss on the extinguishment of debt; (ii) the amortization of non-cash debt discount on our convertible notes; (iii) the estimated cash refund expected to be paid to pullmantur guests and other expenses incurred as part of the pullmantur s.a. reorganization; (iv) impairment and credit losses; (v) equity investment asset impairments; (vi) net insurance recoveries related to the collapse of the drydock structure at the grand bahama shipyard involving oasis of the seas; (vii) restructuring charges and other initiative expenses; (viii) the amortization of the silversea cruises intangible assets resulting from the silversea cruises acquisition in 2018; for 2020, the change in the fair value in the silversea cruises contingent consideration;(ix) the noncontrolling interest adjustment to exclude the impact of the contractual accretion requirements associated with the put option held by heritage cruise holding ltd. (previously known as silversea cruises group ltd.) noncontrolling interest in silversea cruises, which noncontrolling interest we acquired on july 9, 2020; (x) the net gain recognized in the first quarter of 2021 in relation to the sale of the azamara brand; (xi) currency translation losses recognized during the second quarter of 2020, in connection with the ships classified as assets held-for-sale that were previously chartered to pullmantur; (xii) the net loss recognized in the fourth quarter of 2021 related to the elimination of the three-month reporting lag for silversea cruises; and (xiii) loss contingency recorded in connection with the ongoing havana docks litigation inclusive of related legal fees and costs. a reconciliation of net loss attributable to royal caribbean cruises ltd. to adjusted net loss attributable to royal caribbean cruises ltd. is provided below under results of operations.
available passenger cruise days ("apcd") is our measurement of capacity and represents double occupancy per cabin multiplied by the number of cruise days for the period, which excludes canceled cruise days and cabins not available for sale. we use this measure to perform capacity and rate analysis to identify our main non-capacity drivers that cause our cruise revenue and expenses to vary.
ebitda is a non-gaap measure that represents of net income (loss) attributable to royal caribbean cruises ltd. excluding (i) interest income; (ii) interest expense, net of interest capitalized; (iii) depreciation and amortization expenses; and (iv) income tax benefit or expense. we believe that this non-gaap measure is meaningful when assessing our operating performance on a comparative basis. a reconciliation of net income (loss) attributable to royal caribbean cruises ltd. to ebitda is provided below under results of operations.
gross cruise costs represent the sum of total cruise operating expenses plus marketing, selling and administrative expenses.
carbon intensity is our measurement of carbon dioxide emissions per gross tonne nautical mile (well-to-wake).
net cruise costs and net cruise costs excluding fuel are non-gaap measures that represent gross cruise costs excluding commissions, transportation and other expenses and onboard and other expenses and, in the case of net cruise costs excluding fuel, fuel expenses (each of which is described above under the description of certain line items heading). in measuring our ability to control costs in a manner that positively impacts net income, we believe changes in net cruise costs and net cruise costs excluding fuel to be the most relevant indicators of our performance. a reconciliation of gross cruise costs to net cruise costs and net cruise costs excluding fuel is provided below under results of operations. for the 2022 period presented, net cruise costs and net cruise costs excluding fuel excludes restructuring and other initiative expenses.
occupancy ("load factor"), in accordance with cruise vacation industry practice, is calculated by dividing passenger cruise days (as defined below) by apcd. a percentage in excess of 100% indicates that three or more passengers occupied some cabins.
passenger cruise days represent the number of passengers carried for the period multiplied by the number of days of their respective cruises.
although discussed in prior periods, we did not disclose or reconcile in this report our gross yields and net yields, as defined in our annual report on form 10-k for the year ended december 31, 2019. historically, we have utilized these financial metrics to measure relevant rate comparisons to other periods. however, our 2022 and 2021 reduction in capacity and revenues, due to the impact of the covid-19 pandemic on our operations, do not allow for a meaningful analysis and comparison of these metrics and as such these metrics have been excluded from this report. for gross cruise costs, net cruise costs, and net cruise costs excluding fuel we present amounts in constant currency compared to 2019, which is the last year of normalized operations.
executive overview
2022 was a transitional year filled with numerous accomplishments. we returned our entire fleet into operations, took delivery of celebrity beyond and wonder of the seas, and acquired silver endeavour. additionally, we achieved positive ebitda and operating cash flow for the year, controlled costs to minimize the impacts of inflation, and saw record shipboard revenues for the year.
our 2022 net loss was $(2.2) billion, or $(8.45) per diluted share, compared to net income attributable to royal caribbean cruises ltd. of $1.9 billion, or $8.95 per diluted share in 2019, the most recent year of normalized operations. adjusted net loss for 2022 was $(1.9) billion, or $(7.50) per diluted share, compared to adjusted net income attributable to royal caribbean cruises ltd. of $2.0 billion, or $9.54 per diluted share in 2019. 2022 adjusted ebitda was $711.6 million, compared to adjusted ebitda of $3.6 billion in 2019. we started 2022 by operating 51 ships and sailing at 57% load factor in the first quarter of 2022. we successfully completed the return of our entire fleet into operations during the second quarter and achieved 96% load factors in the third quarter with the caribbean eclipsing triple digits at close to 105% during the third quarter. we finished the year sailing at almost 100% load factor in december 2022, with holiday sailings close to 110% during the fourth quarter.
despite only partially operating for the first half of the year, total revenues were $8.8 billion in 2022, compared to $11.0 billion in 2019. load factors for 2022 were 85%, and 96% for the second half of the year. additionally, total revenue per passenger cruise day in 2022 was higher than record 2019 levels, driven by strong onboard revenue performance.
cruise operating expenses increased from $6.1 billion in 2019 to $6.6 billion in 2022. gross cruise costs per apcd increased 8.2% as-reported and 8.8% in constant currency, compared to 2019. net cruise costs, excluding fuel, per apcd increased 12.9% as-reported and 13.5% in constant currency, compared to 2019. our cost-conscious mindset has helped to mitigate the effects of inflation, and we benefited from reduced costs related to health protocols as the year went on. for the year net cruise costs included $5.97 per apcd of transitory costs related to health protocols, and one-time lagging costs related to fleet ramp up. 2022 also included galveston terminal construction costs and increased costs associated with cococay, which were not present in 2019.
in 2023, we expect our capacity to increase by 14% compared to 2019, despite the reduction in capacity resulting from the divestiture of azamara and the sale of older ships. since 2019 we have welcomed 9 new ships across our five brands, and with the addition of celebrity ascent and silver nova in 2023 we expect a total of 11 new vessels operating by year end. these new ships, along with enhanced onboard offerings and continued investment in destinations, are expected to help drive increases in both net yields and total revenues as our capacity expands. we also plan to continue investing in both more efficient newbuilds and retrofitting our existing fleet with technology to help reach our long-term goals to reduce carbon intensity. lastly, we anticipate taking delivery of icon of the seas by the end of the year, to begin operating revenue sailings in 2024.
results of operations in addition to the items discussed above under "executive overview," significant items for 2022 include:
•our net loss attributable to royal caribbean cruises ltd. and adjusted net loss attributable to royal caribbean cruises ltd. for the year ended december 31, 2022 was $(2.2) billion and $(1.9) billion, or $(8.45) and $(7.50) per share on a diluted basis, respectively, reflecting our return to full operations, compared to net loss attributable to royal caribbean cruises ltd. and adjusted net loss attributable to royal caribbean cruises ltd. of $(5.3) billion and $(4.8) billion, or $(20.89) and $(19.19) per share on a diluted basis, respectively, for the year ended december 31, 2021.
•total revenues, excluding the effect of changes in foreign currency rates, increased by $7.5 billion for the year ended december 31, 2022 as compared to the same period in 2021. the increase reflects our full return to operations by june 2022 compared to 2021 when the suspension of our global cruise operations was in effect for a substantial portion of our fleet. apcds for the year ended december 31, 2022 was 41,197,650 compared to 11,767,441, in the same period in 2021.
•the effect of changes in foreign currency exchange rates related to our passenger ticket and onboard and other revenue transactions, denominated in currencies other than the united states dollar, resulted in a decrease in total revenues of $149.0 million for the year ended december 31, 2022 compared to the same period in 2021.
•total cruise operating expenses, excluding the effect of changes in foreign currency rate, increased by $4.0 billion for the year ended december 31, 2022 compared to the same period in 2021, which reflects our return to operations in 2022 compared to 2021 when the suspension of our global cruise operations was in effect for the substantial portion of our fleet.
•the effect of changes in foreign currency exchange rates related to our cruise operating expenses, denominated in currencies other than the united states dollar, resulted in a decrease in total operating expenses of $79.5 million for the year ended december 31, 2022 compared to the same period in 2021.
•in january 2022 and april 2022, we took delivery of wonder of the seas and celebrity beyond, respectively. to finance the purchases, we borrowed $1.3 billion and €0.7 billion, or approximately $0.7 billion based on the exchange rate at december 31, 2022, respectively, under previously committed unsecured term loans. refer to note 8. debt to our consolidated financial statements under item 8. financial statements and supplementary data for further information. wonder of the seas and celebrity beyond entered service in the first and second quarters of 2022, respectively.

in this section, references to 2022 refer to the year ended december 31, 2022 and references to 2021 refer to the year ended december 31, 2021.
revenues total revenues increased $7.3 billion, or 477.0%, to $8.8 billion in 2022 from $1.5 billion in 2021.
passenger ticket revenues comprised 65.5% of our 2022 total revenues. passenger ticket revenues increased by $4.9 billion, or 515.6% to $5.8 billion in 2022 from $0.9 billion in 2021 and was partially offset by unfavorable movements in foreign currency exchange rates related to our revenue transactions denominated in currencies other than the united states dollar of $129.8 million.
the remaining 34.5% of total revenues was comprised of onboard and other revenues, which increased $2.5 billion, or 415.6% to $3.0 billion in 2022 from $591.0 million in 2021 and was partially offset by unfavorable movements in foreign currency exchange rates related to our revenue transactions denominated in currencies other than the united states dollar of $19.2 million.
the increase in total revenues was due to our return of operations, with our full fleet in service by june 2022, compared to 2021 when we began resuming guest cruise operations. occupancy in 2022 was 85.1% compared to 49.3% in 2021.
onboard and other revenues included concession revenues of $331.9 million in 2022 and $72.0 million in 2021.
cruise operating expenses total cruise operating expenses increased by $4.0 billion, or 148.9%, to $6.6 billion in 2022 from $2.7 billion in 2021.
the increase in cruise operating expenses was driven by the return to operations in 2022, with the majority of our fleet in service compared to 2021, when the suspension of our global cruise operations was in effect. the 2022 operating expenses include the overhead costs associated with bringing our ships back to service and our crew back on board our ships. additionally, inflationary pressures have impacted our operating costs, especially in fuel and food expense. our cost of fuel (net of the financial impact of fuel swap agreements) for 2022 increased 43% per metric ton compared to 2021 mainly due to the increase in fuel price.
marketing, selling and administrative expenses marketing, selling and administrative expenses increased $0.2 billion, or 15.5% to $1.6 billion in 2022 from $1.4 billion in 2021. the increase was due to the ramp up of our global sales and marketing efforts starting in the second half of 2021 as we commenced our resumption of operations. additionally, having our full fleet in service as of june 30, 2022 increased overall expenses compared to 2021.
depreciation and amortization expenses depreciation and amortization expenses increased $0.1 billion, or 8.8%, to $1.4 billion in 2022 compared to $1.3 billion. the increase was primarily due to the addition of wonder of the seas and celebrity beyond to our fleet in january 2022 and april 2022, respectively, and depreciation for odyssey of the seas and silver dawn, which were delivered in march 2021 and november 2021, respectively.
.impairment and credit losses impairment and credit losses for 2022 was $0.6 million compared to $82.0 million in 2021. the decrease in impairment loss was primarily due to 2021 impairment charges of certain construction in progress projects that were reduced in scope or terminated as a result of covid-19, which did not recur in 2022.
other income (expense)
interest expense, net of interest capitalized, increased $72.4 million, or 5.6%, to $1.4 billion in 2022 from $1.3 billion in 2021. the increase was primarily due to additional indebtedness associated with new ship deliveries.
equity investment income for 2022 was $56.7 million compared to equity investment loss of $135.5 million in 2021. the increase in income was primarily due to income from tui cruises, one of our equity investments, in 2022 compared to losses in 2021.
other (expense) income decreased $140.7 million, or 693.5%, to other expense of $120.4 million in 2022 from other income of $20.3 million in 2021. the decrease was primarily due to a loss contingency of $130.0 million recorded in connection with the ongoing havana docks litigation.
other comprehensive income other comprehensive income in 2022 was $67.7 million compared to $28.5 million in 2021. the change was primarily due to changes in defined benefits plan in 2022 of $48.9 million compared to $8.7 million in 2021.

liquidity and capital resources sources and uses of cash net cash provided by (used in) operating activities increased by $2.4 billion to cash provided of $0.5 billion for the year ended december 31, 2022, compared to cash used of $1.9 billion for the same period in 2021. our full resumption of operations in 2022 generated an increase in guest ticket and onboard collections for the twelve months ended december 31, 2022, compared to a partial resumption of operations in 2021.
net cash used in investing activities increased by $843.0 million to cash used of $3.0 billion for the year ended december 31, 2022, compared to cash used of $2.1 billion for the same period in 2021. the increase in cash used in investing activities was primarily attributable to an increase in capital expenditures of $480.4 million due to the increased cost associated with taking delivery of wonder of the seas and celebrity beyond in 2022 compared to taking delivery of odyssey of the seas and silver dawn in 2021, and an increase in cash paid on settlement of derivative financial instruments of $281.7 million in 2022 compared to 2021.
net cash provided by financing activities was $1.7 billion in 2022 compared to cash provided of $3.0 billion in 2021. the decrease of $1.3 billion was primarily attributable to proceeds from common stock issuances of $1.6 billion during the twelve months ended december 31, 2021, compared to none during the same period in 2022, and offset by repayments of commercial paper notes of $414.6 million during the twelve months ended december 31, 2021, compared to none during the same period in 2022.
future capital commitments capital expenditures our future capital commitments consist primarily of new ship orders. as of december 31, 2022, we have one oasis-class ship, and three ships of a new generation, known as our icon-class, on order for our royal caribbean international brand with an aggregate capacity of approximately 22,500 berths. as of december 31, 2022, we have one edge-class ship on order for our celebrity cruises brand, with a capacity of approximately 3,250 berths. additionally, as of december 31, 2022, we have two ships on order for our silversea cruises brand with an aggregate capacity of approximately 1,460 berths. refer to item 1. business-operations for further information on our ships on order. we have committed financing arrangements in place covering 80% of the cost of the ship for the seven ships on order for our global brands, all of which include sovereign financing guarantees. additionally, we have an agreement in place with chantiers de l'atlantique to build an additional edge-class ship for delivery in 2025, which is contingent upon completion of conditions precedent and financing.
as of december 31, 2022, the aggregate cost of our ships on order, excluding any ships on order by our partner brands, was approximately $9.8 billion, of which we had deposited $832 million. approximately 52.3% of the aggregate cost was exposed to fluctuations in the euro exchange rate at december 31, 2022. refer to note 16. fair value measurements and derivative instruments and note 17. commitments and contingencies to our consolidated financial statements under item 8. financial statements and supplementary data.
we have been, and may continue to be, negatively impacted on our cash flows, liquidity and financial position by the covid-19 pandemic. in order to preserve liquidity, we deferred a significant portion of our planned 2020, 2021 and 2022 capital expenditures. as of december 31, 2022, we anticipate overall full year capital expenditures, based on our existing ships on order, will be approximately $4.1 billion for 2023. this amount does not include any ships on order by our partner brands.

(1)    long-term debt obligations mature at various dates through fiscal year 2037 and bear interest at fixed and variable rates. interest on variable-rate debt is calculated based on forecasted debt balances, including the impact of interest rate swap agreements, using the applicable rate at december 31, 2022. debt denominated in other currencies is calculated based on the applicable exchange rate at december 31, 2022.
(2)     amounts are based on contractual installment and delivery dates for our ships on order. included in these figures are $5.7 billion in final contractual installments, which have committed financing covering 80% of the cost of the ships on order for our global brands, almost all of which include sovereign financing guarantees. amounts do not include potential obligations which remain subject to cancellation at our sole discretion or any agreements entered for ships on order that remain contingent upon completion of conditions precedent.

refer to note 9. leases to our consolidated financial statements under item 8. financial statements and supplementary data for maturities related to lease liabilities.
refer to funding needs and sources below for discussion on the planned funding of the above material contractual obligations.
as a normal part of our business, depending on market conditions, pricing and our overall growth strategy, we continuously consider opportunities to enter into contracts for the building of additional ships. we may also consider the sale of ships or the purchase of existing ships. we continuously consider potential acquisitions and strategic alliances. if any of these were to occur, they would be financed through the incurrence of additional indebtedness, the issuance of additional shares of equity securities or through cash flows from operations.
off-balance sheet arrangements.
refer to note 7. other assets to our consolidated financial statements under item 8. financial statements and supplementary data for ownership restrictions related to tui cruises.
refer to note 8. debt to our consolidated financial statements under item 8. financial statements and supplementary data for export credit agency guarantees.
refer to note 17. commitments and contingencies to our consolidated financial statements under item 8. financial statements and supplementary data for other agreements.
as of december 31, 2022, other than the items described above, we are not party to any other off-balance sheet arrangements, including guarantee contracts, retained or contingent interest, certain derivative instruments and variable interest entities, that either have, or are reasonably likely to have, a current or future material effect on our financial position.
funding needs and sources historically, we relied on a combination of cash flows provided by operations, draw-downs under our available credit facilities, the incurrence of additional debt and/or the refinancing of our existing debt and the issuance of additional shares of equity securities to fund our obligations. covid-19 resulted in our voluntary suspension of global cruise operations from march 2020 up to our full fleet returning to service during the second quarter of 2022. the suspension of operations strained our sources of cash flow and liquidity, causing us to take actions resulting in reductions in our operating expenses, reductions in our capital expenses and new financings and other liquidity actions.
the company continually identifies and evaluates actions to maintain adequate liquidity. these include, and are not limited to: further reductions in capital expenditures, operating expenses and administrative costs and additional financings. additionally, we will continue to pursue various opportunities to raise additional capital to fund obligations associated with future debt maturities and/or to extend the maturity dates associated with our existing indebtedness or facilities. actions to raise capital may include issuances of debt, convertible debt or equity in private or public transactions or entering into new or extended credit facilities.
we have significant contractual obligations of which our debt service obligations and the capital expenditures associated with our ship purchases represent our largest funding needs. as of december 31, 2022, we had approximately $7.6 billion of committed financing for our ships on order.
as of december 31, 2022, our obligations due through december 31, 2023 primarily consisted of $2.1 billion related to debt maturities, $1.3 billion related to interest on debt and $2.7 billion related to progress payments on our ship orders and, based on expected delivery date, the final installments payable due upon the delivery of silver nova, icon of the seas, and celebrity ascent.
as of december 31, 2022, we had liquidity of $2.9 billion, including cash and cash equivalents of $1.9 billion, $0.3 billion of undrawn revolving credit facility capacity, and a $0.7 billion commitment for a 364-day term loan facility which was terminated in february 2023 in connection with our completion of the $700 million 7.25% priority guaranteed notes offering. our revolving credit facilities were partially utilized through a combination of amounts drawn and letters of credit issued under the facilities as of december 31, 2022, which were subsequently amended in january 2023, as described in note 8. debt to our consolidated financial statements. we have agreed with certain of our lenders not to pay dividends or engage in stock repurchases unless we repay the remaining principal payments that were deferred under our export credit facilities in 2020 and 2021. refer to note 10. shareholders' equity to our consolidated financial statements under item 8. financial statements and supplementary data for further information.
if any person acquires ownership of more than 50% of our common stock or, subject to certain exceptions, during any 24-month period, a majority of our board of directors is no longer comprised of individuals who were members of our board of directors on the first day of such period, we may be obligated to prepay indebtedness outstanding under our credit facilities, which we may be unable to replace on similar terms. our public debt securities also contain change of control provisions that would be triggered by a third-party acquisition of greater than 50% of our common stock coupled with a ratings downgrade. if this were to occur, it would have an adverse impact on our liquidity and operations.
based on our assumptions and estimates and our financial condition, we believe that we have sufficient financial resources to fund our obligations for at least the next twelve months from the issuance of these financial statements. however, there is no assurance that our assumptions and estimates are accurate as there is inherent uncertainty in our ability to predict future liquidity requirements. refer to note 1. general, management's plan and liquidity, to our consolidated financial statements under item 8. financial statements and supplementary data for further information.
debt covenants our export credit facilities, our non-export credit facilities, and certain of our credit card processing agreements contain covenants that require us, among other things, to maintain a fixed charge coverage ratio, limit our net debt-to-capital ratio, and maintain minimum liquidity, and under certain facilities, to maintain a minimum level of stockholders' equity. the fixed charge coverage ratio is calculated by dividing net cash from operations for the past four quarters by the sum of dividend payments plus scheduled principal debt payments in excess of any new financings for the past four quarters. our minimum stockholders' equity and maximum net debt-to-capital calculations exclude the impact of accumulated other comprehensive loss on total stockholders' equity. in 2021 and 2022, the financial covenant levels were modified for 2023 and 2024. as of december 31, 2022, we were in compliance with our financial covenants and we estimate that we will be in compliance for at least the next twelve months.
any further covenant waivers may lead to increased costs, increased interest rates, additional restrictive covenants and other available lender protections as may be agreed with our lenders. there can be no assurance that we would be able to obtain additional waivers in a timely manner, or on acceptable terms. if we require additional waivers and are not able to obtain them or repay the debt facilities, this would lead to an event of default and potential acceleration of amounts due under all of our outstanding debt and derivative contracts. refer to note 8. debt to our consolidated financial statements under item 8. financial statements and supplementary data for further information regarding debt covenants.
dividends the declaration of dividends shall at all times be subject to the final determination of our board of directors that a dividend is prudent at that time in consideration of the needs of the business. in the event we declare a dividend or engage in share repurchases, we will need to repay the amounts deferred under our export credit facilities. accordingly, we have not declared a dividend since the first quarter of 2020.

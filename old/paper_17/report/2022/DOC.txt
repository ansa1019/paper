item 1a.    risk factors the section below discusses the most significant risk factors that may materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition.
as set forth below, we believe that the risks we face generally fall into the following categories:
•risks related to our business and operations;
•risks related to our capital structure and market conditions;
•risks related to the regulatory environment; and
•risks related to tax, including reit-related risks, and our jurisdiction of incorporation.
table of contents risks related to our business and operations we may be negatively impacted by macroeconomic trends, including rising inflation and interest rates, increased labor costs, and historically low unemployment.
many of our costs, including labor costs, costs of construction materials, interest, utilities, and other operating costs, have been, and may continue to be, affected by inflation and price volatility. in addition, interest rates rose substantially in 2022 and may continue to rise. increased interest rates have caused, and may continue to cause, increased interest costs for variable rate debt and new debt. we may not be able to offset additional costs caused by inflation, increased interest rates or other macroeconomic trends by passing them through, or increasing the rates we charge, to tenants and residents. these increased costs may adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition.
in addition, rising labor costs and personnel shortages have increased, and may continue to increase, the cost of our, or our tenants', operators', and borrowers', workforce. competitive pressures, including historically low unemployment, may require that we or our tenants, operators, or borrowers enhance pay and benefits packages to compete effectively for such personnel. to the extent we or our tenants, operators, or borrowers cannot hire a sufficient number of qualified personnel, we or they may need to utilize high-cost alternatives to meet labor needs, including contract and overtime labor, or our business may operate below capacity, which may affect our ability to effectively manage risk and pursue potential revenue and growth opportunities.
decreases in our tenants', operators', or borrowers' revenues, or increases in their expenses, could affect their ability to meet their financial and other contractual obligations to us.
occupancy levels at, and rental income from, our medical office and senior housing properties depend on our ability and the ability of our tenants, operators, and borrowers to compete with respect to (i) the quality of care provided, (ii) reputation, (iii) price, (iv) the range of services offered, (v) the physical appearance of a property, (vi) family preference, (vii) referral sources, and (xiii) location.
in addition, our medical office and senior housing tenants, operators, and borrowers compete with certain companies that have superior resources and attributes and/or provide similar healthcare services or alternatives such as home health agencies, telemedicine, life care at home, community-based service programs, retirement communities, and convalescent centers.
furthermore, these tenants, operators, and borrowers face a competitive labor market. a shortage of care givers or other trained personnel, union activities, wage laws, or general inflationary pressures on wages may require our tenants, operators, and borrowers to enhance pay and benefits packages, or to use more expensive contract personnel, and they may be unable to offset these added costs by increasing the rates charged to residents or patients. an inability to attract and retain qualified personnel, including personnel possessing the expertise needed to operate in the life science, medical office, and senior housing sectors, could negatively impact the ability of our tenants, operators, and borrowers to meet their obligations to us.
although we generally have the right under specified circumstances to terminate a lease, evict a tenant or terminate our operator, or demand immediate repayment of outstanding loan amounts or other obligations to us, we may be unable to enforce these rights or we may determine not to do so if we believe that doing so would be more detrimental than alternative approaches. if widespread default or nonpayment of outstanding obligations from our tenants, operators, or borrowers occurs at a time when terminating our agreements with them and replacing them would be difficult or impossible, we could elect instead to amend our agreements on materially less favorable terms to us. the failure of our tenants, operators, or borrowers to meet their financial and other contractual obligations to us could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition.
we may be negatively impacted by the insolvency or bankruptcy of one or more of our major tenants, operators, or borrowers.
a downturn in our tenants', operators', or borrowers' businesses could lead to voluntary or involuntary bankruptcy or similar insolvency proceedings, including assignment for the benefit of creditors, liquidation, or winding-up. bankruptcy and insolvency laws afford certain rights to a defaulting tenant, operator, or borrower that has filed for bankruptcy or reorganization that may render certain of our remedies unenforceable or, at the least, delay our ability to pursue such remedies and realize any related recoveries.
table of contents a debtor has the right to assume, or to assume and assign to a third party, or to reject its executory contracts and unexpired leases in a bankruptcy proceeding. if a debtor were to reject its leases with us, obligations under such rejected leases would cease. the claim against the rejecting debtor for remaining rental payments due under the lease would be an unsecured claim, which would be limited by the statutory cap set forth in the u.s. bankruptcy code. this statutory cap may be substantially less than the remaining rent actually owed under the lease. in addition, a debtor may also assert in bankruptcy proceedings that certain leases should be re-characterized as financing agreements, which could result in our being deemed a lender instead of a landlord. a lender's rights and remedies, as compared to a landlord's, generally are materially less favorable, and our rights as a lender may be subject to lower priority for payment under the u.s. bankruptcy code.
furthermore, the automatic stay provisions of the u.s. bankruptcy code would preclude us from enforcing our remedies unless we first obtain relief from the court having jurisdiction over the bankruptcy case. this would effectively limit or delay our ability to collect unpaid rent or interest payments, and we may ultimately not receive any payment at all. in addition, we would likely be required to fund certain expenses and obligations (e.g., real estate taxes, insurance, debt costs, and maintenance expenses) to preserve the value of our properties, avoid the imposition of liens on our properties, or transition our properties to a new tenant or operator.
if we are unable to transition affected properties, they would likely experience prolonged operational disruption, leading to lower occupancy rates and further depressed revenues. publicity about the operator's financial condition and insolvency proceeds may also negatively impact their and our reputations, decreasing customer demand and revenues. any or all of these risks could have a material adverse effect on our revenues, results of operations, and cash flows. these risks could be magnified where we lease multiple properties to a single operator under a master lease, as an operator failure or default under a master lease would expose us to these risks across multiple properties.
we depend on real estate investments, particularly in the healthcare property sector, making us more vulnerable to a downturn or slowdown in that specific sector than if we were investing across multiple sectors.
we concentrate our investments in the healthcare property sector. a downturn or slowdown in this sector, such as occurred during the covid pandemic, would have a greater adverse impact on our business than if we had investments across multiple sectors, and could negatively impact the ability of our tenants, operators, and borrowers to meet their obligations to us, as well as the ability to maintain historical rental and occupancy rates, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition. in addition, such downturns could have a material adverse effect on the value of our properties and our ability to sell properties at prices or on terms acceptable or favorable to us.
the illiquidity of our real estate investments may prohibit us from timely responding to economic or investment performance changes.
our real estate investments can be relatively illiquid due to: (i) restrictions on our ability to sell properties under applicable reit tax laws, (ii) other tax-related considerations, (iii) regulatory hurdles, and (iv) market conditions. as a result, we may be unable to recognize full value for any property that we seek to sell. our inability to timely respond to economic or investment performance changes could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition.
identifying and securing new or replacement tenants or operators can be time consuming and costly.
healthcare properties can be highly customized, and the improvements generally required to conform a property to healthcare use are costly, sometimes tenant-specific, and may be subject to regulatory requirements. a new or replacement tenant or operator may require different features in a property, depending on that tenant's or operator's particular business. in addition, infrastructure improvements for life science properties typically are significantly more expensive than improvements to other property types due to the highly specialized nature of the properties and the greater lease square footage often required by life science tenants. therefore, we may incur substantial expenditures to modify a life science property and experience delays before we are able to secure a new or replacement tenant or operator or to accommodate multiple tenants or operators, which may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition.
in addition, we may fail to identify suitable replacements or enter into leases, management agreements, or other arrangements with new tenants or operators on a timely basis or on terms as favorable to us as our current leases, if at all. we also may be required to fund certain expenses and obligations, such as real estate taxes, debt costs, insurance costs, and maintenance expenses, to preserve the value of, and avoid the imposition of liens on, our properties while they are being repositioned. in addition, we may incur certain obligations and liabilities, including obligations to indemnify the replacement tenant or operator. identifying and securing new or replacement tenants or operators can be time consuming and costly, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition.
table of contents property development, redevelopment, and tenant improvement risks can render a project less profitable or unprofitable and delay or prevent its undertaking or completion.
our property development, redevelopment, and tenant improvement projects could be canceled, abandoned, delayed or, if completed, fail to perform in accordance with expectations due to, among other things:
•the inability to obtain financing on favorable terms or at all, or the lack of liquidity we deem necessary or appropriate for the project;
•legal and regulatory hurdles, including moratoriums on development and redevelopment activities;
•the failure to obtain, or costs associated with obtaining, necessary zoning, entitlements, and permits;
•cost increases; and
•other factors over which we have limited or no control, including: (i) changes in market and economic conditions; (ii) natural disasters and other catastrophic events; (iii) health crises or other pandemics; (iv) labor conditions, including a labor shortage or work stoppage; (v) shortages of construction materials; (vi) environmental conditions; or (vii) civil unrest and acts of war or terrorism.
project costs may materially exceed original estimates due to, among other things:
•increased interest rates;
•increased costs for materials, transportation, environmental remediation, labor, or other inputs, including those caused by a shortage of construction materials or labor;
•negligent construction or construction defects;
•damage, vandalism, or accidents; and
•increased operating costs, including insurance premiums, utilities, real estate taxes, and costs of complying with changes in government regulations or increases in tariffs.
delays in project completion also delay the commencement of related rental payments, including increases in rental payments following tenant improvement projects, and may provide tenants the right to terminate leases or cause us to incur additional costs, including through rent abatement.
demand for a project may decrease prior to a project's completion, and resulting lease-up rates, rental rates, lease commencement dates, and occupancy levels may fail to meet expectations. tenants that have pre-leased at a project may file for bankruptcy or become insolvent, or elect to terminate their lease prior to delivery if they are acquired or for other reasons. finally, a project may have defects that we do not discover through the inspection processes, including latent defects not discovered until after we put a property in service.
in addition, changes in federal, state, and local legislation and regulation on climate change could require increased capital expenditures to improve the energy efficiency or resiliency of our existing properties and increase the costs of new developments without a corresponding increase in revenue.
the foregoing risks could result in not achieving anticipated returns on investment and could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition.
life science industry changes could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.
if economic, financial, regulatory, or industry conditions adversely affect the life science industry, we may be unable to lease or re-lease our life science properties in a timely manner or at favorable rates or with favorable terms. in addition, because life science property infrastructure improvements are typically significantly more costly than improvements to other property types due to their highly specialized nature, and life science tenants typically require greater lease square footage relative to medical office tenants, repositioning efforts would have a disproportionate adverse effect on our life science segment performance. further, life science industry consolidation could reduce the rentable square footage requirements of our client tenants and prospective client tenants, which may adversely impact our revenues from lease payments. finally, our life science investments could also be adversely affected if the life science industry migrates from the u.s. to other countries or to areas outside of our primary life science markets in the greater san francisco, san diego, and boston areas.
table of contents our life science tenants face significant regulation, funding requirements, and uncertainty.
our life science tenants face substantial requirements for, and risks related to, the research, development, clinical testing, manufacture, and commercialization of their products and technologies, including:
•significant funding requirements, including for rent payments due to us;
•federal, state, and foreign regulatory approvals that may be costly or difficult to obtain, may take several years and be subject to delay, may not be obtained at all, require validation through clinical trials that may face delays or difficulties, or ultimately be unsuccessful;
•product and technology efficacy risks;
•acceptance risks among doctors and patients;
•significant regulatory and liability risks, including the possible later discovery of safety concerns and other defects and potential loss of approvals, competition from new products, and the expiration of patent protection;
•healthcare reforms and reimbursement policies of government or private healthcare payors, including pricing controls for prescription drug prices;
•intellectual property and technology risks under patent, copyright, and trade secret laws; and
•economic feasibility risks.
our life science tenants' ability to raise capital depends on the actual or perceived viability of their products and technologies, their financial and operating condition and outlook, and the overall financial, banking, and economic environment. if venture capital firms, private investors, the public markets, companies in the life science industry, the government, or other sources of funding are difficult to obtain or unavailable to support our tenants' activities, including as a result of general economic conditions or adverse market conditions that negatively impact our tenants' ability to raise capital, our tenants' business would be adversely affected or could fail. if our life science tenants' businesses are adversely affected, they may fail to make their rent payments to us, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition.
the hospitals on whose campuses our mobs are located and their affiliated healthcare systems could fail to remain competitive or financially viable, which could adversely impact their ability to attract physicians and physician groups to our mobs and our other properties that serve the healthcare industry.
the viability of hospitals depends on factors such as: (i) the quality and mix of healthcare services provided, (ii) competition for patients and physicians, (iii) demographic trends in the surrounding community, (iv) market position, (v) growth potential, and (vi) changes to the reimbursement system, as well as the ability of the affiliated healthcare systems to provide economies of scale and access to capital. in addition, hospitals could be negatively affected by widespread cancellations of elective procedures due to health and safety measures or otherwise. if a hospital whose campus is located near one of our mobs is unable to meet its financial obligations, and if an affiliated healthcare system is unable to support that hospital or goes bankrupt, the hospital may be unable to successfully compete or could be forced to close or relocate, which could adversely impact its ability to attract physicians and other healthcare-related users. because we rely on our proximity to, and affiliations with, these hospitals to create tenant demand for space in our mobs, their inability to remain competitive or financially viable, or to attract physicians and physician groups, could adversely affect our mob operations and have a material adverse effect on us.
we may be unable to develop, maintain, or expand hospital and health system client relationships.
we invest significant time in developing, maintaining, and expanding relationships with both new and existing hospital and health system clients. if we fail to maintain these relationships, including through a lack of responsiveness, failure to adapt to the current market, or employment of individuals with inadequate experience, our reputation and relationships will be harmed and we may lose business to competitors, which could have a material adverse effect on us.
we assume operational risks with respect to our senior housing properties managed in ridea structures that could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition.
although the ridea structure gives us certain oversight approval rights (e.g., budgets and material contracts) and the right to review operational and financial reporting information, our operators are ultimately in control of the day-to-day business of the property. as a result, we have limited rights to direct or influence the business or operations of our ccrcs and in the properties owned by our swf sh jv, all of which are under ridea structures, and we depend on our operators to operate these properties in a manner that complies with applicable law, minimizes legal risk, and maximizes the value of our investment.
table of contents under a ridea structure, our trs is ultimately responsible for all operational risks and other liabilities of the properties, other than those arising out of certain actions by our operator, such as gross negligence or willful misconduct. operational risks include, and our resulting revenues therefore depend on, among other things: (i) occupancy rates; (ii) the entrance fees and rental rates charged to residents; (iii) the requirements of, or changes to, governmental reimbursement programs such as medicare or medicaid, to the extent applicable, including changes to reimbursement rates; (iv) our operators' reputations and ability to attract and retain residents; (v) general economic conditions and market factors that impact seniors, including general inflationary pressures; (vi) competition from other senior housing providers; (vii) compliance with federal, state, local, and industry-regulated licensure, certification and inspection laws, regulations and standards; (viii) litigation involving our properties or residents/patients; (ix) the availability and cost of general and professional liability insurance coverage or increases in insurance policy deductibles; and (x) the ability to control operating expenses.
operators of our ccrcs and the swf sh jv properties primarily depend on private sources for their revenues and the ability of their patients and residents to pay fees. costs associated with independent and assisted living services are not generally reimbursable under governmental reimbursement programs such as medicare and medicaid. accordingly, our operators of these properties depend on attracting seniors with appropriate levels of income and assets, which may be affected by many factors, including: (i) prevailing economic and market trends, including general inflationary pressures; (ii) consumer confidence; (iii) demographics; (iv) property condition and safety; (v) public perception about such properties; and (vi) social and environmental factors.
in addition, epidemics, pandemics, and severe flu seasons or any other widespread illness could result in early move-outs or delayed move-ins during quarantine periods or during periods when actual or perceived risks of such illnesses are heightened, and have reduced, and could continue to reduce, our operators' revenues.
if our operators fail to effectively conduct operations on our behalf, or to maintain and improve our properties, it could adversely affect our business reputation as the owner of the properties, as well as the business reputation of our operators and their ability to attract and retain patients and residents in our properties, which could have a material adverse effect on our and our operators' business, results of operations, and financial condition.
economic conditions, natural disasters, weather, and other events or conditions that negatively affect geographic areas where we have concentrated investments could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition.
we are subject to increased exposure to adverse conditions affecting the geographies in which our properties are located, including: (i) downturns in local economies and increases in unemployment rates; (ii) changes in local real estate conditions, including increases in real estate taxes; (iii) increased competition; (iv) decreased demand; (v) changes in state and local legislation; and (vi) local climate events and natural disasters and other catastrophic events, such as pandemics, earthquakes, hurricanes, windstorms, flooding, wildfires, and mudslides and other physical climate risks, including water stress and heat stress. these risks could significantly disrupt our businesses in the region, harm our ability to compete effectively, result in increased costs, and divert management attention, any or all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition.
in addition, significant climate changes in areas where we own property could result in extreme weather and changes in precipitation and temperature, all of which could result in physical damage to or a decrease in demand for properties located in these areas or affected by these conditions. if changes in the climate have material effects, such as property destruction, or occur for extended periods, this could have a material adverse effect on business, results of operations and financial condition.
uninsured or underinsured losses could result in a significant loss of capital invested in a property, lower than expected future revenues, and unanticipated expense.
a large number of our properties are located in areas exposed to earthquakes, hurricanes, windstorms, flooding, water stress, heat stress, and other common natural disasters and physical climate risks. in particular, (i) a significant portion of our life science development projects and approximately 67% of our life science portfolio (based on gross asset value as of december 31, 2022) was concentrated in california, which is known to be subject to earthquakes, wildfires, and other natural disasters, and (ii) approximately 69% of our ccrc portfolio (based on gross asset value as of december 31, 2022) was concentrated in florida, which is known to be subject to hurricanes. while we maintain insurance coverage for earthquakes, fires, hurricanes, windstorms, floods, and other natural disasters and physical climate risks, we may be unable to purchase the limits and terms we desire on a commercially reasonable basis. we maintain earthquake insurance for our properties that are located in the vicinity of active earthquake zones in amounts and with deductibles we believe are commercially reasonable. because of our significant concentration in the seismically active regions of south san francisco, california, and san diego, california, an earthquake in these areas could damage a significant portion of our life science portfolio. similarly, a hurricane in florida could damage a significant portion of our ccrc portfolio. as a result, aggregate deductible amounts may be material, and our insurance coverage may be materially insufficient to cover our losses. furthermore, there are certain exposures for which we do not purchase insurance because we do not believe it is economically feasible to do so or there is no viable insurance market.
table of contents if one of our properties experiences a loss that is uninsured or that exceeds policy coverage limits, we could lose our investment in the damaged property as well as the anticipated future cash flows from such property. if the damaged property is subject to recourse indebtedness, we could continue to be liable for the indebtedness even if the property is irreparably damaged. in addition, even if damage to our properties is covered by insurance, a disruption of business caused by a casualty event may result in loss of revenues for us. any business interruption insurance may not fully compensate the lender or us for such loss of revenue. our insurance coverage does not include damages from business interruptions, loss of revenue or earnings or any related effects caused by pandemics, including the covid pandemic. generally, insurance coverage for pandemics has not been readily available and, if and when it does become available, may not be on commercially reasonable terms. further, even if such coverage is available on commercially reasonable terms, we may be unable to receive insurance proceeds that would compensate us fully for our liabilities, costs, and expenses in the event of a pandemic.
our ccrc and senior housing operators also face various forms of class-action lawsuits from time to time, such as wage and hour and consumer rights actions, which generally are not covered by insurance. these class actions could result in significant defense costs, as well as settlements or verdicts that materially decrease anticipated revenues from a property and can result in the loss of a portion or all of our invested capital. we may also incur significant out-of-pocket costs associated with legal proceedings or other claims from residents and patients at our properties. any of the foregoing risks could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition.
our use of joint ventures may limit our returns on and our flexibility with jointly owned investments.
from time to time, we develop, acquire, and/or recapitalize properties in joint ventures with other persons or entities when circumstances warrant the use of these structures. our participation in joint ventures is subject to risks that may not be present with other methods of ownership, including:
•our joint venture partners could have investment and financing goals that are inconsistent with our objectives, including the timing, terms, and strategies for any investments, and what levels of debt to incur or carry;
•because we lack sole decision-making authority, we could experience impasses or disputes relating to certain decisions, including budget approvals, acquisitions, sales of assets, debt financing, execution of lease agreements, and vendor approvals, which could result in delayed decisions and missed opportunities and could require us to expend additional resources on litigation or arbitration to resolve;
•our joint venture partners may have competing interests that create conflicts of interest in our markets;
•our ability to transfer our interest in a joint venture to a third party may be restricted;
•the market for our interest may be limited and/or valued lower than fair market value;
•our joint venture partners may be structured differently than us for tax purposes, and this could create conflicts of interest and risks to our reit status;
•our joint venture partners might become insolvent, fail to fund their share of required capital contributions or fail to fulfill their obligations as a joint venture partner, which may require us to infuse our own capital into the venture on behalf of the partner despite other competing uses for such capital;
•our joint venture agreements may contain anti-competitive restrictions that impact certain of our non-joint venture assets and require us to manage the non-joint venture assets in a manner we otherwise would not; and
•our joint venture agreements may in certain circumstances grant our partners a right of first refusal to acquire certain of our non-joint venture assets.
in addition, in some instances, our joint venture partner will have the right to cause us to sell our interest, or acquire their interest, at a time when we otherwise would not have initiated such a transaction. our ability to acquire our partner's interest will be limited if we lack sufficient capital resources. this could require us to sell our interest in the joint venture when we might otherwise prefer to retain it. any of the foregoing risks could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition.
rent escalators or contingent rent provisions in our leases could hinder our profitability and growth.
we derive a significant portion of our revenues from leasing properties pursuant to leases that generally provide for fixed rental rates, subject to annual escalations. if inflation exceeds our annual escalations, as it often recently has, our growth and profitability may be limited.
under certain leases, a portion of the tenant's rental payment to us is based on the property's revenues (i.e., contingent rent). if a tenant's revenue at a rental property with contingent rent declines, our rental revenues would decrease.
table of contents additionally, some of our leases provide that annual rent is modified based on changes in the consumer price index or other thresholds (i.e., contingent rent escalators). if the consumer price index does not increase or other applicable thresholds are not met, rental rates may not increase as anticipated or at all, which could hinder our profitability and growth. furthermore, if economic conditions result in significant increases in the consumer price index, but the escalations under our leases with contingent rent escalators are capped or the increase in the consumer price index exceeds our tenants' ability to pay, our growth and profitability also may be limited.
competition may make it difficult to identify and purchase, or develop, suitable healthcare properties to grow our investment portfolio, to finance acquisitions on favorable terms, or to retain or attract tenants and operators.
we face significant competition from other reits, investment companies, private equity and hedge fund investors, sovereign funds, healthcare operators, lenders, developers, and other institutional investors, some of whom may have greater resources and lower costs of capital than we do. increased competition and resulting capitalization rate compression make it more challenging for us to identify and successfully capitalize on opportunities that meet our business goals and could improve the bargaining power of property owners seeking to sell, thereby impeding our investment, acquisition, and development activities. similarly, our properties face competition for tenants and operators from other properties in the same market, which may affect our ability to attract and retain tenants and operators, or may reduce the rents we are able to charge. the failure to capitalize on our development pipeline, identify, and purchase a sufficient quantity of healthcare properties at favorable prices, finance acquisitions on commercially favorable terms, or attract and retain profitable tenants could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition.
we may be unable to successfully foreclose or exercise rights on the collateral securing our real estate-related loans and, even if we are successful in our foreclosure or realization efforts, we may be unable to successfully operate, occupy, or reposition the underlying real estate.
if a borrower defaults under one of our mortgages, we may look to foreclose on the loan or take additional actions, including acquiring title to the collateral via statutory or judicial foreclosure or commencing collection litigation. we may determine that substantial improvements or repairs to the property are necessary in order to maximize the property's investment potential. in some cases, because our collateral consists of the equity interests in an entity that directly or indirectly owns the applicable real property or interests in other operating properties, we may not have full recourse with respect to assets of that entity, or that entity may have incurred unexpected liabilities, either of which would preclude us from fully recovering our investment. borrowers may contest enforcement of foreclosure or other remedies, seek bankruptcy protection against our exercise of enforcement or other remedies, and/or bring claims for lender liability in response to actions to enforce mortgage obligations. because many of the properties securing our mortgage loans are licensed senior housing health care facilities, we would also need to navigate and comply with various healthcare regulatory matters in a variety of states in connection with any foreclosure effort. foreclosure or collections-related costs, high loan-to-value ratios, healthcare regulatory issues or consents, or declines in the value of the property, may prevent us from realizing an amount equal to our mortgage balance upon foreclosure or conclusion of litigation, and we may be required to record a valuation allowance for such losses. even if we are able to successfully foreclose on the collateral securing our real estate-related loans, we may acquire properties for which we may be unable to expeditiously secure tenants or operators, if at all, or that are burdened with healthcare regulatory compliance issues that need to be addressed, or we may acquire equity interests that we are unable to immediately resell or otherwise liquidate due to limitations under the securities laws, either of which would adversely affect our ability to fully recover our investment.
we may invest substantial resources and time in transactions that are not consummated.
we regularly review potential transactions in order to maximize stockholder value. our review process may require significant management attention, and a potential transaction could be abandoned or rejected by us or the other parties involved after we expend significant resources and time.
we may not be able to successfully integrate or operate acquisitions, or may incur unanticipated liabilities.
successful integration of acquired companies depends primarily on our ability to consolidate operations, systems, procedures, properties, and personnel, and to eliminate redundancies and reduce costs. we may encounter difficulties in these integrations. potential difficulties associated with acquisitions include: (i) our ability to effectively monitor and manage our expanded portfolio of properties; (ii) the loss of key employees; (iii) the disruption of our ongoing business or that of the acquired entity; (iv) possible inconsistencies in standards, controls, procedures, and policies; and (v) the assumption of unexpected liabilities and claims, including:
•liabilities relating to the cleanup or remediation of undisclosed environmental conditions;
•unasserted claims of vendors, residents, patients, or other persons dealing with the seller;
•liabilities, claims, and litigation, whether or not incurred in the ordinary course of business, relating to periods prior to our acquisition;

•claims for indemnification by general partners, directors, officers, and others indemnified by the seller;
•claims for return of government reimbursement payments; and
•liabilities for taxes relating to periods prior to our acquisition.
in addition, acquired companies and their properties may fail to perform as expected, including with respect to estimated cost savings. inaccurate assumptions regarding future rental or occupancy rates could result in overly optimistic estimates of future revenues. similarly, we may underestimate future operating expenses or the costs necessary to bring properties up to standards established for their intended use or for property improvements.
if we have difficulties with any of these areas, or if we later discover additional liabilities or experience unforeseen costs relating to our acquired companies, we may not achieve the anticipated economic benefits from our acquisitions, and this may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition.
we may be affected by unfavorable resolution of litigation or disputes and rising liability and insurance costs as a result thereof or other market factors.
our tenants, operators, property managers, and borrowers are from time to time parties to litigation, including, for example, disputes regarding the quality of care at healthcare properties. the effect of litigation may materially increase the costs incurred by our tenants, operators, property managers, and borrowers, including costs to monitor and report quality of care compliance. in addition, the cost of professional liability, medical malpractice, property, business interruption, and insurance policies can be significant and may increase or not be available at a reasonable cost or at all. cost increases could cause our tenants and borrowers to be unable to make their lease or mortgage payments or fail to purchase the appropriate liability and malpractice insurance, or cause our borrowers to be unable to meet their obligations to us, potentially decreasing our revenues and increasing our collection and litigation costs. cost increases could also lead our operators and property managers to increase the fees they charge, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition.
furthermore, with respect to our ccrc properties and the properties in our swf sh jv, all of which are operated in ridea structures, we directly bear the costs of any such increases in litigation, monitoring, reporting, and insurance due to our direct exposure to the cash flows of such properties. we are responsible for these claims, litigation, and liabilities, with limited indemnification rights against our operators, which are typically based on the gross negligence or willful misconduct by the operator. although our leases provide us with certain information rights with respect to our tenants, one or more of our tenants may be or become party to pending litigation or investigation of which we are unaware or in which we do not have a right to participate or evaluate. in such cases, we would be unable to determine the potential impact of such litigation or investigation on our tenants or our business or results. moreover, negative publicity of any of our operators', property managers', or tenants' litigation, other legal proceedings or investigations may also negatively impact their and our reputation, resulting in lower customer demand and revenues, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flow.
we may also be named as defendants in lawsuits arising out of our alleged actions or the alleged actions of our tenants, operators, or property managers for which such tenants, operators, or property managers may have agreed to indemnify us. unfavorable resolution of any such litigation or negative publicity as a result of such litigation could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition. regardless of the outcome, litigation or other legal proceedings may result in substantial costs, disruption of our normal business operations, and the diversion of management attention. we may be unable to prevail in, or achieve a favorable settlement of, any pending or future legal action against us.
even when a tenant or operator is obligated to indemnify us for liability incurred as a result of a lawsuit pursuant to the terms of its agreement with us, the tenant may fail to satisfy those obligations and, in such event, we would have to incur the costs that should have been covered by the tenant, operator, or property manager and to determine whether to expend additional resources to seek the contractually owed indemnity from that tenant, operator, or property manager, including potentially through litigation or arbitration. in some instances, we may decide not to enforce our indemnification rights if we believe that enforcement of such rights would be more detrimental to our business than alternative approaches. regardless, such an event would divert management attention and may result in a disruption to our normal business operations, any or all of which could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition.
table of contents environmental compliance costs and liabilities associated with our real estate-related investments may be substantial and may materially impair the value of those investments.
federal, state and local laws, ordinances, and regulations may require us, as a current or previous owner of real estate, to investigate and clean up certain hazardous or toxic substances released at a property. we may be held liable to a governmental entity or to third parties for injury or property damage and for investigation and cleanup costs incurred in connection with the contamination. the costs of cleanup and remediation could be substantial. in addition, some environmental laws create a lien on the contaminated site in favor of the government for damages and the costs it incurs in connection with the contamination, and/or impose fines and penalties on the property owner with respect to such contamination.
although we currently carry environmental insurance on our properties in an amount that we believe is commercially reasonable and generally require our tenants and operators to indemnify us for environmental liabilities they cause, such liabilities could exceed the amount of our insurance, the financial ability of the tenant or operator to indemnify us, or the value of the contaminated property. as the owner of a site, we may also be held liable to third parties for damages and injuries resulting from environmental contamination emanating from the site. we may also experience environmental costs and liabilities arising from conditions not known to us or disrupted during development. the cost of defending against these claims, complying with environmental regulatory requirements, conducting remediation of any contaminated property, or paying personal injury or other claims or fines could be substantial and could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition. in addition, the presence of contamination or the failure to remediate contamination may materially adversely affect our ability to use, develop, sell, or lease the property or to borrow using the property as collateral.
we may be impacted by epidemics, pandemics, or other infectious diseases, including covid, and health and safety measures intended to reduce their spread.
epidemics, pandemics, or other infectious diseases, including the ongoing covid pandemic and those caused by possible new variants, as well as both future widespread and localized outbreaks of infectious diseases and other health concerns, and the health and safety measures taken to reduce the spread or lessen the impact, could cause a material disruption to our industry or deteriorate the economy as a whole. the impacts of such events could be severe and far-reaching, and may impact our operations in several ways, including: (i) tenants could experience deteriorating financial conditions and be unable or unwilling to pay rent on time and in full; (ii) we may have to restructure tenants' obligations and may not be able to do so on terms that are favorable to us; (iii) inquiries and tours at our properties could decrease; (iv) move-ins and new tenanting efforts, and re-letting efforts could slow or stop altogether; (v) move-outs and potential early termination of leases thereunder could increase; (vi) operating expenses, including the costs of certain essential services or supplies, including payments to third-party contractors, service providers, and employees essential to ensure continuity in our building operations may increase; (vii) procedures normally conducted on our properties may be disrupted, adversely affecting the economic viability of our tenants; and (viii) costs of development, including expenditures for materials utilized in construction and labor essential to complete existing developments in progress, may increase substantially.
the loss or limited availability of our key personnel could disrupt or impair our operations.
we depend on the efforts of our executive officers for the success of our business. although they are covered by our executive severance plan and change in control plan, which provide many of the benefits typically found in executive employment agreements, none of our executive officers have employment agreements with us. the loss or limited availability of the services of any of our executive officers, or our inability to recruit and retain qualified personnel, could, at least temporarily, disrupt, or impair our operations.
we rely on information technology in our operations, and any material failure, inadequacy, interruption, or security failure of that technology could harm our business.
we rely on information technology networks and systems to process, transmit, and store electronic information, and to manage or support a variety of business processes, including financial transactions and records, and to maintain personal identifying information and tenant and lease data. we utilize software and cloud-based technology from vendors, on whom our systems depend. we rely on commercially available systems, software, tools, and monitoring to provide security for the processing, transmission, and storage of confidential tenant and customer data, including individually identifiable information relating to financial accounts. although we have taken steps to protect the security of our information systems, with multiple layers of controls around the data maintained in those systems, it is possible that our safety and security measures will not prevent the systems' improper functioning or damage, or the improper access or disclosure of personally identifiable information such as in the event of cyber-attacks. the risk of security breaches has generally increased as the number, intensity, and sophistication of attacks and intrusions have increased, and we have seen a significant increase in cyber phishing attacks. the risk of security breaches has also increased under our hybrid work model. furthermore, because our operators also rely on the internet, information technology networks, systems, and software, some of our data may be vulnerable to cyber-attacks on our operators.
table of contents security breaches of our or our operators' networks and systems, including those caused by physical or electronic break-ins, computer viruses, malware, worms, attacks by hackers or foreign governments, disruptions from unauthorized access and tampering, including through social engineering such as phishing attacks, coordinated denial-of-service attacks, and similar breaches could result in, among other things: (i) system disruptions; (ii) shutdowns; (iii) unauthorized access to or disclosure of confidential information; (iv) misappropriation of our or our business partners' proprietary or confidential information; (v) breach of our legal, regulatory, or contractual obligations; (vi) inability to access or rely upon critical business records or systems; or (vii) other delays in our operations. in some cases, it may be difficult to anticipate or immediately detect such incidents and the damage they cause. we may be required to expend significant financial resources to protect against or to remediate such security breaches. in addition, our technology infrastructure and information systems are vulnerable to damage or interruption from natural disasters, power loss, and telecommunications failures. any failure to maintain proper function, security, and availability of our and our operators' information systems and the data maintained in those systems could interrupt our operations, damage our reputation, subject us to liability claims or regulatory penalties, harm our business relationships, or increase our security and insurance costs, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.
risks related to our capital structure and market conditions increased borrowing costs could materially adversely impact our ability to refinance existing debt, sell properties and conduct acquisition, investment, and development activities, and could cause our stock price to decline.
increased borrowing costs and attendant negative impacts on our business can reduce the amount investors are willing to pay for our common stock. because reit stocks are often perceived as high-yield investments, investors may perceive less relative benefit to owning reit stocks as borrowing costs increase.
additionally, we have and may incur additional debt obligations that have variable interest rates and related payments that vary with the movement of certain indices. recent increases in interest rates have increased interest costs for our variable rate debt and our new debt, and interest rates may continue to rise. these interest rates make the financing of any acquisition and development activity more costly. in addition, increased interest rates could decrease the amount third parties are willing to pay for our properties, thereby limiting our ability to reposition our portfolio promptly in response to changes in economic or other conditions.
rising borrowing costs could limit our ability to refinance existing debt when it matures, or cause us to pay higher interest rates upon refinancing and increase interest expense on refinanced indebtedness. if our prevailing borrowing costs are higher than the interest rates of our senior notes at their maturity, we will incur additional interest expense upon any replacement debt.
we manage a portion of our exposure to interest rate risk by accessing debt with staggered maturities and through the use of derivative instruments, primarily interest rate cap and swap agreements. these agreements involve risk, including that counterparties may fail to honor their obligations under these arrangements, that these arrangements may not be effective in reducing our exposure to interest rate changes, that the amount of income we earn from hedging transactions may be limited by federal tax provisions governing reits and that these arrangements may cause us to incur higher debt service costs than would otherwise be the case. failure to hedge effectively against interest rate risk could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.
cash available for distribution to stockholders may be insufficient to make dividend distributions at expected levels and are made at the discretion of our board of directors.
decreases in cash available for distributions may result in us being unable to make dividend distributions at expected levels. our failure to make distributions commensurate with market expectations would likely result in a decrease in the market price of our common stock. further, all distributions are made at the discretion of our board of directors in accordance with maryland law and depend on: (i) our earnings; (ii) our financial condition; (iii) debt and equity capital available to us; (iv) our expectations for future capital requirements and operating performance; (v) restrictive covenants in our financial or other contractual arrangements, including those in our credit facility agreement; (vi) maintenance of our reit qualification; and (vii) other factors as our board of directors may deem relevant from time to time.
if access to external capital is unavailable on acceptable terms or at all, it could have a material adverse effect on our ability to meet commitments as they become due or make investments necessary to grow our business.
we periodically rely on external sources of capital (including debt and equity financing) to fulfill our capital requirements. the availability of external capital sources depends upon several factors, some of which we have little or no control over, including:
•general availability of capital, including less favorable terms, rising interest rates, and increased borrowing costs;
•the market price of the shares of our equity securities and the credit ratings of our debt and any preferred securities we may issue;

•the market's perception of our growth potential and our current and potential future earnings and cash distributions;
•our degree of financial leverage and operational flexibility;
•the financial integrity of our lenders, which might impair their ability to meet their commitments to us or their willingness to make additional loans to us, and our inability to replace the financing commitment of any such lender on favorable terms, or at all;
•the stability of the market value of our properties;
•the financial performance and general market perception of our tenants and operators;
•changes in the credit ratings on u.s. government debt securities or default or delay in payment by the united states of its obligations;
•issues facing the healthcare industry, including healthcare reform and changes in government reimbursement policies; and
•the performance of the national and global economies generally, including any economic downturn and volatility in the financial markets.
if access to capital is unavailable on acceptable terms or at all, it could have a material adverse impact on our ability to fund operations, repay or refinance our debt obligations, fund dividend payments, acquire properties, and make the investments in development and redevelopment activities, as well as capital expenditures, needed to grow our business.
our level of indebtedness may increase and materially adversely affect our future operations.
our outstanding indebtedness as of december 31, 2022 was approximately $6.5 billion. we may incur additional indebtedness, which may be substantial. any significant additional indebtedness would likely negatively affect the credit ratings of our debt and require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow to interest and principal payments. greater demands on our cash resources may reduce funds available to us to pay dividends, conduct development activities, make capital expenditures and acquisitions, or carry out other aspects of our business strategy. increased indebtedness can also make us more vulnerable to general adverse economic and industry conditions and create competitive disadvantages for us compared to other companies with comparatively lower debt levels. increased future debt service obligations may limit our operational flexibility, including our ability to finance or refinance our properties, contribute properties to joint ventures, or sell properties as needed.
covenants in our debt instruments limit our operational flexibility, and breaches of these covenants could result in adverse actions by our creditors.
the terms of our current secured and unsecured debt instruments require us to comply with a number of customary financial and other covenants, such as maintaining leverage ratios, minimum tangible net worth requirements, reit status, and certain levels of debt service coverage. our ability to incur additional debt and to conduct business in general is subject to compliance with these covenants, which limits our operational flexibility. for example, mortgages on our properties contain customary covenants such as those that limit or restrict our ability, without the consent of the lender, to further encumber or sell the applicable properties, or to replace the applicable tenant or operator. breaches of certain covenants may result in defaults under the mortgages on our properties and cross-defaults under certain of our other indebtedness, even if we satisfy our payment obligations to the respective obligee. covenants that limit our operational flexibility, as well as defaults resulting from the breach of any of these covenants, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition.
volatility, disruption, or uncertainty in the financial markets may impair our ability to raise capital, obtain new financing or refinance existing obligations, and fund real estate and development activities.
increased or prolonged market disruption, volatility, or uncertainty could have a material adverse effect on our ability to raise capital, obtain new financing or refinance our existing obligations as they mature, and fund real estate and development activities. our lenders and other financial institutions could also require us to agree to more restrictive covenants, grant liens on our assets as collateral and/or accept other terms that are not commercially beneficial to us in order to obtain financing. one or more of our lenders under our credit facility could refuse or fail to fund their financing commitment to us as a result of lender liquidity and/or viability challenges, which financing commitments we may not be able to replace on favorable terms, or at all. market volatility could also lead to significant uncertainty in the valuation of our investments and those of our joint ventures, which may result in a substantial decrease in the value of our properties and those of our joint ventures. as a result, we may be unable to recover the carrying amount of such investments and the associated goodwill, if any, which may require us to recognize impairment charges in earnings.
table of contents adverse changes in our credit ratings could impair our ability to obtain additional debt and equity financing on favorable terms.
our credit ratings affect the amount and type of capital, as well as the terms of any financing we may obtain. the credit ratings of our senior unsecured debt are based on, among other things, our operating performance, liquidity and leverage ratios, overall financial position, level of indebtedness, and pending or future changes in the regulatory framework applicable to our operators and our industry. if we are unable to maintain our current credit ratings, we would likely incur higher borrowing costs, which would make it more difficult or expensive to obtain additional financing or refinance existing obligations and commitments. an adverse change in our outlook may ultimately lead to a downgrade in our credit ratings, which would trigger additional borrowing costs or other potentially negative consequences under our current credit facilities and debt instruments. also, if our credit ratings are downgraded, or general market conditions were to ascribe higher risk to our ratings, our industry, or us, our access to capital and the cost of any future debt financing will be further negatively impacted. in addition, the terms of future debt agreements could include more restrictive covenants, or require incremental collateral, which may further restrict our business operations or be unavailable due to our covenant restrictions then in effect. there is no guarantee that debt or equity financings will be available in the future to fund future acquisitions or general operating expenses, or that such financing will be available on terms consistent with our historical agreements or expectations.
risks related to the regulatory environment tenants, operators, and borrowers that fail to comply with federal, state, local, and international laws and regulations, including resident health and safety requirements, as well as licensure, certification and inspection requirements, may cease to operate or be unable to meet their financial and other contractual obligations to us.
our tenants, operators, and borrowers across our segments are subject to or impacted by extensive, frequently changing federal, state, and local laws and regulations. see "item 1, business-government regulation, licensing, and enforcement-healthcare licensure and certificate of need" for a discussion of certain of these laws and regulations. unannounced surveys, inspections, or audits occur frequently, including following a regulator's receipt of a complaint about a facility, and these surveys, inspections, and audits can result in deficiencies and further adverse action. our tenants', operators', or borrowers' failure to comply with any of the laws, regulations, or requirements applicable to them could result in: (i) loss of accreditation; (ii) denial of reimbursement; (iii) imposition of fines; (iv) suspension or decertification from government healthcare programs; (v) civil liability; and (vi) in certain instances, suspension or denial of admissions, criminal penalties, loss of license, or closure of the property and/or the incurrence of considerable costs arising from an investigation or regulatory action, which may have an adverse effect on properties that we own and lease to a third party tenant in our life science and mob segments, that we own and operate through a ridea structure in our ccrc segment or our swf sh jv, or on which we hold a mortgage, and therefore may materially adversely impact us.
furthermore, we are required under ridea to rely on our operators to oversee and direct these aspects of the properties' operations to ensure compliance with applicable laws and regulations. if one or more of our healthcare properties fails to comply with applicable laws and regulations, our trs would be responsible (except in limited circumstances, such as the gross negligence or willful misconduct of our operators, where we would have a contractual claim against them), which could subject our trs to penalties including loss or suspension of licenses, certification or accreditation, exclusion from government healthcare programs (i.e., medicare, medicaid), administrative sanctions, and civil monetary penalties. some states also reserve the right to sanction affiliates of a licensee when they take administrative action against the licensee, and require a licensee to report all healthcare-related administrative actions that have been brought against any of the licensee's affiliates, even in other states. additionally, when we receive individually identifiable health information relating to residents of our healthcare properties, we are subject to federal and state data privacy and security laws and rules, and could be subject to liability in the event of an audit, complaint, cybersecurity attack, or data breach. furthermore, our trs has exposure to professional liability claims that could arise out of resident claims, such as quality of care, and the associated litigation costs.
table of contents required regulatory approvals can delay or prohibit transfers of our senior housing properties.
transfers of senior housing properties, including in connection with the foreclosure of a real-estate secured loan, to successor owners or operators are typically subject to regulatory approvals or ratifications, including change of ownership approvals for licensure and medicare / medicaid (if applicable) that are not required for transfers of other types of commercial operations and other types of real estate. the sale of, or replacement of any operator at, our senior housing facilities, or the foreclosure of a loan secured by senior housing real estate, could be delayed by the regulatory approval process of any federal, state, or local government agency necessary for the transfer of the property or the replacement of the operator licensed to manage the property, during which time the property may experience performance declines. we may also elect to use an interim licensing structure to facilitate such transfers, which structure expedites the transfer by allowing a third party to operate under our license until the required regulatory approvals are obtained, but could subject us to fines or penalties if the third party fails to comply with applicable laws and regulations and fails to indemnify us for such fines or penalties pursuant to the terms of its agreement with us.
compliance with the americans with disabilities act and fire, safety, and other regulations may require us to make expenditures that adversely affect our cash flows.
our properties must comply with applicable ada and any similar state and local laws. these laws may require removal of barriers to access by persons with disabilities in public areas of our properties. noncompliance could result in the incurrence of additional costs associated with bringing the properties into compliance, the imposition of fines or an award of damages to private litigants in individual lawsuits or as part of a class action. we could be required to expend funds to comply with the provisions of the ada and similar state and local laws on behalf of tenants, which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.
in addition, we are required to operate our properties in compliance with fire and safety regulations, building codes, and other land use regulations. new and revised regulations and codes may be adopted by governmental agencies and bodies and become applicable to our properties. for example, new safety laws for senior housing properties were adopted following the particularly damaging 2018 hurricane season. compliance could require substantial capital expenditures, both for significant upgrades and for tenant relocations that may be necessary depending on the scope and duration of upgrades, and may restrict our ability to renovate our properties. these expenditures and restrictions could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and cash flows.
laws or regulations prohibiting eviction of our tenants, even on a temporary basis, could have a material adverse effect on our revenues if our tenants fail to make their contractual rent payments to us.
various federal, state, and local governments have enacted, and may continue to enact, laws, regulations, and moratoriums or take other actions that could limit our ability to evict tenants until such laws, regulations, or moratoriums are reversed or lifted. in particular, several state and local governments implemented eviction moratoriums as a result of the covid pandemic that applied to both residential and commercial tenants. although these moratoriums have generally terminated or expired, federal, state, and local governments could enact moratoriums under similar circumstances in the future. while we generally have arrangements and other agreements that give us the right under specified circumstances to terminate a lease or evict a tenant for nonpayment of contractual rent, such laws, regulations and moratoriums may restrict our ability to begin eviction proceedings even where no rent or only partial rent is being paid. further, under current laws and regulations, eviction proceedings for delinquent tenants are already costly and time-consuming, and, if there are existing backlogs or backlogs develop in courts due to higher than normal eviction proceedings, we may incur significant costs and it may take a significant amount of time to ultimately evict any tenant who is not meeting their contractual rent obligations. if we are restricted, delayed, or prohibited from evicting tenants for failing to make contractual rent payments, it may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition.
the requirements of, or changes to, governmental reimbursement programs such as medicare or medicaid may adversely affect our tenants', operators', and borrowers' ability to meet their financial and other contractual obligations to us.
certain of our tenants, operators, and borrowers, as well as our owned assets in the ccrc segment and swf sh jv, are affected, directly or indirectly, by a complex set of federal, state, and local laws and regulations pertaining to governmental reimbursement programs, including the cares act and other similar relief legislation enacted as a result of the covid pandemic. these laws and regulations are subject to frequent and substantial changes that are sometimes applied retroactively. see "item 1, business-government regulation, licensing, and enforcement." for example, to the extent that our tenants, operators, or borrowers, or assets owned in our ccrc segment or through the sfw sh jv, receive a significant portion of their revenues from governmental payors, primarily medicare and medicaid, they are generally subject to, among other things:
•statutory and regulatory changes;
•retroactive rate adjustments and recoupment efforts;

•recovery of program overpayments or set-offs;
•federal, state, and local litigation and enforcement actions, including those relating to covid and the failure to satisfy the terms and conditions of financial relief;
•administrative proceedings;
•policy interpretations;
•payment or other delays by fiscal intermediaries or carriers;
•government funding restrictions (at a program level or with respect to specific properties);
•reduced reimbursement rates under managed care contracts;
•changes in reimbursement rates, methods, or timing under governmental reimbursement programs;
•interruption or delays in payments due to any ongoing governmental investigations and audits at such properties; and
•reputational harm of publicly disclosed enforcement actions, audits, or investigations related to billing and reimbursements.
the failure to comply with the extensive laws, regulations and other requirements applicable to their business and the operation of our properties could result in, among other challenges: (i) becoming ineligible to receive reimbursement from governmental reimbursement programs or being compelled to repay amounts received, including under the cares act; (ii) becoming subject to prepayment reviews or claims for overpayments; (iii) bans on admissions of new patients or residents; (iv) civil or criminal penalties; and (v) significant operational changes, including requirements to increase staffing or the scope of care given to residents. these laws and regulations are enforced by a variety of federal, state, and local agencies and can also be enforced by private litigants through, among other things, federal and state false claims acts, which allow private litigants to bring qui tam or "whistleblower" actions.
we are unable to predict future changes to or interpretations of federal, state, and local statutes and regulations, including the medicare and medicaid statutes and regulations, or the intensity of enforcement efforts with respect to such statutes and regulations. any changes in the regulatory framework or the intensity or extent of governmental or private enforcement actions could have a material adverse effect on our tenants, operators, borrowers, and/or assets.
sometimes, governmental payors freeze or reduce payments to healthcare providers, or provide annual reimbursement rate increases that are smaller than expected, due to budgetary and other pressures. in addition, the federal government periodically makes changes in the statutes and regulations relating to medicare and medicaid reimbursement that may impact state reimbursement programs, particularly medicaid reimbursement and managed care payments. we cannot make any assessment as to the ultimate timing or the effect that any future changes may have on our tenants', operators', and borrowers' costs of doing business, or the cost of doing business for or the assets owned in our ccrc segment or through the sfw sh jv, and on the amount of reimbursement by government and other third-party payors. the failure of any of our tenants, operators, or borrowers to comply with these laws and regulations, and significant limits on the scope of services reimbursed, reductions in reimbursement rates and fees, or increases in provider or similar types of taxes, could materially adversely affect their ability to meet their financial and contractual obligations to us.
furthermore, executive orders and legislation may amend the patient protection and affordable care act, along with the health care and education reconciliation act of 2010 (collectively, the "affordable care act") and related regulations in whole or in part. we also anticipate that congress, state legislatures, and third-party payors may continue to review and assess alternative healthcare delivery and payment systems and may propose and adopt legislation or policy changes or implementations effecting additional fundamental changes in the healthcare system. for example, the department of health and human services has focused on tying medicare payments to quality or value through alternative payment models, which generally aim to make providers attentive to the total costs of treatments. medicare no longer reimburses hospitals for care related to certain preventable adverse events and imposes payment reductions on hospitals for preventable readmissions. these punitive approaches could be expanded to additional types of providers in the future. additionally, the patient driven payment model utilized by the centers for medicare and medicaid services to calculate reimbursement rates for patients in skilled nursing properties (which is among the unit types in our ccrcs) could result in decreases in payments to our operators and tenants or increase our operators' and tenants' costs. if any such changes significantly and adversely affect our tenants' or borrowers' profitability, they could in turn negatively affect our tenants' or borrowers' ability and willingness to comply with the terms of their leases and/or loan documents with us and/or renew their leases with us upon expiration or repay their loans upon maturity, which could impact our business, prospects, financial condition, or results of operations.
table of contents we could be negatively impacted by legislation to address federal government operations and administrative decisions affecting the centers for medicare and medicaid services.
congressional consideration of legislation pertaining to the federal debt ceiling, the affordable care act, tax reform, and entitlement programs, including reimbursement rates for physicians, could have a material adverse effect on our tenants', operators', and borrowers' liquidity, financial condition, or results of operations. in particular, reduced funding for entitlement programs such as medicare and medicaid would result in increased costs and fees for programs such as medicare advantage plans and additional reductions in reimbursements to providers. amendments to the affordable care act in whole or in part and decisions by the centers for medicare and medicaid services could impact the delivery of services and benefits under medicare, medicaid, or medicare advantage plans and could affect our tenants and operators and the manner in which they are reimbursed by such programs. any shutdown of the federal government that delays or disrupts payments or any other material adverse effect on payments to our tenants, operators, or borrowers could adversely affect their ability to satisfy their obligations to us and could have a material adverse effect on us.
our participation in the cares act provider relief fund and other covid-related stimulus and relief programs could subject us to disruptive government and financial audits and investigations, regulatory enforcement actions, civil litigation, and other claims, penalties, and liabilities.
under the cares act and subsequent relief legislation, congress has allocated more than $178 billion to eligible hospitals, physicians, and other health care providers through the public health and social services emergency fund (the "provider relief fund" or "prf"). the u.s. department of health and human services ("hhs") has distributed prf awards through various general and targeted distributions, including certain distributions that were paid automatically to providers, and others that required providers to submit requested data or applications. we and our senior housing operators (including operators of senior housing facilities that we have subsequently disposed of) have received relief funds through several distributions, both via automatic payments and also as a result of applications or other filings we submitted for prf funds.
prf funds are intended to reimburse eligible providers for unreimbursed health care-related expenses and lost revenues attributable to covid and must be used only to prevent, prepare for, or respond to covid. prf funds received under certain targeted distributions, including the nursing home infection control distribution, are further limited to specific uses. additionally, the prf program imposes certain distribution-specific eligibility criteria and requires recipients to comply with various terms and conditions. hhs has stated that compliance with prf program terms and conditions is material to hhs's decision to disburse prf payments to recipients. prf program terms and conditions include limitations and requirements governing use of prf funds, implementation of controls, retention of records relating to prf funds, audit and reporting to governmental authorities, and other prf program requirements. hhs interpretation of these terms and requirements regarding eligibility, use of funds, audit, and reporting continues to evolve and there is a high degree of uncertainty surrounding interpretation and implementation, particularly among more complex corporate, transactional, and contractual relationships, including ridea structures and for organizations with multiple recipient subsidiaries. accordingly, prf guidance or hhs interpretations could change in ways that adversely impact the prf funding we receive, our ability to retain prf funding, or our eligibility to participate in the prf program.
changing prf program requirements could reduce the amount of prf funds we receive or are permitted to retain and could render us or our operators ineligible for future or previously received prf funds. prf reporting obligations and monitoring and compliance efforts could impose substantial costs, become overly burdensome, and require significant attention from leadership, disrupting our business and impeding our operations. further, our current and former operators may not consistently use, account for, or document prf and other relief funds, which may adversely impact availability of data and consistency in our reporting, including among current and former operators and across reporting periods. ultimately, as prf program requirements and interpretations continue to evolve, we may determine that we are unable to comply with certain terms and conditions, or that we are no longer eligible for some or all of the prf payments we or our operators previously received. if we are unable to fully comply with applicable prf terms and conditions, we may be required to return some or all prf funds received and may be subject to further enforcement action.
due to our and our operators' participation in the prf program, we may be subject to government and other audits and investigations related to our receipt and use of prf funds. these audits and investigations also may impose substantial costs and disruptions. if the government determines that we failed to comply with prf terms and conditions, related interpretative guidance, or applicable federal award requirements, or that our prf applications and submissions were defective, prf funds that we or our operators have received may be subject to recoupment and further enforcement actions could result. this could occur even if our interpretation of prf program requirements was reasonable under the present or then-existing prf guidance and hhs interpretations. government audits and investigations also could result in other regulatory penalties or enforcement actions, including actions under the false claims act ("fca"), which prohibits false claims for payments to, or improper retention of overpayments from, the government. fca litigation could be asserted directly by the federal government, or on its behalf by private litigants as "whistleblowers." even if not meritorious, fca litigation could impose significant costs and result in reputational damage and a disruption of our business.
table of contents risks related to tax, including reit-related risks, and our jurisdiction of incorporation loss of our tax status as a reit would substantially reduce our available funds and would have materially adverse consequences for us and the value of our common stock.
qualification as a reit involves the application of numerous highly technical and complex provisions of the internal revenue code of 1986, as amended (the "code"), for which there are limited judicial and administrative interpretations, as well as the determination of various factual matters and circumstances not entirely within our control. we intend to continue to operate in a manner that enables us to qualify as a reit. however, our qualification and taxation as a reit depend upon our ability to meet, through actual annual operating results, asset diversification, distribution levels, and diversity of stock ownership, the various qualification tests imposed under the code.
for example, to qualify as a reit, at least 95% of our gross income in any year must be derived from qualifying sources, and we must make distributions to our stockholders aggregating annually to at least 90% of our reit taxable income, excluding net capital gains. rents we receive from a trs in a ridea structure are treated as qualifying rents from real property for reit tax purposes only if (i) they are paid pursuant to a lease of a "qualified healthcare property," and (ii) the operator qualifies as an "eligible independent contractor," as defined in the code. if either of these requirements is not satisfied, then the rents will not be qualifying rents and we may not satisfy the reit gross income requirement. furthermore, new legislation, regulations, administrative interpretations, or court decisions could change the tax laws or interpretations of the tax laws regarding qualification as a reit, or the federal income tax consequences of that qualification, in a manner that is materially adverse to our stockholders. accordingly, we cannot assure you that we have operated or will continue to operate in a manner so as to qualify or remain qualified as a reit.
if we lose our reit status, we will face serious tax consequences that will substantially reduce the funds available to make payments of principal and interest on the debt securities we issue and to make distributions to stockholders. if we fail to qualify as a reit:
•we will not be allowed a deduction for distributions to stockholders in computing our taxable income;
•we will be subject to corporate-level income tax on our taxable income at regular corporate rates;
•we will be subject to increased state and local income taxes; and
•unless we are entitled to relief under relevant statutory provisions, we will be disqualified from taxation as a reit for the four taxable years following the year during which we fail to qualify as a reit.
as a result of all these factors, our failure to qualify as a reit could also impair our ability to expand our business and raise capital and could materially adversely affect the value of our common stock.
further changes to u.s. federal income tax laws could materially and adversely affect us and our stockholders.
the present federal income tax treatment of reits and various transactional structures that we utilize may be modified, possibly with retroactive effect, by legislative, judicial, or administrative action at any time, which could affect the federal income tax treatment of an investment in us. the federal income tax rules dealing with u.s. federal income taxation and reits are constantly under review by persons involved in the legislative process, the u.s. internal revenue service (the "irs") and the u.s. treasury department, which results in statutory changes as well as frequent revisions to regulations and interpretations. we cannot predict how changes in the tax laws might affect our investors or us. revisions in federal tax laws and interpretations thereof could significantly and negatively affect our ability to qualify as a reit, as well as the tax considerations relevant to an investment in us, or could cause us to change our investments and commitments.
potential deferred and contingent tax liabilities from corporate acquisitions could limit or delay future property sales.
if, during the five-year period beginning on the date we acquire certain companies, we recognize a gain on the disposition of any property acquired, then, to the extent of the excess of (i) the fair market value of such property as of the acquisition date, over (ii) our adjusted income tax basis in such property as of that date, we will be required to pay a corporate-level federal income tax on this gain at the highest regular corporate rate. these potential tax effects could limit or delay future property sales. in addition, the irs may assert liabilities against us for income taxes of certain entities we acquire for taxable years prior to the time that we acquire such entities, in which case we will owe these taxes plus interest and penalties, if any.
table of contents there are uncertainties relating to the calculation of non-reit tax earnings and profits ("e&p") in certain acquisitions, which may require us to distribute e&p.
in order to remain qualified as a reit, we are required to distribute to our stockholders all of the accumulated non-reit e&p of certain companies that we acquire, prior to the close of the first taxable year in which the acquisition occurs. failure to make such e&p distributions could result in our disqualification as a reit. the determination of the amount to be distributed in such e&p distributions is a complex factual and legal determination. we may have less than complete information at the time we undertake our analysis, or we may interpret the applicable law differently from the irs. we currently believe that we have satisfied the requirements relating to such e&p distributions. there are, however, substantial uncertainties relating to the determination of e&p, including the possibility that the irs could successfully assert that the taxable income of the companies acquired should be increased, which could increase our non-reit e&p. thus, we might fail to satisfy the requirement that we distribute all of our non-reit e&p by the close of the first taxable year in which the acquisition occurs. although there are procedures available to cure a failure to distribute all of our e&p, we cannot now determine whether we will be able to take advantage of these procedures or the economic impact on us of doing so.
our charter contains ownership limits with respect to our common stock and other classes of capital stock.
our charter contains restrictions on the ownership and transfer of our common stock and preferred stock that are intended to assist us in preserving our qualification as a reit. under our charter, subject to certain exceptions, no person or entity may own, actually or constructively, more than 9.8% (by value or by number of shares, whichever is more restrictive) of the outstanding shares of our common stock or any class or series of our preferred stock.
additionally, our charter has a 9.9% ownership limitation on the direct or indirect ownership of our voting shares, which may include common stock or other classes of capital stock. our board of directors, in its sole discretion, may exempt a proposed transferee from either ownership limit. the ownership limits may delay, defer or prevent a transaction or a change of control that might involve a premium price for our common stock or might otherwise be in the best interests of our stockholders.
we are subject to certain provisions of maryland law and our charter relating to business combinations that may prevent a transaction that may otherwise be in the interest of our stockholders.
we are subject to the maryland business combination act (the "mbca") which provides that unless exempted, a maryland corporation may not engage in certain business combinations with an "interested stockholder" or an affiliate of an interested stockholder for five years after the most recent date on which the interested stockholder became an interested stockholder, and thereafter unless specified criteria are met. in addition to the restrictions on business combinations contained in the mbca, our charter also requires that, except in certain circumstances, "business combinations" with a "related person" must be approved by the affirmative vote of the holders of at least 90% of our outstanding voting stock. these restrictions on business combinations may delay, defer, or prevent a change of control or other transaction even if such transaction involves a premium price for our common stock or our stockholders believe that such transaction is otherwise in their best interests.
item 7.    management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the information set forth in this item 7 is intended to provide readers with an understanding of our financial condition, changes in financial condition, and results of operations. this section generally discusses the results of our operations for the year ended december 31, 2022 compared to the year ended december 31, 2021. for a discussion of the year ended december 31, 2021 compared to the year ended december 31, 2020, please refer to part ii, item 7. "management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations" in our annual report on form 10-k for the fiscal year ended december 31, 2021 filed with the sec on february 9, 2022.
we will discuss and provide our analysis in the following order:
•market trends and uncertainties
•overview of transactions
•dividends
•results of operations
•liquidity and capital resources
•non-gaap financial measures reconciliations
•critical accounting estimates
•recent accounting pronouncements market trends and uncertainties our operating results have been and will continue to be impacted by global and national economic and market conditions generally and by the local economic conditions where our properties are located, as well as by the covid pandemic.
rising interest rates, high inflation, supply chain disruptions, ongoing geopolitical tensions, and increased volatility in public equity and fixed income markets have led to increased costs and limited the availability of capital. to the extent our tenants or operators experience increased costs or financing difficulties due to the foregoing macroeconomic conditions, they may be unable or unwilling to make payments or perform their obligations when due. in addition, increased interest rates could affect our borrowing costs and the fair value of our fixed rate instruments.
we have also been affected by significant inflation in construction costs over the past couple of years, which, together with rising costs of capital, have negatively affected the expected yields on our development and redevelopment projects. in addition, labor shortages and global supply chain disruptions, including procurement delays and long lead times on certain materials, have adversely impacted and could continue to adversely impact the scheduled completion and/or costs of these projects.
further, the full, long-term economic impact of the covid pandemic on the operations of our ccrcs and the senior housing facilities owned by our swf sh jv remains uncertain. many factors cannot be predicted and will remain unpredictable, including the impact, duration, and severity of new variants and outbreaks. due to these uncertainties, at this time, we are not able to estimate the full impact of covid on our consolidated financial position, results of operations, and cash flows in the future.
we continuously monitor the effects of domestic and global events, including but not limited to inflation, labor shortages, supply chain matters, rising interest rates, and other current and expected impacts of the covid pandemic on our operations and financial position, as well as on the operations and financial position of our tenants, operators, and borrowers, to ensure that we remain responsive and adaptable to the dynamic changes in our operating environment.
see "item 1a, risk factors" in this report for additional discussion of the risks posed by macroeconomic conditions and the covid pandemic, as well as the uncertainties we and our tenants, operators, and borrowers may face as a result.

results of operations we evaluate our business and allocate resources among our reportable business segments: (i) life science, (ii) medical office, and (iii) ccrc. under the life science and medical office segments, we invest through the acquisition, development, and management of life science facilities, mobs, and hospitals, which generally requires a greater level of property management. our ccrcs are operated through ridea structures. we have other non-reportable segments that are comprised primarily of: (i) an interest in our unconsolidated swf sh jv, (ii) loans receivable, and (iii) marketable debt securities. we evaluate performance based upon property adjusted net operating income ("adjusted noi" or "cash noi") in each segment. the accounting policies of the segments are the same as those described in the summary of significant accounting policies in note 2 to the consolidated financial statements.
non-gaap financial measures net operating income noi and adjusted noi are non-u.s. generally accepted accounting principles ("gaap") supplemental financial measures used to evaluate the operating performance of real estate. noi is defined as real estate revenues (inclusive of rental and related revenues, resident fees and services, income from direct financing leases, and government grant income and exclusive of interest income), less property level operating expenses; noi excludes all other financial statement amounts included in net income (loss) as presented in note 16 to the consolidated financial statements. adjusted noi is calculated as noi after eliminating the effects of straight-line rents, dfl non-cash interest, amortization of market lease intangibles, termination fees, actuarial reserves for insurance claims that have been incurred but not reported, and the impact of deferred community fee income and expense. noi and adjusted noi are calculated as noi and adjusted noi from consolidated properties, plus our share of noi and adjusted noi from unconsolidated joint ventures (calculated by applying our actual ownership percentage for the period), less noncontrolling interests' share of noi and adjusted noi from consolidated joint ventures (calculated by applying our actual ownership percentage for the period). management utilizes its share of noi and adjusted noi in assessing its performance as we have various joint ventures that contribute to its performance. we do not control our unconsolidated joint ventures, and our share of amounts from unconsolidated joint ventures do not represent our legal claim to such items. our share of noi and adjusted noi should not be considered a substitute for, and should only be considered together with and as a supplement to, our financial information presented in accordance with gaap.
adjusted noi is oftentimes referred to as "cash noi." management believes noi and adjusted noi are important supplemental measures because they provide relevant and useful information by reflecting only income and operating expense items that are incurred at the property level and present them on an unlevered basis. we use noi and adjusted noi to make decisions about resource allocations, to assess and compare property level performance, and to evaluate our same-store ("ss") performance, as described below. we believe that net income (loss) is the most directly comparable gaap measure to noi and adjusted noi. noi and adjusted noi should not be viewed as alternative measures of operating performance to net income (loss) as defined by gaap since they do not reflect various excluded items. further, our definitions of noi and adjusted noi may not be comparable to the definitions used by other reits or real estate companies, as they may use different methodologies for calculating noi and adjusted noi. for a reconciliation of noi and adjusted noi to net income (loss) by segment, refer to note 16 to the consolidated financial statements.
operating expenses generally relate to leased medical office and life science properties, as well as ccrc facilities. we generally recover all or a portion of our leased medical office and life science property expenses through tenant recoveries. we present expenses as operating or general and administrative based on the underlying nature of the expense.
table of contents same-store same-store noi and adjusted (cash) noi information allows us to evaluate the performance of our property portfolio under a consistent population by eliminating changes in the composition of our portfolio of properties, excluding properties within the other non-reportable segments. we include properties from our consolidated portfolio, as well as properties owned by our unconsolidated joint ventures in same-store noi and adjusted noi (see noi definition above for further discussion regarding our use of pro-rata share information and its limitations). same-store adjusted noi excludes amortization of deferred revenue from tenant-funded improvements and certain non-property specific operating expenses that are allocated to each operating segment on a consolidated basis.
properties are included in same-store once they are stabilized for the full period in both comparison periods. newly acquired operating assets are generally considered stabilized at the earlier of lease-up (typically when the tenant(s) control(s) the physical use of at least 80% of the space and rental payments have commenced) or 12 months from the acquisition date. newly completed developments and redevelopments are considered stabilized at the earlier of lease-up or 24 months from the date the property is placed in service. properties that experience a change in reporting structure are considered stabilized after 12 months in operations under a consistent reporting structure. a property is removed from same-store when it is classified as held for sale, sold, placed into redevelopment, experiences a casualty event that significantly impacts operations, a change in reporting structure or operator transition has been agreed to, or a significant tenant relocates from a same-store property to a non same-store property and that change results in a corresponding increase in revenue. we do not report same-store metrics for our other non-reportable segments. for a reconciliation of same-store to total portfolio adjusted noi and other relevant disclosures by segment, refer to our segment analysis below.
funds from operations ("ffo")
ffo encompasses nareit ffo and ffo as adjusted, each of which is described in detail below. we believe ffo applicable to common shares, diluted ffo applicable to common shares, and diluted ffo per common share are important supplemental non-gaap measures of operating performance for a reit. because the historical cost accounting convention used for real estate assets utilizes straight-line depreciation (except on land), such accounting presentation implies that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time. since real estate values instead have historically risen and fallen with market conditions, presentations of operating results for a reit that use historical cost accounting for depreciation could be less informative. the term ffo was designed by the reit industry to address this issue.
nareit ffo. ffo, as defined by the national association of real estate investment trusts ("nareit"), is net income (loss) applicable to common shares (computed in accordance with gaap), excluding gains or losses from sales of depreciable property, including any current and deferred taxes directly associated with sales of depreciable property, impairments of, or related to, depreciable real estate, plus real estate and other real estate-related depreciation and amortization, and adjustments to compute our share of nareit ffo and ffo as adjusted (see below) from joint ventures. adjustments for joint ventures are calculated to reflect our pro rata share of both our consolidated and unconsolidated joint ventures. we reflect our share of nareit ffo for unconsolidated joint ventures by applying our actual ownership percentage for the period to the applicable reconciling items on an entity by entity basis. for consolidated joint ventures in which we do not own 100%, we reflect our share of the equity by adjusting our nareit ffo to remove the third party ownership share of the applicable reconciling items based on actual ownership percentage for the applicable periods. our pro rata share information is prepared on a basis consistent with the comparable consolidated amounts, is intended to reflect our proportionate economic interest in the operating results of properties in our portfolio and is calculated by applying our actual ownership percentage for the period. we do not control the unconsolidated joint ventures, and the pro rata presentations of reconciling items included in nareit ffo do not represent our legal claim to such items. the joint venture members or partners are entitled to profit or loss allocations and distributions of cash flows according to the joint venture agreements, which provide for such allocations generally according to their invested capital.
the presentation of pro rata information has limitations, which include, but are not limited to, the following: (i) the amounts shown on the individual line items were derived by applying our overall economic ownership interest percentage determined when applying the equity method of accounting and do not necessarily represent our legal claim to the assets and liabilities, or the revenues and expenses and (ii) other companies in our industry may calculate their pro rata interest differently, limiting the usefulness as a comparative measure. because of these limitations, the pro rata financial information should not be considered independently or as a substitute for our financial statements as reported under gaap. we compensate for these limitations by relying primarily on our gaap financial statements, using the pro rata financial information as a supplement.
nareit ffo does not represent cash generated from operating activities in accordance with gaap, is not necessarily indicative of cash available to fund cash needs and should not be considered an alternative to net income (loss). we compute nareit ffo in accordance with the current nareit definition; however, other reits may report nareit ffo differently or have a different interpretation of the current nareit definition from ours.
table of contents ffo as adjusted. in addition, we present nareit ffo on an adjusted basis before the impact of non-comparable items including, but not limited to, transaction-related items, other impairments (recoveries) and other losses (gains), restructuring and severance-related charges, prepayment costs (benefits) associated with early retirement or payment of debt, litigation costs (recoveries), casualty-related charges (recoveries), foreign currency remeasurement losses (gains), deferred tax asset valuation allowances, and changes in tax legislation ("ffo as adjusted"). these adjustments are net of tax, when applicable. transaction-related items include transaction expenses and gains/charges incurred as a result of mergers and acquisitions and lease amendment or termination activities. prepayment costs (benefits) associated with early retirement of debt include the write-off of unamortized deferred financing fees, or additional costs, expenses, discounts, make-whole payments, penalties or premiums incurred as a result of early retirement or payment of debt. other impairments (recoveries) and other losses (gains) include interest income associated with early and partial repayments of loans receivable and other losses or gains associated with non-depreciable assets including goodwill, dfls, undeveloped land parcels, and loans receivable. management believes that ffo as adjusted provides a meaningful supplemental measurement of our ffo run-rate and is frequently used by analysts, investors, and other interested parties in the evaluation of our performance as a reit. at the same time that nareit created and defined its ffo measure for the reit industry, it also recognized that "management of each of its member companies has the responsibility and authority to publish financial information that it regards as useful to the financial community." we believe stockholders, potential investors, and financial analysts who review our operating performance are best served by an ffo run-rate earnings measure that includes certain other adjustments to net income (loss), in addition to adjustments made to arrive at the nareit defined measure of ffo. ffo as adjusted is used by management in analyzing our business and the performance of our properties and we believe it is important that stockholders, potential investors, and financial analysts understand this measure used by management. we use ffo as adjusted to: (i) evaluate our performance in comparison with expected results and results of previous periods, relative to resource allocation decisions, (ii) evaluate the performance of our management, (iii) budget and forecast future results to assist in the allocation of resources, (iv) assess our performance as compared with similar real estate companies and the industry in general, and (v) evaluate how a specific potential investment will impact our future results. other reits or real estate companies may use different methodologies for calculating an adjusted ffo measure, and accordingly, our ffo as adjusted may not be comparable to those reported by other reits. for a reconciliation of net income (loss) to nareit ffo and ffo as adjusted and other relevant disclosure, refer to "non-gaap financial measures reconciliations" below.
table of contents adjusted ffo ("affo"). affo is defined as ffo as adjusted after excluding the impact of the following: (i) amortization of stock-based compensation, (ii) amortization of deferred financing costs, net, (iii) straight-line rents, (iv) deferred income taxes, and (v) other affo adjustments, which include: (a) amortization of acquired market lease intangibles, net, (b) non-cash interest related to dfls and lease incentive amortization (reduction of straight-line rents), (c) actuarial reserves for insurance claims that have been incurred but not reported, and (d) amortization of deferred revenues, excluding amounts amortized into rental income that are associated with tenant funded improvements owned/recognized by us and up-front cash payments made by tenants to reduce their contractual rents. also, affo is computed after deducting recurring capital expenditures, including second generation leasing costs and second generation tenant and capital improvements, and includes adjustments to compute our share of affo from our unconsolidated joint ventures. more specifically, recurring capital expenditures, including second generation leasing costs and second generation tenant and capital improvements ("affo capital expenditures") excludes our share from unconsolidated joint ventures (reported in "other affo adjustments"). adjustments for joint ventures are calculated to reflect our pro rata share of both our consolidated and unconsolidated joint ventures. we reflect our share of affo for unconsolidated joint ventures by applying our actual ownership percentage for the period to the applicable reconciling items on an entity by entity basis. we reflect our share for consolidated joint ventures in which we do not own 100% of the equity by adjusting our affo to remove the third party ownership share of the applicable reconciling items based on actual ownership percentage for the applicable periods (reported in "other affo adjustments"). see ffo for further disclosure regarding our use of pro rata share information and its limitations. we believe affo is an alternative run-rate earnings measure that improves the understanding of our operating results among investors and makes comparisons with: (i) expected results, (ii) results of previous periods, and (iii) results among reits more meaningful. affo does not represent cash generated from operating activities determined in accordance with gaap and is not necessarily indicative of cash available to fund cash needs as it excludes the following items which generally flow through our cash flows from operating activities: (i) adjustments for changes in working capital or the actual timing of the payment of income or expense items that are accrued in the period, (ii) transaction-related costs, (iii) litigation settlement expenses, and (iv) restructuring and severance-related charges. furthermore, affo is adjusted for recurring capital expenditures, which are generally not considered when determining cash flows from operations or liquidity. other reits or real estate companies may use different methodologies for calculating affo, and accordingly, our affo may not be comparable to those reported by other reits. management believes affo provides a meaningful supplemental measure of our performance and is frequently used by analysts, investors, and other interested parties in the evaluation of our performance as a reit, and by presenting affo, we are assisting these parties in their evaluation. affo is a non-gaap supplemental financial measure and should not be considered as an alternative to net income (loss) determined in accordance with gaap and should only be considered together with and as a supplement to the company's financial information prepared in accordance with gaap. for a reconciliation of net income (loss) to affo and other relevant disclosure, refer to "non-gaap financial measures reconciliations" below.

_______________________________________
(1)for the reconciliation of non-gaap financial measures, see "non-gaap financial measure reconciliations" below.
net income (loss) applicable to common shares decreased primarily as a result of the following:
•a decrease in income from discontinued operations, primarily as a result of a decrease in gain on sales of real estate from dispositions of our senior housing portfolios, partially offset by lower impairments of depreciable real estate and goodwill;
•a decrease in gains on sale of depreciable real estate, primarily related to the hoag hospital sale in may 2021;

•an increase in general and administrative expenses, primarily as a result of: (i) severance-related charges associated with the departures of our former chief executive officer and our former chief legal officer and general counsel in the fourth quarter of 2022 and (ii) charges incurred in connection with the downsizing of our corporate headquarters in denver, colorado;
•an increase in depreciation, primarily as a result of: (i) development and redevelopment projects placed in service during 2021 and 2022 and (ii) 2021 and 2022 acquisitions of real estate;
•an increase in interest expense, primarily as a result of: (i) higher interest rates under the commercial paper program and (ii) borrowings under the 2022 term loan facilities;
•a decrease in interest income primarily as a result of principal repayments on and sales of loans receivable in 2021 and 2022;
•expenses incurred in 2022 for tenant relocation and other costs associated with the demolition of an mob;
•an increase in loan loss reserves in 2022 primarily due to macroeconomic conditions and increased interest rates; and
•casualty-related charges during 2022.
the decrease in net income (loss) applicable to common shares was partially offset by:
•a gain upon change of control related to the sale of a 30% interest and deconsolidation of seven previously consolidated life science assets in south san francisco, california;
•a decrease in loss on debt extinguishments related to our repurchase and redemption of certain outstanding senior notes in the first and second quarters of 2021;
•an increase in noi generated from our life science and medical office segments related to: (i) 2021 and 2022 acquisitions of real estate, (ii) development and redevelopment projects placed in service during 2021 and 2022, and (iii) new leasing activity during 2021 and 2022 (including the impact to straight-line rents);
•a gain on sale of a hospital under a dfl that was sold in the first quarter of 2022; and
•fewer impairment charges on depreciable real estate.
nareit ffo increased primarily as a result of the aforementioned events impacting net income (loss) applicable to common shares, except for the following, which are excluded from nareit ffo:
•depreciation and amortization expense;
•gain on sales of depreciable real estate;
•gain upon change of control; and
•impairment charges related to depreciable real estate.
ffo as adjusted increased primarily as a result of the aforementioned events impacting nareit ffo, except for the following, which are excluded from ffo as adjusted:
•goodwill impairment charges related to the disposition of our senior housing portfolios, included in income from discontinued operations;

•the expenses for tenant relocation and other costs associated with the demolition of an mob;
•the charges incurred in connection with the downsizing of our corporate headquarters in denver, colorado;
•loan loss reserves;
•loss on debt extinguishment;
•severance-related charges; and
•casualty-related charges.
affo increased primarily as a result of the aforementioned events impacting ffo as adjusted, except for the impact of straight-line rents, which is excluded from affo. the increase was partially offset by lower affo capital expenditures.

(1)total portfolio includes results of operations from disposed properties through the disposition date.
(2)represents adjustments to noi in accordance with our definition of adjusted noi. refer to "non-gaap financial measures" above for definitions of noi and adjusted noi. see note 16 to the consolidated financial statements for a reconciliation of adjusted noi by segment to net income (loss).
(3)from our 2021 presentation of same-store, we added: (i) six stabilized developments placed in service, (ii) five stabilized acquisitions, and (iii) four stabilized redevelopments placed in service, and we removed: (i) seven life science facilities that were placed into redevelopment, (ii) one life science facility related to a significant tenant relocation, and (iii) one life science facility that was classified as held for sale.
(4)average annual total revenues does not include non-cash revenue adjustments (i.e., straight-line rents, amortization of market lease intangibles, and deferred revenues).
(5)base rent does not include tenant recoveries, additional rents in excess of floors and non-cash revenue adjustments (i.e., straight-line rents, amortization of market lease intangibles, and deferred revenues).
same-store adjusted noi increased primarily as a result of the following:
•annual rent escalations;
•higher occupancy; and
•new leasing activity; partially offset by
•higher operating expenses.
total portfolio adjusted noi increased primarily as a result of the aforementioned impacts to same-store and the following non-same-store impacts:
•an increase in noi from (i) increased occupancy in developments and redevelopments placed in service in 2021 and 2022 and (ii) acquisitions in 2021.

(1)total portfolio includes results of operations from disposed properties through the disposition date.
(2)represents adjustments to noi in accordance with our definition of adjusted noi. refer to "non-gaap financial measures" above for definitions of noi and adjusted noi. see note 16 to the consolidated financial statements for a reconciliation of adjusted noi by segment to net income (loss).
(3)from our 2021 presentation of same-store, we added: (i) 10 stabilized acquisitions and (ii) 3 stabilized redevelopments placed in service, and we removed: (i) 2 mobs that were sold and (ii) 1 mob that was placed into redevelopment.
(4)average annual total revenues does not include non-cash revenue adjustments (i.e., straight-line rents, amortization of market lease intangibles, dfl non-cash interest, and deferred revenues).
(5)base rent does not include tenant recoveries, additional rents in excess of floors and non-cash revenue adjustments (i.e., straight-line rents, amortization of market lease intangibles, dfl non-cash interest, and deferred revenues).
same-store adjusted noi increased primarily as a result of the following:
•mark-to-market lease renewals;
•annual rent escalations; and
•higher parking income and percentage-based rents; partially offset by
•higher operating expenses.
total portfolio adjusted noi increased primarily as a result of the aforementioned increases to same-store and the following non-same-store impacts:
•increased noi from our 2021 and 2022 acquisitions;
•increased occupancy in former redevelopment and development properties that have been placed in service; partially offset by
•decreased noi from our 2021 and 2022 dispositions.

general and administrative expense general and administrative expenses increased for the year ended december 31, 2022 primarily as a result of: (i) severance-related charges associated with the departures of our former chief executive officer and our former chief legal officer and general counsel in the fourth quarter of 2022 and (ii) charges incurred in connection with the downsizing of our corporate headquarters in denver, colorado.

noncontrolling interests' share in discontinued operations noncontrolling interests' share in discontinued operations decreased for the year ended december 31, 2022 as a result of the completion of our dispositions of our senior housing portfolios.
table of contents liquidity and capital resources we anticipate that our cash flow from operations, available cash balances, and cash from our various financing activities will be adequate for the next 12 months and for the foreseeable future for purposes of: (i) funding recurring operating expenses; (ii) meeting debt service requirements; and (iii) satisfying funding of distributions to our stockholders and non-controlling interest members. distributions are made using a combination of cash flows from operations, funds available under our bank line of credit (the "revolving facility") and commercial paper program, proceeds from the sale of properties, and other sources of cash available to us.
in addition to funding the activities above, our principal liquidity needs for the next 12 months are to:
•fund capital expenditures, including tenant improvements and leasing costs; and
•fund future acquisition, transactional, and development and redevelopment activities.
our longer term liquidity needs include the items listed above as well as meeting debt service requirements.
we anticipate satisfying these future needs using one or more of the following:
•cash flow from operations;
•sale of, or exchange of ownership interests in, properties or other investments;
•borrowings under our revolving facility and commercial paper program;
•issuance of additional debt, including unsecured notes, term loans, and mortgage debt; and/or

our ability to access the capital markets impacts our cost of capital and ability to refinance maturing indebtedness, as well as our ability to fund future acquisitions and development through the issuance of additional securities or secured debt. credit ratings impact our ability to access capital and directly impact our cost of capital as well. our 2022 term loan facilities accrue interest at adjusted secured overnight financing rate ("sofr") administered by the federal reserve bank of new york plus a margin that depends on the credit ratings of our senior unsecured long-term debt. additionally, our revolving facility accrues interest at a rate per annum equal to the london interbank offered rate ("libor") plus a margin that depends upon our credit ratings for our senior unsecured long-term debt. our revolving facility includes customary libor replacement language, including, but not limited to, the use of rates based on sofr. we also pay a facility fee on the entire revolving commitment that depends upon our credit ratings. as of february 6, 2023, we had long-term credit ratings of baa1 from moody's and bbb+ from s&p global and fitch, and short-term credit ratings of p-2, a-2, and f2 from moody's, s&p global, and fitch, respectively.
a downgrade in credit ratings by moody's, s&p global, and fitch may have a negative impact on the interest rates and facility fees for our revolving facility and 2022 term loan facilities and may negatively impact the pricing of notes issued under our commercial paper program and senior unsecured notes. while a downgrade in our credit ratings would adversely impact our cost of borrowing, we believe we would continue to have access to the unsecured debt markets, and we could also seek to enter into one or more secured debt financings, issue additional securities, including under our atm program, or dispose of certain assets to fund future operating costs, capital expenditures, or acquisitions, although no assurances can be made in this regard. refer to "market trends and uncertainties" above for a more comprehensive discussion of the potential impact of covid as well as economic and market conditions on our business.
material cash requirements our material cash requirements include the below contractual and other obligations.
debt. as of december 31, 2022, we had total debt of $6.5 billion, including borrowings under our bank line of credit and commercial paper program, senior unsecured notes, term loans, and mortgage debt. future interest payments associated with such debt total $1.2 billion, $188 million of which are payable within twelve months. of our total debt, the total amount payable within twelve months is comprised of $90 million of mortgage debt. commercial paper borrowings are backstopped by our bank line of credit. as such, we calculate the weighted average remaining term of our commercial paper borrowings using the maturity date of our bank line of credit. see note 11 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.
development and redevelopment commitments.  our development and redevelopment commitments represent construction and other commitments for developments and redevelopments in progress and includes certain allowances for tenant improvements that we have provided as a lessor. as of december 31, 2022, we had $219 million of development and redevelopment commitments, $197 million of which we expect to spend within the next twelve months.
table of contents lease and other contractual commitments.  our lease and other contractual commitments represent our commitments, as lessor, under signed leases and contracts for operating properties and include allowances for tenant improvements and leasing commissions. these commitments exclude allowances for tenant improvements related to developments and redevelopments in progress for which we have executed an agreement with a general contractor to complete the tenant improvements, which are recognized as development and redevelopment commitments and are discussed further above. as of december 31, 2022, we had total lease and other contractual commitments of $33 million, $30 million of which we expect to spend within the next twelve months.
construction loan commitments. due to the terms of our shop seller financing notes receivable, as of december 31, 2022, we are obligated to provide additional loans up to $40 million to fund senior housing redevelopment and capital expenditure projects, which extend through 2024. see note 8 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.
ground and other operating lease commitments.  our ground and other operating lease commitments represent our commitments as lessee under signed operating leases. as of december 31, 2022, we had total ground and other operating lease commitments of $551 million, $17 million of which are payable within twelve months. see note 7 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.
redeemable noncontrolling interests. certain of our noncontrolling interest holders have the ability to put their equity interests to us upon specified events or after the passage of a predetermined period of time. each put option is subject to changes in redemption value in the event that the underlying property generates specified returns for us and meets certain promote thresholds pursuant to the respective agreements. during the year ended december 31, 2022, one of the redeemable noncontrolling interests met the conditions for redemption, but was not yet exercised. as of december 31, 2022, the redemption value of our redeemable noncontrolling interests was $106 million. see note 13 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.
distribution and dividend requirements. our dividend policy on our common stock is to distribute a percentage of our cash flow to ensure that we meet the dividend requirements of the code, relative to maintaining our reit status, while still allowing us to retain cash to fund capital improvements and other investment activities. under the code, reits may be subject to certain federal income and excise taxes on undistributed taxable income. we paid quarterly cash dividends of $0.30 per common share in 2022. our future common dividends, if and as declared, may vary and will be determined by the board based upon the circumstances prevailing at the time, including our financial condition.
off-balance sheet arrangements we own interests in certain unconsolidated joint ventures as described in note 9 to the consolidated financial statements. two of these joint ventures have mortgage debt of $87 million, of which our share is $40 million. except in limited circumstances, our risk of loss is limited to our investment in the joint venture. we have no other material off-balance sheet arrangements that we expect would materially affect our liquidity and capital resources.
inflation a significant portion of our revenues are derived from leases that generally provide for fixed rental rates, subject to annual escalations. a period of high inflation could result in increases in the consumer price index in excess of our fixed annual escalations. certain of our leases provide that annual rent is modified based on changes in the consumer price index or other thresholds.
most of our mob leases require the tenant to pay a share of property operating costs such as real estate taxes, insurance, and utilities. substantially all of our life science leases require the tenant or operator to pay all of the property operating costs or reimburse us for all such costs.
labor costs, costs of construction materials, interest, utilities, and other operating costs may increase during periods of inflation. inflationary increases in expenses will generally be offset, in whole or in part, by the tenant expense reimbursements and contractual rent increases described above.
table of contents cash flow summary the following summary discussion of our cash flows is based on the consolidated statements of cash flows and is not meant to be an all-inclusive discussion of the changes in our cash flows for the periods presented below.
the following table sets forth changes in cash flows (in thousands):

operating cash flows our cash flows from operations are dependent upon the occupancy levels of our buildings, rental rates on leases, our tenants' performance on their lease obligations, the level of operating expenses, and other factors. operating cash flows increased $105 million for the year ended december 31, 2022 compared to the year ended december 31, 2021 primarily as the result of: (i) 2021 and 2022 acquisitions, (ii) annual rent increases, (iii) new leasing and renewal activity, and (iv) developments and redevelopments placed in service during 2021 and 2022. the increase in operating cash flow is partially offset by: (i) a decrease in income related to assets sold during 2021 and 2022 and (ii) an increase in operating expenses.
investing cash flows our cash flows from investing activities are generally used to fund acquisitions, developments, and redevelopments of real estate assets, net of proceeds received from sales of real estate assets, sales of dfls, and repayments on loans receivable. our net cash used in investing activities increased $1.4 billion for the year ended december 31, 2022 compared to the year ended december 31, 2021 primarily as a result of the following: (i) fewer sales of real estate assets, (ii) increased development and redevelopment of real estate assets, and (iii) fewer repayments on loans receivable. the increase in cash used in investing activities was partially offset by: (i) a reduction in investments related to the acquisitions of real estate assets, (ii) proceeds received from the sale of a 30% interest in seven previously consolidated life science assets in south san francisco, california, and (iii) proceeds received from the sale of a hospital under a dfl.
financing cash flows our cash flows from financing activities are generally impacted by issuances of equity, borrowings and repayments under our bank line of credit and commercial paper program, senior unsecured notes, term loans, and mortgage debt, net of dividends paid to common shareholders. our net cash used in financing activities decreased $1.2 billion for the year ended december 31, 2022 compared to the year ended december 31, 2021 primarily as a result of the following: (i) no repayments of senior unsecured notes (including debt extinguishment costs) in 2022, (ii) issuance of the 2022 term loan facilities, (iii) proceeds received from the settlement of forward contracts under our atm program, and (iv) fewer purchases of and distributions to noncontrolling interests. the decrease in cash used in financing activities was partially offset by: (i) lower borrowings and higher repayments under the bank line of credit and commercial paper program, (ii) no senior unsecured notes issuances in 2022, and (iii) an increase in common stock repurchases.
discontinued operations operating, investing, and financing cash flows in our consolidated statements of cash flows are reported inclusive of both cash flows from continuing operations and cash flows from discontinued operations. certain significant cash flows from discontinued operations are disclosed in note 18 to the consolidated financial statements. the absence of future cash flows from discontinued operations is not expected to significantly impact our liquidity, as the proceeds from senior housing triple-net and shop dispositions were used to pay down debt and invest in additional real estate in our other business lines. additionally, we have multiple other sources of liquidity that can be utilized in the future, as needed. refer to the beginning of the liquidity and capital resources section above for additional information regarding our liquidity.
debt in july 2022, we increased the maximum aggregate face or principal amount that can be outstanding at any one time under the commercial paper program from $1.5 billion to $2.0 billion.
in august 2022, we executed the 2022 term loan agreement that provided for two senior unsecured delayed draw term loans in an aggregate principal amount of up to $500 million. in october 2022, the entirety of the $500 million under the 2022 term loan facilities was drawn.
table of contents in january 2023, we completed a public offering of $400 million aggregate principal amount of 5.25% senior unsecured notes due in 2032.
see note 11 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information about our outstanding debt.
approximately 85% and 79% of our consolidated debt was fixed rate debt as of december 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. at december 31, 2022, our fixed rate debt and variable rate debt had weighted average interest rates of 3.46% and 4.91%, respectively. at december 31, 2021, our fixed rate debt and variable rate debt had weighted average interest rates of 3.40% and 0.59%, respectively. as of december 31, 2022, we had $142 million of variable rate mortgage debt swapped to fixed through interest rate swap instruments and the $500 million 2022 term loan facilities swapped to fixed through forward starting interest rate swap instruments. these interest rate swap instruments are designated as cash flow hedges. for purposes of classification of the amounts above, variable rate debt with a derivative financial instrument designated as a cash flow hedge is reported as fixed rate debt due to us having effectively established a fixed interest rate for the underlying debt instrument. as of december 31, 2021, we had $142 million of variable rate mortgage debt subject to interest rate cap instruments. for a more detailed discussion of our interest rate risk, see "item 7a, quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk" below.
equity at december 31, 2022, we had 547 million shares of common stock outstanding, equity totaled $7.2 billion, and our equity securities had a market value of $13.9 billion.
at december 31, 2022, non-managing members held an aggregate of five million units in seven limited liability companies ("downreits") for which we are the managing member. the downreit units are exchangeable for an amount of cash approximating the then-current market value of shares of our common stock or, at our option, shares of our common stock (subject to certain adjustments, such as stock splits and reclassifications). at december 31, 2022, the outstanding downreit units were convertible into approximately seven million shares of our common stock.
at-the-market program our at-the-market equity offering program (as amended from time to time, the "atm program") has a capacity of $1.5 billion. in addition to the issuance and sale of shares of our common stock, we may also enter into one or more forward sales agreements (each, an "atm forward contract") with sales agents for the sale of our shares of common stock under our atm program.
during the year ended december 31, 2021, we utilized the forward provisions under the atm program to allow for the sale of an aggregate of 9.1 million shares of our common stock at an initial weighted average net price of $35.25 per share, after commissions. we did not utilize the forward provisions under the atm program during the year ended december 31, 2022. during the year ended december 31, 2022, we settled all 9.1 million shares previously outstanding under atm forward contracts at a weighted average net price of $34.01 per share, after commissions, resulting in net proceeds of $308 million. therefore, at december 31, 2022, no shares remained outstanding under atm forward contracts.
during the year ended december 31, 2022, there were no direct issuances of shares of common stock under the atm program.
at december 31, 2022, $1.18 billion of our common stock remained available for sale under the atm program. actual future sales of our common stock will depend upon a variety of factors, including but not limited to market conditions, the trading price of our common stock, and our capital needs. we have no obligation to sell any of the remaining shares under our atm program.
see note 13 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information about our atm program.
share repurchase program on august 1, 2022, our board of directors approved the share repurchase program under which we may acquire shares of our common stock in the open market up to an aggregate purchase price of $500 million. purchases of common stock under the share repurchase program may be exercised at our discretion with the timing and number of shares repurchased depending on a variety of factors, including price, corporate and regulatory requirements, and other corporate liquidity requirements and priorities. the share repurchase program expires in august 2024 and may be suspended or terminated at any time without prior notice. during the year ended december 31, 2022, we repurchased 2.1 million shares of our common stock at a weighted average price of $27.16 per share for a total of $56 million. therefore, at december 31, 2022, $444 million of our common stock remained available for repurchase under the share repurchase program.
table of contents shelf registration in may 2021, we filed a prospectus with the sec as part of a registration statement on form s-3, using an automatic shelf registration process. this shelf registration statement expires on may 13, 2024 and at or prior to such time, we expect to file a new shelf registration statement. under the "shelf" process, we may sell any combination of the securities described in the prospectus through one or more offerings. the securities described in the prospectus include common stock, preferred stock, depositary shares, debt securities and warrants.

table of contents critical accounting estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with u.s. gaap requires our management to use judgment in the application of critical accounting estimates and assumptions. we base estimates on the best information available to us at the time, our experience and on various other assumptions believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. these estimates affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting periods. if our judgment or interpretation of the facts and circumstances relating to various transactions or other matters had been different, it is possible that different accounting would have been applied, resulting in a different presentation of our consolidated financial statements. from time to time, we re-evaluate our estimates and assumptions. in the event estimates or assumptions prove to be different from actual results, adjustments are made in subsequent periods to reflect more current estimates and assumptions about matters that are inherently uncertain. below is a discussion of accounting estimates that we consider critical in that they may require complex judgment in their application or require estimates about matters that are inherently uncertain. for a more detailed discussion of our significant accounting policies, including those related to critical accounting estimates further discussed below, see note 2 to the consolidated financial statements.
real estate we make estimates as part of our process for allocating a purchase price to the various identifiable assets and liabilities of an acquisition based upon the relative fair value of each asset or liability. the most significant components of our allocations are typically buildings as-if-vacant, land, and lease intangibles. in the case of allocating fair value to buildings and intangibles, our fair value estimates will affect the amount of depreciation and amortization we record over the estimated useful life of each asset acquired. in the case of allocating fair value to in-place leases, we make our best estimates based on our evaluation of the specific characteristics of each tenant's lease. factors considered include estimates of carrying costs during hypothetical expected lease-up periods, market conditions, and costs to execute similar leases. our assumptions affect the amount of future revenue and/or depreciation and amortization expense that we will recognize over the remaining useful life for the acquired in-place leases.
impairment of long-lived assets we assess the carrying value of our real estate assets and related intangibles ("real estate assets") when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. recoverability of real estate assets is measured by comparing the carrying amount of the real estate assets to the respective estimated future undiscounted cash flows. the expected future undiscounted cash flows reflect external market factors and are probability-weighted to reflect multiple possible cash-flow scenarios, including selling the assets at various points in the future. additionally, the estimated future undiscounted cash flows are calculated utilizing the lowest level of identifiable cash flows that are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities. in order to review our real estate assets for recoverability, we make assumptions regarding external market conditions (including capitalization rates and growth rates), forecasted cash flows and sales prices, and our intent with respect to holding or disposing of the asset. if our analysis indicates that the carrying value of the real estate assets is not recoverable on an undiscounted cash flow basis, we recognize an impairment charge for the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the real estate asset.
determining the fair value of real estate assets, including assets classified as held for sale, involves significant judgment and generally utilizes market capitalization rates, comparable market transactions, estimated per unit or per square foot prices, negotiations with prospective buyers, and forecasted cash flows (primarily lease revenue rates, expense rates, and growth rates). our ability to accurately predict future operating results and resulting cash flows, and estimate fair values, impacts the timing and recognition of impairments. while we believe our assumptions are reasonable, changes in these assumptions may have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.

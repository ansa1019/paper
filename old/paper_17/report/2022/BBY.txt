item 1a. risk factors.
described below are certain risks we believe apply to our business and the industry in which we operate. the risks are categorized using the following headings: external, strategic, operational, regulatory and legal, and financial and market. each of the following risk factors should be carefully considered in conjunction with other information provided in this annual report on form 10-k and in our other public disclosures. the risks described below highlight potential events, trends or other circumstances that could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, liquidity or access to sources of financing and, consequently, the market value of our common stock and debt instruments. these risks could cause our future results to differ materially from historical results and from guidance we may provide regarding our expectations of future financial performance. the risks described below are not an exhaustive list of all the risks we face. there may be others that we have not identified or that we have deemed to be immaterial. all forward-looking statements made by us or on our behalf are qualified by the risks described below.
external risks macroeconomic pressures, including, but not limited to, the current geopolitical climate, may adversely affect consumer spending and our financial results.
to varying degrees, our products and services are sensitive to changes in macroeconomic conditions that impact consumer spending. as a result, consumers may be affected in many different ways, including, for example:
• whether or not they make a purchase;
• their choice of brand, model or price-point;
• how frequently they upgrade or replace their devices; and
• their appetite for complementary services (for example, best buy totaltech).
real gdp growth, inflation (including wage inflation), consumer confidence, the covid-19 pandemic, employment levels, oil prices, interest, tax and foreign currency exchange rates, availability of consumer financing, housing market conditions, limitations on a government's ability to borrow and/or spend capital, costs for items such as fuel and food, any recession (and resulting corresponding declines in consumer sentiment) in response at least in part to central banks' actions to reduce inflation, bank failures or limited liquidity in accessing bank deposits, and other macroeconomic trends can adversely affect consumer demand for the products and services that we offer. in addition to general levels of inflation, we are also subject to risks of specific inflationary pressures on product prices due to, for example, high consumer demand, component shortages and supply chain disruption. we may be unable to increase our prices sufficiently to offset these pressures.
geopolitical issues around the world and how our markets are positioned can also impact macroeconomic conditions and could have a material adverse impact on our financial results. for example, the conflict in ukraine may continue to significantly impact fuel prices, inflation, the global supply chain and other macroeconomic conditions, which may further adversely affect global economic growth, consumer confidence and demand for our products and services. russia is a significant global producer of both fuel and raw materials used in certain of the products we sell, including nickel, aluminum and copper. disruptions in the markets for those inputs or other inputs produced by russia, whether due to sanctions, market pressure not to purchase inputs from russia or otherwise, could increase overall material costs for many of the products we sell. we cannot predict the extent or duration of sanctions in response to the conflict in ukraine, nor can we predict the effects of legislative or other governmental actions or regulatory scrutiny of russia, its allies or other countries with which russia has significant trade or financial ties, including china. the conflict in ukraine has exacerbated geopolitical tensions globally. further deterioration of relations between taiwan and china, the resulting actions taken, the response of the international community and other factors affecting trade with china or political or economic conditions in taiwan could disrupt the manufacturing of products or hardware components in the region, such as semiconductors and television panels sourced from taiwan or the broader array of products sourced from china. one or more of these factors could have a material adverse effect on our supply chain, the cost of our products or our revenues and financial results.
catastrophic events, including global pandemics such as the covid-19 pandemic, could adversely affect our operating results.
the risk or actual occurrence of various catastrophic events could have a material adverse effect on our financial performance. such events may consist of, or be caused by, for example:
• natural disasters or extreme weather events, including those related to climate change;
• diseases or pandemics (including covid-19) that have affected and may continue to affect our employees, customers or partners;
• earthquakes, floods, fires or other catastrophes affecting our properties, employees or customers;
• power loss, telecommunications failures, or software or hardware malfunctions; or
• terrorism, civil unrest, mass violence or violent acts, or other conflicts.
in recent years, we have observed an increase in the number and severity of certain catastrophic events in many of our markets. such events can adversely affect our workforce and prevent employees and customers from reaching our stores and properties. they can also disrupt or disable portions of our supply chain, distribution network and third-party business operations that may impact our ability to procure goods or services required for business operations at the quantities and levels we require. finally, such events can also affect our information technology systems, resulting in disruption to various aspects of our operations, including our ability to transact with customers and fulfill orders. the adverse effects of any such catastrophic event would be exacerbated if experienced at the same time as another unexpected and adverse event, such as the covid-19 pandemic.
the covid-19 pandemic in particular has had and may continue to subject our business, operations and financial condition to a number of risks. these risks have included or may in the future continue to include: (i) significant reductions in customer visits to, and spending at, our stores; (ii) significant disruptions to our supply chain; (iii) fluctuating consumer spending, particularly in light of the provision of government stimulus funds; (iv) novel changes to our operations, such as the roll-out of contactless, curbside pick-up for our goods, (v) the implementation of safety standards by various state and federal agencies; (vi) risks related to the shift in channels in which customers choose to engage us, such as by switching to online shopping, which may affect our profitability; and (vii) our ability to finance our operations. the emergence of new and more transmissible, more virulent, and/or immune-evading sars-cov-2 variants could exacerbate these risks.
three of our largest states by total sales are california, texas and florida, areas where natural disasters and extreme weather conditions have been, and could continue to be, more prevalent. natural disasters and climate-related events in those states and other areas where our sales and operations are concentrated could result in significant physical damage to or closure of our stores, distribution centers or other facilities.
further, external social activism, tension and violence resulting from external events impacting social justice and inequality, and our response to them, may adversely affect our employees, customers, properties and the communities in which we operate. also, if our customers and employees do not perceive our response to be appropriate or adequate for a particular region or our company as a whole, we could suffer damage to our reputation and our brand, which could adversely affect our business in the future. as a consequence of these or other catastrophic events, we may endure interruption to our operations or losses of property, equipment or inventory, which could adversely affect our revenue and profitability.
many of the products we sell are highly susceptible to technological advancement, product life cycle fluctuations and changes in consumer preferences.
we operate in a highly and increasingly dynamic industry sector fueled by constant technological innovation and disruption. this manifests itself in a variety of ways: the emergence of new products and categories, the often rapid maturation of categories, cannibalization of categories, changing price points, and product replacement and upgrade cycles.
this rapid pace of change can be hard to predict and manage, and there is no guarantee we can effectively do this all the time. if we fail to interpret, predict and react to these changes in a timely and effective manner, the consequences can include: failure to offer the products and services that our customers want; excess inventory, which may require heavy discounting or liquidation; inability to secure adequate access to brands or products for which consumer demand exceeds supply; delays in adapting our merchandising, marketing or supply chain capabilities to accommodate changes in product trends; and damage to our brand and reputation. these and other similar factors could have a material adverse impact on our revenue and profitability.
strategic risks we face strong competition from multi-channel retailers, e-commerce businesses, technology service providers, traditional store-based retailers, vendors and mobile network carriers, which directly affects our revenue and profitability.
while we constantly strive to offer consumers the best value, the retail sector is highly competitive. price is of great importance to most customers and price transparency and comparability continues to increase, particularly as a result of digital technology. the ability of consumers to compare prices on a real-time basis puts additional pressure on us to maintain competitive prices. we compete with many other local, regional, national and international retailers and technology service providers, as well as some of our vendors and mobile network carriers that market their products directly to consumers. competition may also result from new entrants into the markets we serve, offering products and/or services that compete with us.
the retail sector continues to experience increased sales initiated online and using mobile applications, as well as online sales for both in-store or curbside pick-up. online and multi-channel retailers continue to focus on delivery services, with customers increasingly seeking faster, guaranteed delivery times and low-cost or free shipping. our ability to be competitive on delivery times and delivery costs depends on many factors, and our failure to successfully manage these factors and offer competitive delivery options could negatively impact the demand for our products and our profit margins. because our business strategy is based on offering superior levels of customer service and a full range of services to complement the products we offer, our cost structure might be higher than some of our competitors, and this, in conjunction with price transparency, could put pressure on our margins. as these and related competitive factors evolve, we may experience material adverse pressure on our revenue and profitability.
if we fail to attract, retain and engage appropriately qualified employees, including employees in key positions, our operations and profitability may be harmed. in addition, changes in market compensation rates may adversely affect our profitability.
our performance is highly dependent on attracting, retaining and engaging appropriately qualified employees in our stores, service centers, distribution centers, field and corporate offices. our strategy of offering high-quality services and assistance for our customers requires a highly trained and engaged workforce. the turnover rate in the retail sector is relatively high and increased during the covid-19 pandemic, and there is an ongoing need to recruit and train new employees. factors that affect our ability to maintain sufficient numbers of qualified employees include, for example, employee engagement, our reputation, unemployment rates, competition from other employers, availability of qualified personnel and our ability to offer appropriate compensation and benefit packages. failure to recruit or retain qualified employees in the future may impair our efficiency and effectiveness and our ability to pursue growth opportunities. in addition, a significant amount of turnover of our executive team or other employees in key positions with specific knowledge relating to us, our operations and our industry may negatively impact our operations.
we operate in a competitive labor market and there is a risk that market increases in compensation and employer-provided benefits could have a material adverse effect on our profitability. we may also be subject to continued market pressure to increase employee hourly wage rates and increased cost pressure on employer-provided benefits. our need to implement corresponding adjustments within our labor model and compensation and benefit packages could have a material adverse impact to the profitability of our business.
our strategy to expand into health and new products, services and technologies brings new business, financial and regulatory risks.
as we introduce new products and services, we may have limited experience in these newer markets and regulatory environments and our customers may not like our new value propositions. these offerings may present new and difficult technology and regulatory challenges, and we may be subject to claims if customers of these offerings experience service disruptions, failures or other issues.
this expanded risk increases the complexity of our business and places significant responsibility on our management, employees, operations, systems, technical expertise, financial resources, and internal financial and regulatory control and reporting functions. in addition, new initiatives we test through trials and pilots may not scale or grow effectively or as we expected, which could limit our growth and negatively affect our operating results. they may also involve significant laws or regulations that are beyond our current expertise.
with our focus on healthcare, new products and services may frequently require regulatory approvals for market introduction. the number and diversity of regulatory bodies add complexity and may negatively impact time to market and implementation costs. for example, the healthcare space in which we operate is highly regulated from a product safety and quality perspective, and its services and products, including parts or materials from suppliers, are subject to regulation by various government and regulatory agencies including, but not limited to, the u.s. food and drug administration ("fda"). non-compliance with conditions imposed by regulatory authorities could result in product recalls, a temporary ban on products, stoppages at production facilities, remediation costs, orders to stop providing services, fines or claims for damages. product safety incidents or user concerns could trigger business reviews by the fda or other regulatory agencies, which, if failed, could trigger these impacts.
in addition, the ongoing digitalization of best buy health's products and services, including our holding of personal health data and medical data, increases the importance of compliance with data privacy and similar laws. the services and systems used in certain instances subject us to privacy and information security requirements, such as the health insurance portability and accountability act, and could expose us to customer data privacy and information security risks, as well as business or system interruption risks. given our acquisition of current health, a care-at-home technology platform, we also are subject to the uk's general data protection regulation ("gdpr") and other regulatory frameworks. these and other related issues could have a material adverse impact on our financial results and reputation.
our focus on services exposes us to certain risks that could have a material adverse impact on our revenue and profitability, as well as our reputation.
we offer a full range of services that complement our product offerings, including consultation, delivery, design, installation, memberships, protection plans, repair, set-up, technical support, and health, safety and caregiving monitoring and support. designing, marketing and executing these services is subject to incremental risks. these risks include, for example:
• pressure on services attachment as a result of the sustained increase in consumer desire to purchase product offerings online and through mobile applications;
• increased labor expense to fulfill our customer promises;
• increased pressure on margins from our best buy totaltech membership offering, which includes incremental customer benefits, and associated costs, compared to our previous total tech support offer, and the risk that increased volumes will not fully compensate for lower margins, or for loss of revenue and profit from revenue streams that are now included as benefits;
• pressure on traditional labor models to meet the evolving landscape of offerings and customer needs;
• use of third-party services that do not meet our standards or comply with applicable labor and independent contractor regulations, leading to potential reputational damage and liability risk;
• increased risk of errors or omissions in the fulfillment of services;
• unpredictable extended warranty failure rates and related expenses;
• employees in transit using company vehicles to visit customer locations and employees being present in customer homes, which may increase our scope of liability;
• the potential for increased scope of liability relating to managed services offerings;
• employees having access to customer devices, including the information held on those devices, which may increase our responsibility for the security of those devices and the privacy of the data they hold;
• the engagement of third parties to assist with some aspects of construction and installation, and the potential responsibility for the actions they undertake;
• the risk that in-home services could be more adversely impacted by inclement weather, health and safety concerns, and catastrophic events; and
• increased risk of non-compliance with new laws and regulations applicable to these services.
our reliance on key vendors and mobile network carriers subjects us to various risks and uncertainties which could affect our revenue and profitability.
we source the products we sell from a wide variety of domestic and international vendors. in fiscal 2023, our 20 largest suppliers accounted for approximately 79% of the merchandise we purchased, with five suppliers - apple, samsung, hp, lg and sony - representing approximately 57% of total merchandise purchased. we generally do not have long-term written contracts with our vendors that would require them to continue supplying us with merchandise. our profitability depends on securing acceptable terms with our vendors for, among other things, the price of merchandise we purchase from them, funding for various forms of promotional programs, payment terms, allocations of merchandise, development of compelling assortments of products, operation of vendor-focused shopping experiences within our stores and terms covering returns and factory warranties. while we believe we offer capabilities that these vendors value and depend upon to varying degrees, our vendors may be able to leverage their competitive advantages  for example, their financial strength, the strength of their brands with customers, their own stores or online channels or their relationships with other retailers  to our commercial disadvantage. the potential adverse impact of these factors can be amplified by price transparency (which can limit our flexibility to modify selling prices) and a highly competitive retail environment. generally, our ability to negotiate favorable terms with our vendors is more difficult with vendors where our purchases represent a smaller proportion of their total revenues and/or when there is less competition for those products. in addition, vendors may decide to limit or cease allowing us to offer certain categories, focus their marketing efforts on alternative channels or make unfavorable changes to our financial or other terms.
we are also dependent on a relatively small number of mobile carriers to allow us to offer mobile devices with carrier connections. the competitive strategies utilized by mobile network carriers can have a material impact on our business, especially with ongoing consolidation in the mobile industry. for example, if carriers change the structure of contracts, upgrade terms, qualification requirements, monthly fee plans, cancellation fees or service levels, the volume of upgrades and new contracts we sign with customers may be reduced, adversely affecting our revenue and profitability. in addition, our carriers may also serve customers through their own stores, websites, mobile applications and call centers or through other competing retail channels.
demand for the products and services we sell could decline if we fail to maintain positive brand perception and recognition through a focus on consumer experience.
we operate a portfolio of brands with a commitment to customer service and innovation. we believe that recognition and the reputation of our company and our brands are key to our success. operational factors, such as failure to deliver high quality services, uncompetitive pricing, failure to meet delivery promises or business interruptions, could damage our reputation. external factors, such as negative public remarks or accusations, could also be damaging. third parties may commit fraud while using our brand without our permission, possibly harming brand perception or reputation. the ubiquity of social media means that customer feedback and other information about our company are shared with a broad audience in a manner that is easily accessible and rapidly disseminated. damage to the perception or reputation of our brands could result in, among other things, declines in revenues and customer loyalty, decreases in gift card and service plan sales, lower employee retention and productivity and vendor relationship issues, all of which could materially adversely affect our revenue and profitability.
failure to effectively manage strategic ventures, alliances or acquisitions could have a negative impact on our business.
we may decide to enter into new joint ventures, partnerships, alliances or acquisitions with third parties (collectively, "new ventures"). assessing the viability of new ventures is typically subject to significant uncertainty, and the success of such new ventures can be adversely affected by many factors, including, for example:
• different and incremental business and other risks of the new venture not identified in our diligence assessments;
• failure to attract, motivate and retain key employees of the new venture;
• uncertainty of forecasting financial performance;
• failure to integrate aspects of the new venture into our existing business, such as new product or service offerings or information technology systems;
• failure to maintain appropriate internal controls over financial reporting;
• failure to generate expected synergies, such as cost reductions;
• unforeseen changes in the business environment of the new venture;
• disputes or strategic differences with key employees or other third-party participants in the new venture; and
• adverse impacts on relationships with vendors and other key partners of our existing business or the new venture.
if new ventures are unsuccessful, our liquidity and profitability could be materially adversely affected, and we may be required to recognize material impairments to goodwill and other assets acquired. new ventures may also divert our financial resources and management's attention from other important areas of our business.
failure to effectively manage our real estate portfolio may negatively impact our operating results.
effective management of our real estate portfolio is critical to our omnichannel strategy. failure to identify and secure suitable locations for our stores and other facilities could impair our ability to compete successfully and our profitability. most of our properties are leased under multi-year contracts. as such, it is essential that we effectively evaluate a range of factors that may influence the success of our long-term real estate strategy. such factors include, for example:
• changing patterns of customer consumption and behavior, particularly in light of an evolving omnichannel environment;
• our ability to adjust store operating models to adapt to these changing patterns;
• the location and appropriate number of stores, supply chain and other facilities in our portfolio;
• the interior layout, format and size of our stores;
• the products and services we offer at each store;
• the local competitive positioning, trade area demographics and economic factors for each of our stores;
• the primary term lease commitment and long-term lease option coverage for each store; and
• the occupancy cost of our stores relative to market rents.
if we fail to effectively evaluate these factors or negotiate appropriate terms, or if unforeseen changes arise, the consequences could include, for example:
• closing stores and abandoning the related assets, while retaining the financial commitments of the leases;
• incurring significant costs to remodel or transform our stores;
• operating stores, supply chain or service locations that no longer meet the needs of our business; and
• bearing excessive lease expenses.
these consequences could have a material adverse impact on our profitability, cash flows and liquidity.
for leased property, the financial impact of exiting a location can vary greatly depending on, among other factors, the terms of the lease, the condition of the local real estate market, demand for the specific property, our relationship with the landlord and the availability of potential sub-lease tenants. it is difficult for us to influence some of these factors, and the costs of exiting a property can be significant. in addition to rent, we are typically still responsible for taxes, insurance and common area maintenance charges for vacant properties until the lease commitment expires or is terminated. similarly, when we enter into a contract with a tenant to sub-lease property, we usually retain our obligations as the master lessee. this leaves us at risk for any remaining liability in the event of default by the sub-lease tenant.
operational risks interruptions and other factors affecting our stores and supply chain, including in-bound deliveries from our vendors, may adversely affect our business.
our stores and supply chain assets are a critical part of our operations, particularly in light of industry trends and initiatives, such as ship-from-store and the emphasis on fast delivery when purchasing online. we depend on our vendors' abilities to deliver products to us at the right location, at the right time and in the right quantities. we also depend on third parties for the operation of certain aspects of our supply chain network. the factors that can adversely affect these aspects of our operations include, but are not limited to:
• interruptions to our delivery capabilities;
• failure of third parties to meet our standards or commitments;
• disruptions to our systems and the need to implement new systems;
• limitations in capacity;
• global supply chain impacts that could hinder our vendors' ability to meet our demand for product volumes and timing;
• increased levels of inventory loss due to organized crime, theft or damage;
• risk to our employees and customers arising from burglary or robbery from our stores or other facilities;
• consolidation or business failures in the transportation and distribution sectors;
• labor strikes, slow-downs or labor shortages, including as a result of an increasingly competitive job market, affecting our stores or impacting ports or any other aspect of our supply chain;
• diseases, pandemics (including covid-19), outbreaks and other health-related concerns; and
• increasing transportation costs.
it is important that we maintain optimal levels of inventory in each store and distribution center and respond rapidly to shifting demands. any disruption to, or inefficiency in, our supply chain network, whether due to geopolitical conflicts, the covid-19 pandemic or other factors, could damage our revenue and profitability. the risks associated with our dependence on third parties are greater for small parcel home deliveries because of the relatively small number of carriers with the scope and capacity required by our business. the continuing growth of online purchases for delivery increases our exposure to these risks. if we fail to manage these risks effectively, we could experience a material adverse impact on our reputation, revenue and profitability.
we utilize third-party vendors for certain aspects of our operations, and any material disruption in our relationships or their services may have an adverse impact on our business.
we engage key third-party business partners to support various functions of our business, including, but not limited to, delivery and installation, customer warranty, information technology, web hosting and cloud-based services, customer loyalty programs, promotional financing and customer loyalty credit cards, gift cards, technical support, transportation, insurance programs and human resource operations. any material disruption in our relationships with key third-party business partners or any disruption in the services or systems provided or managed by third parties could impact our revenues and cost structure and hinder our operations, particularly if a disruption occurs during peak revenue periods.
our exclusive brands products are subject to several additional product, supply chain and legal risks that could affect our operating results.
sales of our exclusive brands products, which include best buy essentials, dynex, insignia, modal, platinum and rocketfish branded products, as well as products such as jitterbug and lively branded products, represent an important component of our product offerings and our revenue and profitability. most of these products are manufactured by contract manufacturers in china and southeast asia. this arrangement exposes us to the following additional potential risks, which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results:
• we have greater exposure and responsibility to consumers for warranty replacements and repairs as a result of exclusive brands product defects, and our recourse to contract manufacturers for such warranty liabilities may be limited in foreign jurisdictions;
• we may be subject to regulatory compliance and/or product liability claims relating to personal injury, death or property damage caused by exclusive brands products, some of which may require us to take significant actions, such as product recalls;
• we have experienced and may continue to experience disruptions in manufacturing and logistics due to the covid-19 pandemic, and we may experience disruptions in manufacturing or logistics in the future due to inconsistent and unanticipated order patterns, our inability to develop long-term relationships with key manufacturers, other diseases or pandemics, unforeseen natural disasters or geopolitical crises, such as the conflict in ukraine and this conflict's potential impact on global geopolitical tensions, including with china or between china and taiwan;
• we may not be able to locate manufacturers that meet our internal standards, whether for new exclusive brands products or for migration of the manufacturing of products from an existing manufacturer;
• we may be subject to a greater risk of inventory obsolescence as we do not generally have return-to-vendor rights;
• we are subject to developing and often-changing labor and environmental laws for the manufacturing of products in foreign countries, and we may be unable to conform to new rules or interpretations in a timely manner;
• we may be subject to claims by technology or other intellectual property owners if we inadvertently infringe upon their patents or other intellectual property rights, or if we fail to pay royalties owed on our exclusive brands products;
• our operations may be disrupted by trade disputes or excessive tariffs, including any future trade disputes or future phases of trade negotiations with china, and we may not be able to source alternatives quickly enough to avoid interruptions in product supply; and
• we may be unable to obtain or adequately protect patents and other intellectual property rights on our exclusive brands products or manufacturing processes.
maintaining consistent quality, availability and competitive pricing of our exclusive brands products helps us build and maintain customer loyalty, generate revenue and achieve acceptable margins. failure to maintain these factors could have a significant adverse impact on the demand for exclusive brands products and the profits we are able to generate from them.
we are subject to risks associated with vendors that source products outside of the u.s.
our ability to find qualified vendors who can supply products in a timely and efficient manner that meet our internal standards of quality and safety can be difficult, especially with respect to goods sourced from outside the u.s. risks such as political or economic instability, cross-border trade restrictions or tariffs, merchandise quality issues, product safety concerns, work stoppages, port delays, foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, transportation capacity and costs, inflation, civil unrest, natural disasters, outbreaks of pandemics (including covid-19) and other factors relating to foreign trade are beyond our control. vendors may also fail to invest adequately in design, production or distribution facilities, and may reduce their customer incentives, advertising and promotional activities or change their pricing policies. these and other related issues could have a material adverse impact on our financial results.
we rely heavily on our information technology systems for our key business processes. any failure or interruption in these systems could have a material adverse impact on our business.
the effective and efficient operation of our business is dependent on our information technology systems and those of our information technology vendors. we rely heavily on these information technology systems to manage all key aspects of our business, including demand forecasting, purchasing, supply chain management, point-of-sale processing, services fulfillment (including, for example, our urgent response service provided by best buy health), staff planning and deployment, financial management, reporting and forecasting and safeguarding critical and sensitive information.
our information technology systems and those of our partners are subject to damage or interruption from power outages, computer and telecommunications failures, computer viruses, worms, other malicious computer programs, denial-of-service attacks, security breaches (through cyber-attacks and other malicious actions, including ransomware and phishing attacks), catastrophic events (such as fires, tornadoes, earthquakes and hurricanes) and usage errors by our employees. while we have adopted, and continue to enhance, business continuity and disaster recovery plans and strategies, there is no guarantee that such plans and strategies will be effective, which could interrupt the functionality of our information technology systems or those of third parties. the failure or interruption of these information systems, data centers, cloud platforms or their backup systems could significantly disrupt our business and cause higher costs and lost revenues and could threaten our ability to remain in operation.
as we continue to migrate more systems to the cloud, we may face additional risks that may compromise our security or disrupt our business capabilities, including ensuring the proper configuration, the unknowns of operating more workloads in the cloud, securing systems in the cloud and the types of cloud-based services we leverage.
we face a heightened risk of cybersecurity attacks or data security incidents and are more dependent on internet and telecommunications access and capabilities.
we utilize complex information technology platforms to operate our websites and mobile applications. if we fail to secure these systems against attacks or fail to effectively upgrade and maintain our hardware, software, network and system infrastructure and improve the efficiency and resiliency of our systems, it could cause system interruptions and delays. disruptions to these services, such as those caused by unforeseen traffic levels, malicious attacks by governments, criminals or other non-state actors, other technical difficulties or events outside of our control, such as natural disasters, power or telecommunications failures or loss of critical data, could prevent us from accepting and fulfilling customer orders for products or services, which could cause us to forgo material revenues and incur material costs, and could adversely affect our reputation.
further, as our online interactions and sales have increased and have become critical to our growth, and as many employees now use hybrid or full-time remote-working arrangements, the risk of any interruption of our information technology system capabilities is heightened, as well as the risk that customer demand exceeds the capacity of our online operations. any such interruption or capacity constraint could result in a deterioration of our ability to process online sales, provide customer service or perform other necessary business functions.
failure to prevent or effectively respond to a breach of the privacy or security of our customer, employee, vendor or company information could expose us to substantial costs and reputational damage, as well as litigation and enforcement actions.
our business involves the collection, use and storage of personal information, including payment card information and protected health information, as well as confidential information regarding our employees, vendors and other company information. we also share personal and confidential information with suppliers and other third parties, as well as use third-party technology and systems which process and transmit information for a variety of activities. we have been the target of attempted cyber-attacks and other security threats, and we may be subject to breaches of our information technology systems. while we engage in significant data-protection efforts, criminal activity, such as cyber-attacks, lapses in our controls or the intentional or negligent actions of employees, business associates or third parties, may undermine our privacy and security measures, and, as a result, unauthorized parties may obtain access to our data systems and misappropriate employee, customer and other confidential data, or authorized parties may use or share personal information in an inappropriate manner or otherwise seek to extract financial gain based on access to or possession of company, employee or customer information. furthermore, because the methods used to obtain unauthorized access change frequently and may not be immediately detected, and given the potentially disruptive nature of emerging technologies, we may be unable to anticipate such attacks or promptly and effectively respond to them. any compromise of our customer information or other confidential information could have a material adverse effect on our reputation or our relationships with our customers and partners, which may in turn have a negative impact on our revenue and may expose us to material costs, penalties and claims.
sensitive customer data may also be present on customer-owned devices entrusted to us for service and repair. vulnerable code on products sold or serviced, including our exclusive brands, may also result in a compromise of customer privacy or security. our efforts to protect against such compromises and ensure appropriate handling of customer data on devices we manufacture, sell and service may not be effective, resulting in potential liability and damage to our customer relationships.
increasing costs associated with information security and privacy, such as increased investment in technology and qualified staff, costs of compliance, costs resulting from fraud or criminal activity and costs of cyber and privacy insurance, could cause our business and results of operations to suffer materially. additionally, recently applicable and potential new or significantly revised state, provincial and federal laws and regulations in the jurisdictions in which we do business are expanding our obligations to protect and honor the privacy and security of customer data, requiring additional resources and creating incremental risk arising from a potential breach or compliance failure. in addition, any compromise of our data security may materially increase the costs we incur to protect against such breaches and could subject us to additional legal risk.
product safety and quality concerns could have a material adverse impact on our revenue and profitability.
if the products we sell fail to meet applicable safety standards or our customers' expectations regarding safety and quality, we could be exposed to increased legal risk and our reputation may be damaged. failure to take appropriate actions in relation to product recalls could lead to breaches of laws and regulations and leave us susceptible to government enforcement actions or private litigation. recalls of products, particularly when combined with lack of available alternatives or difficulty in sourcing sufficient volumes of replacement products, could also have a material adverse impact on our revenue and profitability.
changes to labor or employment laws or regulations could have an adverse impact on our costs and impair the viability of our operating model.
as an employer of more than 90,000 people in a large number of different jurisdictions, we are subject to risks related to employment laws and regulations including, for example:
• the organization of unions and related rules that affect the nature of labor relations, changes to which the national labor relations board frequently considers;
• laws that impact the relationship between the company and independent contractors and the classification of employees and independent contractors; and
• laws that impact minimum wage, sick time, paid leave and scheduling requirements that could directly or indirectly increase our payroll costs and/or impact the level of service we are able to provide.
changes to laws and regulations such as these could adversely impact our reputation, our ability to continue operations and our profitability.
regulatory and legal risks we are subject to statutory, regulatory and legal developments that could have a material adverse impact on our business.
our statutory, regulatory and legal environments expose us to complex compliance and litigation risks that could have a material adverse effect on our operations. some of the most significant compliance and litigation risks we face include, but are not limited to:
• the difficulty of complying with sometimes conflicting statutes and regulations in local, national or international jurisdictions;
• the potential for unexpected costs related to compliance with new or existing environmental legislation or international agreements affecting energy, carbon emissions, electronics recycling and water or product materials;
• the challenges of ensuring compliance with applicable product compliance laws and regulations with respect to both the products we sell and contract to manufacture, including laws and regulations related to product safety and product transport;
• the financial, operational and business impact of evolving regulations governing data privacy and security, including limitations on the collection, use or sharing of information; consumer rights to access, delete or limit/opt-out of the use of information; or litigation arising from new private rights of action;
• the impact of other new or changing statutes and regulations including, but not limited to, financial reform; national labor relations board rule changes; healthcare reform; contracted worker labor laws; corporate governance matters; escheatment rules; rules governing pricing, content, distribution, copyright, mobile communications, electronic device certification or payment services; and/or other future legislation that could affect how we operate and execute our strategies as well as alter our expense structure;
• the impact of litigation, including class-action lawsuits involving consumers and shareholders, and labor and employment matters; and
• the impact of changes in the federal executive and legislative branches on the development, or changes in, laws, regulations and policies, such as economic, fiscal, tax, retail, labor and social policies.
the impact of geopolitical tensions, including the potential implementation of more restrictive trade policies, higher tariffs or the renegotiation of existing trade agreements in the u.s. or countries where we sell our products and services or procure products, could have a material adverse effect on our business. in particular, political or trade disputes or future phases of trade negotiations with china could lead to the imposition of tariffs or other trade actions that could adversely affect our supply chain and our business and could require us to take action to mitigate those effects.
further, the impact of potential changes in u.s., state or other countries' tax laws and regulations or evolving interpretations of existing laws, could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.
regulatory activity that affects the retail sector has grown in recent years, increasing the risk of fines and additional operating costs associated with compliance. additionally, defending against lawsuits and other proceedings may involve significant expense and divert management's attention and resources from other matters.
concern over climate change may result in new or additional legal, legislative and regulatory requirements to reduce or mitigate the effects of climate change on the environment, which could result in future tax, compliance, transportation and utility cost increases. our own climate change-oriented initiatives, such as our attempts to increase energy efficiency during store construction and remodeling, could also increase our costs. in addition, changes to the environment, both long-term and short-term, may affect consumer shopping behavior in a way that negatively impacts our revenue, revenue mix and profitability.
our business is subject to evolving corporate governance and public disclosure regulations and expectations, including with respect to cybersecurity and environmental, social and governance matters, that could expose us to numerous risks.
we are subject to changing rules and regulations promulgated by a number of governmental and self-regulatory organizations, including the sec, the new york stock exchange and the financial accounting standards board. these rules and regulations continue to evolve in scope and complexity, and many new requirements have been created in response to laws enacted by congress, making compliance more difficult and uncertain. in addition, increasingly regulators, customers, investors, employees and other stakeholders are focusing on cybersecurity and environmental, social and governance ("esg") matters and related disclosures. these changing rules, regulations and stakeholder expectations have resulted in, and are likely to continue to result in, increased general and administrative expenses and increased management time and attention spent complying with or meeting such regulations and expectations. for example, developing and acting on initiatives within the scope of esg, and collecting, measuring and reporting esg-related information and metrics can be costly, difficult and time consuming and is subject to evolving reporting standards, including the sec's recently proposed climate-related reporting requirements, and similar proposals by other international regulatory bodies. we may also communicate certain initiatives and goals, regarding environmental matters, diversity, responsible sourcing and social investments and other esg-related matters, in our sec filings or in other public disclosures. these initiatives and goals within the scope of esg could be difficult and expensive to implement, the technologies needed to implement them may not be cost effective and may not advance at a sufficient pace, and we could be criticized for the accuracy, adequacy or completeness of the disclosure. further, statements about our esg-related initiatives and goals, and progress against those goals, may be based on standards for measuring progress that are still developing, internal controls and processes that continue to evolve, and assumptions that are subject to change in the future. in addition, we could be criticized for the scope or nature of such initiatives or goals, or for any revisions to these goals. if our esg-related data, processes and reporting are incomplete or inaccurate, or if we fail to achieve progress with respect to our goals within the scope of esg on a timely basis, or at all, our reputation, business, financial performance and growth could be adversely affected.
our international activities are subject to many of the same risks as described above, as well as to risks associated with the legislative, judicial, regulatory, political, economic and cultural factors specific to the countries or regions in which we operate.
we operate retail locations in canada, current health operates in the uk, and most of our exclusive brands products are manufactured by contract manufacturers based in southeast asia. we also have wholly-owned legal entities registered in various other foreign countries, including bermuda, china, hong kong, luxembourg, the republic of mauritius and the uk. during fiscal 2023, our international segment's operations generated approximately 8% of our revenue. in general, the risk factors identified above also have relevance to our international operations. in addition, our international operations also expose us to other risks, including those related to, for example:
• political conditions and geopolitical events, including war and terrorism;
• economic conditions, including monetary and fiscal policies and tax rules, as well as foreign exchange rate risk;
• rules governing international trade and potential changes to trade policies or trade agreements and ownership of foreign entities;
• government-imposed travel restrictions or warnings, whether in response to the covid-19 pandemic or otherwise, and differing responses of governmental authorities to pandemics and other global events;
• cultural differences that we may be unable to anticipate or respond to appropriately;
• different rules or practices regarding employee relations, including the existence of works councils or unions;
• difficulties in enforcing intellectual property rights; and
• difficulties encountered in exerting appropriate management oversight to operations in remote locations.
these factors could significantly disrupt our international operations and have a material adverse effect on our revenue and profitability and could lead us to incur material impairments and other exit costs.
financial and market risks failure to effectively manage our costs could have a material adverse effect on our profitability.
as discussed above, our revenues are susceptible to volatility from various sources, which can lead to periods of flat or declining revenues. however, some of our operating costs are fixed and/or are subject to multi-year contracts. some elements of our costs may be higher than our competitors' because of, for example, our extended retail footprint and structure, our hourly pay structure, our differentiated service offerings or our levels of customer service. accordingly, our ongoing drive to reduce costs and increase efficiency represents a strategic imperative. failure to successfully manage our costs could have a material adverse impact on our profitability and curtail our ability to fund our growth or other critical initiatives.
we are highly dependent on the cash flows and net earnings we generate during our fiscal fourth quarter, which includes the majority of the holiday shopping season.
a large proportion of our revenue and earnings is generated in the fiscal fourth quarter, which includes the majority of the holiday shopping season. in addition, the holiday shopping season also incorporates many other unpredictable factors, such as the level of competitive promotional activity, new product release activity and customer buying patterns, which makes it difficult to forecast and react to these factors quickly. unexpected events or developments, such as pandemics, natural or man-made disasters, changes in consumer demand, economic factors, product sourcing issues, cyber-attacks, failure or interruption of management information systems, or disruptions in services or systems provided or managed by third-party vendors could significantly disrupt our operations. as a result of these factors, our fiscal fourth quarter and annual results could be adversely affected.‎

economic, regulatory and other developments could adversely affect our ability to offer attractive promotional financing to our customers and adversely affect the profits we generate from these programs.
we offer promotional financing and credit cards issued by third-party banks that manage and directly extend credit to our customers. customers choosing promotional financing can receive extended payment terms and low- or no-interest financing on qualifying purchases. we believe our financing programs generate incremental revenue from customers who prefer the financing terms to other available forms of payment or otherwise need access to financing in order to make purchases. approximately 25% of our fiscal 2023 revenue was transacted using one of the company's branded cards. in addition, we earn profit-share income and share in any losses from certain of our banking partners based on the performance of the programs. the income or loss we earn in this regard is subject to numerous factors, including the volume and value of transactions, the terms of promotional financing offers, bad debt rates, interest rates, the regulatory and competitive environment and expenses of operating the program. adverse changes to any of these factors could impair our ability to offer these programs to customers and reduce customer purchases and our ability to earn income from sharing in the profits of the programs.
constraints in the capital markets or our vendor credit terms may have a material adverse impact on our liquidity.
we need sufficient sources of liquidity to fund our working capital requirements, service our outstanding indebtedness and finance business opportunities. without sufficient liquidity, we could be forced to curtail our operations or we may not be able to pursue business opportunities. the principal sources of our liquidity are funds generated from operating activities, available cash and liquid investments, credit facilities, other debt arrangements and trade payables. our liquidity could be materially adversely impacted if our vendors reduce payment terms and/or impose tighter credit limits. if our sources of liquidity do not satisfy our requirements, we may need to seek additional financing. we typically hold material balances of cash, cash equivalents and/or short-term investments and are therefore reliant on banks and other financial institutions to safeguard and allow ready access to these assets. our future liquidity will depend on a variety of factors, such as economic and market conditions, the regulatory environment for and financial stability of banks and other financial institutions, the availability of credit, our credit ratings and our reputation with potential lenders. these factors could have a material adverse effect on our costs of borrowing and our ability to pursue business opportunities and threaten our ability to meet our obligations as they become due.
changes in our credit ratings may limit our access to capital and materially increase our borrowing costs.
any future downgrades to our credit ratings and outlook could negatively impact the perception of our credit risk and thus our access to capital markets, borrowing costs, vendor terms and lease terms. our credit ratings are based upon information furnished by us or obtained by a rating agency from its own sources and are subject to revision, suspension or withdrawal by one or more rating agencies at any time. rating agencies may change the ratings assigned to us due to developments that are beyond our control, including the introduction of new rating practices and methodologies.
failure to meet any financial performance guidance or other forward-looking statements we may provide to the public could result in a decline in our stock price.
we may provide public guidance on our expected financial results or other forward-looking information for future periods. when we provide guidance, we believe that this guidance provides investors and analysts with a better understanding of management's expectations for the future and is useful to our existing and potential shareholders, but such guidance is comprised of forward-looking statements subject to the risks and uncertainties described in this report and in our other public filings and public statements. our actual results may not be in line with guidance we have provided. we may not be able to accurately forecast our growth rate and profit margins. we base our expense levels and investment plans on sales estimates. a significant portion of our expenses and investments are fixed, and we may not be able to adjust our spending quickly enough if our sales are less than expected. our revenue growth may not be sustainable and our percentage growth rates may decrease. our revenue and operating profit growth depend on the continued growth of demand for the products and services offered by us, and our business is affected by general economic and business conditions worldwide. if our financial results for a particular period do not meet any guidance we provide or the expectations of market participants, or if we reduce any guidance for future periods, the market price of our common stock may decline.
item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations.
management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations ("md&a") is intended to provide a reader of our financial statements with a narrative from the perspective of our management on our financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and certain other factors that may affect our future results. unless otherwise noted, transactions and other factors significantly impacting our financial condition, results of operations and liquidity are discussed in order of magnitude. our md&a should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes included in item 8, financial statements and supplementary data, of this annual report on form 10-k. refer to item 7, management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations, in our form 10-k for the fiscal year ended january 29, 2022, for discussion of the results of operations for the year ended january 29, 2022, compared to the year ended january 30, 2021, which is incorporated by reference herein.
overview we are driven by our purpose to enrich lives through technology and our vision to personalize and humanize technology solutions for every stage of life. we accomplish this by leveraging our combination of technology and a human touch to meet our customers' everyday needs, whether they come to us online, visit our stores or invite us into their homes. we have operations in the u.s. and canada.
we have two reportable segments: domestic and international. the domestic segment is comprised of our operations in all states, districts and territories of the u.s. and our best buy health business, and includes the brand names best buy, best buy ads, best buy business, best buy health, cst, current health, geek squad, lively, magnolia, pacific kitchen and home, techliquidators and yardbird and the domain names bestbuy.com, currenthealth.com, lively.com, techliquidators.com and yardbird.com. the international segment is comprised of all operations in canada under the brand names best buy, best buy mobile and geek squad and the domain name bestbuy.ca.
our fiscal year ends on the saturday nearest the end of january. fiscal 2023, fiscal 2022 and fiscal 2021 included 52 weeks. our business, like that of many retailers, is seasonal. a large proportion of our revenue and earnings is generated in the fiscal fourth quarter, which includes the majority of the holiday shopping season.
comparable sales throughout this md&a, we refer to comparable sales. comparable sales is a metric used by management to evaluate the performance of our existing stores, websites and call centers by measuring the change in net sales for a particular period over the comparable prior-period of equivalent length. comparable sales includes revenue from stores, websites and call centers operating for at least 14 full months. revenue from online sales is included in comparable sales and represents sales initiated on a website or app, regardless of whether customers choose to pick up product in store, curbside, at an alternative pick-up location or take delivery direct to their homes. revenue from acquisitions is included in comparable sales beginning with the first full quarter following the first anniversary of the date of the acquisition. comparable sales also includes credit card revenue, gift card breakage, commercial sales and sales of merchandise to wholesalers and dealers, as applicable. revenue from stores closed more than 14 days, including but not limited to relocated, remodeled, expanded and downsized stores, or stores impacted by natural disasters, is excluded from comparable sales until at least 14 full months after reopening. comparable sales excludes the impact of revenue from discontinued operations, the impact of profit-share revenue from our services plan portfolio and the effect of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates (applicable to our international segment only). all periods presented apply this methodology consistently.
on november 2, 2021, we acquired all outstanding shares of current health ltd. ("current health"). on november 4, 2021, we acquired all outstanding shares of two peaks, llc d/b/a yardbird furniture ("yardbird"). consistent with our comparable sales policy, the results of current health and yardbird are excluded from our comparable sales calculation until the first quarter of fiscal 2024.
we believe comparable sales is a meaningful supplemental metric for investors to evaluate revenue performance resulting from growth in existing stores, websites and call centers versus the portion resulting from opening new stores or closing existing stores. the method of calculating comparable sales varies across the retail industry. as a result, our method of calculating comparable sales may not be the same as other retailers' methods.
non-gaap financial measures this md&a includes financial information prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the u.s. ("gaap"), as well as certain adjusted or non-gaap financial measures, such as constant currency, non-gaap operating income, non-gaap effective tax rate and non-gaap diluted earnings per share ("eps"). we believe that non-gaap financial measures, when reviewed in conjunction with gaap financial measures, provide additional useful information for evaluating current period performance and assessing future performance. for these reasons, internal management reporting, including budgets, forecasts and financial targets used for short-term incentives are based on non-gaap financial measures. generally, our non-gaap financial measures include adjustments for items such as restructuring charges, goodwill and intangible asset impairments, price-fixing settlements, gains and losses on certain investments, intangible asset amortization, certain acquisition-related costs and the tax effect of all such items. in addition, certain other items may be excluded from non-gaap financial measures when we believe doing so provides greater clarity to management and our investors. we provide reconciliations of the most comparable financial measures presented in accordance with gaap to presented non-gaap financial measures that enable investors to understand the adjustments made in arriving at the non-gaap financial measures and to evaluate performance using the same metrics as management. these non-gaap financial measures should be considered in addition to, and not superior to or as a substitute for, gaap financial measures. we strongly encourage investors and shareholders to review our financial statements and publicly-filed reports in their entirety and not to rely on any single financial measure. non-gaap financial measures may be calculated differently from similarly titled measures used by other companies, thereby limiting their usefulness for comparative purposes.‎
in our discussions of the operating results of our consolidated business and our international segment, we sometimes refer to the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates or the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, which are references to the differences between the foreign currency exchange rates we use to convert the international segment's operating results from local currencies into u.s. dollars for reporting purposes. we also may use the term "constant currency," which represents results adjusted to exclude foreign currency impacts. we calculate those impacts as the difference between the current period results translated using the current period currency exchange rates and using the comparable prior period currency exchange rates. we believe the disclosure of revenue changes in constant currency provides useful supplementary information to investors in light of significant fluctuations in currency rates.
refer to the non-gaap financial measures section below for detailed reconciliations of items impacting non-gaap operating income, non-gaap effective tax rate and non-gaap diluted eps in the presented periods.
business strategy update during fiscal 2023, our team delivered strong execution and relentless focus on customer service during what continues to be a challenging environment for our industry. throughout the fiscal year, we remained committed to balancing our near-term response to current conditions and managing well what is in our control, while also advancing our strategic initiatives and investing in areas important for our long-term performance.
during the first year of the pandemic, we said we believed customer shopping behavior would be permanently changed in a way that is even more digital and puts customers entirely in control to shop how they want. and our strategy was to embrace that reality, and to lead not follow.
in fiscal 2023, digital sales comprised 33% of our domestic revenue compared to 19% in fiscal 2020. sales via phone, chat and virtual have also remained significantly higher. even with that shift, our stores remain a cornerstone of our differentiation. not only was 67% of our domestic revenue transacted in our stores, more than half of our identified customers engaged in cross-channel shopping experiences, and more than 40% of online sales were picked up in stores. further, we play an important role for our vendors as the only national consumer electronics specialty retailer who can showcase their products and help commercialize their new technology. therefore, we are focused on evolving our omnichannel retail strategy over time, including our portfolio of stores, operating model and digital tools, to provide customers with differentiated experiences and enhance our omnichannel fulfillment.
we continue to advance our other strategic initiatives as well. we are building customer relationships through membership, including evolving our free my best buy program and our paid best buy totaltech membership option. in best buy health, we are essentially nurturing a startup within a large-scale organization and leveraging best buy's core assets, including the geek squad, to grow, build and establish the care at home space, an emerging part of the healthcare industry.
as we enter fiscal 2024, macroeconomic headwinds will likely result in continued pressure, and we are preparing for sales in the consumer electronics industry to decline again this year. in particular, our customers are facing economic challenges from the dual pressures of high inflation and the resulting interest rate increases, and it is difficult to predict how such factors will impact us in the near term. however, we expect several factors to drive the eventual return of industry growth over time, including the natural upgrade and replacement cycles for the technology bought earlier in the pandemic and continued vendor innovation. in addition, macro technology trends like cloud, augmented reality and expanded broadband access have the potential to drive new products and demand. while our product categories tend to experience slightly different timing nuances, in general, we believe they are poised for growth in the coming years. in addition, we are continuing our expansion into newer categories like wellness technology, personal electric transportation, outdoor living and electric car charging.
we remain excited about our industry and our future. there are more technology products than ever in people's homes, technology is increasingly a necessity in our lives, and we believe we are uniquely there for our customers as they continue to navigate this innovative space.

(1)because retailers vary in how they record costs of operating their supply chain between cost of sales and sg&a, our gross profit rate and sg&a rate may not be comparable to other retailers' corresponding rates. for additional information regarding costs classified in cost of sales and sg&a, refer to note 1, summary of significant accounting policies, of the notes to consolidated financial statements, included in item 8, financial statements and supplementary data, of this annual report on form 10-k.
in fiscal 2023, we generated $46.3 billion in revenue and our comparable sales declined 9.9%. our comparable sales decline was due to multiple factors, including the following: (1) the lapping of strong sales in fiscal 2022 and fiscal 2021 that were driven by heightened demand during the pandemic for stay-at-home focused purchases and the benefit of government stimulus payments; (2) the shift of consumer spending back into service areas such as travel and entertainment and away from durable goods; and (3) macroeconomic pressures, including high inflation, that resulted in overall softness in customer demand within the consumer electronics industry.
revenue, gross profit rate, sg&a and operating income rate changes in fiscal 2023 were primarily driven by our domestic segment. for further discussion of each segment's rate changes, see segment performance summary, below.

(1)comparable online sales are included in the comparable sales calculation.
the decrease in revenue in fiscal 2023 was primarily driven by comparable sales declines across most of our product categories, particularly computing, home theater, mobile phones and appliances. online revenue of $14.2 billion decreased 13.5% on a comparable basis in fiscal 2023. these decreases in revenue were primarily due to the reasons described within the consolidated results section, above.

notable comparable sales changes by revenue category were as follows:
• computing and mobile phones: the 12.0% comparable sales decline was driven primarily by computing, mobile phones, wearables and tablets.
• consumer electronics: the 12.2% comparable sales decline was driven primarily by home theater, digital imaging and headphones.
• appliances: the 5.7% comparable sales decline was driven primarily by large appliances.
• entertainment: the 5.5% comparable sales decline was driven primarily by virtual reality and gaming software.
• services: the 2.5% comparable sales decline was driven primarily by the launch of our best buy totaltech membership offering that includes benefits that were previously stand-alone revenue-generating services, such as warranty services.
our gross profit rate decreased in fiscal 2023, primarily due to lower product margin rates, including increased promotions, lower services margin rates, driven by the incremental customer benefits and associated costs from our best buy totaltech membership offering compared to our previous total tech support offer, and higher supply chain costs. these decreases were partially offset by higher profit-sharing revenue from our private label and co-branded credit card arrangement and an approximately $30 million profit-sharing benefit from our services plan portfolio.
our sg&a decreased in fiscal 2023, primarily due to lower short-term incentive compensation expense of approximately $455 million compared to the prior year and decreased store payroll expenses. we were below the required thresholds for most short-term incentive compensation performance metrics in the current year while lapping short-term incentive amounts near maximum levels in the prior year.
the restructuring charges incurred in fiscal 2023 primarily related to employee termination benefits related to an enterprise-wide restructuring initiative that commenced in the second quarter of fiscal 2023 to better align our spending with critical strategies and operations, as well as optimize our cost structure. refer to note 3, restructuring, of the notes to consolidated financial statements, included in item 8, financial statements and supplementary data, of this annual report on form 10-k for additional information.
our operating income rate decreased in fiscal 2023, primarily driven by the unfavorable gross profit rate described above and decreased leverage from lower sales volume on our fixed expenses, which resulted in an unfavorable sg&a rate.

(2)represents a price-fixing litigation settlement received in relation to products purchased and sold in prior fiscal years.
(3)represents charges associated with acquisitions, including: (1) the non-cash amortization of definite-lived intangible assets, including customer relationships, tradenames and developed technology; and (2) acquisition-related transaction and due diligence costs, primarily comprised of professional fees.
(4)represents restructuring charges, including: (1) charges in fiscal 2023 associated with an enterprise-wide initiative to better align our spending with critical strategies and operations, as well as to optimize our cost structure; and (2) charges in fiscal 2021 and subsequent adjustments in fiscal 2022 associated with actions taken in the domestic segment to better align the company's organizational structure with its strategic focus and the exit from operations in mexico in the international segment.
(5)represents an increase in the fair value of a minority equity investment in fiscal 2021.
(6)the non-gaap adjustments primarily relate to the u.s., canada and mexico. as such, the income tax charge is calculated using the statutory tax rate of 24.5% for the u.s. and 26.4% for canada applied to the non-gaap adjustments of each country. there is no income tax charge for mexico non-gaap items and a minimal amount of u.s. non-gaap items, as there was no tax benefit recognized on these expenses in the calculation of gaap income tax expense.
our non-gaap operating income rate decreased in fiscal 2023, primarily driven by our domestic segment's lower gross profit rate and decreased leverage from lower sales volume on our fixed expenses, which resulted in an unfavorable sg&a rate.
our non-gaap effective tax rate increased in fiscal 2023, primarily due to reduced tax benefits from the resolution of tax matters, stock-based compensation and federal tax credits, partially offset by the impact of lower pre-tax earnings.
our non-gaap diluted eps decreased in fiscal 2023, primarily driven by the decrease in non-gaap operating income, partially offset by lower diluted weighted-average common shares outstanding from share repurchases.
liquidity and capital resources we closely manage our liquidity and capital resources. our liquidity requirements depend on key variables, including the level of investment required to support our business strategies, the performance of our business, capital expenditures, dividends, credit facilities, short-term borrowing arrangements and working capital management. we modify our approach to managing these variables as changes in our operating environment arise. for example, capital expenditures and share repurchases are a component of our cash flow and capital management strategy, which, to a large extent, we can adjust in response to economic and other changes in our business environment. we have a disciplined approach to capital allocation, which focuses on investing in key priorities that support our strategy.

the decrease in cash and cash equivalents in fiscal 2023 was primarily driven by share repurchases, capital expenditures and dividend payments. these decreases were partially offset by positive cash flows from operations, primarily driven by earnings.
our cash deposits held at financial institutions may exceed the amount of insurance provided on such deposits. generally, these deposits may be redeemed upon demand and are maintained with financial institutions with reputable credit. we limit exposure relating to financial instruments by diversifying the financial instruments among various counterparties, which consist primarily of major financial institutions.
cash flows cash flows were as follows ($ in millions):

operating activities the decrease in cash provided by operating activities in fiscal 2023 was primarily due to lower earnings and higher incentive compensation payments in the current year as a result of strong fiscal 2022 results, partially offset by the timing and volume of inventory purchases and payments.
investing activities the decrease in cash used in investing activities in fiscal 2023 was primarily driven by the acquisitions of current health and yardbird in fiscal 2022 and a decrease in purchases of investments, partially offset by an increase in capital spending for initiatives to support our business.
financing activities the decrease in cash used in financing activities in fiscal 2023 was primarily driven by lower share repurchases.
sources of liquidity funds generated by operating activities, available cash and cash equivalents, our credit facilities and other debt arrangements are our most significant sources of liquidity. we believe our sources of liquidity will be sufficient to fund operations and anticipated capital expenditures, share repurchases, dividends and strategic initiatives, including business combinations. however, in the event our liquidity is insufficient, we may be required to limit our spending. there can be no assurance that we will continue to generate cash flows at or above current levels or that we will be able to maintain our ability to borrow under our existing credit facilities or obtain additional financing, if necessary, on favorable terms.
we have a $1.25 billion five-year senior unsecured revolving credit facility agreement (the "five-year facility agreement") with a syndicate of banks. the five-year facility agreement permits borrowings of up to $1.25 billion and expires in may 2026. there were no borrowings outstanding under the five-year facility agreement as of january 28, 2023, or january 29, 2022.
our ability to continue to access the five-year facility agreement is subject to our compliance with its terms and conditions, including financial covenants. the financial covenants require us to maintain certain financial ratios. as of january 28, 2023, we were in compliance with all financial covenants. if an event of default were to occur with respect to any of our other debt, it would likely constitute an event of default under the five-year facility agreement as well.
our credit ratings and outlook as of march 15, 2023, remained unchanged from those disclosed in our annual report on form 10-k for the fiscal year ended january 29, 2022, and are summarized below.
rating agency           rating   outlook standard &amp; poor's   bbb+     stable moody's                 a3       stable credit rating agencies review their ratings periodically, and, therefore, the credit rating assigned to us by each agency may be subject to revision at any time. factors that can affect our credit ratings include changes in our operating performance, the economic environment, conditions in the retail and consumer electronics industries, our financial position and changes in our business strategy. if changes in our credit ratings were to occur, they could impact, among other things, interest costs for certain of our credit facilities, our future borrowing costs, access to capital markets, vendor financing terms and future new-store leasing costs.
restricted cash our liquidity is also affected by restricted cash balances that are primarily restricted to cover product protection plans provided under our best buy totaltech membership offering and other self-insurance liabilities. restricted cash, which is included in other current assets on our consolidated balance sheets, was $379 million and $269 million as of january 28, 2023, and january 29, 2022, respectively. the increase in restricted cash was primarily due to our best buy totaltech membership offering and growth in the membership base, partially offset by a decrease in restricted cash for other self-insurance liabilities.
capital expenditures capital expenditures were as follows ($ in millions):
2023                                                  2022              2021

(1)store-related projects are primarily comprised of store remodels and various merchandising projects.
(2)total capital expenditures exclude non-cash capital expenditures of $35 million, $46 million and $32 million in fiscal 2023, fiscal 2022 and fiscal 2021, respectively. non-cash capital expenditures are comprised of additions to property and equipment included in accounts payable, as well as finance leases.
we currently expect capital expenditures to approximate $850 million in fiscal 2024.
debt and capital as of january 28, 2023, we had $500 million of principal amount of notes due october 1, 2028 ("2028 notes") and $650 million of principal amount of notes due october 1, 2030 ("2030 notes"). refer to note 8, debt, in the notes to consolidated financial statements, included in item 8, financial statements and supplementary data, of this annual report on form 10-k for further information about our outstanding debt.
share repurchases and dividends we repurchase our common stock and pay dividends pursuant to programs approved by our board. the payment of cash dividends is also subject to customary legal and contractual restrictions. our long-term capital allocation strategy is to first fund operations and investments in growth and then return excess cash over time to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases while maintaining investment-grade credit metrics. our share repurchase plans are evaluated on an ongoing basis, considering factors such as our financial condition and cash flows, our economic outlook, the impact of tax laws, our liquidity needs, and the health and stability of global credit markets. the timing and amount of future repurchases may vary depending on such factors.
on february 28, 2022, our board approved a new $5.0 billion share repurchase program, which replaced the $5.0 billion share repurchase program authorized on february 16, 2021. there is no expiration date governing the period over which we can repurchase shares under this authorization.
share repurchase and dividend activity were as follows ($ and shares in millions, except per share amounts):
2023                                                         2022                2021

the total cost of shares repurchased decreased in fiscal 2023 from decreases in the volume of repurchases and the average price per share.‎
cash dividends declared and paid increased in fiscal 2023, primarily due to an increase in the regular quarterly cash dividend per share. on march 2, 2023, we announced the board's approval of a 5% increase in the regular quarterly dividend to $0.92 per share.
other financial measures our current ratio, calculated as current assets divided by current liabilities, remained unchanged at 1.0 as of january 28, 2023, and january 29, 2022. our debt to earnings ratio, calculated as total debt (including current portion) divided by net earnings increased to 0.8 as of january 28, 2023, compared to 0.5 at january 29, 2022, primarily due to lower net earnings.
off-balance-sheet arrangements and contractual obligations we do not have outstanding off-balance-sheet arrangements. contractual obligations as of january 28, 2023, were as follows ($ in millions):

for additional information regarding the nature of contractual obligations discussed below, refer to note 6, derivative instruments; note 7, leases; note 8, debt; and note 13, contingencies and commitments, of the notes to consolidated financial statements, included in item 8, financial statements and supplementary data, of this annual report on form 10-k.
(1)purchase obligations include agreements to purchase goods or services that are enforceable, are legally binding and specify all significant terms, including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed, minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction. purchase obligations do not include agreements that are cancelable without penalty. additionally, although they do not contain legally binding purchase commitments, we included open purchase orders in the table above. substantially all open purchase orders are fulfilled within 30 days.
(2)lease obligations exclude $63 million of legally binding fixed costs for leases signed but not yet commenced.
(3)operating lease obligations exclude payments to landlords covering real estate taxes and common area maintenance. these charges, if included, would increase total operating lease obligations by $0.7 billion as of january 28, 2023.
(4)represents principal amounts only and excludes interest rate swap valuation adjustments related to our long-term debt obligations.
(5)interest payments related to our 2028 notes and 2030 notes include the variable interest rate payments included in our interest rate swaps.
additionally, we have $1.25 billion in undrawn capacity on our five-year facility agreement as of january 28, 2023, which, if drawn upon, would be included in either short-term or long-term debt on our consolidated balance sheets.
critical accounting estimates the preparation of our financial statements requires us to make assumptions and estimates about future events and apply judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, expenses and the related disclosures. we base our assumptions, estimates and judgments on historical experience, current trends and other factors believed to be relevant at the time our consolidated financial statements are prepared. because future events and their effects cannot be determined with certainty, actual results could differ from our assumptions and estimates, and such differences could be material.
our significant accounting policies are discussed in note 1, summary of significant accounting policies, of the notes to consolidated financial statements, included in item 8, financial statements and supplementary data, of this annual report on form 10-k. we have not made any material changes to our accounting policies or methodologies during the past three fiscal years. we believe that the following accounting estimates are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results. these estimates require our most difficult, subjective or complex judgments and generally incorporate significant uncertainty.
vendor allowances description we receive funds from our merchandise vendors through a variety of programs and arrangements, primarily in the form of purchases-based or sales-based volumes and for product advertising and placement. we recognize allowances based on purchases and sales as a reduction of cost of sales when the associated inventory is sold. allowances for advertising and placement are recognized as a reduction of cost of sales ratably over the corresponding performance period. funds that are determined to be a reimbursement of specific, incremental and identifiable costs incurred to sell a vendor's products are recorded as an offset to the related expense within sg&a when incurred.
judgments and uncertainties involved in the estimate due to the quantity and diverse nature of our vendor agreements, estimates are made to determine the amount of funding to be recognized in earnings or deferred as an offset to inventory. these estimates require a detailed analysis of complex factors, including (1) proper classification of the type of funding received; and (2) the methodology to estimate the portion of purchases-based funding that should be recognized in cost of sales in each period, which considers factors such as inventory turn by product category and actual sell-through of inventory.
effect if actual results differ from assumptions a 10% change in our vendor funding deferral as of january 28, 2023, would have affected net earnings by approximately $45 million in fiscal 2023. the level of vendor funding deferral has remained relatively stable over the last three fiscal years.
goodwill description goodwill is evaluated for impairment annually in the fiscal fourth quarter or whenever events or circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. the impairment test involves a comparison of the fair value of each reporting unit with its carrying value. fair value reflects our estimate of the price a potential market participant would be willing to pay for the reporting unit in an arms-length transaction.
we have goodwill in two reporting units - best buy domestic (comprising our core u.s. best buy business) and best buy health - with carrying values of $492 million and $891 million, respectively, as of january 28, 2023.
judgments and uncertainties involved in the estimate determining the fair value of a reporting unit requires complex analysis and judgment. we use a combination of discounted cash flow ("dcf") models and market data, such as earnings multiples and quoted market prices, for observable comparable companies. dcf models require detailed forecasts of cash flow drivers, such as revenue growth rates, margin rates and capital investments, and estimates of weighted-average cost of capital rates. these estimates incorporate many uncertain factors, such as the effectiveness of our strategy, changes in customer behavior, technological changes, competitor actions, regulatory changes and macroeconomic trends.
effects if actual results differ from assumptions for our best buy domestic reporting unit, fair value exceeded book value by a substantial margin in fiscal 2023 and fiscal 2022. compared to fiscal 2022, the excess of fair value over book value in fiscal 2023 decreased approximately in line with the decline in best buy's market capitalization over the same period, reflecting the macroeconomic factors that affected our fiscal year 2023 performance and our expectations for the future. barring a fundamental, material further deterioration of these factors, we believe the risk of future goodwill impairment within our best buy domestic reporting unit is remote.
our best buy health reporting unit is subject to a greater level of uncertainty, since it operates in a less mature, rapidly-changing and high-growth environment. in both fiscal 2023 and fiscal 2022, the excess of fair value over book value for this reporting unit was substantial. in fiscal 2023, the excess decreased more significantly than our best buy domestic reporting unit, primarily due to the effects of macroeconomic factors, driving, for example, lower forecasted revenue growth rates in some categories and higher estimates of weighted-average cost of capital rates. the risk of further deterioration in these factors, along with the more uncertain environment in which best buy health operates, cause the likelihood of goodwill impairment for our best buy health reporting unit to be higher than for our best buy domestic reporting unit.
inventory markdown description our merchandise inventories were $5.1 billion as of january 28, 2023. we value our inventory at the lower of cost or net realizable value through the establishment of inventory markdown adjustments. markdown adjustments reflect the excess of cost over the net recovery we expect to realize from the ultimate sale or other disposal of inventory and establish a new cost basis. no adjustment is recorded for inventory that we expect to return to our vendors for full credit.
judgments and uncertainties involved in the estimate markdown adjustments involve uncertainty because the calculations require management to make assumptions and to apply judgment about the expected revenue and incremental costs we will generate for current inventory. such estimates include the evaluation of historical recovery rates, as well as factors such as product type and condition, forecasted consumer demand, product lifecycles, promotional environment, vendor return rights and the expected sales channel of ultimate disposition. we also apply judgment in the assumptions about other components of net realizable value, such as vendor allowances and selling costs.
effect if actual results differ from assumptions a 10% change in our markdown adjustment as of january 28, 2023, would have affected net earnings by approximately $14 million in fiscal 2023. the level of markdown adjustments has remained relatively stable over the last three fiscal years.
tax contingencies description our income tax returns are routinely examined by domestic and foreign tax authorities. taxing authorities audit our tax filing positions, including the timing and amount of income and deductions and the allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions. at any one time, multiple tax years are subject to audit by the various taxing authorities. in evaluating the exposures associated with our various tax filing positions, we may record a liability for such exposures. a number of years may elapse before a particular matter, for which we have established a liability, is audited and fully resolved or clarified. we adjust our liability for unrecognized tax benefits and income tax provisions in the period in which an uncertain tax position is effectively settled, the statute of limitations expires for the relevant taxing authority to examine the tax position or when more information becomes available. our effective income tax rate is also affected by changes in tax law, the tax jurisdiction of new stores or business ventures, the level of earnings and the results of tax audits.
judgments and uncertainties involved in the estimate our liability for unrecognized tax benefits contains uncertainties because management is required to make assumptions and apply judgment to estimate the exposures associated with our various tax filing positions. such assumptions can include complex and uncertain external factors, such as changes in tax law, interpretations of tax law and the timing of such changes, and uncertain internal factors such as taxable earnings by jurisdiction, the magnitude and timing of certain transactions and capital spending.
effect if actual results differ from assumptions although we believe that the judgments and estimates discussed herein are reasonable, actual results could differ, and we may be exposed to losses or gains that could be material. to the extent we prevail in matters for which a liability has been established or are required to pay amounts in excess of our established liability, our effective income tax rate in a given financial statement period could be materially affected. an unfavorable tax settlement generally would require use of our cash and may result in an increase in our effective income tax rate in the period of resolution. a favorable tax settlement may reduce our effective income tax rate in the period of resolution. see note 11, income taxes, of the notes to consolidated financial statements, included in item 8, financial statements and supplementary data, of this annual report on form 10-k for additional information.
service revenue description we sell membership plans that include access to benefits such as technical support, delivery and installation, price discounts on certain products and services, product protection plans and anti-virus software. we allocate the transaction price to all performance obligations identified in the contract based on their relative fair value. for performance obligations provided over the term of the contract, we typically recognize revenue on a usage basis, an input method of measuring progress over the related contract term. this method involves the estimation of expected usage patterns, primarily derived from historical information.
judgments and uncertainties involved in the estimate there is judgment in (1) measuring the relative standalone selling price for bundled performance obligations; and (2) assessing the appropriate recognition and methodology for each performance obligation, and for those based on usage, estimating the expected pattern of consumption across a large portfolio of customers. when insufficient reliable and relevant history is available to estimate usage, we generally recognize revenue ratably over the life of the contract until such history has accumulated.
effect if actual results differ from assumptions a 10% change in the amount of services membership deferred revenue as of january 28, 2023, would have affected net earnings by approximately $40 million in fiscal 2023. the amount of services membership deferred revenue has increased over the last three fiscal years, primarily driven by the national launch of our best buy totaltech membership offering, which resulted in higher membership sales and the initial deferral of more revenue than under the previous total tech support offer.
new accounting pronouncements we do not expect any recently issued accounting pronouncements to have a material effect on our financial statements.

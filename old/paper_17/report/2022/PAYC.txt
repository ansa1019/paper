"us," "our" and the "company" refer to paycom software, inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries. all amounts presented in tables, other than per share amounts, are in thousands unless otherwise noted.
overview we are a leading provider of a comprehensive, cloud-based human capital management ("hcm") solution delivered as software-as-a-service. we provide functionality and data analytics that businesses need to manage the complete employment lifecycle, from recruitment to retirement. our solution requires virtually no customization and is based on a core system of record maintained in a single database for all hcm functions, including talent acquisition, time and labor management, payroll, talent management and human resources management applications. our user-
friendly software allows for easy adoption of our solution by employees, enabling self-management of their hcm activities in the cloud, which reduces the administrative burden on employers and increases employee productivity.
we generate revenues from (i) fixed amounts charged per billing period plus a fee per employee or transaction processed and (ii) fixed amounts charged per billing period. we do not require clients to enter into long-term contractual commitments with us. our billing period varies by client based on when each client pays its employees, which may be weekly, bi-weekly, semi-monthly or monthly. we serve a diverse client base in terms of size and industry. none of our clients constituted more than one-half of one percent of our revenues for the year ended december 31, 2022. our revenues are primarily generated through our sales force that solicits new clients and our client relations representatives, ("crrs") who sell new applications to existing clients.
our continued growth depends on attracting new clients through further penetration of our existing markets and geographic expansion into new markets, targeting a high degree of client employee usage across our solution, and introducing new applications to our existing client base. we believe our ability to continue to develop new applications and to improve existing applications will enable us to increase revenues in the future, and the number of our new applications adopted by our clients has been a significant factor in our revenue growth. in january
2022, we added new sales teams in las vegas, jacksonville, new england and south jersey, bringing our total to 55
sales teams (including one team consisting of crrs and inside sales representatives) located in 28 states. we plan to open additional sales offices in the future to further expand our market presence.
our principal marketing efforts include national and local advertising campaigns, email campaigns, social and digital media campaigns, search engine marketing methods, tradeshows, print advertising and outbound marketing including personalized direct mail campaigns. in addition, we generate leads and build recognition of our brand and thought leadership with relevant and informative content, such as white papers, blogs, podcast episodes and webinars.
throughout our history, we have built strong relationships with our clients. as the hcm needs of our clients evolve, we believe that we are well-positioned to expand the hcm spending of our clients and we believe this opportunity is significant. to be successful, we must continue to demonstrate the operational and economic benefits of our solution, as well as effectively hire, train, motivate and retain qualified personnel.
growth outlook, opportunities and challenges as a result of our significant revenue growth and geographic expansion, we are presented with a variety of opportunities and challenges. our payroll application is the foundation of our solution and all of our clients are required to utilize this application in order to access our other applications. consequently, we have historically generated the majority of our revenues from our payroll applications, although our revenue mix has evolved and will continue to evolve as we develop and add new non-payroll applications to our solution. we believe our strategy of focusing on increased employee usage is key to long-term client satisfaction and client retention. client adoption of new applications and client employee usage of both new and existing applications have been significant factors in our revenue growth, and we expect the continuation of this trajectory will depend, in part, on the introduction of applications to our existing client base that encourage and promote more employee usage. for example, in 2021, we launched our industry-first beti technology, which further automates and streamlines the payroll process by empowering employees to do their own payroll. moreover, in order to increase revenues and continue to improve our operating results, we must also attract new clients. we intend to
34
obtain new clients by (i) continuing to leverage our sales force productivity within markets where we currently have existing sales offices, (ii) expanding our presence in metropolitan areas where we currently have an existing sales office through adding sales teams or offices, thereby increasing the number of sales professionals within such markets, and (iii) opening sales offices in new metropolitan areas.
our target client size range is 50 to 10,000 employees. while we continue to serve a diversified client base ranging in size from one employee to many thousands of employees, the average size of our clients has grown significantly as we have organically grown our operations, increased the number of applications we offer and gained traction with larger companies. we believe larger employers represent a substantial opportunity to increase our revenues per client, with limited incremental cost to us. because we charge our clients on a per employee basis for certain services we provide, any increase or decrease in the number of employees of our clients will have a positive or negative impact, respectively, on our results of operations. generally, we expect that changes in certain factors affecting our performance will correlate with improvement or deterioration in the labor market.
based on our total revenues, we have grown at a 25% compound annual growth rate from january 1, 2019 through december 31, 2022. growing our business has resulted in, and will continue to result in, substantial investments in sales professionals, operating expenses, system development and programming costs and general and administrative expenses, which have increased and will continue to increase our expenses. specifically, our revenue growth and geographic expansion drive increases in our employee headcount, which in turn precipitates increases in (i)
salaries and benefits, (ii) stock-based compensation expense and (iii) facility costs related to the expansion of our corporate headquarters and operations facilities and additional sales office leases.
we believe the challenges of managing the ever-changing complexity of payroll and human resources will continue to drive companies to turn to outsourced providers for help with their hcm needs. the hcm industry historically has been driven, in part, by legislation and regulatory action, including cobra, changes to the minimum wage laws or overtime rules, and legislation from federal, state or municipal taxation authorities. the implementation of the affordable care act (the "aca") is an example of legislation that has created demand in the hcm industry. we generate aca-related revenues (i) on an annual basis in connection with processing and filing forms 1094 and 1095
on behalf of clients and (ii) from clients who have purchased our enhanced aca application as part of the fixed, bundled price charged per billing period. while we generally do not track our revenues on an application-by-
application basis (because applications are often sold in various groupings and configurations for a single price), we estimate that, if the aca is not modified or repealed, revenues from our enhanced aca application and aca forms filings business will represent approximately 2% of total projected revenues for the year ending december 31, 2023.
for each of the years ended december 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, our gross margin was approximately 85%. although our gross margin may fluctuate from quarter to quarter due to seasonality and hiring trends, we expect that our gross margin will remain relatively consistent in future periods.
key metrics in addition to the u.s. gaap and non-gaap metrics discussed elsewhere in this form 10-k, we also monitor the following metrics to evaluate our business, measure our performance and identify trends affecting our business:

clients. when we calculate the number of clients at period end, we treat client accounts with separate taxpayer identification numbers (or, in certain circumstances, separate client codes) as separate clients, which often separates client accounts that are affiliated with the same parent organization. we track the number of our clients to provide an accurate gauge of the size of our business. unless we state otherwise or the context otherwise requires, references to clients throughout this form 10-k refer to this metric.
clients (based on parent company grouping). when we calculate the number of clients based on parent company grouping at period end, we combine client accounts that have identified the same person(s) as their decision-maker regardless of whether the client accounts have separate taxpayer identification numbers (or, in certain circumstances, separate client codes), which often combines client accounts that are affiliated with the same parent organization. we track the number of our clients based on parent company grouping to provide an alternate measure of the size of our business and clients.
35
sales teams . we monitor our sales professionals by the number of sales teams at period end. crrs and inside sales representatives are counted as one sales team. each outside sales team consists of a sales manager and approximately six to eight sales professionals. certain larger metropolitan areas can support more than one sales team. we believe the number of sales teams is an indicator of potential revenues for future periods.
annual revenue retention rate . our annual revenue retention rate tracks the percentage of revenues that we retain from our existing clients. we monitor this metric because it is an indicator of client satisfaction and revenues for future periods.
components of results of operations sources of revenues revenues are comprised of recurring revenues, and implementation and other revenues. we expect our revenues to increase as we introduce new applications, expand our client base and renew and expand relationships with existing clients. as a percentage of total revenues, we expect our mix of recurring revenues, and implementation and other revenues to remain relatively constant.
recurring revenues recurring revenues include fees for our talent acquisition, time and labor management, payroll, talent management and hr management applications as well as fees charged for form filings and delivery of client payroll checks and reports. these revenues are derived from (i) fixed amounts charged per billing period plus a fee per employee or transaction processed or (ii) fixed amounts charged per billing period. we do not require clients to enter into long-term contractual commitments with us. our billing period varies by client based on when each client pays its employees, which may be weekly, bi-weekly, semi-monthly or monthly. because recurring revenues are based, in part, on fees for use of our applications and the delivery of checks and reports that are levied on a per-employee basis, our recurring revenues increase as our clients hire more employees. recurring revenues are recognized in the period services are rendered.
recurring revenues include revenues relating to the annual processing of payroll tax filing forms, such as form w-2
and form 1099, and revenues from processing unscheduled payroll runs (such as bonuses) for our clients. these payroll forms are typically processed in the first quarter of the year and many of our clients are subject to aca form filing requirements in the first quarter, which positively impacts first quarter revenues and margins. we anticipate our revenues will continue to exhibit this seasonal pattern related to aca form filings for so long as the aca (or replacement legislation) includes employer reporting requirements. in addition, our recurring revenues during the fourth quarter are positively impacted by unscheduled payroll runs for our clients that occur before the end of the year. nonetheless, we expect the magnitude of these seasonal fluctuations in our revenues to decrease to the extent clients utilize more of our non-payroll applications.
recurring revenues also include interest earned on funds held for clients. we collect funds from clients in advance of either the applicable due date for payroll tax submissions or the applicable disbursement date for employee payment services. these collections from clients are typically disbursed from one to 30 days after receipt, with some funds being held for up to 120 days. we typically invest funds held for clients in money market funds, demand deposit accounts, commercial paper and certificates of deposit until they are paid to the applicable tax or regulatory agencies or to client employees. we expect interest earned on funds held for clients will increase as we introduce new applications, expand our client base and renew and expand relationships with existing clients. the amount of interest we earn from the investment of client funds is also impacted by changes in interest rates.
implementation and other revenues implementation and other revenues are comprised of implementation fees for the deployment of our solution and other revenues from sales of time clocks as part of our time and attendance services. non-refundable implementation fees are charged to new clients at inception and upon the addition of certain incremental applications for existing clients. these fees generally range from 10% to 30% of the annualized value of the transaction. implementation revenues are recognized as deferred revenue and amortized into income over the life of the client, which is estimated to be ten years, and other revenues are recognized upon shipment of time clocks. implementation and other revenues comprised approximately 1.7% and 1.8% of our total revenues for the years ended december 31, 2022 and
2021, respectively.
cost of revenues cost of revenues consists of expenses related to hosting and supporting our applications, hardware costs, systems support and technology and depreciation and amortization. these costs include employee-related expenses (including non-cash stock-based compensation expenses) and other expenses related to client support, bank charges for processing ach transactions, certain implementation expenses, delivery charges and paper costs. they also include our cost for time clocks sold and ongoing technology and support costs related to our systems. the amount of depreciation and amortization of property and equipment allocated to cost of revenues is determined based upon an estimate of assets used to support our operations.
36
administrative expenses administrative expenses consist of sales and marketing, research and development, general and administrative and depreciation and amortization. sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of employee-related expenses for our direct sales and marketing staff (such as the amortization of commissions and bonuses and non-cash stock-based compensation expenses), marketing expenses and other related costs. based on positive results from our advertising campaigns, we plan to continue to invest in our marketing program and may adjust spending levels in future periods as we see opportunities for favorable returns on our investments. research and development expenses consist primarily of employee-related expenses (including non-cash stock-based compensation expenses) for our development staff, net of capitalized software costs for internally developed software. we expect to grow our research and development efforts as we continue to broaden our payroll and hr solution offerings and extend our technological solutions by investing in the development of new applications and enhancements for existing applications. general and administrative expenses consist of employee-related expenses for finance and accounting, legal, human resources and management information systems personnel (including non-cash stock-based compensation expenses), legal costs, professional fees and other corporate expenses. depreciation and amortization expenses consist of (i) the amount of depreciation and amortization of property and equipment allocated to administrative expenses (based upon an estimate of assets used to support our selling, general and administrative functions) and (ii) amortization of intangible assets.
interest expense interest expense includes interest on our debt and settlements related to an interest rate swap prior to the termination of the interest rate swap agreement on august 24, 2022. we capitalize interest incurred for indebtedness related to construction in progress.
other income (expense), net other income (expense), net includes interest earned on our own funds, any gain or loss on the sale or disposal of fixed assets, costs associated with the early repayment of debt, and the realized gain which resulted from the settlement of our interest rate swap agreement.
provision for income taxes our consolidated financial statements include a provision for income taxes incurred for the anticipated tax consequences of the reported results of operations using the asset and liability method. under this method, we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax basis of assets and liabilities, as well as for any operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the tax rates expected to apply to taxable income for the years in which those tax assets and liabilities are expected to be realized or settled. we recognize a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the net amount we believe is more likely than not to be realized.

revenues the increase in total revenues for the year ended december 31, 2022 from the year ended december 31, 2021 was primarily the result of the addition of new clients and productivity and efficiency gains in mature sales offices, which are offices that have been open for at least 24 months, and the sale of additional applications to our existing clients. in addition, our tax forms filing business in the first quarter of 2022 contributed to the increase in total revenues for the year ended december 31, 2022 as compared to the year ended december 31, 2021.
because we charge our clients on a per-employee basis for certain services we provide, the drivers of revenue for the year ended december 31, 2022 described above were impacted by the headcount fluctuations within our client base. additionally, rising interest rates and a higher average funds held for clients balance during year ended december 31, 2022 as compared to the year ended december 31, 2021, resulted in increased interest earned on funds held for clients, which had a positive impact on recurring revenue.
the increase in implementation and other revenues for the year ended december 31, 2022 from the year ended december
31, 2021 was primarily the result of the increased non-refundable upfront conversion fees collected from the addition of new clients. these fees are deferred and recognized ratably over the ten-year estimated life of our clients.
expenses cost of revenues during the year ended december 31, 2022, operating expenses increased from the prior year by $39.3 million primarily due to a $33.2 million increase in employee-related expenses attributable to growth in the number of operating personnel, a $3.6 million increase in shipping and supplies fees, and a $2.2 million increase in automated clearing house fees in connection with the increase in revenues. depreciation and amortization expense increased $11.5 million, or 37%, primarily due to the development of additional technology and purchases of other related fixed assets.
administrative expenses sales and marketing during the year ended december 31, 2022, sales and marketing expenses increased from the prior year by $70.6
million due to a $54.8 million increase in employee-related expenses, including commissions and bonuses, and a
$15.8 million increase in marketing and advertising expense attributable to increased spending across many components of our marketing program. based on positive results from our advertising campaigns, we plan to continue to make significant investments in our marketing program and may adjust spending levels in future periods as we see opportunities for returns on our investments.
research and development during the year ended december 31, 2022, research and development expenses increased $29.9 million from the prior year primarily due to an increase in employee-related expenses.
as we continue the ongoing development of our platform and product offerings, we generally expect research and development expenses (exclusive of stock-based compensation) to continue to increase, particularly as we hire more personnel to support our growth. while we expect this trend to continue on an absolute dollar basis and as a percentage of total revenues, we also anticipate the rate of increase to decline over time as we leverage our growth and realize additional economies of scale. as is customary for our business, we also expect fluctuations in research and development expense as a percentage of revenue on a quarter-to-quarter basis due to seasonal revenue trends, the introduction of new products, the amount and timing of research and development costs that may be capitalized and the timing of onboarding new hires and restricted stock vesting events.
expenditures for software developed or obtained for internal use are capitalized and amortized over a three-year period on a straight-line basis. the nature of the development projects underway during a particular period directly impacts the timing and extent of these capitalized expenditures and can affect the amount of research and development expenses in such period. the table below sets forth the amounts of capitalized and expensed research and development costs for the years ended december 31, 2022 and 2021:

general and administrative during the year ended december 31, 2022, general and administrative expenses increased by $29.3 million from the prior year due to a $40.4 million increase in employee-related expenses, which was partially offset by a $11.1
million decrease in non-cash stock-based compensation expense.

expense depreciation and amortization during the year ended december 31, 2022, depreciation and amortization expense increased from the prior year primarily due to the development of additional technology and purchases of other related fixed assets.
interest expense the increase in interest expense for the year ended december 31, 2022 was due to the timing and progress of construction of the expansion of our corporate headquarters and our expanded operations facility, which resulted in a lower capitalization rate of interest in 2022.
other income (expense), net the change in other income (expense), net for the year ended december 31, 2022 was primarily due to the realized gain which resulted from the settlement of our interest rate swap agreement, the settlement of an insurance matter and increased interest income.
provision for income taxes the provision for income taxes is based on a current estimate of the annual effective income tax rate adjusted to reflect the impact of discrete items. our effective income tax rate was 28% and 23% for the years ended december
31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.
liquidity and capital resources our principal sources of capital and liquidity are our operating cash flow and cash and cash equivalents. our cash and cash equivalents consist primarily of demand deposit accounts, money market funds and certificates of deposit.
additionally, we maintain a $650.0 million senior secured revolving credit facility (the "july 2022 revolving credit facility"), and a $750.0 million senior secured delayed draw term loan facility (the "july 2022 term loan facility"), which can be accessed as needed to supplement our operating cash flow and cash balances. as of december
31, 2022, we have $29.0 million of outstanding borrowings under the july 2022 revolving credit facility and no outstanding borrowings under the july 2022 term loan facility.
we have historically funded our operations from cash flows generated from operations, cash from the sale of equity securities and debt financing. although we have funded most of the costs for construction projects at our corporate headquarters and other facilities from available cash, we have incurred indebtedness for a portion of these costs.
we are funding the current building expansion at our oklahoma city headquarters from available cash. further, all purchases under our stock repurchase plans were paid for from available cash. we believe our existing cash and cash equivalents, cash generated from operations and available sources of liquidity will be sufficient to maintain operations, make necessary capital expenditures and opportunistically repurchase shares for at least the next 12
months. in addition, based on our strong profitability and continued growth, we expect to meet our longer-term liquidity needs with cash flows from operations and, as needed, financing arrangements.
interest rate swap agreement.in december 2017, we entered into a floating-to-fixed interest rate swap agreement
(the "interest rate swap agreement") to limit our exposure to interest rate risk related to the term loans used to finance construction projects at our corporate headquarters (the "2017 term loans"). the interest rate swap agreement, which had a maturity date of september 7, 2025, provided that we received quarterly variable interest payments based on the libor rate and paid interest at a fixed rate. we have elected not to designate this interest rate swap as a hedge and, as such, changes in the fair value of the derivative instrument are

recognized in our consolidated statements of comprehensive income. on august 24, 2022, we terminated the interest rate swap agreement by settling the contract. the settlement of the interest rate swap contract resulted in a cash receipt of $0.5 million. the realized gain from the settlement of the interest rate swap is included in other income (expense), net in the consolidated statements of comprehensive income.
may 2022 revolving credit agreement.on may 4, 2022, we entered into a credit agreement (the "may 2022 revolving credit agreement") with bank of america, n.a., as a lender, swingline lender and letters of credit issuer, the lenders from time to time party thereto, and bank of america, n.a., as the administrative agent, which provided for a senior secured revolving credit facility in the initial aggregate principal amount of up to $250.0 million and the ability to request an incremental facility of up to an additional $100.0 million, subject to obtaining additional lender commitments and certain approvals and satisfying certain other conditions (the "may 2022
facility"). the may 2022 facility included a $25.0 million sublimit for swingline loans and a $2.5 million sublimit for letters of credit. on may 4, 2022, we borrowed $29.0 million under the may 2022 facility to repay the 2017 term loans, along with accrued interest, expenses and fees. on june 7, 2022, the aggregate commitments under the may
2022 revolving credit agreement were increased from $250.0 million to $350.0 million. the may 2022 facility was scheduled to mature on may 4, 2027.
as discussed below, on july 29, 2022, we entered into the july 2022 credit agreement (as defined below) and borrowed $29.0 million to repay the outstanding indebtedness under the may 2022 facility along with accrued interest, expenses and fees. in connection with the repayment, the may 2022 revolving credit agreement was terminated on july 29, 2022.
july 2022 credit agreement.on july 29, 2022 (the "july 2022 facility closing date"), we entered into a new credit agreement (the "july 2022 credit agreement") with jpmorgan chase bank, n.a., as a lender, swingline lender and issuing bank, the lenders from time to time party thereto (collectively with jpmorgan chase bank, n.a., the "july
2022 lenders"), and jpmorgan chase bank, n.a., as the administrative agent.
the july 2022 credit agreement provides for the july 2022 revolving credit facility in the aggregate principal amount of up to $650.0 million, and the ability to request an incremental facility of up to an additional $500.0
million, subject to obtaining additional lender commitments and certain approvals and satisfying certain other conditions. the july 2022 credit agreement includes a $25.0 million sublimit for swingline loans and a $6.5 million sublimit for letters of credit. the july 2022 credit agreement also provides for the july 2022 term loan facility in the aggregate amount of up to $750.0 million. all loans under the july 2022 credit agreement will mature on july
29, 2027 (the "scheduled maturity date").
the borrowings under the july 2022 credit agreement will bear interest at a rate per annum equal to (i) the alternate base rate ("abr") plus an applicable margin ("abr loans") or (ii) (x) the term secured overnight financing rate ("sofr") plus 0.10% (the "adjusted term sofr rate") or (y) the daily sofr plus 0.10%, in each case plus an applicable margin ("sofr rate loans"). abr is calculated as the highest of (i) the rate of interest last quoted by the wall street journal in the united states as the prime rate in effect, (ii) the federal funds rate plus 0.5% and (iii) the adjusted term sofr rate for a one-month interest period plus 1.00%; provided that, if the abr as determined pursuant to the foregoing would be less than 1.00%, such rate shall be deemed to be 1.00%. the applicable margin for abr loans is (i) 0.25% if the company's consolidated leverage ratio is less than 1.0 to 1.0;
(ii) 0.50% if the company's consolidated leverage ratio is greater than or equal to 1.0 to 1.0 but less than 2.0 to
1.0; (iii) 0.75% if the company's consolidated leverage ratio is greater than or equal to 2.0 to 1.0 but less than
3.0 to 1.0; or (iv) 1.00% if the company's consolidated leverage ratio is greater than or equal to 3.0 to 1.0. the applicable margin for sofr rate loans is (i) 1.25% if the company's consolidated leverage ratio is less than 1.0 to
1.0; (ii) 1.5% if the company's consolidated leverage ratio is greater than or equal to 1.0 to 1.0 but less than
2.0 to 1.0; (iii) 1.75% if the company's consolidated leverage ratio is greater than or equal to 2.0 to 1.0 but less than 3.0 to 1.0; or (iv) 2.00% if the company's consolidated leverage ratio is greater than or equal to 3.0 to
1.0. we are required to pay a quarterly commitment fee on the daily amount of the undrawn portion of the revolving commitments under the july 2022 revolving credit facility and a quarterly ticking fee on the daily amount of the undrawn portion of the july 2022 term loan facility, in each case at a rate per annum of (i) 0.20% if the company's consolidated leverage ratio is less than 1.0 to 1.0; (ii) 0.225% if the company's consolidated leverage ratio is greater than or equal to 1.0 to 1.0 but less than 2.0 to 1.0; (iii) 0.25% if the company's consolidated leverage ratio is greater than or equal to 2.0 to 1.0 but less than 3.0 to 1.0; or (iv) 0.275% if the company's consolidated leverage ratio is greater than or equal to 3.0 to 1.0. we are also required to pay customary letter of credit fees upon drawing any letter of credit.
under the july 2022 credit agreement, we are required to maintain as of the end of each fiscal quarter a consolidated interest ratio of not less than 3.0 to 1.0 and a consolidated leverage ratio of not greater than 3.75
to 1.0, stepping down to 3.0 to 1.0 at intervals thereafter.
we may make up to ten draws under the july 2022 term loan facility at any time during the period from and after the july 2022 facility closing date through twelve months after the july 2022 facility closing date. loans under the july 2022 term loan facility will amortize in equal quarterly installments commencing with the first full fiscal quarter after the earlier of (x) the date on which the july 2022 term loan facility has been fully drawn and (y)
the expiration of the draw period, in an aggregate annual amount equal to 7.5% in year one (if applicable) and year two, and 10% thereafter.
40
on the july 2022 facility closing date, we borrowed $29.0 million under the july 2022 revolving credit facility to repay the outstanding indebtedness under the may 2022 facility, along with accrued interest, expenses and fees. the loan bears interest at the adjusted term sofr rate for the interest period in effect plus 1.25%. in connection with the repayment of the may 2022 facility, the may 2022 revolving credit agreement was terminated on july 29, 2022.
stock repurchase plan and withholding shares to cover taxes.in may 2016, our board of directors authorized a stock repurchase plan allowing for the repurchase of shares of our common stock in open market transactions at prevailing market prices, in privately negotiated transactions or by other means in accordance with federal securities laws, including rule 10b5-1 programs. since the initial authorization of the stock repurchase plan, our board of directors has amended and extended and authorized new stock repurchase plans from time to time. most recently, in august 2022, our board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to $1.1 billion of our common stock. as of december 31, 2022, there was $1.1 billion available for repurchases under our stock repurchase plan. our stock repurchase plan may be suspended or discontinued at any time. the actual timing, number and value of shares repurchased depends on a number of factors, including the market price of our common stock, general market and economic conditions, the shares withheld for taxes associated with the vesting of restricted stock and other corporate considerations. the current stock repurchase plan will expire on august 15, 2024.
during the year ended december 31, 2022, we repurchased an aggregate of 364,667 shares of common stock at an average cost of $273.74 per share, including 17,355 shares withheld to satisfy tax withholding obligations for certain employees upon the vesting of restricted stock. our payment of the taxes on behalf of those employees resulted in an aggregate cash expenditure of $5.2 million and, as such, we generally subtract the amounts attributable to such withheld shares from the aggregate amount available for future purchases under our stock repurchase plan.
cash flow analysis our cash flows from operating activities have historically been significantly impacted by profitability, implementation revenues received but deferred, our investment in sales and marketing to drive growth, and research and development. our ability to meet future liquidity needs will be driven by our operating performance and the extent of continued investment in our operations. failure to generate sufficient revenues and related cash flows could have a material adverse effect on our ability to meet our liquidity needs and achieve our business objectives.
as our business grows, we expect our capital expenditures and our investment activity to continue to increase. we are currently focused on the expansion of our corporate headquarters. capital expenditures related to this expansion began in the fourth quarter of 2021 and continued during 2022. we estimate that the cost of construction will be between $70 million and $75 million and we expect construction to be completed in the first half of 2024.
in addition, we purchased the naming rights to the downtown oklahoma city arena that is home to the oklahoma city thunder national basketball association franchise. under the terms of the naming rights agreement, we committed to make payments escalating annually from $4.0 million in 2021 to $6.1 million in 2035. the payments are due in the fourth quarter of each year. upon the conclusion of the initial term, the agreement may be extended upon the mutual agreement of both parties for an additional five-year period. depending on certain growth opportunities, we may choose to accelerate investments in sales and marketing, acquisitions, technology and services. actual future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including our future revenues, cash from operating activities and the level of expenditures in all areas of our business.
as part of our payroll and payroll tax filing services, we collect funds from our clients for federal, state and local employment taxes, which we remit to the appropriate tax agencies. we invest these funds in money market funds, demand deposit accounts, commercial paper and certificates of deposit from which we earn interest income during the period between their receipt and disbursement.
our cash flows from investing and financing activities are influenced by the amount of funds held for clients, which can vary significantly from quarter to quarter. the balance of the funds we hold depends on our clients'
payroll calendars, and therefore such balance changes from period to period in accordance with the timing of each payroll cycle.
our cash flows from financing activities are also affected by the extent to which we use available cash to purchase shares of common stock under our stock repurchase plan as well as restricted stock vesting events that result in net share settlements and the company paying withholding taxes on behalf of certain employees.

equivalents operating activities cash flows provided by operating activities for the year ended december 31, 2022 primarily consisted of payments received from our clients and interest earned on funds held for clients. cash used in operating activities primarily consisted of personnel-related expenditures to support the growth and infrastructure of our business.
these payments included costs of operations, advertising and other sales and marketing efforts, it infrastructure development, product research and development and security and administrative costs. compared to the year ended december 31, 2021, our operating cash flows for the year ended december 31, 2022 were positively impacted by the growth of our business.
investing activities cash flows used in investing activities for the year ended december 31, 2022 decreased from the prior year period due to a $130.1 million decrease in purchases of investments from funds held for clients, a $114.9 million increase in proceeds from investments from funds held for clients, and a $1.4 million decrease in purchases of intangible assets, which were partially offset by a $12.0 million increase in purchases of property and equipment.
financing activities cash flows provided by financing activities for the year ended december 31, 2022 increased from the prior year period primarily due to the impact of a $128.1 million change related to the client funds obligation, which is due to the timing of receipts from our clients and payments made to our clients' employees and applicable taxing authorities on their behalf, a $60.4 million decrease in withholding taxes paid related to net share settlements, and a $29.0 million increase in proceeds from the issuance of debt. the increase in cash flows provided by financing activities was partially offset by a $94.7 million increase in common stock repurchases, a $27.5 million increase payments on long-term debt, and a $6.4 million increase in payment of debt issuance costs.
contractual obligations our principal commitments primarily consist of long-term debt, leases for office space and the naming rights agreement. as discussed in "note 6. long-term debt, net" and elsewhere in this form 10-k, on may 4, 2022, we entered into the may 2022 revolving credit agreement, repaid the 2017 term loans and terminated the 2017 term credit agreement. on july 29, 2022, we entered into the july 2022 credit agreement and terminated the may 2022
revolving credit agreement. for additional information regarding our naming rights agreement, leases, long-term debt and our commitments and contingencies, see "note 4. goodwill and intangible assets, net", "note 5. leases",
"note 6. long-term debt, net" and "note 13. commitments and contingencies".
we plan to continue to lease additional office space to support our growth. in addition, many of our existing lease agreements provide us with the option to renew. when applicable, our future operating lease obligations include payments due during any renewal period provided for in the lease where the lease imposes a penalty for failure to renew. additional details on our leases, including the related future cash outflows, are included within "note 5.
leases" in the notes to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere within this form 10-k.
critical accounting policies and estimates our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes have been prepared in accordance with u.s. gaap. the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, costs and expenses, and related disclosures.
estimates made in accordance with u.s. gaap that involve a significant level of estimation uncertainty and have had or are reasonably likely to have a material impact on our financial condition are described below. on an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates and assumptions to ensure that management believes them to be reasonable under the then-current facts and circumstances. actual amounts and results may materially differ from these estimates made by management under different assumptions and conditions.
certain accounting policies that require significant management estimates, and are deemed critical to our results of operations or financial position, are described below. accordingly, these are the policies we believe are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our consolidated financial condition and results of operations.
42
revenue recognition revenues are recognized when control of the promised goods or services is transferred to our clients in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to be entitled to for those goods or services. substantially all of our revenues are comprised of revenue from contracts with clients. sales and other applicable taxes are excluded from revenues.
recurring revenues are derived primarily from our talent acquisition, time and labor management, payroll, talent management and hr management applications as well as fees charged for form filings and delivery of client payroll checks and reports. talent acquisition includes our applicant tracking, candidate tracker, enhanced background checks, onboarding, e-verify and tax credit services applications. time and labor management includes time and attendance, scheduling/schedule exchange, time-off requests, labor allocation, labor management reports/push reporting, geofencing/geotracking and microfence tools and applications. payroll includes beti, payroll and tax management, vault card, paycom pay, expense management, mileage tracker/favr, garnishment administration and gl concierge applications. talent management includes our employee self-service, compensation budgeting, performance management, position management, my analytics and paycom learning and content subscriptions applications. hr management includes our manager on-the-go, direct data exchange, ask here, documents and checklists, government and compliance, benefits administration/benefits to carrier, benefit enrollment service, cobra administration, personnel action forms and performance discussion forms, surveys, enhanced aca and clue applications.
the performance obligations related to recurring revenues are satisfied during each client's payroll period, with the agreed-upon fee being charged and collected as part of our processing of the client's payroll. recurring revenues are recognized at the conclusion of processing of each client's payroll period, when each respective payroll client is billed. collectability is reasonably assured as the fees are collected through an automated clearing house as part of the client's payroll cycle or through direct wire transfer, which minimizes the default risk.
the contract period for substantially all contracts associated with these revenues is one month due to the fact that both we and the client have the unilateral right to terminate a wholly unperformed contract without compensating the other party by providing 30 days' notice of termination. our payroll application is the foundation of our solution, and all of our clients are required to utilize this application in order to access our other applications. for clients who purchase multiple applications, due to the short-term nature of our contracts, we do not believe it is meaningful to separately assess and identify whether or not each application potentially represents its own, individual, performance obligation as the revenue generated from each application is recognized within the same month as the revenue from the core payroll application. similarly, we do not believe it is meaningful to individually determine the standalone selling price for each application. we consider the total price charged to a client in a given period to be indicative of the standalone selling price, as the total amount charged is within a reasonable range of prices typically charged for our goods and services for comparable classes of client groups.
implementation and other revenues consist of nonrefundable upfront conversion fees which are charged to new clients to offset the expense of new client set-up as well as revenues from the sale of time clocks as part of our employee time and attendance services. although these revenues are related to our recurring revenues, they represent distinct performance obligations.
implementation activities primarily represent administrative activities that allow us to fulfill future performance obligations for our clients and do not represent services transferred to the client. however, the nonrefundable upfront fee charged to our clients results in an implied performance obligation in the form of a material right to the client related to the client's option to renew at the end of each 30-day contract period. further, given that all other services within the contract are sold at a total price indicative of the standalone selling price, coupled with the fact that the upfront fees are consistent with upfront fees charged in similar contracts that we have with clients, the standalone selling price of the client's option to renew the contract approximates the dollar amount of the nonrefundable upfront fee. the nonrefundable upfront fee is typically included on the client's first invoice, and is deferred and recognized ratably over the estimated renewal period (i.e. ten-year estimated client life).
revenues from the sale of time clocks are recognized when control is transferred to the client upon delivery of the product. we estimate the standalone selling price for the time clocks by maximizing the use of observable inputs such as our specific pricing practices for time clocks.
goodwill and other intangible assets goodwill is not amortized, but we are required to test the carrying value of goodwill for impairment at least annually, or earlier if, at the reporting unit level, an indicator of impairment arises. our business is largely homogeneous and, as a result, goodwill is associated with one reporting unit. we have selected june 30 as our annual goodwill impairment testing date. a review of goodwill may be initiated before or after conducting the annual analysis if events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of goodwill may no longer be recoverable. the company performed a qualitative assessment to determine if it is more-likely-than-not that the fair value of the reporting units had declined below its carrying value. in the qualitative assessment, we consider the macroeconomic conditions, including any deterioration of general economic conditions, industry and market conditions, including any deterioration in the environment where the reporting unit operates, changes in the products/services and regulator and political developments; cost of doing business; overall financial performance;
other relevant reporting unit specific facts, such as changes in
43
management or key personnel or pending litigation. based on our assessment, there was no impairment recorded as of june 30, 2022. for the years ended december 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, there were no indicators of impairment.
intangible assets with definite lives are amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives.
impairment of long-lived assets long-lived assets, including intangible assets with finite lives, are reviewed for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset. if the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its estimated future cash flows, an impairment charge is recognized for the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the estimated fair value of the asset. we have determined that there is no impairment of long-lived assets for the years ended december 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020.
market-based restricted stock awards and performance-based restricted stock units we measure non-cash stock-based compensation expense based on the fair value of the award on the date of grant. we determine the fair value of stock awards and units issued by using a monte carlo simulation model. this model considers various subjective assumptions as inputs, and represent our best estimates, which involve inherent uncertainties and the application of our judgment as it relates to market volatilities, the historical volatility of our stock price, risk-free rates and expected life. the valuation model also incorporates exercise and forfeiture assumptions based on an analysis of historical data. determining these assumptions is subjective and complex, and therefore, a change in the assumptions utilized could impact the calculation of the fair value of our market-based stock awards and performance-based restricted stock units and the associated compensation expense.
refer to note 12 in the notes to our consolidated financial statements for further information regarding our stock-
based compensation awards.
recent accounting pronouncements refer to note 2 in the notes to the consolidated financial statements for a full description of recent accounting pronouncements.
non-gaap financial measures management uses adjusted ebitda and non-gaap net income as supplemental measures to review and assess the performance of our core business operations and for planning purposes. we define (i) adjusted ebitda as net income plus interest expense, taxes, depreciation and amortization, non-cash stock-based compensation expense, certain transaction expenses that are not core to our operations (if any) and the change in fair value of our interest rate swap and (ii) non-gaap net income as net income plus non-cash stock-based compensation expense, certain transaction expenses that are not core to our operations (if any) and the change in fair value of our interest rate swap, all of which are adjusted for the effect of income taxes. adjusted ebitda and non-gaap net income are metrics that provide investors with greater transparency to the information used by management in its financial and operational decision-making. we believe these metrics are useful to investors because they facilitate comparisons of our core business operations across periods on a consistent basis, as well as comparisons with the results of peer companies, many of which use similar non-gaap financial measures to supplement results under u.s. gaap. in addition, adjusted ebitda is a measure that provides useful information to management about the amount of cash available for reinvestment in our business, repurchasing common stock and other purposes. management believes that the non-gaap measures presented in this form 10-k, when viewed in combination with our results prepared in accordance with u.s. gaap, provide a more complete understanding of the factors and trends affecting our business and performance.
adjusted ebitda and non-gaap net income are not measures of financial performance under u.s. gaap, and should not be considered a substitute for net income, which we consider to be the most directly comparable u.s. gaap measure.
adjusted ebitda and non-gaap net income have limitations as analytical tools, and when assessing our operating performance, you should not consider adjusted ebitda or non-gaap net income in isolation, or as a substitute for net income or other consolidated statements of comprehensive income data prepared in accordance with u.s. gaap.
adjusted ebitda and non-gaap net income may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies and other companies may not calculate such measures in the same manner as we do.

item 7a. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate sensitivity we had cash and cash equivalents totaling $400.7 million as of december 31, 2022. these amounts are invested primarily in demand deposit accounts and money market funds. we consider all highly liquid debt instruments purchased with a maturity of three months or less and sec-registered money market mutual funds to be cash equivalents. the primary objectives of our investing activities are capital preservation, meeting our liquidity needs and, with respect to investing client funds, generating interest income while maintaining the safety of principal. we do not enter into investments for trading or speculative purposes.
our cash equivalents are subject to market risk due to changes in interest rates. the market value of fixed rate securities may be adversely affected due to a rise in interest rates, while floating rate securities may produce less income than expected if interest rates fall. due in part to these factors, our future investment income may fall short of expectations due to changes in interest rates, or we may suffer losses in principal if we are forced to sell securities that decline in market value due to changes in interest rates.
as of december 31, 2022, we had $29.0 million of indebtedness outstanding under the july 2022 revolving credit facility. as described elsewhere in this form 10-k, our borrowings under the july 2022 revolving credit facility bear interest at the adjusted term sofr rate for the interest period in effect plus 1.25%, and as a result, we may be exposed to increased interest rate risk. as of december 31, 2022, an increase or decrease in interest rates of
100 basis points would not have had a material effect on our operating results or financial condition.

report of independent registered public accounting firm board of directors and stockholders paycom software, inc.
opinion on the financial statements we have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of paycom software, inc. (a delaware corporation) and subsidiaries (the "company") as of december 31, 2022 and 2021, the related consolidated statements of comprehensive income, changes in stockholders' equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended december
31, 2022, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the "financial statements"). in our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the company as of december
31, 2022 and 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended december 31, 2022, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america.
we also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the public company accounting oversight board (united states) ("pcaob"), the company's internal control over financial reporting as of december 31, 2022, based on criteria established in the 2013internal control-integrated frameworkissued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission ("coso"), and our report dated february 16, 2023 expressed an unqualified opinion.
basis for opinion these financial statements are the responsibility of the company's management. our responsibility is to express an opinion on the company's financial statements based on our audits. we are a public accounting firm registered with the pcaob and are required to be independent with respect to the company in accordance with the u.s. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the securities and exchange commission and the pcaob.
we conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the pcaob. those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. we believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
critical audit matter the critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. the communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.
deferred implementation revenue and contract costs amortization period as described further in note 2 to the financial statements, the company capitalizes costs associated with obtaining and fulfilling revenue contracts when it expects the amortization period to be longer than one year. the resulting assets are amortized over the expected period of benefit of ten years, which the company has determined to be the estimated life of a client relationship. the company also uses the estimated client relationship period in recognizing deferred implementation revenue. we identified the amortization period of both the deferred contract costs as well as the deferred implementation revenue as a critical audit matter.
the principal considerations for our determination that the amortization period of both the deferred contract costs as well as the deferred implementation revenue is a critical audit matter are as follows. given the materiality of the balances of deferred contract costs and deferred implementation revenue, this assumption is considered sensitive as a change could yield a material impact on the financial statements. auditing the estimated life of the company's client relationships required significant auditor judgment in planning and executing the appropriate audit procedures.
48
our audit procedures related to the estimated life of the company's client relationships included the following, among others. we tested the design and operating effectiveness of controls relating to management's annual review of the reasonableness of the estimated life of a client relationship, including controls over the completeness of key inputs in the calculation and the review of the methodology applied by the company's third-party specialist.
with the assistance of a valuation specialist, we tested the methodologies used in determining the appropriateness of the estimated life by evaluating the relationship between the average life of a client and the associated attrition rate for reasonableness. this included reperforming the calculation and verifying that all provided historical data was utilized in the analysis. we also performed procedures over the data utilized in the analysis, including comparing a sample of historical data to previously audited information.

1. organization and description of business description of business paycom software, inc. ("software") and its wholly-owned subsidiaries (collectively, the "company") is a leading provider of a comprehensive, cloud-based human capital management ("hcm") solution delivered as software-as-a-service. unless we state otherwise or the context otherwise requires, the terms "we," "our," "us" and the "company" refer to software and its consolidated subsidiaries. we provide functionality and data analytics that businesses need to manage the complete employment lifecycle from recruitment to retirement. our solution requires virtually no customization and is based on a core system of record maintained in a single database for all hcm functions, including talent acquisition, time and labor management, payroll, talent management and human resources ("hr") management applications.
2. summary of significant accounting policies basis of presentation our consolidated financial statements include the financial results of software and its wholly owned subsidiaries and have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america ("u.s. gaap") and applicable rules and regulations of the securities and exchange commission ("sec"). intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. in the opinion of management, the accompanying consolidated financial statements include all adjustments necessary for the fair presentation for the periods presented.
adoption of new accounting pronouncements in january 2021, we adopted accounting standards update ("asu") no.
2019-12, "income taxes (topic 740) simplifying the accounting for income taxes" ("asu 2019-12") utilizing the prospective transition method. the amendments in asu 2019-12 eliminate certain exceptions related to the approach for intraperiod tax allocation, the methodology for calculating income tax in an interim period and the recognition of deferred tax liabilities for outside basis differences. asu 2019-12 also clarifies and simplifies other aspects of the accounting for income taxes. the adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. in march 2020, the financial accounting standards board ("fasb") issued asu no.
2020-04, "reference rate reform (topic 848) facilitation of the effects of reference rate reform on financial reporting" ("asu 2020-04"). asu 2020-04 provides temporary optional expedients and exceptions for applying u.s.
gaap to contracts, hedging relationships and other transactions affected by reference rate reform. prior to august
24, 2022, our floating-to-fixed interest rate swap was outstanding to offset the rate variability associated with our outstanding indebtedness. as discussed in note 7, the interest rate swap was terminated on august 24, 2022. as a result, the adoption of asu 2020-04 had no material impact on our unaudited financial statements. in january
2021, the fasb issued asu no. 2021-01, "reference rate reform (topic 848) scope" ("asu 2021-01"), which clarifies that certain optional expedients and exceptions in topic 848 for contract modifications and hedge accounting apply to derivative instruments that are affected by the discounting transition. asu 2021-01 amends the expedients and exceptions in topic 848 to capture the incremental consequences of the scope clarification and to tailor the existing guidance to derivative instruments affected by the discounting transition. as discussed in note 7, the interest rate swap was terminated on august 24, 2022. as a result, the adoption of asu 2021-01 had no material impact on our unaudited financial statements.
use of estimates the preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with u.s. gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes. significant estimates include income taxes, loss contingencies, the useful life of property and equipment and intangible assets, the life of our client relationships, the fair value of our stock-based awards and the fair value of our financial instruments, intangible assets and goodwill. these estimates are based on historical experience, where applicable, and other assumptions that management believes are reasonable under the circumstances. actual results could materially differ from these estimates.
segment information we operate in a single operating segment and a single reporting segment. operating segments are defined as components of an enterprise about which separate financial information is evaluated regularly by the chief operating decision maker, who is also the chief executive officer, in deciding how to allocate resources and assessing performance. our chief executive officer allocates 55 paycom software, inc. notes to the consolidated financial statements (tabular dollars and shares in thousands, except per share amounts) resources and assesses performance based upon financial information at the consolidated level. as we operate in one operating segment, all required financial segment information is presented in the consolidated financial statements.
cash equivalents we consider all highly liquid instruments purchased with a maturity of three months or less and money market funds to be cash equivalents. we maintain cash and cash equivalents in demand deposit accounts, money market funds, and certificates of deposit, which may not be federally insured. the fair value of our cash and cash equivalents approximates carrying value. we have not experienced any losses in such accounts and do not believe there is exposure to any significant credit risk on such accounts.
accounts receivable we generally collect revenues from our clients through an automatic deduction from the clients'
bank accounts at the time payroll processing occurs. accounts receivable on our consolidated balance sheets generally consists of revenue-related receivables, including processing fees, interest income receivable, and revenue fees related to the last business day of the year, which are collected on the following business day. as accounts receivable are collected via automatic deduction on the following business day, the company has not recognized an allowance for doubtful accounts.
property and equipment property and equipment is stated at cost, net of accumulated depreciation and amortization.depreciation is computed using the straight line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets as follows:
furniture, fixtures and equipment  5 years computer equipment                 3 years software and capitalized software  3 years buildings                          30 years leasehold improvements             5 years rental clocks                      5 years land improvements                  15 years vehicles                           3 years costs incurred during construction of long-lived assets are recorded as construction in progress and are not depreciated until the asset is placed in service.
we capitalize interest costs incurred related to construction in progress. for the years ended december 31, 2022,
2021 and 2020, we incurred interest costs of $3.4million, $1.4million and $1.5million, respectively. for the years ended december 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, interest costs of $0.9million, $1.4million and $1.5million, respectively, were capitalized.
leases our leases primarily consist of noncancellable operating leases for office space. we recognize a right-of-
use asset and operating lease liability on the lease commencement date based on the present value of the lease payments over the lease term. operating lease liabilities are measured by discounting future lease payments at an estimated incremental borrowing rate. right-of-use assets are amortized over the lease term and include adjustments related to prepaid rent.
internal use software capitalized costs include services associated with developing or obtaining internal use computer software and certain payroll and payroll-related costs for employees who are directly associated with internal use computer software projects. the amount of payroll costs that are capitalized with respect to these employees is limited to the time directly spent on such projects. expenditures for software purchases and software developed or obtained for internal use are capitalized and amortized over a three-year period on a straight-line basis. costs associated with preliminary project stage activities, training, maintenance and all other post-
implementation stage activities are expensed as incurred. we also expense internal costs related to minor upgrades and enhancements, as it is impractical to separate these costs from normal maintenance activities. the total capitalized payroll costs related to internal use computer software projects were $ 66.4 million and $ 52.9 million during the years ended december 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, and are included in property and equipment.
amortization expense of capitalized software costs were $ 47.3 million, $ 36.5 million and $ 27.1 million for the years ended december 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively.

derivatives in december 2017, we entered into a floating-to-fixed interest rate swap agreement to limit the exposure to floating interest rate risk related to the 2017 term loans (as defined in note 6). we do not hold derivative instruments for trading or speculative purposes. the interest rate swap agreement effectively converted a portion of the variable interest rate payments to fixed interest rate payments. we account for our derivatives under asc topic 815, "derivatives and hedging," and recognize all derivative instruments in the consolidated balance sheets at fair value as either short-term or long-term assets or liabilities based on their anticipated settlement date. see note 9, "fair value of financial instruments". we have elected not to designate our interest rate swap as a hedge; therefore, changes in the fair value of the derivative instrument are recognized in our consolidated statements of comprehensive income within other income (expense), net. as further discussed in note 7, on august 24, 2022, we terminated the interest rate swap by settling the contract.
goodwill and other intangible assets goodwill is not amortized, but we are required to test the carrying value of goodwill for impairment at least annually, or earlier if, at the reporting unit level, an indicator of impairment arises. our business is largely homogeneous and, as a result, goodwill is associated with one reporting unit. we have selected june 30 as our annual goodwill impairment testing date. a review of goodwill may be initiated before or after conducting the annual analysis if events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of goodwill may no longer be recoverable. the company performed a qualitative assessment to determine if it is more-
likely-than-not that the fair value of the reporting unit had declined below its carrying value. in the qualitative assessment, we consider the macroeconomic conditions, including any deterioration of general economic conditions, industry and market conditions, including any deterioration in the environment where the reporting unit operates, changes in the products/services and regulator and political developments; cost of doing business; overall financial performance; other relevant reporting unit specific facts, such as changes in management or key personnel or pending litigation. based on our assessment, there was no impairment recorded as of june 30, 2022. for the years ended december 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, there were no indicators of impairment. intangible assets with definite lives are amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives.
impairment of long-lived assets long-lived assets, including intangible assets with definite lives, are reviewed for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset. if the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its estimated future cash flows, an impairment charge is recognized for the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the estimated fair value of the asset. we have determined that there was no impairment of long-lived assets including intangible assets with definite lives, for the years ended december 31,

collect client funds to satisfy their respective federal, state and local employment tax obligations, (ii) remit such funds to the appropriate taxing authorities and accounts designated by our clients, and (iii) manage client tax filings and any related correspondence with taxing authorities. amounts collected by us from clients for their federal, state and local employment taxes are invested by us, and we earn interest on these funds during the interval between receipt and disbursement. these investments are shown in our consolidated balance sheets as funds held for clients, and the associated liability for the tax filings is shown as client funds obligation. the liability is recorded in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets at the time we obtain the funds from clients.
the client funds obligation represents liabilities that will be repaid within one year of the consolidated balance sheet date. as of december 31, 2022 and december 31, 2021, the funds held for clients were invested in money market funds, demand deposit accounts, commercial paper and certificates of deposit. additionally, as of december 31,
2022, the funds held for clients were invested in u.s. treasury securities with an original maturity of greater than one year. short-term investments in commercial paper and certificates of deposit with an original maturity greater than three months are classified as available for-sale securities, and are also included within the funds held for clients line item in the consolidated balance sheets. u.s. treasury securities with an original maturity of greater than one year are also classified as available-for-sale securities and included within the funds held for clients line item in the consolidated balance sheets. these available-for-sale securities are recorded in the consolidated balance sheets at fair value, with the difference between the amortized cost and fair value of these available-for-sale securities recorded as unrealized net gains (losses) on available-for-sale securities and are included within comprehensive earnings (loss) in the consolidated statements of comprehensive income. funds held for clients are classified as a current asset in the consolidated balance sheets because the funds are held solely to satisfy the client funds obligation. additionally, the funds held for clients is classified as restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents and presented within the reconciliation of cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents on the consolidated statements of cash flows.

stock repurchase plan in may 2016, our board of directors authorized a stock repurchase plan allowing for the repurchase of shares of our common stock in open market transactions at prevailing market prices, in privately negotiated transactions or by other means in accordance with federal securities laws, including rule 10b5-1
programs. since the initial authorization of the stock repurchase plan, our board of directors has amended and extended and authorized new stock repurchase plans from time to time. most recently, in august 2022, our board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to $ 1.1 billion of our common stock. as of december 31, 2022 there was $
1.1 billion available for repurchases under our stock repurchase plan. our stock repurchase plan may be suspended or discontinued at any time. the actual timing, number and value of shares repurchased depends on a number of factors, including the market price of our common stock, general market and economic conditions, shares withheld for taxes associated with the vesting of restricted stock and other corporate considerations. the current stock repurchase plan will expire on august 15, 2024. during the year ended december 31, 2022, we repurchased an aggregate of 364,667 shares of our common stock at an average cost of $ 273.74 per share, including 17,355 shares withheld to satisfy tax withholding obligations for certain employees upon the vesting of restricted stock. during the year ended december 31, 2021, we repurchased an aggregate of 163,849 shares of our common stock at an average cost of $ 400.24 per share, all of which were shares withheld to satisfy tax withholding obligations for certain employees upon the vesting of the restricted stock.
revenue recognition revenues are recognized when control of the promised goods or services is transferred to our clients in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to be entitled to for those goods or services. substantially all of our revenues are comprised of revenue from contracts with clients. sales taxes and other applicable taxes are excluded from revenues.
recurring revenues recurring revenues are derived primarily from our talent acquisition, time and labor management, payroll, talent management and hr management applications as well as fees charged for form filings and delivery of client payroll checks and reports. talent acquisition includes our applicant tracking, candidate tracker, enhanced background checks, onboarding, e-verify and tax credit services applications. time and labor management includes time and attendance, scheduling/schedule exchange, time-off requests, labor allocation, labor management reports/push reporting, geofencing/geotracking and microfence tools and applications. payroll includes beti, payroll and tax management, vault card, paycom pay, expense management, mileage tracker/favr, garnishment administration and gl concierge applications. talent management includes our employee self-service, compensation budgeting, performance management, position management, my analytics and paycom learning and content subscriptions applications. hr management includes our manager on-the-go, direct data exchange, ask here, documents and checklists, government and compliance, benefits administration/benefits to carrier, benefit enrollment service, cobra administration, personnel action forms and performance discussion forms, surveys, enhanced aca and clue applications.
the performance obligations related to recurring revenues are satisfied during each client's payroll period, with the agreed-upon fee being charged and collected as part of our processing of the client's payroll. recurring revenues are recognized at the conclusion of processing of each client's payroll period, when each respective payroll client is billed. collectability is reasonably assured as the fees are collected through an automated clearing house as part of the client's payroll cycle or through direct wire transfer, which minimizes the default risk.
the contract period for substantially all contracts associated with these revenues is one month due to the fact that both we and the client have the unilateral right to terminate a wholly unperformed contract without compensating the other party by providing 30 days' notice of termination. our payroll application is the foundation of our solution, and all of our clients are required to utilize this application in order to access our other applications. for clients who purchase multiple applications, due to the short-term nature of our contracts, we do not believe it is meaningful to separately assess and identify whether or not each application potentially represents its own, individual, performance obligation as the revenue generated from each application is recognized within the same month as the revenue from the core payroll application. similarly, we do not believe it is meaningful to individually determine the standalone selling price for each application. we consider the total price charged to a client in a given period to be indicative of the standalone selling price, as the total amount charged is within a reasonable range of prices typically charged for our goods and services for comparable classes of client groups, which we periodically assess for price adjustments.
interest income on funds held for clients is earned on funds that are collected from clients in advance of either the applicable due date for payroll tax submissions or the applicable disbursement date for employee payment services. the interest earned on these funds is included in recurring revenues in the consolidated statements of comprehensive income as the collection, holding, and remittance of these funds are essential components of providing these services.

implementation and other revenues implementation and other revenues consist of nonrefundable upfront conversion fees which are charged to new clients to offset the expense of new client set-up as well as revenues from the sale of time clocks as part of our employee time and attendance services. although these revenues are related to our recurring revenues, they represent distinct performance obligations.
implementation activities primarily represent administrative activities that allow us to fulfill future performance obligations for our clients and do not represent services transferred to the client. however, the nonrefundable upfront fee charged to our clients results in an implied performance obligation in the form of a material right to the client related to the client's option to renew at the end of each 30-day contract period. further, given that all other services within the contract are sold at a total price indicative of the standalone selling price, coupled with the fact that the upfront fees are consistent with upfront fees charged in similar contracts that we have with clients, the standalone selling price of the client's option to renew the contract approximates the dollar amount of the nonrefundable upfront fee. the nonrefundable upfront fee is typically included on the client's first invoice, and is deferred and recognized ratably over the estimated renewal period (i.e., ten-year estimated client life).
revenues from the sale of time clocks are recognized when control is transferred to the client upon delivery of the product. we estimate the standalone selling price for the time clocks by maximizing the use of observable inputs such as our specific pricing practices for time clocks.
contract balances the timing of revenue recognition for recurring services is consistent with the invoicing of clients as they both occur during the respective client payroll period for which the services are provided. therefore, we do not recognize a contract asset or liability resulting from the timing of revenue recognition and invoicing.
changes in deferred revenue related to material rights for the years ended december 31, 2022 and 2021 were as follows:

we expect to recognize $24.3million of deferred revenue related to material rights in 2023, $18.5million in 2024, and $74.6million of such deferred revenuethereafter.
assets recognized from the costs to obtain and costs to fulfill revenue contracts we recognize an asset for the incremental costs of obtaining a contract with a client if we expect the amortization period to be longer than one year. we also recognize an asset for the costs to fulfill a contract with a client if such costs are specifically identifiable, generate or enhance resources used to satisfy future performance obligations, and are expected to be recovered. we have determined that substantially all costs related to implementation activities are administrative in nature and also meet the capitalization criteria under asc 340-40.
these capitalized costs to fulfill principally relate to upfront direct costs that are expected to be recovered through margin and that enhance our ability to satisfy future performance obligations.
the assets related to both costs to obtain, and costs to fulfill, contracts with clients are accounted for utilizing a portfolio approach, and are capitalized and amortized over the expected period of benefit, which we have determined to be the estimated client relationship of ten years. the expected period of benefit has been determined to be the estimated life of the client relationship primarily because we incur no new costs to obtain, or costs to fulfill, a contract upon renewal of such contract. additional commission costs may be incurred when an existing client purchases additional applications; however, these commission costs relate solely to the additional applications purchased and are not related to contract renewal. furthermore, additional fulfillment costs associated with existing clients purchasing additional applications are minimized by our seamless single-database platform. these assets are presented as deferred contract costs in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.
amortization expense related to costs to obtain and costs to fulfill a contract are included in the "sales and marketing" and "general and administrative" line items in the accompanying consolidated statements of comprehensive income.

contract cost of revenues our costs and expenses applicable to total revenues represent operating expenses and systems support and technology costs, including labor and related expenses, bank fees, shipping fees and costs of paper stock, envelopes, etc. in addition, costs included to derive gross margins are comprised of support labor and related expenses, related hardware costs and applicable depreciation and amortization costs.
advertising costs advertising costs are expensed the first time that advertising takes place. advertising costs for the years ended december 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020 were $ 90.6 million, $ 71.6 million and $ 66.9 million, respectively.
sales taxes we collect and remit sales tax on sales of time and attendance clocks and on payroll services in certain states. these taxes are recognized on a net basis, and therefore, excluded from revenues. for the years ended december 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, sales taxes collected were $ 15.5 million, $ 11.9 million and $ 9.7
million, respectively.
employee stock-based compensation time-based stock compensation awards to employees are recognized on a straight-
line basis over the applicable vesting period as compensation costs in the consolidated statements of comprehensive income based on their fair values measured as of the date of grant. market-based stock compensation awards to employees are recognized on a straight-line basis over the applicable estimated vesting period as compensation costs in the consolidated statements of comprehensive income based on their fair value as of the date of the grant unless vesting occurs sooner at which time the remaining respective unrecognized compensation cost is recognized.
performance-based restricted stock compensation awards are recognized on a straight-line basis over the applicable vesting period as compensation costs in the consolidated statements of comprehensive income based on their fair values measured as of the date of grant. forfeitures related to our stock-based compensation awards are recognized as they occur.
employee stock purchase plan an award issued under the paycom software, inc. employee stock purchase plan (the
"espp") is classified as a share-based liability and recognized at the fair value of the award. expense is recognized, net of estimated forfeitures, on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period.
income taxes our consolidated financial statements include a provision for income taxes incurred for the anticipated tax consequences of the reported results of operations using the asset and liability method. under this method, we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax basis of assets and liabilities, as well as for operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the tax rates that are expected to apply to taxable income for the years in which those tax assets and liabilities are expected to be realized or settled. we recognize a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the net amount that we believe is more likely than not to be realized. 60 paycom software, inc. notes to the consolidated financial statements (tabular dollars and shares in thousands, except per share amounts) we file income tax returns with the united states federal government and various state jurisdictions. we evaluate tax positions taken or expected to be taken in the course of preparing our tax returns and disallow the recognition of tax positions not deemed to meet a
"more-likely-than-not" threshold of being sustained by the applicable tax authority. we do not believe there are any tax positions taken within the consolidated financial statements that do not meet this threshold. our policy is to recognize interest and penalties, if any, related to uncertain tax positions as a component of general and administrative expenses. with few exceptions, we are no longer subject to u.s. federal, state and local income tax examinations by tax authorities for years prior to 2019.
seasonality our revenues are seasonal in nature and generally we expect our first and fourth quarter recurring revenues to be higher than other quarters during the year. recurring revenues include revenues relating to the annual processing of payroll tax filing forms and aca form filing requirements, such as form w-2, form 1099, and form 1095 and revenues from processing unscheduled payroll runs (such as bonuses) for our clients. as payroll tax forms are typically processed in the first quarter of the year, first quarter recurring revenues and margins are positively impacted. in addition, unscheduled payroll runs at the end of the year often result in increased recurring revenues in the fourth quarter. these seasonal fluctuations in revenues can also have an impact on gross profits. historical results impacted by these seasonal trends should not be considered a reliable indicator of our future results of operations.

in connection with our marketing initiatives, we purchased the naming rights to the downtown oklahoma city arena that is home to the oklahoma city thunder national basketball association franchise. under the terms of the naming rights agreement, we committed to make payments escalating annually from $4.0million in 2021 to $6.1million in
2035. we also made a $1.5million one time payment in july 2021 to cover sponsorship rights leading up to the 2021-
2022 season. upon the conclusion of the initial term, the agreement may be extended upon the mutual agreement of both parties for an additional five-year period. the cost of the naming rights has been recorded as an intangible asset with an offsetting liability as of the date of the contract. the intangible asset is being amortized over the life of the agreement on a straight line basis that commenced in june 2021. the difference between the present value of the offsetting liability and actual cash payments is being relieved through sales and marketing expense using the effective interest method over the life of the agreement.

5. leases the company's leases primarily consist of noncancellable operating leases for office space with contractual terms expiring from2023to2029. all of our leases are operating leases and, as a lessee, we have not entered into any sublease agreements. the lease term is defined as the fixed noncancellable term of the lease plus all periods, if any, for which failure to renew the lease imposes a penalty on us in an amount that appears, at the inception of the lease, to be reasonably assured. while some of our leases include an option to extend the lease up tofive years, it is not reasonably certain that any such options will be exercised due, in part, to the dynamic nature of our sales force and rate of growth. some of our leases contain a termination option that is not reasonably certain to be exercised. if a termination option is exercised, we remeasure the lease asset in the consolidated balance sheets using the updated lease period. none of our leases contain residual value guarantees, substantial restrictions or covenants.

the expiration of the draw period, in an aggregate annual amount equal to7.5% in year one (if applicable) and year two, and10% thereafter.
the proceeds of the loans and letters of credit under the july 2022 credit agreement are to be used for ongoing working capital and general corporate purposes, permitted acquisitions, share repurchases and refinancing the may
2022 facility. on the july 2022 facility closing date, we borrowed $29.0million under the july 2022 revolving credit facility to repay the outstanding indebtedness under the may 2022 facility, along with accrued interest, expenses and fees. the loan bears interest at the adjusted term sofr rate for the interest period in effect plus1.25%. in connection with the repayment of the may 2022 facility, the may 2022 revolving credit agreement was terminated onjuly 29, 2022.
under the july 2022 credit agreement, we are required to maintain as of the end of each fiscal quarter a consolidated interest ratio of not less than 3.0 to 1.0 and a consolidated leverage ratio of not greater than 3.75
to 1.0, stepping down to 3.0 to 1.0 at intervals thereafter. additionally, the july 2022 credit agreement contains customary affirmative and negative covenants, including covenants limiting our ability to, among other things, grant liens, incur debt, effect certain mergers, make investments, dispose of assets, enter into certain transactions, including swap agreements and sale and leaseback transactions, pay dividends or distributions on our capital stock, and enter into transactions with affiliates, in each case subject to customary exceptions. as of december 31, 2022, we were in

compliance with these covenants. our obligations under the july 2022 credit agreement are secured by a senior security interest in all personal property of the loan parties.

increase in the rate of interest.
as of december 31, 2022 and 2021, the carrying value of our total long-term debt approximated its fair value as of such date. the fair value of our long-term debt is estimated based on the borrowing rates currently available to us for bank loans with similar terms and maturities. aggregate future maturities of long-term debt for the next five years and thereafter (including current portion) as of december 31, 2022 are as follows:

7. derivative instruments in december 2017, we entered into a floating-to-fixed interest rate swap agreement to limit the exposure to floating interest rate risk related to the 2017 term loans. we do not hold derivative instruments for trading or speculative purposes. the interest rate swap agreement effectively converted a portion of the variable interest rate payments to fixed interest rate payments. we account for our derivatives under asc topic 815, "derivatives and hedging," and recognize all derivative instruments in the consolidated balance sheets at fair value as either short-term or long-term assets or liabilities based on their anticipated settlement date.
see note 9, "fair value of financial instruments". we have elected not to designate our interest rate swap as a hedge; therefore, changes in the fair value of the derivative instrument were recognized in our consolidated statements of comprehensive income within other income (expense), net. the objective of the interest rate swap was to reduce the variability in the forecasted interest payments of the 2017 term loans, which was based on a one-
month usd libor rate versus a fixed interest rate of 2.54 % on a notional value of $ 35.5 million. under the terms of the interest rate swap agreement, we received quarterly variable interest payments based on the libor rate and paid interest at a fixed rate. as further discussed in note 6, on may 4, 2022, we repaid the 2017 term loans and terminated the 2017 term credit agreement. in connection with the repayment of the 2017 term loans, we borrowed funds under the may 2022 facility. the interest rate swap agreement had a maturity date of september 7, 2025 . on august 24, 2022, we terminated the interest rate swap by settling the contract, which resulted in a cash receipt of
$ 0.5 million. the realized gain from the settlement of the interest rate swap contract is included in other income
(expense), net in the consolidated statements of comprehensive income.

the accounting standard for fair value measurements establishes a three-level fair value hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value as follows:
• level 1 - observable inputs such as quoted prices in active markets
• level 2 - inputs other than quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that are observable either directly or indirectly or quoted prices that are not active
• level 3 - unobservable inputs in which there is little or no market data included in the following tables are the company's major categories of assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of december 31, 2022 and 2021:

12. stock-based compensation restricted stock awards we have historically issued shares of restricted stock under the paycom software, inc. 2014 long-term incentive plan (as amended, the "ltip") that are subject to either time-based vesting conditions ("time-based shares") or market-based vesting conditions ("market-based shares"). the maximum number of shares that may be delivered pursuant to awards under the ltip is13,350,881shares. the market-based vesting conditions are based on the company's total enterprise value ("tev") or volume weighted average stock price over a specific period exceeding certain specified thresholds. compensation expense related to the issuance of time-based shares is measured based on the fair value of the award on the grant date and recognized over the requisite service period on a straight-
line basis. compensation expense related to the issuance of market-based shares is measured based upon the fair value of the award on the grant date and recognized on a straight-line basis over the vesting period based upon the probability that the vesting conditions will be met.
during the year ended december 31, 2022, we issued an aggregate of451,737restricted shares of common stock under the ltip, consisting of59,503market-based shares and392,234time-based shares. market-based shares will vest50% on the first date, if any, that the arithmetic average of the company's volume weighted average price on each of the twenty consecutive trading days immediately preceding such date (the "vwap value") equals or exceeds $484per share and50% on the first date, if any, that the company's vwap value equals or exceeds $559per share, in each case provided that (i) such date occurs on or before the eighth anniversary of the grant date and (ii) the recipient is employed by, or providing services to, the company on the applicable vesting date, and subject to the terms and conditions of the ltip and the applicable restricted stock award agreement. the time-based shares granted to non-
executive employees will vest over periods ranging fromthreetofive years, provided that the recipient is employed by, or providing services to, the company on the applicable vesting date, and subject to the terms and conditions of the ltip and the applicable restricted stock award agreement.

restricted stock units in february 2022, the compensation committee of the board of directors authorized the granting of performance-based restricted stock units ("psus") to certain executive officers pursuant to the ltip (the "2022 psu awards"). each psu granted under the ltip represents a notional share of the company's common stock. the 2022 psu awards represented an aggregate of51,494target units that may increase to an aggregate of128,735awarded units based upon the company's performance over two separate performance periods: (i) a two-year performance period commencing onjanuary 1, 2022and ending ondecember 31, 2023(the "two-year performance period"); and (ii) a three-year performance period commencing onjanuary 1, 2022and ending ondecember 31, 2024(the "three year performance period").
up to25% of the psus will be eligible to vest no later thanfebruary 29, 2024, for the two-year performance period, and up to75% of the psus will be eligible to vest no later thanmarch 1, 2025, for the three-year performance period, provided that the grantee remains employed by or providing services to the company on the applicable vesting date, and subject to the terms and conditions of the ltip and the restricted stock unit award agreement -
performance based vesting (the "psu award agreement"). the number of psus that will vest and be converted into shares of common stock will depend on the company's relative total stockholder return ("relative tsr"), expressed as a percentile ranking of the company's total stockholder return ("tsr") as compared to the company's peer group set forth in the psu award agreement.

for purposes of the 2022 psu awards, tsr is determined by dividing (i) the sum of (a) the average daily volume weighted average price (or "vwap" as defined in the psu award agreement) of a share of the company's common stock or the common stock of a peer company, as applicable, during the final 60 trading day period of the applicable performance period, less (b) the average vwap of a share of the company's common stock or the common stock of a peer company, as applicable, during the 60 trading day period ending on december 31, 2021, plus (c) the sum of all dividends which are paid by the company (or the member of the peer group) to its stockholders, assuming such dividends are reinvested in the applicable company through the applicable performance period, by (ii) the average vwap of a share of the company's common stock or the common stock of a peer company, as applicable, during the60trading day period ending on december 31, 2021. the company's peer group includes35publicly traded companies, which were reflective of the s&p 500 software & services index on the grant date.
in connection with the departure of jon evans described above, the psus granted to mr. evans in 2021 and 2022 will remain eligible for vesting based on the company's actual performance, but pro-rated for the number of days mr.
evans was employed during the applicable two-year performance periods and three-year performance periods.
during the year ended december 31, 2022, we issued500time-based restricted stock units ("time rsus") under the ltip. the time rsus will vest overfour years, provided that the recipient is employed by, or providing services to, the company on the applicable vesting date, and subject to the terms and conditions of the ltip and the applicable time rsu award agreement.

our effective income tax rate was28% and23% for the years ended december 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. the higher effective income tax rate for the year ended december 31, 2022 primarily resulted from a decrease of excess tax benefits from shares that vested in 2022.
deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes.the significant components of our deferred tax assets and liabilities were as follows:

on august 16, 2022, the inflation reduction act of 2022 was signed into law, which, among other things, implements a15% minimum tax on book income of certain large corporations, a1% excise tax on net stock repurchases and several tax incentives to promote clean energy. based on our current analysis of the provisions, we do not believe this legislation will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements
15. subsequent events on february 4, 2023, we issued an aggregate of 302,015 restricted shares of common stock to certain non-executive employees under the ltip, consisting of 87,618 market-based shares and 214,397 time-based shares. market-based shares for non-executive employees will vest 50 % on the first date, if any, that the company's vwap value equals or exceeds $ 404 per share and 50 % on the first date, if any, that the company's vwap value equals or exceeds $ 466 per share, in each case provided that (i) such date occurs on or before the eighth anniversary of the grant date and (ii) the recipient is employed by, or providing services to, the company on the applicable vesting date. of the 214,397 time-based shares granted to non-executive employees, 213,397 will vest 21
% on a specified initial vesting date, 21 % on the first anniversary of such initial vesting date, 25 % on the second anniversary of such initial vesting date, and 33 % on the third anniversary of such initial vesting date, provided that the recipient is employed by, or providing services to, the company on the applicable vesting date.
effective february 6, 2023, we issued, in the aggregate, 5,232 shares of common stock upon the vesting of psus awarded to certain executive officers in february 2021. the number of shares delivered upon vesting of the psus was determined based on the company's achievement of a relative tsr performance goal, which compared the company's tsr to the tsr of a peer group of 34 publicly traded companies for the two-year performance period that commenced on january 1, 2021 and ended on december 31, 2022 .

item 9a. controls and procedures evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures the term "disclosure controls and procedures," as defined in rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the exchange act, refers to controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the exchange act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the sec's rules and forms. disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that such information is accumulated and communicated to a company's management, including its principal executive and principal financial officers, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. we believe, however, that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can only provide reasonable assurance of achieving desired control objectives, and no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud or error within a company, if any, have been detected.
our management, with the participation of our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of december 31, 2022, the end of the period covered by this form 10-k. based upon such evaluation, our chief executive officer and chief financial officer have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of such date.

report ofindependent registered public accounting firm board of directors and stockholders paycom software, inc.
opinion on internal control over financial reporting we have audited the internal control over financial reporting of paycom software, inc. (a delaware corporation) and subsidiaries (the "company") as of december 31, 2022, based on criteria established in the 2013internal control-integrated frameworkissued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission
("coso"). in our opinion, the company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of december 31, 2022, based on criteria established in the 2013internal control-integrated frameworkissued by coso.
we also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the public company accounting oversight board (united states) ("pcaob"), the consolidated financial statements of the company as of and for the year ended december 31,
2022, and our report dated february 16, 2023 expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements.
basis for opinion the company's management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying management's report on internal control over financial reporting. our responsibility is to express an opinion on the company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. we are a public accounting firm registered with the pcaob and are required to be independent with respect to the company in accordance with the u.s. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the securities and exchange commission and the pcaob.
we conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the pcaob. those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. we believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
definition and limitations of internal control over financial reporting a company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. a company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate

item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations this management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is intended to provide a reader of our financial statements with management's perspective on our financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and certain other factors that may affect our future results. the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the audited and unaudited consolidated financial statements (prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states ("u.s. gaap") and related notes included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10-k (this "form 10-k"). the following discussion contains forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties. see "cautionary statements" for a discussion of the uncertainties, risks, and assumptions associated with those statements. actual results could differ materially from those discussed in or implied by forward-looking statements as a result of various factors, including those discussed below and elsewhere in this form 10-k, particularly in the section entitled "risk factors." unless we state otherwise or the context otherwise requires, the terms "we," "us," "our" and the "company" refer to paycom software, inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries. all amounts presented in tables, other than per share amounts, are in thousands unless otherwise noted.
overview we are a leading provider of a comprehensive, cloud-based human capital management ("hcm") solution delivered as software-as-a-service. we provide functionality and data analytics that businesses need to manage the complete employment lifecycle, from recruitment to retirement. our solution requires virtually no customization and is based on a core system of record maintained in a single database for all hcm functions, including talent acquisition, time and labor management, payroll, talent management and human resources management applications. our user-friendly software allows for easy adoption of our solution by employees, enabling self-management of their hcm activities in the cloud, which reduces the administrative burden on employers and increases employee productivity.
we generate revenues from (i) fixed amounts charged per billing period plus a fee per employee or transaction processed and (ii) fixed amounts charged per billing period. we do not require clients to enter into long-term contractual commitments with us. our billing period varies by client based on when each client pays its employees, which may be weekly, bi-weekly, semi-monthly or monthly. we serve a diverse client base in terms of size and industry. none of our clients constituted more than one-half of one percent of our revenues for the year ended december 31, 2022. our revenues are primarily generated through our sales force that solicits new clients and our client relations representatives, ("crrs") who sell new applications to existing clients.
our continued growth depends on attracting new clients through further penetration of our existing markets and geographic expansion into new markets, targeting a high degree of client employee usage across our solution, and introducing new applications to our existing client base. we believe our ability to continue to develop new applications and to improve existing applications will enable us to increase revenues in the future, and the number of our new applications adopted by our clients has been a significant factor in our revenue growth. in january 2022, we added new sales teams in las vegas, jacksonville, new england and south jersey, bringing our total to 55 sales teams (including one team consisting of crrs and inside sales representatives) located in 28 states. we plan to open additional sales offices in the future to further expand our market presence.
our principal marketing efforts include national and local advertising campaigns, email campaigns, social and digital media campaigns, search engine marketing methods, tradeshows, print advertising and outbound marketing including personalized direct mail campaigns. in addition, we generate leads and build recognition of our brand and thought leadership with relevant and informative content, such as white papers, blogs, podcast episodes and webinars.
throughout our history, we have built strong relationships with our clients. as the hcm needs of our clients evolve, we believe that we are well-positioned to expand the hcm spending of our clients and we believe this opportunity is significant. to be successful, we must continue to demonstrate the operational and economic benefits of our solution, as well as effectively hire, train, motivate and retain qualified personnel.
growth outlook, opportunities and challenges as a result of our significant revenue growth and geographic expansion, we are presented with a variety of opportunities and challenges. our payroll application is the foundation of our solution and all of our clients are required to utilize this application in order to access our other applications. consequently, we have historically generated the majority of our revenues from our payroll applications, although our revenue mix has evolved and will continue to evolve as we develop and add new non-payroll applications to our solution. we believe our strategy of focusing on increased employee usage is key to long-term client satisfaction and client retention. client adoption of new applications and client employee usage of both new and existing applications have been significant factors in our revenue growth, and we expect the continuation of this trajectory will depend, in part, on the introduction of applications to our existing client base that encourage and promote more employee usage. for example, in 2021, we launched our industry-first beti technology, which further automates and streamlines the payroll process by empowering employees to do their own payroll. moreover, in order to increase revenues and continue to improve our operating results, we must also attract new clients. we intend to obtain new clients by (i) continuing to leverage our sales force productivity within markets where we currently have existing sales offices, (ii) expanding our presence in metropolitan areas where we currently have an existing sales office through adding sales teams or offices, thereby increasing the number of sales professionals within such markets, and (iii) opening sales offices in new metropolitan areas.
our target client size range is 50 to 10,000 employees. while we continue to serve a diversified client base ranging in size from one employee to many thousands of employees, the average size of our clients has grown significantly as we have organically grown our operations, increased the number of applications we offer and gained traction with larger companies. we believe larger employers represent a substantial opportunity to increase our revenues per client, with limited incremental cost to us. because we charge our clients on a per employee basis for certain services we provide, any increase or decrease in the number of employees of our clients will have a positive or negative impact, respectively, on our results of operations. generally, we expect that changes in certain factors affecting our performance will correlate with improvement or deterioration in the labor market.
based on our total revenues, we have grown at a 25% compound annual growth rate from january 1, 2019 through december 31, 2022. growing our business has resulted in, and will continue to result in, substantial investments in sales professionals, operating expenses, system development and programming costs and general and administrative expenses, which have increased and will continue to increase our expenses. specifically, our revenue growth and geographic expansion drive increases in our employee headcount, which in turn precipitates increases in (i) salaries and benefits, (ii) stock-based compensation expense and (iii) facility costs related to the expansion of our corporate headquarters and operations facilities and additional sales office leases.
we believe the challenges of managing the ever-changing complexity of payroll and human resources will continue to drive companies to turn to outsourced providers for help with their hcm needs. the hcm industry historically has been driven, in part, by legislation and regulatory action, including cobra, changes to the minimum wage laws or overtime rules, and legislation from federal, state or municipal taxation authorities. the implementation of the affordable care act (the "aca") is an example of legislation that has created demand in the hcm industry. we generate aca-related revenues (i) on an annual basis in connection with processing and filing forms 1094 and 1095 on behalf of clients and (ii) from clients who have purchased our enhanced aca application as part of the fixed, bundled price charged per billing period. while we generally do not track our revenues on an application-by-application basis (because applications are often sold in various groupings and configurations for a single price), we estimate that, if the aca is not modified or repealed, revenues from our enhanced aca application and aca forms filings business will represent approximately 2% of total projected revenues for the year ending december 31, 2023.
for each of the years ended december 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, our gross margin was approximately 85%. although our gross margin may fluctuate from quarter to quarter due to seasonality and hiring trends, we expect that our gross margin will remain relatively consistent in future periods.
key metrics in addition to the u.s. gaap and non-gaap metrics discussed elsewhere in this form 10-k, we also monitor the following metrics to evaluate our business, measure our performance and identify trends affecting our business:

•clients. when we calculate the number of clients at period end, we treat client accounts with separate taxpayer identification numbers (or, in certain circumstances, separate client codes) as separate clients, which often separates client accounts that are affiliated with the same parent organization. we track the number of our clients to provide an accurate gauge of the size of our business. unless we state otherwise or the context otherwise requires, references to clients throughout this form 10-k refer to this metric.
•clients (based on parent company grouping). when we calculate the number of clients based on parent company grouping at period end, we combine client accounts that have identified the same person(s) as their decision-maker regardless of whether the client accounts have separate taxpayer identification numbers (or, in certain circumstances, separate client codes), which often combines client accounts that are affiliated with the same parent organization. we track the number of our clients based on parent company grouping to provide an alternate measure of the size of our business and clients.
•sales teams. we monitor our sales professionals by the number of sales teams at period end. crrs and inside sales representatives are counted as one sales team. each outside sales team consists of a sales manager and approximately six to eight sales professionals. certain larger metropolitan areas can support more than one sales team. we believe the number of sales teams is an indicator of potential revenues for future periods.
•annual revenue retention rate. our annual revenue retention rate tracks the percentage of revenues that we retain from our existing clients. we monitor this metric because it is an indicator of client satisfaction and revenues for future periods.
components of results of operations sources of revenues revenues are comprised of recurring revenues, and implementation and other revenues. we expect our revenues to increase as we introduce new applications, expand our client base and renew and expand relationships with existing clients. as a percentage of total revenues, we expect our mix of recurring revenues, and implementation and other revenues to remain relatively constant.
recurring revenues recurring revenues include fees for our talent acquisition, time and labor management, payroll, talent management and hr management applications as well as fees charged for form filings and delivery of client payroll checks and reports. these revenues are derived from (i) fixed amounts charged per billing period plus a fee per employee or transaction processed or (ii) fixed amounts charged per billing period. we do not require clients to enter into long-term contractual commitments with us. our billing period varies by client based on when each client pays its employees, which may be weekly, bi-weekly, semi-monthly or monthly. because recurring revenues are based, in part, on fees for use of our applications and the delivery of checks and reports that are levied on a per-employee basis, our recurring revenues increase as our clients hire more employees. recurring revenues are recognized in the period services are rendered.
recurring revenues include revenues relating to the annual processing of payroll tax filing forms, such as form w-2 and form 1099, and revenues from processing unscheduled payroll runs (such as bonuses) for our clients. these payroll forms are typically processed in the first quarter of the year and many of our clients are subject to aca form filing requirements in the first quarter, which positively impacts first quarter revenues and margins. we anticipate our revenues will continue to exhibit this seasonal pattern related to aca form filings for so long as the aca (or replacement legislation) includes employer reporting requirements. in addition, our recurring revenues during the fourth quarter are positively impacted by unscheduled payroll runs for our clients that occur before the end of the year. nonetheless, we expect the magnitude of these seasonal fluctuations in our revenues to decrease to the extent clients utilize more of our non-payroll applications.
recurring revenues also include interest earned on funds held for clients. we collect funds from clients in advance of either the applicable due date for payroll tax submissions or the applicable disbursement date for employee payment services. these collections from clients are typically disbursed from one to 30 days after receipt, with some funds being held for up to 120 days. we typically invest funds held for clients in money market funds, demand deposit accounts, commercial paper and certificates of deposit until they are paid to the applicable tax or regulatory agencies or to client employees. we expect interest earned on funds held for clients will increase as we introduce new applications, expand our client base and renew and expand relationships with existing clients. the amount of interest we earn from the investment of client funds is also impacted by changes in interest rates.
implementation and other revenues implementation and other revenues are comprised of implementation fees for the deployment of our solution and other revenues from sales of time clocks as part of our time and attendance services. non-refundable implementation fees are charged to new clients at inception and upon the addition of certain incremental applications for existing clients. these fees generally range from 10% to 30% of the annualized value of the transaction. implementation revenues are recognized as deferred revenue and amortized into income over the life of the client, which is estimated to be ten years, and other revenues are recognized upon shipment of time clocks. implementation and other revenues comprised approximately 1.7% and 1.8% of our total revenues for the years ended december 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.
cost of revenues cost of revenues consists of expenses related to hosting and supporting our applications, hardware costs, systems support and technology and depreciation and amortization. these costs include employee-related expenses (including non-cash stock-based compensation expenses) and other expenses related to client support, bank charges for processing ach transactions, certain implementation expenses, delivery charges and paper costs. they also include our cost for time clocks sold and ongoing technology and support costs related to our systems. the amount of depreciation and amortization of property and equipment allocated to cost of revenues is determined based upon an estimate of assets used to support our operations.
administrative expenses administrative expenses consist of sales and marketing, research and development, general and administrative and depreciation and amortization. sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of employee-related expenses for our direct sales and marketing staff (such as the amortization of commissions and bonuses and non-cash stock-based compensation expenses), marketing expenses and other related costs. based on positive results from our advertising campaigns, we plan to continue to invest in our marketing program and may adjust spending levels in future periods as we see opportunities for favorable returns on our investments. research and development expenses consist primarily of employee-related expenses (including non-cash stock-based compensation expenses) for our development staff, net of capitalized software costs for internally developed software. we expect to grow our research and development efforts as we continue to broaden our payroll and hr solution offerings and extend our technological solutions by investing in the development of new applications and enhancements for existing applications. general and administrative expenses consist of employee-related expenses for finance and accounting, legal, human resources and management information systems personnel (including non-cash stock-based compensation expenses), legal costs, professional fees and other corporate expenses. depreciation and amortization expenses consist of (i) the amount of depreciation and amortization of property and equipment allocated to administrative expenses (based upon an estimate of assets used to support our selling, general and administrative functions) and (ii) amortization of intangible assets.
interest expense interest expense includes interest on our debt and settlements related to an interest rate swap prior to the termination of the interest rate swap agreement on august 24, 2022. we capitalize interest incurred for indebtedness related to construction in progress.
other income (expense), net other income (expense), net includes interest earned on our own funds, any gain or loss on the sale or disposal of fixed assets, costs associated with the early repayment of debt, and the realized gain which resulted from the settlement of our interest rate swap agreement.
provision for income taxes our consolidated financial statements include a provision for income taxes incurred for the anticipated tax consequences of the reported results of operations using the asset and liability method. under this method, we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax basis of assets and liabilities, as well as for any operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the tax rates expected to apply to taxable income for the years in which those tax assets and liabilities are expected to be realized or settled. we recognize a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the net amount we believe is more likely than not to be realized.
results of operations the following table sets forth selected consolidated statements of income data and such data as a percentage of total revenues for each of the periods indicated, as well as year-over-year changes with respect to each line item. refer to "item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations" in the annual report on form 10-k for the year ended december 31, 2021, filed with the sec on february 17, 2022,for a discussion of results for the year ended december 31, 2020, including a discussion of the changes in our results of operations for the year ended december 31, 2021 compared to the year ended december 31, 2020.

revenues the increase in total revenues for the year ended december 31, 2022 from the year ended december 31, 2021 was primarily the result of the addition of new clients and productivity and efficiency gains in mature sales offices, which are offices that have been open for at least 24 months, and the sale of additional applications to our existing clients. in addition, our tax forms filing business in the first quarter of 2022 contributed to the increase in total revenues for the year ended december 31, 2022 as compared to the year ended december 31, 2021. because we charge our clients on a per-employee basis for certain services we provide, the drivers of revenue for the year ended december 31, 2022 described above were impacted by the headcount fluctuations within our client base. additionally, rising interest rates and a higher average funds held for clients balance during year ended december 31, 2022 as compared to the year ended december 31, 2021, resulted in increased interest earned on funds held for clients, which had a positive impact on recurring revenue.
the increase in implementation and other revenues for the year ended december 31, 2022 from the year ended december 31, 2021 was primarily the result of the increased non-refundable upfront conversion fees collected from the addition of new clients. these fees are deferred and recognized ratably over the ten-year estimated life of our clients.
expenses cost of revenues during the year ended december 31, 2022, operating expenses increased from the prior year by $39.3 million primarily due to a $33.2 million increase in employee-related expenses attributable to growth in the number of operating personnel, a $3.6 million increase in shipping and supplies fees, and a $2.2 million increase in automated clearing house fees in connection with the increase in revenues. depreciation and amortization expense increased $11.5 million, or 37%, primarily due to the development of additional technology and purchases of other related fixed assets.
administrative expenses sales and marketing during the year ended december 31, 2022, sales and marketing expenses increased from the prior year by $70.6 million due to a $54.8 million increase in employee-related expenses, including commissions and bonuses, and a $15.8 million increase in marketing and advertising expense attributable to increased spending across many components of our marketing program. based on positive results from our advertising campaigns, we plan to continue to make significant investments in our marketing program and may adjust spending levels in future periods as we see opportunities for returns on our investments.
research and development during the year ended december 31, 2022, research and development expenses increased $29.9 million from the prior year primarily due to an increase in employee-related expenses.
as we continue the ongoing development of our platform and product offerings, we generally expect research and development expenses (exclusive of stock-based compensation) to continue to increase, particularly as we hire more personnel to support our growth. while we expect this trend to continue on an absolute dollar basis and as a percentage of total revenues, we also anticipate the rate of increase to decline over time as we leverage our growth and realize additional economies of scale. as is customary for our business, we also expect fluctuations in research and development expense as a percentage of revenue on a quarter-to-quarter basis due to seasonal revenue trends, the introduction of new products, the amount and timing of research and development costs that may be capitalized and the timing of onboarding new hires and restricted stock vesting events.
expenditures for software developed or obtained for internal use are capitalized and amortized over a three-year period on a straight-line basis. the nature of the development projects underway during a particular period directly impacts the timing and extent of these capitalized expenditures and can affect the amount of research and development expenses in such period. the table below sets forth the amounts of capitalized and expensed research and development costs for the years ended december 31, 2022 and 2021:

total research and development costs                        $214,750                     $171,302        25%
general and administrative during the year ended december 31, 2022, general and administrative expenses increased by $29.3 million from the prior year due to a $40.4 million increase in employee-related expenses, which was partially offset by a $11.1 million decrease in non-cash stock-based compensation expense.
non-cash stock-based compensation expense the following table presents the non-cash stock-based compensation expense that is included within the specified line items in our consolidated statements of comprehensive income:

total non-cash stock-based compensation expense            $94,898                    $97,506        -3%
depreciation and amortization during the year ended december 31, 2022, depreciation and amortization expense increased from the prior year primarily due to the development of additional technology and purchases of other related fixed assets.
interest expense the increase in interest expense for the year ended december 31, 2022 was due to the timing and progress of construction of the expansion of our corporate headquarters and our expanded operations facility, which resulted in a lower capitalization rate of interest in 2022.
other income (expense), net the change in other income (expense), net for the year ended december 31, 2022 was primarily due to the realized gain which resulted from the settlement of our interest rate swap agreement, the settlement of an insurance matter and increased interest income.
provision for income taxes the provision for income taxes is based on a current estimate of the annual effective income tax rate adjusted to reflect the impact of discrete items. our effective income tax rate was 28% and 23% for the years ended december 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.
liquidity and capital resources our principal sources of capital and liquidity are our operating cash flow and cash and cash equivalents. our cash and cash equivalents consist primarily of demand deposit accounts, money market funds and certificates of deposit. additionally, we maintain a $650.0 million senior secured revolving credit facility (the "july 2022 revolving credit facility"), and a $750.0 million senior secured delayed draw term loan facility (the "july 2022 term loan facility"), which can be accessed as needed to supplement our operating cash flow and cash balances. as of december 31, 2022, we have $29.0 million of outstanding borrowings under the july 2022 revolving credit facility and no outstanding borrowings under the july 2022 term loan facility.
we have historically funded our operations from cash flows generated from operations, cash from the sale of equity securities and debt financing. although we have funded most of the costs for construction projects at our corporate headquarters and other facilities from available cash, we have incurred indebtedness for a portion of these costs. we are funding the current building expansion at our oklahoma city headquarters from available cash. further, all purchases under our stock repurchase plans were paid for from available cash. we believe our existing cash and cash equivalents, cash generated from operations and available sources of liquidity will be sufficient to maintain operations, make necessary capital expenditures and opportunistically repurchase shares for at least the next 12 months. in addition, based on our strong profitability and continued growth, we expect to meet our longer-term liquidity needs with cash flows from operations and, as needed, financing arrangements.
interest rate swap agreement. in december 2017, we entered into a floating-to-fixed interest rate swap agreement (the "interest rate swap agreement") to limit our exposure to interest rate risk related to the term loans used to finance construction projects at our corporate headquarters (the "2017 term loans"). the interest rate swap agreement, which had a maturity date of september 7, 2025, provided that we received quarterly variable interest payments based on the libor rate and paid interest at a fixed rate. we have elected not to designate this interest rate swap as a hedge and, as such, changes in the fair value of the derivative instrument are recognized in our consolidated statements of comprehensive income. on august 24, 2022, we terminated the interest rate swap agreement by settling the contract. the settlement of the interest rate swap contract resulted in a cash receipt of $0.5 million. the realized gain from the settlement of the interest rate swap is included in other income (expense), net in the consolidated statements of comprehensive income.
may 2022 revolving credit agreement. on may 4, 2022, we entered into a credit agreement (the "may 2022 revolving credit agreement") with bank of america, n.a., as a lender, swingline lender and letters of credit issuer, the lenders from time to time party thereto, and bank of america, n.a., as the administrative agent, which provided for a senior secured revolving credit facility in the initial aggregate principal amount of up to $250.0 million and the ability to request an incremental facility of up to an additional $100.0 million, subject to obtaining additional lender commitments and certain approvals and satisfying certain other conditions (the "may 2022 facility"). the may 2022 facility included a $25.0 million sublimit for swingline loans and a $2.5 million sublimit for letters of credit. on may 4, 2022, we borrowed $29.0 million under the may 2022 facility to repay the 2017 term loans, along with accrued interest, expenses and fees. on june 7, 2022, the aggregate commitments under the may 2022 revolving credit agreement were increased from $250.0 million to $350.0 million. the may 2022 facility was scheduled to mature on may 4, 2027.
as discussed below, on july 29, 2022, we entered into the july 2022 credit agreement (as defined below) and borrowed $29.0 million to repay the outstanding indebtedness under the may 2022 facility along with accrued interest, expenses and fees. in connection with the repayment, the may 2022 revolving credit agreement was terminated on july 29, 2022.
july 2022 credit agreement. on july 29, 2022 (the "july 2022 facility closing date"), we entered into a new credit agreement (the "july 2022 credit agreement") with jpmorgan chase bank, n.a., as a lender, swingline lender and issuing bank, the lenders from time to time party thereto (collectively with jpmorgan chase bank, n.a., the "july 2022 lenders"), and jpmorgan chase bank, n.a., as the administrative agent.
the july 2022 credit agreement provides for the july 2022 revolving credit facility in the aggregate principal amount of up to $650.0 million, and the ability to request an incremental facility of up to an additional $500.0 million, subject to obtaining additional lender commitments and certain approvals and satisfying certain other conditions. the july 2022 credit agreement includes a $25.0 million sublimit for swingline loans and a $6.5 million sublimit for letters of credit. the july 2022 credit agreement also provides for the july 2022 term loan facility in the aggregate amount of up to $750.0 million. all loans under the july 2022 credit agreement will mature on july 29, 2027 (the "scheduled maturity date").
the borrowings under the july 2022 credit agreement will bear interest at a rate per annum equal to (i) the alternate base rate ("abr") plus an applicable margin ("abr loans") or (ii) (x) the term secured overnight financing rate ("sofr") plus 0.10% (the "adjusted term sofr rate") or (y) the daily sofr plus 0.10%, in each case plus an applicable margin ("sofr rate loans"). abr is calculated as the highest of (i) the rate of interest last quoted by the wall street journal in the united states as the prime rate in effect, (ii) the federal funds rate plus 0.5% and (iii) the adjusted term sofr rate for a one-month interest period plus 1.00%; provided that, if the abr as determined pursuant to the foregoing would be less than 1.00%, such rate shall be deemed to be 1.00%. the applicable margin for abr loans is (i) 0.25% if the company's consolidated leverage ratio is less than 1.0 to 1.0; (ii) 0.50% if the company's consolidated leverage ratio is greater than or equal to 1.0 to 1.0 but less than 2.0 to 1.0; (iii) 0.75% if the company's consolidated leverage ratio is greater than or equal to 2.0 to 1.0 but less than 3.0 to 1.0; or (iv) 1.00% if the company's consolidated leverage ratio is greater than or equal to 3.0 to 1.0. the applicable margin for sofr rate loans is (i) 1.25% if the company's consolidated leverage ratio is less than 1.0 to 1.0; (ii) 1.5% if the company's consolidated leverage ratio is greater than or equal to 1.0 to 1.0 but less than 2.0 to 1.0; (iii) 1.75% if the company's consolidated leverage ratio is greater than or equal to 2.0 to 1.0 but less than 3.0 to 1.0; or (iv) 2.00% if the company's consolidated leverage ratio is greater than or equal to 3.0 to 1.0. we are required to pay a quarterly commitment fee on the daily amount of the undrawn portion of the revolving commitments under the july 2022 revolving credit facility and a quarterly ticking fee on the daily amount of the undrawn portion of the july 2022 term loan facility, in each case at a rate per annum of (i) 0.20% if the company's consolidated leverage ratio is less than 1.0 to 1.0; (ii) 0.225% if the company's consolidated leverage ratio is greater than or equal to 1.0 to 1.0 but less than 2.0 to 1.0; (iii) 0.25% if the company's consolidated leverage ratio is greater than or equal to 2.0 to 1.0 but less than 3.0 to 1.0; or (iv) 0.275% if the company's consolidated leverage ratio is greater than or equal to 3.0 to 1.0. we are also required to pay customary letter of credit fees upon drawing any letter of credit.
under the july 2022 credit agreement, we are required to maintain as of the end of each fiscal quarter a consolidated interest ratio of not less than 3.0 to 1.0 and a consolidated leverage ratio of not greater than 3.75 to 1.0, stepping down to 3.0 to 1.0 at intervals thereafter.
we may make up to ten draws under the july 2022 term loan facility at any time during the period from and after the july 2022 facility closing date through twelve months after the july 2022 facility closing date. loans under the july 2022 term loan facility will amortize in equal quarterly installments commencing with the first full fiscal quarter after the earlier of (x) the date on which the july 2022 term loan facility has been fully drawn and (y) the expiration of the draw period, in an aggregate annual amount equal to 7.5% in year one (if applicable) and year two, and 10% thereafter.
on the july 2022 facility closing date, we borrowed $29.0 million under the july 2022 revolving credit facility to repay the outstanding indebtedness under the may 2022 facility, along with accrued interest, expenses and fees. the loan bears interest at the adjusted term sofr rate for the interest period in effect plus 1.25%. in connection with the repayment of the may 2022 facility, the may 2022 revolving credit agreement was terminated on july 29, 2022.
stock repurchase plan and withholding shares to cover taxes. in may 2016, our board of directors authorized a stock repurchase plan allowing for the repurchase of shares of our common stock in open market transactions at prevailing market prices, in privately negotiated transactions or by other means in accordance with federal securities laws, including rule 10b5-1 programs. since the initial authorization of the stock repurchase plan, our board of directors has amended and extended and authorized new stock repurchase plans from time to time. most recently, in august 2022, our board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to $1.1 billion of our common stock. as of december 31, 2022, there was $1.1 billion available for repurchases under our stock repurchase plan. our stock repurchase plan may be suspended or discontinued at any time. the actual timing, number and value of shares repurchased depends on a number of factors, including the market price of our common stock, general market and economic conditions, the shares withheld for taxes associated with the vesting of restricted stock and other corporate considerations. the current stock repurchase plan will expire on august 15, 2024.
during the year ended december 31, 2022, we repurchased an aggregate of 364,667 shares of common stock at an average cost of $273.74 per share, including 17,355 shares withheld to satisfy tax withholding obligations for certain employees upon the vesting of restricted stock. our payment of the taxes on behalf of those employees resulted in an aggregate cash expenditure of $5.2 million and, as such, we generally subtract the amounts attributable to such withheld shares from the aggregate amount available for future purchases under our stock repurchase plan.
cash flow analysis our cash flows from operating activities have historically been significantly impacted by profitability, implementation revenues received but deferred, our investment in sales and marketing to drive growth, and research and development. our ability to meet future liquidity needs will be driven by our operating performance and the extent of continued investment in our operations. failure to generate sufficient revenues and related cash flows could have a material adverse effect on our ability to meet our liquidity needs and achieve our business objectives.
as our business grows, we expect our capital expenditures and our investment activity to continue to increase. we are currently focused on the expansion of our corporate headquarters. capital expenditures related to this expansion began in the fourth quarter of 2021 and continued during 2022. we estimate that the cost of construction will be between $70 million and $75 million and we expect construction to be completed in the first half of 2024. in addition, we purchased the naming rights to the downtown oklahoma city arena that is home to the oklahoma city thunder national basketball association franchise. under the terms of the naming rights agreement, we committed to make payments escalating annually from $4.0 million in 2021 to $6.1 million in 2035. the payments are due in the fourth quarter of each year. upon the conclusion of the initial term, the agreement may be extended upon the mutual agreement of both parties for an additional five-year period. depending on certain growth opportunities, we may choose to accelerate investments in sales and marketing, acquisitions, technology and services. actual future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including our future revenues, cash from operating activities and the level of expenditures in all areas of our business.
as part of our payroll and payroll tax filing services, we collect funds from our clients for federal, state and local employment taxes, which we remit to the appropriate tax agencies. we invest these funds in money market funds, demand deposit accounts, commercial paper and certificates of deposit from which we earn interest income during the period between their receipt and disbursement.
our cash flows from investing and financing activities are influenced by the amount of funds held for clients, which can vary significantly from quarter to quarter. the balance of the funds we hold depends on our clients' payroll calendars, and therefore such balance changes from period to period in accordance with the timing of each payroll cycle.
our cash flows from financing activities are also affected by the extent to which we use available cash to purchase shares of common stock under our stock repurchase plan as well as restricted stock vesting events that result in net share settlements and the company paying withholding taxes on behalf of certain employees.
the following table summarizes the consolidated statements of cash flows for the years ended december 31, 2022 and 2021:

operating activities cash flows provided by operating activities for the year ended december 31, 2022 primarily consisted of payments received from our clients and interest earned on funds held for clients. cash used in operating activities primarily consisted of personnel-related expenditures to support the growth and infrastructure of our business. these payments included costs of operations, advertising and other sales and marketing efforts, it infrastructure development, product research and development and security and administrative costs. compared to the year ended december 31, 2021, our operating cash flows for the year ended december 31, 2022 were positively impacted by the growth of our business.
investing activities cash flows used in investing activities for the year ended december 31, 2022 decreased from the prior year period due to a $130.1 million decrease in purchases of investments from funds held for clients, a $114.9 million increase in proceeds from investments from funds held for clients, and a $1.4 million decrease in purchases of intangible assets, which were partially offset by a $12.0 million increase in purchases of property and equipment.
financing activities cash flows provided by financing activities for the year ended december 31, 2022 increased from the prior year period primarily due to the impact of a $128.1 million change related to the client funds obligation, which is due to the timing of receipts from our clients and payments made to our clients' employees and applicable taxing authorities on their behalf, a $60.4 million decrease in withholding taxes paid related to net share settlements, and a $29.0 million increase in proceeds from the issuance of debt. the increase in cash flows provided by financing activities was partially offset by a $94.7 million increase in common stock repurchases, a $27.5 million increase payments on long-term debt, and a $6.4 million increase in payment of debt issuance costs.
contractual obligations our principal commitments primarily consist of long-term debt, leases for office space and the naming rights agreement. as discussed in "note 6. long-term debt, net" and elsewhere in this form 10-k, on may 4, 2022, we entered into the may 2022 revolving credit agreement, repaid the 2017 term loans and terminated the 2017 term credit agreement. on july 29, 2022, we entered into the july 2022 credit agreement and terminated the may 2022 revolving credit agreement. for additional information regarding our naming rights agreement, leases, long-term debt and our commitments and contingencies, see "note 4. goodwill and intangible assets, net", "note 5. leases", "note 6. long-term debt, net" and "note 13. commitments and contingencies".
we plan to continue to lease additional office space to support our growth. in addition, many of our existing lease agreements provide us with the option to renew. when applicable, our future operating lease obligations include payments due during any renewal period provided for in the lease where the lease imposes a penalty for failure to renew. additional details on our leases, including the related future cash outflows, are included within "note 5. leases" in the notes to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere within this form 10-k.
critical accounting policies and estimates our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes have been prepared in accordance with u.s. gaap. the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, costs and expenses, and related disclosures. estimates made in accordance with u.s. gaap that involve a significant level of estimation uncertainty and have had or are reasonably likely to have a material impact on our financial condition are described below. on an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates and assumptions to ensure that management believes them to be reasonable under the then-current facts and circumstances. actual amounts and results may materially differ from these estimates made by management under different assumptions and conditions.
certain accounting policies that require significant management estimates, and are deemed critical to our results of operations or financial position, are described below. accordingly, these are the policies we believe are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our consolidated financial condition and results of operations.
revenue recognition revenues are recognized when control of the promised goods or services is transferred to our clients in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to be entitled to for those goods or services. substantially all of our revenues are comprised of revenue from contracts with clients. sales and other applicable taxes are excluded from revenues.
recurring revenues are derived primarily from our talent acquisition, time and labor management, payroll, talent management and hr management applications as well as fees charged for form filings and delivery of client payroll checks and reports. talent acquisition includes our applicant tracking, candidate tracker, enhanced background checks, onboarding, e-verify and tax credit services applications. time and labor management includes time and attendance, scheduling/schedule exchange, time-off requests, labor allocation, labor management reports/push reporting, geofencing/geotracking and microfence tools and applications. payroll includes beti, payroll and tax management, vault card, paycom pay, expense management, mileage tracker/favr, garnishment administration and gl concierge applications. talent management includes our employee self-service, compensation budgeting, performance management, position management, my analytics and paycom learning and content subscriptions applications. hr management includes our manager on-the-go, direct data exchange, ask here, documents and checklists, government and compliance, benefits administration/benefits to carrier, benefit enrollment service, cobra administration, personnel action forms and performance discussion forms, surveys, enhanced aca and clue applications.
the performance obligations related to recurring revenues are satisfied during each client's payroll period, with the agreed-upon fee being charged and collected as part of our processing of the client's payroll. recurring revenues are recognized at the conclusion of processing of each client's payroll period, when each respective payroll client is billed. collectability is reasonably assured as the fees are collected through an automated clearing house as part of the client's payroll cycle or through direct wire transfer, which minimizes the default risk.
the contract period for substantially all contracts associated with these revenues is one month due to the fact that both we and the client have the unilateral right to terminate a wholly unperformed contract without compensating the other party by providing 30 days' notice of termination. our payroll application is the foundation of our solution, and all of our clients are required to utilize this application in order to access our other applications. for clients who purchase multiple applications, due to the short-term nature of our contracts, we do not believe it is meaningful to separately assess and identify whether or not each application potentially represents its own, individual, performance obligation as the revenue generated from each application is recognized within the same month as the revenue from the core payroll application. similarly, we do not believe it is meaningful to individually determine the standalone selling price for each application. we consider the total price charged to a client in a given period to be indicative of the standalone selling price, as the total amount charged is within a reasonable range of prices typically charged for our goods and services for comparable classes of client groups.
implementation and other revenues consist of nonrefundable upfront conversion fees which are charged to new clients to offset the expense of new client set-up as well as revenues from the sale of time clocks as part of our employee time and attendance services. although these revenues are related to our recurring revenues, they represent distinct performance obligations.
implementation activities primarily represent administrative activities that allow us to fulfill future performance obligations for our clients and do not represent services transferred to the client. however, the nonrefundable upfront fee charged to our clients results in an implied performance obligation in the form of a material right to the client related to the client's option to renew at the end of each 30-day contract period. further, given that all other services within the contract are sold at a total price indicative of the standalone selling price, coupled with the fact that the upfront fees are consistent with upfront fees charged in similar contracts that we have with clients, the standalone selling price of the client's option to renew the contract approximates the dollar amount of the nonrefundable upfront fee. the nonrefundable upfront fee is typically included on the client's first invoice, and is deferred and recognized ratably over the estimated renewal period (i.e. ten-year estimated client life).
revenues from the sale of time clocks are recognized when control is transferred to the client upon delivery of the product. we estimate the standalone selling price for the time clocks by maximizing the use of observable inputs such as our specific pricing practices for time clocks.
goodwill and other intangible assets goodwill is not amortized, but we are required to test the carrying value of goodwill for impairment at least annually, or earlier if, at the reporting unit level, an indicator of impairment arises. our business is largely homogeneous and, as a result, goodwill is associated with one reporting unit. we have selected june 30 as our annual goodwill impairment testing date. a review of goodwill may be initiated before or after conducting the annual analysis if events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of goodwill may no longer be recoverable. the company performed a qualitative assessment to determine if it is more-likely-than-not that the fair value of the reporting units had declined below its carrying value. in the qualitative assessment, we consider the macroeconomic conditions, including any deterioration of general economic conditions, industry and market conditions, including any deterioration in the environment where the reporting unit operates, changes in the products/services and regulator and political developments; cost of doing business; overall financial performance; other relevant reporting unit specific facts, such as changes in management or key personnel or pending litigation. based on our assessment, there was no impairment recorded as of june 30, 2022. for the years ended december 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, there were no indicators of impairment. intangible assets with definite lives are amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives.
impairment of long-lived assets long-lived assets, including intangible assets with finite lives, are reviewed for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset. if the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its estimated future cash flows, an impairment charge is recognized for the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the estimated fair value of the asset. we have determined that there is no impairment of long-lived assets for the years ended december 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020.
market-based restricted stock awards and performance-based restricted stock units we measure non-cash stock-based compensation expense based on the fair value of the award on the date of grant. we determine the fair value of stock awards and units issued by using a monte carlo simulation model. this model considers various subjective assumptions as inputs, and represent our best estimates, which involve inherent uncertainties and the application of our judgment as it relates to market volatilities, the historical volatility of our stock price, risk-free rates and expected life. the valuation model also incorporates exercise and forfeiture assumptions based on an analysis of historical data. determining these assumptions is subjective and complex, and therefore, a change in the assumptions utilized could impact the calculation of the fair value of our market-based stock awards and performance-based restricted stock units and the associated compensation expense. refer to note 12 in the notes to our consolidated financial statements for further information regarding our stock-based compensation awards.
recent accounting pronouncements refer to note 2 in the notes to the consolidated financial statements for a full description of recent accounting pronouncements.
non-gaap financial measures management uses adjusted ebitda and non-gaap net income as supplemental measures to review and assess the performance of our core business operations and for planning purposes. we define (i) adjusted ebitda as net income plus interest expense, taxes, depreciation and amortization, non-cash stock-based compensation expense, certain transaction expenses that are not core to our operations (if any) and the change in fair value of our interest rate swap and (ii) non-gaap net income as net income plus non-cash stock-based compensation expense, certain transaction expenses that are not core to our operations (if any) and the change in fair value of our interest rate swap, all of which are adjusted for the effect of income taxes. adjusted ebitda and non-gaap net income are metrics that provide investors with greater transparency to the information used by management in its financial and operational decision-making. we believe these metrics are useful to investors because they facilitate comparisons of our core business operations across periods on a consistent basis, as well as comparisons with the results of peer companies, many of which use similar non-gaap financial measures to supplement results under u.s. gaap. in addition, adjusted ebitda is a measure that provides useful information to management about the amount of cash available for reinvestment in our business, repurchasing common stock and other purposes. management believes that the non-gaap measures presented in this form 10-k, when viewed in combination with our results prepared in accordance with u.s. gaap, provide a more complete understanding of the factors and trends affecting our business and performance.
adjusted ebitda and non-gaap net income are not measures of financial performance under u.s. gaap, and should not be considered a substitute for net income, which we consider to be the most directly comparable u.s. gaap measure. adjusted ebitda and non-gaap net income have limitations as analytical tools, and when assessing our operating performance, you should not consider adjusted ebitda or non-gaap net income in isolation, or as a substitute for net income or other consolidated statements of comprehensive income data prepared in accordance with u.s. gaap. adjusted ebitda and non-gaap net income may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies and other companies may not calculate such measures in the same manner as we do.
the following tables reconcile net income to adjusted ebitda, net income to non-gaap net income and earnings per share to non-gaap net income per share on a basic and diluted basis. refer to "item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations" in the annual report on form 10-k for the year ended december 31, 2021, filed with the sec on february 17, 2022, for a presentation of the 2020 amounts:

risk factors, our board of directors, in its sole discretion, determines the amount, timing and frequency of our dividends to shareholders.
changes in tax laws or their interpretation could adversely affect our shareholders and our results of operations.
federal and state tax laws are constantly under review by persons involved in the legislative process, the irs, the united states department of the treasury, and state taxing authorities. changes to tax laws could adversely affect our shareholders or increase our effective tax rates. we cannot predict with certainty whether, when, in what forms, or with what effective dates, the tax laws applicable to us or our shareholders may be changed.
import/export taxes and duties we may be required to pay significant taxes or tariffs on our exported products or countervailing and anti-dumping duties or tariffs on our imported products.
we export logs and finished wood products to foreign markets, and our ability to do so profitably is affected by u.s. and foreign trade policy. international trade disputes occur frequently and can be taken to an international trade court for resolution of unfair trade practices between countries.
u.s. international trade policy could result in one or more of our foreign export market jurisdictions adopting trade policy making it more difficult or costly for us to export our products to those countries. we could therefore experience reduced revenues and margins in any of our businesses that is adversely affected by international trade tariffs, duties, taxes, customs or dispute settlement terms. to the extent such trade policies increase prices, they could also reduce the demand for our products and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial results and financial condition, including facility closures or impairments of assets. we cannot predict future trade policy or the terms of any settlements of international trade disputes and their effect on our business.
other risks risks related to owning our stock our cash dividends are not guaranteed and may fluctuate.
our board of directors, in its sole discretion, determines the amount and timing of our cash dividends to shareholders based on consideration of a number of factors. these factors include, but are not limited to: our results of operations and cash flows; current and forecasted economic conditions; changes in the current or expected prices and demand for our products and the general market demand for timberlands, including those timberland properties that have higher and better uses; current and forecasted harvest levels; balancing various capital allocation priorities and considerations including without limitation the company's capital requirements and debt repayment obligations; various finance considerations, including the company's credit ratings, borrowing capacity, debt covenant restrictions that may impose limitations on cash payments and other related factors and tax considerations. consequently, the amount, timing and frequency of our dividends, including our quarterly base dividend and annual supplemental dividend, may fluctuate.
the market price of our common stock may be influenced by many factors, some of which are beyond our control.
the market price of our common stock may be influenced by many factors, some of which are beyond our control, including without limitation those described above and elsewhere in this report, as well as the following:
  actual or anticipated fluctuations in our operating results or our competitors' operating results;
  announcements by us or our competitors of new products, capacity changes, significant contracts, acquisitions or strategic investments or initiatives;
  our growth rate and our competitors' growth rates;
  general economic conditions;
  conditions in the financial markets;
  market interest rates and the relative yields on other financial instruments;
  general perceptions and expectations regarding housing markets, interest rates, commodity prices, and currencies;
weyerhaeuser company >2022 annual report and form 10-k40

  changes in stock market analyst recommendations regarding us, our competitors or the forest products industry generally, or lack of analyst coverage of our common stock;
  sales of our common stock by our executive officers, directors and significant shareholders;
  sales or repurchases of substantial amounts of common stock;
  fluctuation in the market price of our products (see product pricing and profitability above);
  changes in accounting principles and
  changes in tax laws and regulations.
in addition, there has been significant volatility in the market price and trading volume of securities of companies, including companies operating in the forest products industry, that often has been unrelated to individual company operating performance. some companies that have experienced volatile market prices for their securities have had securities litigation brought against them. if litigation of this type is brought against us, it could result in substantial costs and divert management's attention and resources.
capital markets risks deterioration in economic conditions and capital markets could adversely affect our access to capital.
challenging market conditions could impair the company's ability to raise debt or equity capital or otherwise access capital markets on terms acceptable to us, which may, among other effects, reduce our ability to refinance debt maturities or take advantage of growth and expansion opportunities. moreover, our businesses require substantial capital for repair or replacement of existing facilities or equipment. while we believe our capital resources will be adequate to meet our current projected operating needs, capital expenditures and other cash requirements, if for any reason we are unable to access capital for our operating needs, capital expenditures and other cash requirements on acceptable economic terms, or at all, we could experience a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
changes in credit ratings issued by nationally recognized rating organizations could adversely affect our cost of financing and have an adverse effect on the market price of our securities.
credit rating agencies rate our debt securities on factors that include our operating results and balance sheet, actions that we take, their view of the general outlook for our industry and their view of the general outlook for the economy. ratings decisions by these agencies include maintaining, upgrading or downgrading our current rating, as well as placing the company on a "watch list" for possible future ratings actions. any downgrade of our credit rating, or decision by a rating agency to place us on a "watch list" for possible future downgrading could have an adverse effect on our ability to access credit markets, increase our cost of financing, and have an adverse effect on the market price of our securities.
information systems and cybersecurity we face risks associated with the use of information technology (it) systems including from security breaches or other significant disruptions, which could affect our ability to operate our businesses effectively, adversely affect our reported financial results, affect our reputation and expose us to potential liability or litigation.
we use it systems to carry out our operational activities, maintain our business records, and collect and store sensitive data, including but not limited to intellectual property and personally identifiable information. some of our systems are internally managed and some are maintained by third-party service providers. although we employ, and we believe our third-party service providers employ, what we deem to be reasonably adequate security measures and controls, there can be no assurance that our security measures will be effective against the risks we face from cyber-attacks, including from: computer hackers, foreign governments and cyber terrorists; malicious code (such as malware, viruses and ransomware); an intentional or unintentional personnel action; a natural disaster; a hardware or software corruption, failure or error; a telecommunications system failure; a service provider failure or error;
or any one or more other causes of a security breach, failure or disruption. to date, no events of this nature have had a material adverse effect on our business. however, if in the future our it systems are significantly disrupted, shut down or otherwise compromised, or if our data is destroyed, misappropriated or inappropriately disclosed, our financial results or our business operations, or both, could be negatively affected. additionally, we could suffer significant losses or incur significant liabilities, including without limitation damage to our reputation, loss of customer confidence or goodwill and significant expenditures of time and money to address and remediate resulting damages to affected individuals or business partners or to defend ourselves in resulting litigation or other legal proceedings by affected individuals, business partners or regulators.

weyerhaeuser company >2022 annual report and form 10-k43
table of contents economic and market conditions affecting our operations our market conditions and the strength of the broader u.s. economy are, and will continue to be, influenced by the trajectory of activity in the u.s. housing and repair and remodel segments, impacts from any future restrictions related to covid-19 or other viral or similar outbreak, inflation trends and interest rates. the demand for sawlogs within our timberlands segment is directly affected by domestic production of wood-based building products. the strength of the u.s. housing market, particularly new residential construction, strongly affects demand in our wood products segment, as does repair and remodeling activity. seasonal weather patterns impact the level of construction activity in the u.s., which in turn affects demand for our logs and wood products. our timberlands segment, specifically the western region, is also affected by export demand and trade policy. japanese housing starts are a key driver of export log demand in japan. the demand for pulpwood from our timberlands segment is directly affected by the production of pulp, paper and oriented strand board (osb) as well as the demand for biofuels, such as wood-burning pellets made from pulpwood. the timberlands segment is also influenced by the availability of harvestable timber. in general, western log markets are highly tensioned by available supply, while southern log markets have more available supply. however, additional mill capacity being added in the u.s. south has led to tightening of markets in certain geographies. our real estate, energy and natural resources segment is affected by a variety of factors, including the general state of the economy, local real estate market conditions, the level of construction activity in the u.s., and evolution of emerging renewable energy and carbon-related markets.
while underlying longer-term fundamentals remain favorable for construction of new housing in the u.s., home sales and building activity have slowed due in part to higher mortgage interest rates, reduced affordability and general macroeconomic conditions. on a seasonally adjusted annual basis, as reported by the u.s. census bureau, housing starts for fourth quarter 2022 averaged 1.4 million units, a 3.2 percent decrease from third quarter 2022. single family starts averaged 0.9 million units, a 4.8 percent decrease from third quarter 2022. multi-family starts averaged 541 thousand units in fourth quarter 2022, which was a 0.6 percent decrease from third quarter 2022. sales of newly built, single family homes averaged a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 605 thousand units for fourth quarter 2022, an increase of 4.4 percent from the prior quarter. over the medium to long-term, we expect continued strength in the u.s. housing construction market, supported by strong demographics in the key homebuying age cohorts, a decade of underbuilding and an aging housing stock.
repair and remodeling expenditures decreased by 0.8 percent from third quarter 2022 to fourth quarter 2022
according to the census bureau advance retail spending report. do-it-yourself activity has been returning to more normalized levels while professionally contracted activities have benefited from larger projects and increases in home equity levels. over the longer term, we expect this sector to return to pre-pandemic growth trends with healthy household balance sheets, elevated home equity and a u.s. housing stock median age of 43 years.
in u.s. wood product markets, demand felt the effects of a slowing housing market and more uncertain economic environment over most of fourth quarter 2022. the random lengths framing lumber composite price averaged $452/mbf and the osb composite averaged $360/msf in fourth quarter 2022. over the course of the fourth quarter, prices declined from $512/mbf to $380/mbf for lumber and from $402/msf to $288/msf for osb.
in western log markets, douglas fir sawlog prices fell by 7.4 percent in fourth quarter 2022 compared with third quarter 2022 as reported by risi log lines based on weyerhaeuser's portfolio mix. overall, domestic prices in the west fell moderately, as mills felt the effects of lower lumber prices, partially offset by continued constraints in log supply. in the south, delivered sawlog prices increased by 1.2 percent in fourth quarter 2022 compared to third quarter 2022 and 4.6 percent from fourth quarter 2021 as reported by timber mart-south, as mills are carrying higher inventories to mitigate log and haul capacity constraints.
currency exchange rates, available supply from other countries and trade policy affect our export businesses.
during fourth quarter 2022, end use demand softened in export markets, partially offset by continued disruptions in global log and lumber supply. in japan, total housing starts increased 0.8 percent year to date through november compared to the same period in 2021, while the key post and beam segment saw a 4.0 percent decrease. an increase in lumber imports from europe to japan placed downward pressure on market conditions. china demand was held back by zero covid-19 policies and general economic conditions, but constraints of supply sources from other countries, particularly russia, supported demand from u.s. producers.
interest rates affect our business primarily through their impact on mortgage rates and housing affordability, their general impact on the economy, and their influence on our capital management activities. actions by the u.s.
federal reserve, the overall condition of the economy, and fluctuations in financial markets are all factors that influence long-term interest rates. 30-year mortgage rates, which are correlated with long-term interest rates, decreased from 6.7 percent at the end of third quarter 2022 to 6.4 percent at the end of the fourth quarter. while mortgage rates fell over the quarter and from a high of over 7 percent in november, the rapid increase in mortgage rates since the end of 2021 has had a negative impact on home affordability and reduced demand for homebuying.
increased inflation affects the cost of our operations across each of our business segments, including costs for raw materials, transportation, energy and labor. the consumer price index increased 6.5 percent year over year in december 2022, primarily due to demand and supply for goods and services, fluctuations in labor markets, and monetary policy set by the u.s. federal reserve. while we can offset some of the impacts of inflation through our sales activities, our operational excellence initiatives and our procurement practices, not all of the costs associated with inflation can be fully mitigated or passed on to the consumer.
the condition of the labor market affects all of our businesses as it relates to our ability to attract and retain employees and contractors. the unemployment rate of 3.5 percent in december 2022 remained near historically low levels and was unchanged from the end of the third quarter.
weyerhaeuser company >2022 annual report and form 10-k44
table of contents labor force participation has increased to 62.3 percent in december 2022, from 61.9 percent in december 2021, but this remains below pre-pandemic levels of over 63 percent.
governments and businesses across the globe are taking action on climate change and are making significant commitments towards reducing greenhouse gas emissions to net zero. achieving these commitments will require governments and companies to take major steps to modify operations, invest in low-carbon activities and purchase offsets to reduce environmental impacts. we believe we are uniquely positioned to help entities achieve these commitments through natural climate solutions, including forest carbon sequestration and carbon capture and storage activities.
in mid-september 2022, weyerhaeuser employee members of the international association of machinists and aerospace workers union commenced a work stoppage affecting the company's operations in washington and oregon. the stoppage involved approximately 1,200 employees and affected four lumber mills in our wood products segment and a portion of our western timberlands operations. this event had a negative impact on our operations for the third and fourth quarter, including reductions in fee harvest volumes and sale volumes for western timberlands, as well as reductions in production volumes and sales volumes for our lumber business. on october 28, 2022, the company announced the successful resolution of the work stoppage and resumed operations.

comparing 2022 with 2021
net sales net sales decreased $17 million - less than 1 percent - primarily due to a $263 million decrease in wood products net sales to unaffiliated customers, primarily attributable to decreased sales volumes across most product lines and decreased realizations for structural lumber and oriented strand board.
this decrease was partially offset by a $222 million increase in timberlands net sales to unaffiliated customers, primarily due to increased sales realizations in the western and southern regions.
costs of sales costs of sales increased $461 million - 8 percent - primarily due to increased freight and raw material costs within our wood products segment, as well as increased logging and hauling costs and increased third party log purchase costs within our timberlands segment.
operating income operating income decreased $563 million - 15 percent - primarily due to a $478 million decrease in consolidated gross margin (see discussion of components above).
net earnings net earnings decreased $727 million - 28 percent - primarily due to:
  the $563 million decrease in operating income discussed above;
  a $276 million pretax charge ($207 million after-tax) related to the early extinguishment of debt (refer to note 12: long-term debt, net) and
  a $235 million increase in non-operating pension and other post-employment benefit costs (refer to note 9:
pension and other post-employment benefit plans).
these decreases were partially offset by a $284 million decrease in income tax expense, as well as a $43 million decrease in interest expense (refer toincome taxesandinterest expense).

accounting matters critical accounting policies in the preparation of our financial statements we follow established accounting policies and make estimates that affect both the amounts and timing of the recording of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. some of these estimates require judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain. accounting policies whose application may have a significant effect on the reported results of operations and financial position are considered critical accounting policies.
in accounting, we base our judgments and estimates on:
  historical experience and
  assumptions we believe are appropriate and reasonable under current circumstances.
actual results, however, may differ from the estimated amounts we have recorded.
weyerhaeuser company >2022 annual report and form 10-k54
table of contents our most critical accounting policies relate to our:
  discount rates for pension and post-employment benefit plans;
  potential impairments of long-lived assets and
  contingent liabilities.
details about our other significant accounting policies - what we use and how we estimate - are innote 1: summary of significant accounting policies.
discount rates for pension and post-employment benefit plans discount rates are used to estimate the net present value of our pension and other post-employment plan obligations. these rates are determined at the measurement date by matching current spot rates of high-quality corporate bonds with maturities similar to the timing of expected cash outflows for benefits. the selection of discount rates requires judgment as well as the involvement of actuarial specialists. these specialists assist with selecting yield curves based on published indices for high-quality corporate bonds and projecting the timing and amount of cash flows associated with our obligations to ultimately support our determination of an appropriate discount rate for each plan.
our discount rates as of december 31, 2022 are:
  5.4 percent for our u.s. pension plans - compared with 2.9 percent at december 31, 2021;
  5.4 percent for our u.s. post-employment plans - compared with 2.6 percent at december 31, 2021;
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
  5.3 percent for our canadian pension plans - compared with 3.1 percent at december 31, 2021 and
  5.3 percent for our canadian post-employment plans - compared with 3.0 percent at december 31, 2021.
pension expenses for 2023 will be based on the 5.4 percent and 5.3 percent assumed discount rates for the u.s.
pension plans and the canadian pension plans, respectively, and the 5.4 percent and 5.3 percent assumed discount rates for the u.s. and canadian post-employment benefit plans, respectively.
our discount rates are important in determining the cost of our plans. a 50 basis point decrease in our discount rate would increase expense or reduce a credit by approximately:
  $10 million for our u.s. qualified pension plans and
  $1 million for our canadian registered pension plans.
impairment of long-lived assets we review the carrying value of long-lived assets whenever an event or a change in circumstance indicates that the carrying value of the asset or asset group may not be recoverable through future operations. the carrying value is the original cost, less accumulated depreciation and any past impairments recorded.
if we evaluate recoverability, we are required to estimate future cash flows and residual values of the asset or asset group. key assumptions used in developing these estimates would include probability of alternative outcomes, product pricing, raw material cost and product sales.
an impairment occurs when the carrying value of a long-lived asset is greater than the amount that could be recovered from the estimated future cash flows of the asset and greater than fair market value (the amount we could receive if we were to sell the asset).key assumptions used in developing estimates of fair value would include the estimated future cash flows used to assess recoverability, discount rates and probability of alternative outcomes.
contingent liabilities we are subject to lawsuits, investigations and other claims related to environmental, product and other matters, and are required to assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes to these matters, as well as the amount or range of potential loss.
we record contingent liabilities when:
  it becomes probable that a loss has been incurred and
  the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated.
assessing probability of loss and estimating the amount of loss can require analysis of multiple factors, such as:
  historical experience,
  evaluations of relevant legal and environmental authorities and regulations,
  judgments about the potential actions of third-party claimants and courts and
  consideration of potential environmental remediation methods.
in addition to contingent liabilities recorded for probable losses, we disclose contingent liabilities when there is a reasonable possibility that a loss may have been incurred.
weyerhaeuser company >2022 annual report and form 10-k55
table of contents recorded contingent liabilities are based on the best information available and actual losses in any future period are inherently uncertain. if estimated probable future losses or actual losses exceed our recorded liability for such claims, we record additional charges. these exposures and proceedings can be significant and the ultimate negative outcomes could be material to our operating results or cash flows in any given quarter or year. seenote

performance measures we use adjusted ebitda as a key performance measure to evaluate the performance of the consolidated company and our business segments. this measure should not be considered in isolation from, and is not intended to represent an alternative to, our results reported in accordance with u.s. generally accepted accounting principles (u.s. gaap).
however, we believe adjusted ebitda provides meaningful supplemental information for our investors about our operating performance, better facilitates period to period comparisons and is widely used by analysts, lenders, rating agencies and other interested parties. our definition of adjusted ebitda may be different from similarly titled measures reported by other companies. adjusted ebitda, as we define it, is operating income adjusted for depreciation, depletion, amortization, basis of real estate sold and special items.

table of contents financial statements and supplementary data report of independent registered public accounting firm to the shareholders and board of directors weyerhaeuser company:
opinion on the consolidatedfinancial statements we have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of weyerhaeuser company and subsidiaries (the company)
as of december 31, 2022 and 2021, the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income, cash flows, and changes in equity for each of the years in the three-year period ended december 31, 2022, and the related notes (collectively, the consolidated financial statements). in our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the company as of december 31, 2022
and 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended december 31, 2022, in conformity with u.s. generally accepted accounting principles.
we also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the public company accounting oversight board (united states) (pcaob), the company's internal control over financial reporting as of december 31, 2022, based on criteria established ininternal control - integrated framework (2013)issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission, and our report dated february 17, 2023 expressed an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of the company's internal control over financial reporting.
basis for opinion these consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the company's management. our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audits. we are a public accounting firm registered with the pcaob and are required to be independent with respect to the company in accordance with the u.s. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the securities and exchange commission and the pcaob.
we conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the pcaob. those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. we believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
critical audit matter the critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1)
relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. the communication of a critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.
projected benefit obligations for pensions as discussed in notes 1 and 9 to the consolidated financial statements, the company's projected benefit obligations for pensions were $2,278 million as of december 31, 2022. the company estimates the liability related to their pension plans using actuarial models that include assumptions about the company's discount rates.
we identified the evaluation of the company's projected benefit obligations for pensions as a critical audit matter. this is due to the sensitivity of the obligations to changes in the discount rates used and the subjectivity in evaluating those rates. additionally, the assessment of discount rates required specialized actuarial skills and knowledge.
the following are the primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter. we evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of certain internal controls related to the pension obligation process. this included controls related to the actuarial determination of the discount rates used in the valuation of projected benefit obligations for pensions. these procedures also included analyzing year-over-year changes to the projected cash flows associated with the obligations. additionally, we involved actuarial professionals with specialized skills and knowledge, who assisted in the evaluation of the company's discount rates by:
evaluating the selected yield curves used to determine the discount rates assessing changes in the discount rates from the prior year against changes in published indices evaluating the discount rates based on the projected cash flows compared with those of similar plans.

table of contents notes toconsolidated financial statements note 1: summary of significant accounting policies our significant accounting policies describe:
  our election to be taxed as a real estate investment trust,
  how we report our results,
  changes in how we report our results and
  how we account for certain key items.
our election to be taxed as a real estate investment trust (reit) our company is a reit and reit income can be distributed to shareholders without first paying corporate level tax, substantially eliminating the double taxation on income. we expect to derive most of our reit income from investments in timberlands, including the sale of standing timber through pay-as-cut sales contracts and lump sum timber deeds. we continue to be required to pay federal corporate income taxes on earnings of our taxable reit subsidiaries (trss), which include our wood products segment and portions of our timberlands and real estate, energy and natural resources (real estate & enr) segments.
how we report our results our report includes:
  consolidated financial statements,
  our business segments,
  estimates,
  fair value measurements and
  foreign currency translation.
consolidated financial statements our consolidated financial statements provide an overall view of our results and financial condition. they include our accounts and the accounts of entities that we control, including:
  majority-owned domestic and foreign subsidiaries and
  variable interest entities in which we are the primary beneficiary.
they do not include our intercompany transactions and accounts, which are eliminated.
throughout thesenotes to consolidated financial statements, unless specified otherwise, references to
"weyerhaeuser," "the company," "we" and "our" refer to the consolidated company.
our business segments reportable business segments are determined based on the company's "management approach," as defined by financial accounting standards board (fasb) accounting standards codification (asc) topic 280,segment reporting. the management approach is based on the way the chief operating decision maker organizes the segments within a company for making decisions about resources to be allocated and assessing their performance.
we are principally engaged in:
  growing and harvesting timber;
  maximizing the value of our acreage through the sale of higher and better use (hbu) properties and monetizing the value of surface and subsurface assets through leases and royalties and
  manufacturing, distributing and selling products made from trees.
our business segments are organized based primarily on products and services.
segment            products and services timberlands        logs, timber, recreational leases and other products.
real estate & enr  real estate (sales of timberlands) and enr (rights to explore for and extract hard minerals, construction materials, natural gas production, wind and solar).

table of contents we also transfer raw materials, semi-finished materials and end products among our business segments. because of this intracompany activity, accounting for our business segments involves pricing products transferred between our business segments at current market values.
unallocated items are gains or charges not related to, or allocated to, an individual operating segment. they include all or a portion of items such as share-based compensation, pension and post-employment costs, elimination of intersegment profit in inventory and lifo, foreign exchange transaction gains and losses, interest income and other as well as legacy obligations such as environmental remediation and workers compensation.
estimates we prepare our financial statements according to u.s. generally accepted accounting principles (u.s. gaap). this requires us to make estimates and assumptions during our reporting periods and at the date of our financial statements. the estimates and assumptions affect our:
  reported amounts of assets, liabilities and equity;
  disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities and
  reported amounts of revenues and expenses.
while we do our best in preparing these estimates, actual results can and do differ from those estimates and assumptions.
fair value measurements we use a fair value hierarchy in accounting for certain nonfinancial assets and liabilities including:
  long-lived assets (asset groups) measured at fair value for an impairment assessment;
  pension plan assets measured at fair value and
  asset retirement obligations initially measured at fair value.
the fair value hierarchy is based on inputs to valuation techniques that are used to measure fair value that are either observable or unobservable. observable inputs reflect assumptions market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability based on market data obtained from independent sources while unobservable inputs reflect a reporting entity's pricing based upon its own market assumptions.
the fair value hierarchy consists of the following three levels:
  level 1: inputs are unadjusted quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities traded in an active market.
  level 2: inputs are quoted prices in non-active markets for which pricing inputs are observable either directly or indirectly at the reporting date.
  level 3: inputs are derived from valuation techniques in which one or more significant inputs or value drivers are unobservable.
foreign currency translation we translate foreign currencies into u.s. dollars in two ways:
  assets and liabilities - at the exchange rates in effect as of our balance sheet date and
  revenues and expenses - at average monthly exchange rates throughout the year.
changes in how we report our results changes in how we report our results come from:
  reclassification of certain balances and results from prior years to make them consistent with our current reporting and
  accounting changes made upon our adoption of new accounting guidance.
reclassifications we have reclassified certain balances and results from prior years to be consistent with our 2022
reporting. this makes balances comparable from year to year. our reclassifications had no effect on consolidated net earnings or equity.
how we account for certain key items this section provides information about how we account for certain key items related to:
  capital investments,
  financing our business and
  our operations.
items related to capital investments key items related to accounting for capital investments pertain to property and equipment, timber and timberlands and impairment of long-lived assets.
weyerhaeuser company >2022 annual report and form 10-k67
table of contents property and equipment we maintain property accounts on an individual asset basis and account for them as follows:
  improvements to and replacements of major units of property are capitalized.
  maintenance, repairs and minor replacements are expensed.
  depreciation is calculated using a straight-line method at rates based on estimated service lives.
  costs associated with logging roads that we intend to utilize for a period longer than one year are capitalized. these roads are then amortized over an estimated service life.
  cost and accumulated depreciation of property sold or retired are removed from the accounts and the gain or loss is included in earnings.
timber and timberlands we carry timber and timberlands at cost less depletion. depletion refers to the carrying value of timber that is harvested or sold.
key activities affecting how we account for timber and timberlands include:
  reforestation,
  depletion and
  forest management in canada.
reforestation.generally, we capitalize initial site preparation and planting costs as reforestation and then expense costs after the first planting as they are incurred or over the period of expected benefit. these expensed costs include:
  fertilization,
  vegetation and insect control,
  pruning and precommercial thinning and
  property taxes.
accounting practices for these costs do not change when timber becomes merchantable and harvesting starts.
timber depletion.to determine depletion rates, we divide the net carrying value of timber by the related volume of timber estimated to be available over the growth cycle. to determine the growth cycle volume of timber, we consider:
  regulatory and environmental constraints,
  our management strategies,
  inventory data improvements,
  growth rate revisions and recalibrations and
  known dispositions and inoperable acres.
in addition, the duration of the harvest cycle varies by geographic region and species of timber.
depletion rate calculations do not include estimates for:
  future silviculture or sustainable forest management costs associated with existing stands;
  future reforestation costs associated with a stand's final harvest and
  future volume in connection with the replanting of a stand subsequent to its final harvest.
we include the cost of timber harvested in the carrying values of raw materials and product inventories. as these inventories are sold to third parties, we include them in costs of sales.
forest management in canada.we manage timberlands under long-term licenses in various canadian provinces that are:
  granted by the provincial governments;
  granted for initial periods of 15 to 25 years and
  renewable provided we meet reforestation, operating and management guidelines.
calculation of the fees we pay on the timber we harvest:
  varies from province to province,
  is tied to product market pricing and
  depends upon the allocation of land management responsibilities in the license.
weyerhaeuser company >2022 annual report and form 10-k68
table of contents impairment of long-lived assets we review the carrying value of long-lived assets whenever an event or a change in circumstance indicates that the carrying value of the asset or asset group may not be recoverable through future operations. the carrying value is the original cost, less accumulated depreciation and any past impairments recorded. impaired assets held for use are written down to fair value, while impaired assets held for sale are written down to fair value less cost to sell. we determine fair value based on:
  appraisals,
  market pricing of comparable assets,
  discounted value of estimated future cash flows from the asset,
  replacement values of comparable assets and
  agreed upon sale price or offer price.
items related to financing our business key items related to financing our business include financial instruments, cash equivalents and concentration of risk.
financial instruments we estimate the fair value of financial instruments where appropriate. the assumptions we use
- including the discount rate and estimates of cash flows - can significantly affect the fair value. these values are estimates and may not match the amounts we would realize upon sale or settlement of our financial positions.
cash equivalents cash equivalents are investments with maturities of 90 days or less at the date of purchase. we state cash equivalents at cost, which approximates market.
concentration of risk we disclose customers that represent a concentration of risk. as of december 31, 2022, and december 31, 2021, no customer accounted for 10 percent or more of our net sales.
items related to operations key items related to operations include revenue recognition, inventories, shipping and handling costs, income taxes, pension and other post-employment benefit plans and environmental remediation.
revenue recognition refer to note 3: revenue recognition for details on how we account for revenue.
inventories we state inventories at the lower of cost or net realizable value. cost includes labor, materials and production overhead. lifo applies to major inventory products held at our u.s. domestic locations. we began to use the lifo method for domestic products in the 1940s as required to conform with the tax method elected. subsequent acquisitions of entities added new products under the moving average cost or fifo - the first-in, first-out -
methods and those products continue to be recognized under those methods. the moving average cost or fifo method applies to the balance of our domestic raw material and product inventories, all material and supply inventories and all foreign inventories.
shipping and handling costs we classify shipping and handling costs in "costs of sales" in our consolidated statement of operations .
income taxes we account for income taxes under the asset and liability method. unrecognized tax benefits represent potential future funding obligations to taxing authorities if uncertain tax positions we have taken on previously filed tax returns are not sustained. accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits are recognized as a component of income tax expense.
we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities to reflect:
  future tax consequences due to differences between the carrying amounts for financial reporting purposes and the tax bases of certain items and
  net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards.
to measure deferred tax assets and liabilities, we:
  determine when the differences between carrying amounts and tax bases of affected items are expected to be recovered or resolved and
  use enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in those years.
weyerhaeuser company >2022 annual report and form 10-k69
table of contents pension and other post-employment benefit plans we recognize the overfunded or underfunded status of our defined benefit pension and other post-employment plans on ourconsolidated balance sheetand recognize changes in the funded status through comprehensive income (loss) in the year in which the changes occur.
actuarial valuations determine the amount of the pension and other post-employment benefit obligations and the net periodic benefit cost we recognize. the net periodic benefit cost includes:
  cost of benefits provided in exchange for employees' services rendered during the year;
  interest cost of the obligations;
  expected long-term return on plan assets;
  gains or losses on plan settlements and curtailments;
amortization of prior service costs and plan amendments over the average remaining service period of the
  active employee group covered by the plans or the average remaining life expectancy in situations where the participants affected by the plan amendment are inactive and amortization of cumulative unrecognized net actuarial gains and losses - generally in excess of 10 percent of the greater of the benefit obligation or the combination of market-related and fair value of plan assets
  at the beginning of the year - over the average remaining service period of the active employee group covered by the plans or the average remaining life expectancy in situations where the plan participants are inactive.
pension plans.we have defined benefit pension plans covering approximately half of our employees. determination of benefits differs for salaried, hourly and union employees as follows:
  salaried employee benefits are based on each employee's highest monthly earnings for five consecutive years during the final 10 years before retirement.
  hourly and union employee benefits generally are stated amounts for each year of service.
  union employee benefits are set through collective-bargaining agreements.
we contribute to our u.s. and canadian pension plans according to established funding standards. the funding standards for the plans are:
  u.s. pension plans - according to the employee retirement income security act of 1974 and
  canadian pension plans - according to the applicable provincial pension act and the income tax act.
post-employment benefits other than pensions.we provide certain post-employment healthcare and life insurance benefits for some retired employees. in some cases, we pay a portion of the cost of the benefit.note 9: pension and other post-employment benefit plansprovides additional information about our post-employment benefit plans.
estimates for pension and other post-employment benefit plans.estimates we use in accounting for our pension and other post-employment benefit plans include the:
  fair value of our plan assets;
  expected long-term rate of return on plan assets and
  discount rates.
at the end of every year, we review our estimates with external advisers and make adjustments as appropriate. we use these estimates to calculate plan asset and liability information as of year-end as well as pension and post-
employment expense for the following year. actual experience that differs from our estimates and subsequent changes in our estimates could have a significant effect on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.
fair value of plan assets.plan assets are assets of the pension plan trusts that fund the benefits provided under the pension plans. the fair value of our plan assets estimates the amount that would be received if we were to sell each asset in an orderly transaction between market participants at the reporting date. we estimate the fair value of these assets based on the information available during the year-end reporting process.
refer tonote 9: pension and other post-employment benefit plansfor information about the assets held within our pension plans and their related valuation methods.
expected long-term rate of return on plan assets.our expected long-term rate of return is our estimate of the return that our plan assets will earn over time. this rate is used in determining the net periodic benefit or cost we recognize for our plans.
factors we consider in determining our expected long-term rate of return include:
  historical returns for a portfolio of assets similar to our expected allocation and
  expected future performance of similar asset classes.
weyerhaeuser company >2022 annual report and form 10-k70
table of contents the actual return on plan assets in any given year may vary from our expected long-term rate of return. actual returns on plan assets affect the funded status of the plans. differences between actual returns on plan assets and the expected long-term rate of return are reflected as adjustments to accumulated other comprehensive loss, a component of total equity.
discount rates.discount rates are used to estimate the net present value of our plan obligations. the discount rates are determined at the measurement date by matching current spot rates of high-quality corporate bonds with maturities similar to the timing of expected cash outflows for benefits.
environmental remediation we accrue losses associated with environmental remediation obligations when such losses are probable and reasonably estimable. future expenditures for environmental remediation obligations are not discounted to their present value. recoveries of environmental remediation costs from other parties are recorded as assets when the recovery is deemed probable and does not exceed the amount of losses previously recorded.

note 3: revenue recognition a majority of our revenue is derived from sales of delivered logs and manufactured wood products. we account for revenue in accordance with asc topic 606,revenue from contracts with customers.
performance obligations a performance obligation, as defined in asc topic 606, is a promise in a contract to transfer a distinct good or service to a customer. a contract's transaction price is allocated to each distinct performance obligation and recognized as revenue at the point in time, or over the period, in which the performance obligation is satisfied. performance obligations associated with delivered log sales are typically satisfied when the logs are delivered to our customers' mills or delivered to an ocean vessel in the case of export sales.
performance obligations associated with the sale of wood products are typically satisfied when the products are shipped. we have elected, as an accounting policy, to treat shipping and handling that is performed after a customer obtains control of the product as an activity required to fulfill the promise to transfer the good;
therefore we will not evaluate this requirement as a separate performance obligation. customers are generally invoiced shortly after logs are delivered or after wood products are shipped, with payment generally due within a month or less of the invoice date. asc topic 606 requires entities to consider significant financing components of contracts with customers, though allows for the use of a practical expedient when the period between satisfaction of a performance obligation and payment receipt is one year or less. given the nature of our revenue transactions, we have elected to utilize this practical expedient. performance obligations associated with real estate sales are generally met when placed into escrow and all conditions of closing have been satisfied. contract estimates substantially all of our performance obligations are satisfied as of a point in time. therefore, there is little judgment in determining when control transfers for our business segments as described above. the transaction price for log sales generally equals the amount billed to our customer for logs delivered during the accounting period.
for the limited number of log sales subject to a long-term supply agreement, the transaction price is variable but is known at the time of billing. for wood products sales, the transaction price is generally the amount billed to the customer for the products shipped but may be reduced slightly for estimated cash discounts and rebates. there are no significant contract estimates related to the real estate business. weyerhaeuser company > 2022 annual report and form 10-k 72 table of contents contract balances in general, customers are billed and a receivable is recorded as we ship and/or deliver wood products and logs. we generally receive payment shortly after products have been received by our customers. contract asset and liability balances are immaterial. for real estate sales, the company receives the entire consideration in cash at closing.

note 5: net earnings per share our basic and diluted earnings per share for the last three years were:
  $2.53 in 2022,
  $3.48 and $3.47, respectively, in 2021 and
  $1.07 in 2020.
how we calculate basic and diluted net earnings per share basic earnings per share is net earnings available to common shareholders divided by the weighted average number of our outstanding common shares, including stock equivalent units where there is no circumstance under which those shares would not be issued.
diluted earnings per share is net earnings available to common shareholders divided by the sum of the:
  weighted average number of our outstanding common shares and
  the effect of our outstanding dilutive potential common shares.
dilutive potential common shares may include:
  outstanding stock options,
  restricted stock units and
  performance share units.

note 8: related parties this note provides details about our transactions with related parties. for the years presented, our material related parties have consisted of variable interest entities.
from 2002 through 2004, we sold certain nonstrategic timberlands. as a result of these sales, buyer-sponsored and monetization variable interest entities, or special purpose entities (spes), were formed. we were the primary beneficiary and consolidated the assets and liabilities of the spes involved in these transactions.
the assets of the buyer-sponsored spes were financial investments which consisted of bank guarantees. these bank guarantees were in turn backed by bank notes, which were the liabilities of the monetization spes. interest earned from the financial investments within the buyer-sponsored spes was used to pay interest accrued on the corresponding monetization spe's note.
we had an equity interest in the monetization spes, but no ownership interest in the buyer-sponsored spes. the following disclosures refer to assets of buyer-sponsored spes and liabilities of monetization spes. however, because these spes were distinct legal entities:
  assets of the spes were not available to satisfy our liabilities or obligations.
  liabilities of the spes were not our liabilities or obligations.
during first quarter 2020, we received $362million in proceeds from our final buyer-sponsored spe at maturity. the weighted average interest rate on our buyer-sponsored spe was5.5percent during 2020.
note 9: pension and other post-employment benefit plans this note provides details about defined benefit and defined contribution plans we sponsor for our employees. the

table of contents defined benefit plans we sponsor overview of plans the defined benefit pension plans we sponsor in the u.s. and canada differ according to each country's requirements. in the u.s., we have plans that qualify under the internal revenue code (qualified plans), as well as plans for select employees that provide additional benefits not qualified under the internal revenue code
(nonqualified plans). in canada, we have plans that are registered under the income tax act and applicable provincial pension acts (registered plans), as well as nonregistered plans for select employees that provide additional benefits that may not be registered under the income tax act or provincial pension acts (nonregistered plans). we also sponsor other post-employment benefit (opeb) plans in the u.s. and canada, including retiree medical and life insurance plans.
we sponsor various defined contribution plans for our u.s. and canadian salaried and hourly employees. our contributions to these plans were $31million, $27million and $27million in 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively.
actions to reduce pension plan obligations as part of our continued efforts to reduce pension plan obligations, we transferred approximately $420million of canadian registered assets and liabilities and approximately $790million of u.s. qualified pension plan assets and liabilities to insurance companies through the purchase of group annuity contracts in december 2022 (2022 retiree annuity purchase) and december 2020 (2020 retiree annuity purchase), respectively. in connection with these transactions, we recorded noncash pretax settlement charges of $205million and $253million during 2022 and 2020, respectively. these settlement charges accelerated the recognition of previously unrecognized losses in
"accumulated other comprehensive loss," that would have been recognized in subsequent periods. given the timing of the 2022 and 2020 retiree annuity purchases, the plan remeasurements triggered as a result of the transactions were conducted as part of our annual valuation process.

  canadian pension trust - funds our canadian registered pension plans and
  retirement compensation arrangements - fund a portion of our canadian nonregistered pension plans.
u.s. and canadian pension trusts in 2018, we began to shift pension plan assets to an allocation that more closely aligns with our pension plan liability profile. our former investment strategy included investments primarily in hedge funds and private equity funds. these asset classes are now in redemption and run-off mode. however, given the long-term nature of these investments, they will continue to comprise a portion of the plan assets for several years. we expect all investments in redemption to be redeemed at amounts materially consistent with their net asset values (nav). as these investments are redeemed or liquidated, cash proceeds available for investment will be invested in accordance with our revised investment strategy.
the revised investment strategy targets a percentage allocation to growth assets and a percentage allocation to liability hedging assets based on each plan's funded status. we expect to increase the allocation to liability hedging assets over time as the funded status of the pension plan improves. growth assets include investments in global equities, hedge funds (which are in redemption) and private equity assets (which are in run-off mode).
liability hedging assets include corporate credit and government issued fixed income securities as well as treasury futures selected to align with the plan liabilities.
in december 2021, we entered into an agreement to sell certain private equity and hedge fund investments to a third party for $189million (2021 secondary sale) in accordance with our investment strategy. a majority of the assets were transferred to the buyer by year-end 2021. the balance of the assets included in the sale were held at the purchase price as of year-end 2021 and subsequently transferred in 2022 in accordance with the agreement.

(1) cash and short-term investments are valued at cost, which approximates market. the increased cash holding at year-end 2021 was a result of the 2021 secondary sale transaction timing. refer to "u.s. and canadian pension trusts" above for further information.
(2) public equity investments are valued at exit prices quoted in active markets.
(3) fixed income investments include publicly traded corporate and government issued debt. these bonds have varying maturities, credit quality and sector exposure and are selected to align with the duration of our plan liabilities.
additionally, our fixed income portfolio includes repurchase agreements, which represent short-term borrowings to hedge against interest rate risk. we have an obligation to return the cash related to these borrowings in accordance with the agreements, which are collateralized by our government bonds. fixed income investments are valued at exit prices quoted in active or non-active markets or based on observable inputs.
(4) hedge funds and related investments are privately-offered managed pools primarily structured as limited liability entities. general members or partners of these limited liability entities serve as portfolio managers and are thus responsible for the fund's underlying investment decisions. underlying investments within these funds may include long and short public and private equities, corporate, mortgage and sovereign debt, options, swaps, forwards and other derivative positions. these funds have varying degrees of leverage, liquidity and redemption provisions.
(5) these investments are primarily valued based on the navs of the funds. these values represent the per-unit price at which new investors are permitted to invest and existing investors are permitted to exit. when navs as of the end of the year have not been received, we estimate fair value by adjusting the most recently reported navs for market events and cash flows between the interim date and the end of the year.
(6) private equity and related investments include both investments in private equity and investments in mezzanine distressed, co-investments and other structures. private equity funds generally participate in buyout and venture capital strategies through unlisted equity and debt instruments. these funds may also borrow at the underlying entity level. mezzanine and distressed funds generally invest in the debt of public or private companies with additional participation through warrants or other equity options.
(7) derivative instruments have historically been comprised of swaps, futures, forwards or options. consistent with our shift in asset strategy, our positions in derivative instruments have been significantly reduced. at december
31, 2022, only a small amount of futures remain in our portfolio. derivative instruments are valued based upon valuation statements received from each derivative's counterparty.
retirement compensation arrangements retirement compensation arrangements fund a portion of our canadian nonregistered pension plans. as required by canadian tax rules, approximately 50 percent of these assets are invested into a non-interest bearing refundable tax account held by the canada revenue agency. this portion of the portfolio does not earn returns. the remaining portion is invested in a portfolio of equities.
managing risk investments and contracts are subject to risks including market price, interest rate, credit, currency and liquidity risks. we mitigate these risks to our pension plan asset portfolios through investment in diversified portfolios, inclusion of fixed income investments that align with plan liabilities and investment in assets designed to address both currency and liquidity considerations. in addition, we and our investment advisers perform regular monitoring with ongoing qualitative assessments, quantitative assessments and investment and operational due diligence.
valuation of our plan assets pension assets are stated at fair value or nav. fair value is based on the amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to settle a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the reporting date. we consider both observable and unobservable inputs that reflect assumptions applied by market participants when setting the exit price of an asset or liability in an orderly transaction within the principal market for that asset or liability.
we value the pension plan assets based upon the observability of exit pricing inputs and classify pension plan assets based upon the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement of the pension plan assets in their entirety. refer tonote 1: summary of significant accounting policiesfor details on the fair value hierarchy.

the availability of observable market data is monitored to assess the appropriate classification of financial instruments within the fair value hierarchy. changes in economic conditions or model-based valuation techniques may require the transfer of financial instruments from one fair value level to another. in such instances, the transfer is reported at the beginning of the reporting period. we evaluate the significance of transfers between levels based upon the nature of the financial instrument and size of the transfer relative to total net assets available for benefits.

(1) for the u.s. defined benefit plans, the discount rate assumption was 2.90 %, 2.50 % and 3.40 % for 2022, 2021
and 2020, respectively. for the canadian defined benefit plans, the discount rate assumption was 3.10 %, 2.50 % and
3.10 % for 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. for u.s. opeb plans, the discount rate assumption was 2.60 %, 2.10 %
and 3.00 %, for 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. for canadian opeb plans, the discount rate assumption was 3.00
%, 2.40 % and 3.00 % for 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. for lump sum distributions (for u.s. qualified salaried and nonqualified plans only), the discount rate assumption was based on the ppa phased table: interest and mortality assumptions as mandated by the pension protection act of 2006.
(2) determining our expected return requires a high degree of judgment. we consider actual pension fund asset performance over multiple years, and current and expected valuation levels in the global equity and credit markets.
historical fund returns are used as a base and we place added weight on more recent pension plan asset performance.
(3) for the u.s. defined benefit plans, the rate of compensation increase assumption for 2022, 2021 and 2020 was between 2.00 % - 13.00 % for salaried participants and was decreasing with participant age. for the canadian defined benefit plans, the rate of compensation increase assumption for salaried participants was 3.25 % for 2022,
2021 and 2020. the rate of compensation increase assumption for hourly participants was 3.00 % for 2022, 2021 and
2020.
(4) u.s. qualified salaried and nonqualified plans only.
(5) for opeb plans during 2022, the assumed weighted healthcare cost trend rate was 6.20 %, 4.50 % and 5.30 % for u.s. pre-medicare participants, u.s. hra participants and canadian opeb plans, respectively.
pension plan contributions and benefit payments established funding standards govern the funding requirements for our qualified and registered pension plans. we fund the benefit payments of our nonqualified and nonregistered plans as benefit payments come due.
during 2022, we made contributions and/or benefit payments of $13million for our u.s. nonqualified pension plans,
$2million for our canadian nonregistered pension plans and $2million for our canadian registered plans.
during 2023, based on estimated year-end asset values and projections of plan liabilities, we expect to make contributions and/or benefit payments of approximately:
  $12 million for our u.s. nonqualified pension plans,
  $2 million for the canadian non-registered plans and
  $2 million for our canadian registered plan (required contribution).
we do not anticipate contributions being required for our u.s. qualified pension plan for 2023.

these plans have different risks than single-employer plans. our contributions may be used to fund benefits for employees of other participating employers. if we choose to stop participating, we may be required to pay a withdrawal liability based on the underfunded status of the plan.if another participating employer stops contributing to the plan, we may become responsible for remaining plan unfunded obligations.

fair value (level 2)                    $         4,918    $         6,221
to estimate the fair value of fixed rate long-term debt, we used the market approach, which is based on quoted market prices we received for the same types and issues of our debt. we believe that our line of credit has a net carrying value that approximates its fair value within an insignificant difference. the inputs to the valuations of our long-term debt are based on market data obtained from independent sources or information derived principally from observable market data. the difference between the fair value and the carrying value represents the theoretical net premium or discount we would pay or receive to retire all debt at the measurement date.
fair value of other financial instruments we believe that our other financial instruments, including cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, mutual fund investments held in grantor trusts, receivables and payables, have net carrying values that approximate their fair values with only insignificant differences. this is primarily due to the short-term nature of these instruments and the allowance for doubtful accounts.
note 14: legal proceedings, commitments and contingencies this note provides details about our:
  legal proceedings,
  environmental matters and
  commitments and other contingencies.
legal proceedings we are party to various legal proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business. we are not currently a party to any legal proceeding that management believes could have a material adverse effect on ourconsolidated balance sheet,consolidated statement of operationsorconsolidated statement of cash flows.
environmental matters site remediation under the federal comprehensive environmental response, compensation and liability act (cercla) - commonly known as the "superfund" - and similar state laws, we are a party to various proceedings related to the cleanup of hazardous waste sites and have been notified that we may be a potentially responsible party related to the cleanup of other hazardous waste sites for which proceedings have not yet been initiated.
we have received notification from the environmental protection agency (epa) and have acknowledged that we are a potentially responsible party in a portion of the kalamazoo river superfund site in southwest michigan. our involvement in the remediation site is based on our operation of the plainwell, michigan mill, located within the remediation site, from 1954 to 1970. several other companies also have been deemed potentially responsible parties as past or present owners or operators of facilities within the site, or as arrangers under cercla.
we cooperated with other parties to jointly implement an administrative order issued by the epa on april 14, 2016, with respect to a portion of the site comprising a stretch of the river approximately 1.7 miles long referred to as the otsego township dam area. during third quarter 2018, implementation of this administrative order was completed.
in 2010, the company, along with others, was named as a defendant by georgia-pacific consumer products lp, fort james corporation and georgia-pacific llc in an action seeking contribution under cercla for remediation costs relating to a certain area within the site. on march 29, 2018, the u.s. district court issued an opinion and order assigning the company responsibility for5percent of approximately $50million in past costs incurred by the plaintiffs. the remaining95percent of this pool of past costs incurred was allocated to the plaintiffs and other defendants. the opinion and order does not establish allocation for future remediation costs, and accordingly, we may incur additional costs in connection with future remediation tasks for other areas of the site.
in 2022, the sixth circuit court of appeals reversed the district court opinion, finding that georgia-pacific's claims for cost contributions were time barred by the statute of limitations. georgia-pacific has filed a petition for writ of certiorari with the u.s. supreme court.

we change our accrual to reflect:
  new information on any site concerning implementation of remediation alternatives,
  updates on prior cost estimates and new sites and
  costs incurred to remediate sites.
estimates.we believe it is reasonably possible, based on currently available information and analysis, that remediation costs for all identified sites may exceed our existing accruals by up to $134million. this estimate, in which those additional costs may be incurred over several years, is the upper end of the range of reasonably possible additional costs. the estimate:
  is much less certain than the estimates on which our accruals currently are based and
  uses assumptions that are less favorable to us among the range of reasonably possible outcomes.
in estimating our current accruals and the possible range of additional future costs, we:
  assumed we will not bear the entire cost of remediation of every site,
  took into account the ability of other potentially responsible parties to participate and
  considered each party's financial condition and probable contribution on a per-site basis.
we have not recorded any amounts for potential recoveries from insurance carriers.
asset retirement obligations we have obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long-lived assets consisting primarily of reforestation obligations related to forest management licenses in canada and obligations to close and cap landfills. some of our sites have asbestos containing materials. we have met our current legal obligation to identify and manage these materials. in situations where we cannot reasonably determine when asbestos containing materials might be removed from the sites, we have not recorded an accrual because the fair value of the obligation cannot be reasonably estimated. as of december 31, 2022, and december 31, 2021, we had an asset retirement obligation of$32million and$33million, respectively.these obligations are recorded in "accrued liabilities" and

note 16: share-based compensation this note provides details about:
  our long-term incentive compensation plan (2022 plan),
  how we account for share-based awards,
  tax benefits of share-based awards,
  types of share-based compensation,
  unrecognized share-based compensation and
  deferred compensation stock equivalent units.
share-based compensation expense was:
  $33 million in 2022,
  $30 million in 2021 and
  $30 million in 2020.
our long-term incentive compensation plan our long-term incentive plan provides for share-based awards that include:
  restricted stock,
  restricted stock units (rsus),
  performance shares, weyerhaeuser company >2022 annual report and form 10-k89

  performance share units (psus),
  stock options and
  stock appreciation rights (sars).
we may issue future grants of up to22million shares under the 2022 plan. we also have the right to reissue forfeited and expired grants.
for stock options and sars:
  an individual participant may receive a grant of up to 2 million shares in any one calendar year.
  the exercise price is required to be the market price on the date of the grant.
we have not granted any stock options or sars since 2016 and the remaining liability related to sars is immaterial at december 31, 2022.
the compensation committee of our board of directors annually establishes an overall pool of stock awards available for grants based on performance.
for stock-settled awards we:
  issue new stock into the marketplace and
  generally do not repurchase shares in connection with issuing new awards.
our common shares would increase by approximately26million shares if all share-based awards were exercised or vested. these include:
  all options, rsus and psus outstanding at december 31, 2022, and
  all remaining options, rsus and psus that could be granted under the 2022 plan.
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
how we account for share-based awards when accounting for share-based awards we:
  use a fair-value-based measurement and
  recognize the cost of share-based awards in our consolidated financial statements.
we recognize the cost of share-based awards in ourconsolidated statement of operationsover the required service period - generally the period from the date of the grant to the date when it is fully vested. special situations include:
  awards that vest upon retirement - the required service period ends on the date an employee is eligible for retirement, including early retirement.
  awards that continue to vest following job elimination or the sale of a business - the required service period ends on the date the employment from the company is terminated.
in these special situations, compensation expense from share-based awards is recognized over a period that is shorter than the stated vesting period.
tax benefits of share-based awards our total income tax benefit from share-based awards recognized in ourconsolidated statement of operationsfor the last three years was:
  $5 million in 2022,
  $4 million in 2021 and
  $4 million in 2020.
tax benefits from share-based awards are accrued as stock compensation expense and realized when:
  restricted shares and rsus vest,
  performance shares and psus vest,
  stock options are exercised and
  sars are exercised.
weyerhaeuser company >2022 annual report and form 10-k90
table of contents types of share-based compensation our share-based compensation is in the form of:
  rsus,
  psus,
  stock options and
  sars.
restricted stock units through the 2022 plan, we award rsus - grants that entitle the holder to shares of our stock as the award vests.
the details our rsus granted in 2022, 2021 and 2020 generally:
  vest ratably over four years;
  immediately vest in the event of death or disability while employed;
continue to vest upon retirement at an age of at least 62, in accordance with the vesting terms of the
  awards, but a portion of the award is forfeited if retirement occurs before the one-year anniversary of the grant;
  continue vesting for one year in the event of involuntary termination due to job elimination;
immediately vest in the case of a change of control, if the successor company does not assume the award or,
  if assumed, within two years of the effective date of the change in control the recipient is terminated other than for cause or leaves for good reason (as defined in the award terms and conditions) and
  will be forfeited upon termination of employment in all other situations including early retirement prior to age 62.
our accounting the fair value of our rsus is the market price of our stock on the grant date of the awards.
we generally record share-based compensation expense for rsus over the four-year vesting period. generally, for rsus that continue to vest following the termination of employment, we record the share-based compensation expense over a required service period that is less than the stated vesting period.

(1) as of december 31, 2022, there were approximately 185 thou sand rsus that had met the requisite service period and will be released as identified in the grant terms.
the weighted average grant-date fair value for rsus was:
  $42.02 in 2022,
  $33.62 in 2021 and
  $30.03 in 2020.
the total grant-date fair value of rsus vested was:
  $22 million in 2022,
  $25 million in 2021 and
  $19 million in 2020.
nonvested rsus accrue dividends that are paid out when rsus vest. any rsus forfeited will not receive dividends.
as rsus vest, a portion of the shares awarded is withheld to cover employee taxes. as a result, the number of stock units vested and the number of common shares issued will differ.

table of contents performance share units through the 2022 plan, we award psus - grants that entitle the holder to shares of our stock as the award vests.
the details the final number of shares granted in 2022, 2021 and 2020 will vest between a range of0percent to150percent of each grant's target, depending upon actual company performance compared against an industry peer group.
the vesting provisions for psus granted in 2022, 2021 and 2020 were generally as follows:
awards granted in 2020 and 2021 vest 100 percent on the third anniversary of the grant date, and awards
  granted in 2022 vest on march 1st following the end of the performance period, in each case as long as the individual remains employed by the company;
  in the event of death or disability while employed, awards continue to be earned and settled based on actual company performance;
upon retirement at an age of at least 62, awards continue to vest in accordance with the vesting terms of
  the award, but a portion of the award is forfeited if retirement occurs before the one-year anniversary of the grant;
  awards continue vesting for one year in the event of involuntary termination due to job elimination and the second anniversary of the grant date has passed;
in the case of a change of control during the performance period, awards are deemed earned at target performance and (i) vest as of the change of control date if the successor company does not assume the award
  or (ii) if assumed, vest upon termination of employment if, within two years of the effective date of the change in control, the recipient is involuntarily terminated other than for cause or leaves for good reason
(as defined in the award terms and conditions);
  awards will be forfeited upon termination of employment in all other situations including early retirement prior to age 62 and
  awards vest at a maximum of 100 percent of target value in the event of negative absolute company total shareholder return (tsr).
our accounting since the awards contain a market condition, the effect of the market condition is reflected in the grant-date fair value which is estimated using a monte carlo simulation model. this model estimates the tsr ranking of the company over the performance period. compensation expense is based on the estimated probable number of earned awards and recognized over the vesting period on an accelerated basis. generally, compensation expense would not be reversed if the market condition is not achieved, provided the requisite service period has been completed.

stock options stock options entitle award recipients to purchase shares of our common stock at a fixed exercise price. we have not granted stock option awards since 2016. when granted in prior years, stock options had an exercise price equal to the market price of our stock on the date of the grant.
the details our stock options generally:
  vest over four years of continuous service,
  must be exercised within 10 years of the grant date and
  use a black-scholes option valuation model to estimate the fair value of every stock option award on its grant date.

  may choose to defer some or all of the remainder of their annual retainer fee into stock equivalent units and
  do not receive a premium for their deferrals.
weyerhaeuser company >2022 annual report and form 10-k93
table of contents employees and directors also choose when the deferrals will be paid out, although no deferrals may be paid until after the separation from service of the employee or director.
our accounting we settle all deferred compensation accounts in cash for our employees. our directors receive shares of common stock as payment for stock equivalent units, except that any directors who are subject to federal or provincial taxation in canada have the choice to receive a cash amount equal to the fair market value of the company's common stock on the date of payment. in addition, we credit all stock equivalent accounts with dividend equivalents. the number of common shares to be issued in the future to directors is565thousand.
stock equivalent units are:
  liability-classified awards and
  remeasured to fair value at every reporting date.
the fair value of a stock equivalent unit is equal to the market price of our stock.

asset impairment during fourth quarter 2022, we recorded a $10million noncash impairment charge related to the planned divestiture of legacy coal assets. the loss was attributable to our real estate & enr segment and was recorded within "other operating costs, net" in ourconsolidated statement of operations.
insurance recovery during fourth quarter 2021, we received a $13million insurance recovery related to property damage and business interruption for certain of our mills in the southern u.s. as a result of severe winter storm damage in first quarter 2021. this recovery was attributable to our wood products segment and was recorded within "other operating costs, net" in ourconsolidated statement of operations.
timber casualty loss in september 2020, forest fires in the state of oregon, commonly referred to as the holiday farm, beachie creek, riverside, and archie creek fires, spread from adjacent lands onto portions of our oregon timberland properties.
based on interpretation of satellite imagery and aerial photography, as well as limited on-site assessments, we estimated that the fires affected approximately125thousand acres of our oregon timberlands. our assessments indicated that the extent of damage varied from tract to tract based on topographical conditions, rate of fire spread, age of the timber and other circumstances. based on these assessments, we expected that the majority of merchantable timber, even if affected by the fires, was likely salvageable if harvested within a reasonable period of time. we believed the majority of pre-merchantable timber affected by the fires would not be able to be salvaged.
in third quarter 2020, we recorded a timber casualty loss of $80million which represented the estimated book value of timber and related assets that could not be salvaged based on information available at that time. the loss was attributable to our timberlands segment and was recorded within "other operating costs, net" in ourconsolidated statement of operations. as of december 31, 2022, all salvage volume has been harvested.

weyerhaeuser company >2022 annual report and form 10-k43
table of contents economic and market conditions affecting our operations our market conditions and the strength of the broader u.s. economy are, and will continue to be, influenced by the trajectory of activity in the u.s. housing and repair and remodel segments, impacts from any future restrictions related to covid-19 or other viral or similar outbreak, inflation trends and interest rates. the demand for sawlogs within our timberlands segment is directly affected by domestic production of wood-based building products. the strength of the u.s. housing market, particularly new residential construction, strongly affects demand in our wood products segment, as does repair and remodeling activity. seasonal weather patterns impact the level of construction activity in the u.s., which in turn affects demand for our logs and wood products. our timberlands segment, specifically the western region, is also affected by export demand and trade policy. japanese housing starts are a key driver of export log demand in japan. the demand for pulpwood from our timberlands segment is directly affected by the production of pulp, paper and oriented strand board (osb) as well as the demand for biofuels, such as wood-burning pellets made from pulpwood. the timberlands segment is also influenced by the availability of harvestable timber. in general, western log markets are highly tensioned by available supply, while southern log markets have more available supply. however, additional mill capacity being added in the u.s. south has led to tightening of markets in certain geographies. our real estate, energy and natural resources segment is affected by a variety of factors, including the general state of the economy, local real estate market conditions, the level of construction activity in the u.s., and evolution of emerging renewable energy and carbon-related markets.
while underlying longer-term fundamentals remain favorable for construction of new housing in the u.s., home sales and building activity have slowed due in part to higher mortgage interest rates, reduced affordability and general macroeconomic conditions. on a seasonally adjusted annual basis, as reported by the u.s. census bureau, housing starts for fourth quarter 2022 averaged 1.4 million units, a 3.2 percent decrease from third quarter 2022. single family starts averaged 0.9 million units, a 4.8 percent decrease from third quarter 2022. multi-family starts averaged 541 thousand units in fourth quarter 2022, which was a 0.6 percent decrease from third quarter 2022. sales of newly built, single family homes averaged a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 605 thousand units for fourth quarter 2022, an increase of 4.4 percent from the prior quarter. over the medium to long-term, we expect continued strength in the u.s. housing construction market, supported by strong demographics in the key homebuying age cohorts, a decade of underbuilding and an aging housing stock.
repair and remodeling expenditures decreased by 0.8 percent from third quarter 2022 to fourth quarter 2022
according to the census bureau advance retail spending report. do-it-yourself activity has been returning to more normalized levels while professionally contracted activities have benefited from larger projects and increases in home equity levels. over the longer term, we expect this sector to return to pre-pandemic growth trends with healthy household balance sheets, elevated home equity and a u.s. housing stock median age of 43 years.
in u.s. wood product markets, demand felt the effects of a slowing housing market and more uncertain economic environment over most of fourth quarter 2022. the random lengths framing lumber composite price averaged $452/mbf and the osb composite averaged $360/msf in fourth quarter 2022. over the course of the fourth quarter, prices declined from $512/mbf to $380/mbf for lumber and from $402/msf to $288/msf for osb.
in western log markets, douglas fir sawlog prices fell by 7.4 percent in fourth quarter 2022 compared with third quarter 2022 as reported by risi log lines based on weyerhaeuser's portfolio mix. overall, domestic prices in the west fell moderately, as mills felt the effects of lower lumber prices, partially offset by continued constraints in log supply. in the south, delivered sawlog prices increased by 1.2 percent in fourth quarter 2022 compared to third quarter 2022 and 4.6 percent from fourth quarter 2021 as reported by timber mart-south, as mills are carrying higher inventories to mitigate log and haul capacity constraints.
currency exchange rates, available supply from other countries and trade policy affect our export businesses.
during fourth quarter 2022, end use demand softened in export markets, partially offset by continued disruptions in global log and lumber supply. in japan, total housing starts increased 0.8 percent year to date through november compared to the same period in 2021, while the key post and beam segment saw a 4.0 percent decrease. an increase in lumber imports from europe to japan placed downward pressure on market conditions. china demand was held back by zero covid-19 policies and general economic conditions, but constraints of supply sources from other countries, particularly russia, supported demand from u.s. producers.
interest rates affect our business primarily through their impact on mortgage rates and housing affordability, their general impact on the economy, and their influence on our capital management activities. actions by the u.s.
federal reserve, the overall condition of the economy, and fluctuations in financial markets are all factors that influence long-term interest rates. 30-year mortgage rates, which are correlated with long-term interest rates, decreased from 6.7 percent at the end of third quarter 2022 to 6.4 percent at the end of the fourth quarter. while mortgage rates fell over the quarter and from a high of over 7 percent in november, the rapid increase in mortgage rates since the end of 2021 has had a negative impact on home affordability and reduced demand for homebuying.
increased inflation affects the cost of our operations across each of our business segments, including costs for raw materials, transportation, energy and labor. the consumer price index increased 6.5 percent year over year in december 2022, primarily due to demand and supply for goods and services, fluctuations in labor markets, and monetary policy set by the u.s. federal reserve. while we can offset some of the impacts of inflation through our sales activities, our operational excellence initiatives and our procurement practices, not all of the costs associated with inflation can be fully mitigated or passed on to the consumer.
the condition of the labor market affects all of our businesses as it relates to our ability to attract and retain employees and contractors. the unemployment rate of 3.5 percent in december 2022 remained near historically low levels and was unchanged from the end of the third quarter.
weyerhaeuser company >2022 annual report and form 10-k44
table of contents labor force participation has increased to 62.3 percent in december 2022, from 61.9 percent in december 2021, but this remains below pre-pandemic levels of over 63 percent.
governments and businesses across the globe are taking action on climate change and are making significant commitments towards reducing greenhouse gas emissions to net zero. achieving these commitments will require governments and companies to take major steps to modify operations, invest in low-carbon activities and purchase offsets to reduce environmental impacts. we believe we are uniquely positioned to help entities achieve these commitments through natural climate solutions, including forest carbon sequestration and carbon capture and storage activities.
in mid-september 2022, weyerhaeuser employee members of the international association of machinists and aerospace workers union commenced a work stoppage affecting the company's operations in washington and oregon. the stoppage involved approximately 1,200 employees and affected four lumber mills in our wood products segment and a portion of our western timberlands operations. this event had a negative impact on our operations for the third and fourth quarter, including reductions in fee harvest volumes and sale volumes for western timberlands, as well as reductions in production volumes and sales volumes for our lumber business. on october 28, 2022, the company announced the successful resolution of the work stoppage and resumed operations.

net sales net sales decreased $17 million - less than 1 percent - primarily due to a $263 million decrease in wood products net sales to unaffiliated customers, primarily attributable to decreased sales volumes across most product lines and decreased realizations for structural lumber and oriented strand board.
this decrease was partially offset by a $222 million increase in timberlands net sales to unaffiliated customers, primarily due to increased sales realizations in the western and southern regions.
costs of sales costs of sales increased $461 million - 8 percent - primarily due to increased freight and raw material costs within our wood products segment, as well as increased logging and hauling costs and increased third party log purchase costs within our timberlands segment.
operating income operating income decreased $563 million - 15 percent - primarily due to a $478 million decrease in consolidated gross margin (see discussion of components above).
net earnings net earnings decreased $727 million - 28 percent - primarily due to:
  the $563 million decrease in operating income discussed above;
  a $276 million pretax charge ($207 million after-tax) related to the early extinguishment of debt (refer to note 12: long-term debt, net) and
  a $235 million increase in non-operating pension and other post-employment benefit costs (refer to note 9:
pension and other post-employment benefit plans).
these decreases were partially offset by a $284 million decrease in income tax expense, as well as a $43 million decrease in interest expense (refer toincome taxesandinterest expense).

obligations(3)
amounts presented for interest payments assume that all long-term debt obligations outstanding as of december 31,
2022 will remain outstanding until maturity.
purchase obligations include agreements to purchase goods or services that are enforceable and legally binding on the company and that specify all significant terms, including: fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed, minimum or variable price provisions and the approximate timing of the transaction. purchase obligations exclude arrangements that the company can cancel without penalty.
the timing of certain payments within this category will be triggered by retirements or other events. these payments can include workers compensation, deferred compensation and banked vacation, among other obligations. when the timing of payment is uncertain, the amounts are included in the total column only. minimum pension funding is required by established funding standards and estimates are not made for 2024 onward. estimated payments of contractually obligated post-employment benefits are not included due to the uncertainty of payment timing.

accounting matters critical accounting policies in the preparation of our financial statements we follow established accounting policies and make estimates that affect both the amounts and timing of the recording of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. some of these estimates require judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain. accounting policies whose application may have a significant effect on the reported results of operations and financial position are considered critical accounting policies.
in accounting, we base our judgments and estimates on:
  historical experience and
  assumptions we believe are appropriate and reasonable under current circumstances.
actual results, however, may differ from the estimated amounts we have recorded.
weyerhaeuser company >2022 annual report and form 10-k54
table of contents our most critical accounting policies relate to our:
  discount rates for pension and post-employment benefit plans;
  potential impairments of long-lived assets and
  contingent liabilities.
details about our other significant accounting policies - what we use and how we estimate - are innote 1: summary of significant accounting policies.
discount rates for pension and post-employment benefit plans discount rates are used to estimate the net present value of our pension and other post-employment plan obligations. these rates are determined at the measurement date by matching current spot rates of high-quality corporate bonds with maturities similar to the timing of expected cash outflows for benefits. the selection of discount rates requires judgment as well as the involvement of actuarial specialists. these specialists assist with selecting yield curves based on published indices for high-quality corporate bonds and projecting the timing and amount of cash flows associated with our obligations to ultimately support our determination of an appropriate discount rate for each plan.
our discount rates as of december 31, 2022 are:
  5.4 percent for our u.s. pension plans - compared with 2.9 percent at december 31, 2021;
  5.4 percent for our u.s. post-employment plans - compared with 2.6 percent at december 31, 2021;
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
  5.3 percent for our canadian pension plans - compared with 3.1 percent at december 31, 2021 and
  5.3 percent for our canadian post-employment plans - compared with 3.0 percent at december 31, 2021.
pension expenses for 2023 will be based on the 5.4 percent and 5.3 percent assumed discount rates for the u.s.
pension plans and the canadian pension plans, respectively, and the 5.4 percent and 5.3 percent assumed discount rates for the u.s. and canadian post-employment benefit plans, respectively.
our discount rates are important in determining the cost of our plans. a 50 basis point decrease in our discount rate would increase expense or reduce a credit by approximately:
  $10 million for our u.s. qualified pension plans and
  $1 million for our canadian registered pension plans.
impairment of long-lived assets we review the carrying value of long-lived assets whenever an event or a change in circumstance indicates that the carrying value of the asset or asset group may not be recoverable through future operations. the carrying value is the original cost, less accumulated depreciation and any past impairments recorded.
if we evaluate recoverability, we are required to estimate future cash flows and residual values of the asset or asset group. key assumptions used in developing these estimates would include probability of alternative outcomes, product pricing, raw material cost and product sales.
an impairment occurs when the carrying value of a long-lived asset is greater than the amount that could be recovered from the estimated future cash flows of the asset and greater than fair market value (the amount we could receive if we were to sell the asset).key assumptions used in developing estimates of fair value would include the estimated future cash flows used to assess recoverability, discount rates and probability of alternative outcomes.
contingent liabilities we are subject to lawsuits, investigations and other claims related to environmental, product and other matters, and are required to assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes to these matters, as well as the amount or range of potential loss.
we record contingent liabilities when:
  it becomes probable that a loss has been incurred and
  the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated.
assessing probability of loss and estimating the amount of loss can require analysis of multiple factors, such as:
  historical experience,
  evaluations of relevant legal and environmental authorities and regulations,
  judgments about the potential actions of third-party claimants and courts and
  consideration of potential environmental remediation methods.
in addition to contingent liabilities recorded for probable losses, we disclose contingent liabilities when there is a reasonable possibility that a loss may have been incurred.
weyerhaeuser company >2022 annual report and form 10-k55
table of contents recorded contingent liabilities are based on the best information available and actual losses in any future period are inherently uncertain. if estimated probable future losses or actual losses exceed our recorded liability for such claims, we record additional charges. these exposures and proceedings can be significant and the ultimate negative outcomes could be material to our operating results or cash flows in any given quarter or year. seenote

performance measures we use adjusted ebitda as a key performance measure to evaluate the performance of the consolidated company and our business segments. this measure should not be considered in isolation from, and is not intended to represent an alternative to, our results reported in accordance with u.s. generally accepted accounting principles (u.s. gaap).
however, we believe adjusted ebitda provides meaningful supplemental information for our investors about our operating performance, better facilitates period to period comparisons and is widely used by analysts, lenders, rating agencies and other interested parties. our definition of adjusted ebitda may be different from similarly titled measures reported by other companies. adjusted ebitda, as we define it, is operating income adjusted for depreciation, depletion, amortization, basis of real estate sold and special items.

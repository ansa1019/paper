item 1a. risk factors as a global manufacturer of paints, coatings and specialty materials, we operate in a business environment that includes risks. each of the risks described in this section could adversely affect our results of operations, financial position and liquidity. while the factors listed here are considered to be the more significant factors, no such list should be considered to be a complete statement of all potential risks and uncertainties. unlisted factors may present significant additional obstacles which may adversely affect our businesses and our results of operations, financial position and liquidity.
economic risks the effects of the covid-19 pandemic have negatively impacted and are continuing to adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations.
the effects of the public health crisis caused by covid-19 have interfered with the ability of ppg, our suppliers, customers, and others to conduct business and have negatively affected consumer confidence and the global economy. public health officials have recommended or mandated certain precautions to mitigate the spread of covid-19, including prohibitions on congregating in groups, shelter-in-place orders, vaccination requirements or similar measures. preventative and protective actions that public health officials, governments or ppg have taken with respect to covid-19 have and will continue to adversely impact our business, suppliers, distribution channels, and customers, including business shutdowns or disruptions for an indefinite period of time, reduced operations, reduced workforce availability, reduced ability to supply products, or reduced demand for our products. our financial condition, liquidity and results of operations have been and will continue to be adversely impacted by these preventative actions and the disruption to our business and that of our suppliers and customers. as we cannot predict the duration or scope of covid-19, the negative financial impact to our business cannot be reasonably estimated, but could be material.
increases in prices and declines in the availability of raw materials could negatively impact our financial results.
our financial results are significantly affected by the cost of raw materials. raw materials include both organic, primarily petroleum-derived, materials and inorganic materials, including titanium dioxide. these raw materials represent ppg's single largest production cost component.
while not our customary practice, we also import raw materials and intermediates, particularly for use at our manufacturing facilities in the emerging regions of the world. in most cases, those imports are priced in the currency of the supplier and, therefore, if that currency strengthens against the currency of our manufacturing facility, our margins may be lower.
most of our raw materials are purchased from outside sources, and the company has made, and plans to continue to make, supply arrangements to meet the planned operating requirements for the future. adequate supply of critical raw
2022 ppg annual report and form 10-k 9
materials is managed by establishing contracts, procuring from multiple sources, and identifying alternative materials or technology whenever possible. the company is continuing its aggressive sourcing initiatives to effectively broaden our supply of high quality raw materials. these initiatives include qualifying multiple and local sources of supply, within asia and other lower cost regions of the world, diversification of our resin supply including adding on-site resin production at certain manufacturing locations, and a reduction in the amount of titanium dioxide and other raw materials used in our product formulations. despite our actions undertaken to maintain supply arrangements adequate to meet planned operating requirements, raw material supply chain disruptions, including logistical and transportation challenges in many regions, have adversely impacted, and may continue to adversely impact, our ability to procure raw materials, adversely impacting our financial results.
an inability to obtain certain critical raw materials has adversely impacted our ability to produce certain products and could do so in the future. increases in the cost of raw materials may have an adverse effect on our income from continuing operations or cash from operating activities in the event we are unable to offset these higher costs in a timely manner.
the pace of economic growth and level of uncertainty could have a negative impact on our results of operations and cash flows.
demand for our products and services depends, in part, on the general economic conditions affecting the countries and markets in which we do business. weak economic conditions in certain geographies and changing supply and demand balances in the markets we serve have negatively impacted demand for our products and services in the past and may do so in the future. recently, global economic uncertainty has increased due to a number of factors, including the war in ukraine, covid-19, consumer sentiment and commodity market volatility, disruption in supply chains globally, potential changes to international trade agreements, the imposition of tariffs and the threat of additional tariffs, and labor shortages in certain regions of the world. ppg provides products and services to a variety of end-use markets in many geographies. this broad end-use market exposure and expanded geographic presence lessens the significance of any individual decrease in activity levels; nonetheless, lower demand levels may result in lower sales, which would result in reduced income from continuing operations and cash from operating activities.
fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates could affect our financial results.
we are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk with respect to our sales, expenses, profits, assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the u.s. dollar. because our consolidated financial statements are presented in u.s. dollars, we must translate revenues and expenses into u.s. dollars at the average exchange rate during each reporting period, as well as assets and liabilities into u.s. dollars at exchange rates in effect at the end of each reporting period. therefore, increases or decreases in the value of the u.s. dollar against other currencies will affect our net sales, net income and the value of balance sheet items denominated in foreign currencies. we may use derivative financial instruments to reduce our net exposure to currency exchange rate fluctuations related to foreign currency transactions. however, fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, particularly the strengthening or weakening of the u.s. dollar against major currencies, could adversely or positively affect our financial condition and results of operations which are expressed in u.s. dollars.
the industries in which we operate are highly competitive.
with each of our businesses, an increase in competition may cause us to lose market share, lose customers, or compel us to reduce prices to remain competitive, which could result in reduced margins for our products. additionally, our ability to increase prices may impact the overall economics for the products we offer. competitive pressures may not only reduce our margins but may also impact our revenues and our growth which could adversely affect our results of operations.
legal, regulatory, and tax risks we are subject to existing and evolving standards relating to the protection of the environment.
environmental laws and regulations control, among other things, the discharge of pollutants into the air and water, the handling, use, treatment, storage and clean-up of hazardous and non-hazardous waste, and the investigation and remediation of soil and groundwater affected by hazardous substances. in addition, various laws regulate health and safety matters. the environmental laws and regulations we are subject to impose liability for the costs of, and damages resulting from, cleaning up current sites, past spills, disposals and other releases of hazardous substances. violations of these laws and regulations can also result in fines and penalties. future environmental laws and regulations may require substantial capital expenditures or may require or cause us to modify or curtail our operations, which may have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
we are involved in a number of lawsuits and claims, and we may be involved in future lawsuits and claims, in which substantial monetary damages are sought.
ppg is involved in a number of lawsuits and claims, both actual and potential, in which substantial monetary damages are sought. those lawsuits and claims may relate to contract, patent, environmental, product liability, asbestos exposure,
2022 ppg annual report and form 10-k 10
antitrust, employment, securities and other matters arising out of the conduct of ppg's current and past business activities. any such claims, whether with or without merit, could be time consuming and expensive to defend and could divert management's attention and resources. we maintain insurance against some, but not all, of these potential claims, and the levels of insurance we maintain may not be adequate to fully cover any and all losses. we believe that, in the aggregate, the outcome of all current lawsuits and claims involving ppg, including those described in note 15, "commitments and contingent liabilities" in item 8 of this form 10-k, will not have a material effect on ppg's consolidated financial position or liquidity; however, such outcome may be material to the results of operations of any particular period in which costs, if any, are recognized. nonetheless, the results of any future litigation or claims are inherently unpredictable, and such outcomes could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, cash from operating activities or financial condition.
we are subject to a variety of complex u.s. and non-u.s. laws and regulations, which could increase our compliance costs and could adversely affect our results of operations.
we are subject to a wide variety of complex u.s. and non-u.s. laws and regulations, and legal compliance risks, including securities laws, tax laws, environmental laws, employment and pension-related laws, competition laws, u.s. and foreign export and trading laws, and laws governing improper business practices, including bribery. we are affected by new laws and regulations and changes to existing laws and regulations, as well as interpretations by courts and regulators. these laws and regulations effectively expand our compliance obligations and costs.
for example, regulations concerning the composition, use and transport of chemical products continue to evolve. developments concerning these regulations could potentially impact the availability or viability of some of the raw materials we use in our product formulations and/or our ability to supply certain products to some customers or markets. import/export sanctions and regulations also continue to evolve and could result in increased compliance costs, slower product movements or additional complexity in our supply chains.
further, although we believe that we have appropriate risk management and compliance programs in place, we cannot guarantee that our internal controls and compliance systems will always protect us from improper acts committed by employees, agents, business partners or businesses that we acquire. any non-compliance or such improper actions or allegations could damage our reputation and subject us to civil or criminal investigations and shareholder lawsuits, could lead to substantial civil and criminal, monetary and non-monetary penalties, and could cause us to incur significant legal and investigatory costs.
changes in the tax regimes and related government policies and regulations in the countries in which we operate could adversely affect our results and our effective tax rate.
as a multinational corporation, we are subject to various taxes in both the u.s. and non-u.s. jurisdictions. due to economic and political conditions, tax rates in these various jurisdictions may be subject to significant changes. our future effective income tax rate could be affected by changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets or changes in tax laws or their interpretation. further, ppg may continue to refine its estimates to incorporate new or better information as it becomes available. recent developments, including potential u.s. or international tax reform, the european commission's investigations on illegal state aid as well as the organisation for economic co-operation and development project on base erosion and profit shifting may result in changes to long-standing tax principles, which could adversely affect our effective tax rate or result in higher cash tax liabilities. if our effective income tax rate were to increase, our cash from operating activities, financial condition and results of operations would be adversely affected. although we believe that our tax filing positions are appropriate, the final determination of tax audits or tax disputes may be different from what is reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals. if future audits find that additional taxes are due, we may be subject to incremental tax liabilities, possibly including interest and penalties, which could have a material adverse effect on our cash from operating activities, financial condition and results of operations.
operational and strategic risks our international operations expose us to additional risks and uncertainties that could affect our financial results.
ppg has a significant investment in global operations. this broad geographic footprint serves to lessen the significance of economic impacts occurring in any one region. notwithstanding the benefits of geographic diversification, our ability to achieve and maintain profitable growth in international markets is subject to risks related to the differing legal, political, social and regulatory requirements and economic conditions of many countries. as a result of our operations outside the u.s., we are subject to certain inherent risks, including political and economic uncertainty, inflation rates, exchange rates, trade protection measures, local labor conditions and laws, restrictions on foreign investments and repatriation of earnings, and weak intellectual property protection. our percentage of sales generated in 2022 by products sold outside the u.s. was approximately 60%.
2022 ppg annual report and form 10-k 11
business disruptions could have a negative impact on our results of operations and financial condition.
unexpected events, including supply disruptions, temporary plant and/or power outages, work stoppages, natural disasters and severe weather events, including those potentially due to climate change, significant public health issues, computer system disruptions, fires, war or terrorist activities, could increase the cost of doing business or otherwise harm the operations of ppg, our customers and our suppliers. it is not possible for us to predict the occurrence or consequence of any such events. however, such events could reduce our ability to supply products, reduce demand for our products or make it difficult or impossible for us to receive raw materials from suppliers or to deliver products to customers.
integrating acquired businesses into our existing operations.
growth through acquisitions is an important component of the company's strategy. over the last decade, we have successfully completed more than 50 acquisitions, and we will likely acquire additional businesses and enter into additional joint ventures in the future. growth through acquisitions and the formation of joint ventures involve risks, including:
•difficulties in assimilating acquired companies and products into our existing business;
•delays in realizing the benefits from the acquired companies or products;
•diversion of our management's time and attention from other business concerns;
•difficulties due to lack of or limited prior experience in any new markets we may enter;
•unforeseen claims and liabilities, including unexpected environmental exposures, product liability, or existing information technology vulnerabilities;
•unexpected losses of customers or suppliers of the acquired or existing business;
•difficulty in conforming the acquired business' standards, processes, procedures and controls to those of our operations; and
•difficulties in retaining key employees of the acquired businesses.
these risks or other problems encountered in connection with our past or future acquisitions and joint ventures could cause delays in realizing the anticipated benefits of such acquisitions or joint ventures, or such anticipated benefits may never be realized, which could adversely affect our results of operations, cash from operating activities or financial condition.
our ability to understand our customers' specific preferences and requirements, and to innovate, develop, produce and market products that meet customer demand is critical to our business results.
our business relies on continued global demand for our brands and products. to achieve our business goals, we must develop and sell products that appeal to customers. this is dependent on a number of factors, including our ability to produce products that meet the quality, performance and price expectations of our customers and our ability to develop effective sales, advertising and marketing programs.
we believe the automotive industry will experience significant and continued change in the coming years, including an increase in the production of electric vehicles. vehicle manufacturers continue to develop new safety features such as collision avoidance technology and self-driving vehicles that may reduce vehicle collisions in the future, potentially lowering demand for our automotive refinish coatings. in addition, through the introduction of new technologies, new business models or new methods of travel, such as ridesharing, the number of automotive oem new-builds may decline, potentially reducing demand for our automotive oem coatings and related automotive parts.
additionally, the development of customer-facing digital channels has and will continue to transform certain retail industries. an inability to develop such solutions and our customer's pace of adoption of those solutions could negatively affect our business or the market demand for our products.
our future growth will depend on our ability to continue to innovate our existing products and to develop and introduce new products. if we fail to keep pace with product innovation on a competitive basis or to predict market demands for our products, our businesses, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.
the security of our information technology systems could be compromised, which could adversely affect our ability to operate.
increased global information technology security requirements, threats and sophisticated and targeted computer crime pose a risk to the security of our systems, networks and the confidentiality, availability and integrity of our data. despite our efforts to protect intellectual property and confidential and personal data, our facilities and systems may be vulnerable to security breaches. this could lead to negative publicity, theft or other financial loss, modification or destruction of
2022 ppg annual report and form 10-k 12
proprietary information or key information, manufacture of defective products, production downtimes and operational disruptions, which could adversely affect our reputation, competitiveness and results of operations.
item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion includes a comparison of our results of operations and liquidity and capital resources for the years ended december 31, 2022 and 2021. a discussion of changes in our results of operations for the year ended december 31, 2021 as compared to the year ended december 31, 2020 has been omitted from this form 10-k, but may be found in "item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations" of our 2021 form 10-k, filed with the securities and exchange commission on february 17, 2022.
highlights net sales were approximately $17.7 billion in 2022, an increase of 5% compared to the prior year, driven by higher selling prices resulting from continued selling price initiatives. the company increased net sales despite softer demand conditions in europe due in part to geopolitical issues, pandemic-related demand disruptions in china and unfavorable foreign currency translation impacts due to the strong appreciation of the u.s. dollar versus many foreign currencies.
income before income taxes was $1,381 million in 2022, a decrease of $434 million compared to the prior year. this decrease was primarily due to raw material and other cost inflation, lower sales volumes, unfavorable foreign currency translation impacts, higher manufacturing costs related to supply and labor disruptions and impairment and other related charges, partially offset by increased selling prices.

interest expense interest expense increased $46 million 2022 versus 2021 primarily due the unfavorable impact of higher interest rates on ppg's variable rate debt obligations and slightly higher levels of debt in the current year.
interest income interest income increased $28 million primarily due to higher interest rates.
impairment and other related charges, net impairment and other related charges of $290 million were recorded in the first quarter 2022 associated with the wind down of the company's operations in russia. subsequently, the company released a portion of the previously established reserves due to the collection of certain trade receivables and recorded recoveries due to the realization of certain previously written-down inventories, resulting in recognition of income of $63 million. the company continues to consider actions to exit russia, including a possible sale of its russian business or controlled withdrawal from the russian market.
during 2022 and 2021, the company recorded impairment charges of $14 million and $21 million, respectively, related to certain smaller, non-strategic businesses. ppg committed to plans to sell these business and they were reclassified as held for sale. the impairment charges recorded represent the excess net book value of the net assets over the anticipated sales proceeds less costs to sell. the revenue of these businesses represent less than 1% of ppg annual net sales.
in the fourth quarter 2022, the company recorded an impairment charge of $4 million to reduce the carrying value of certain indefinite-lived trademarks based on the results of the annual impairment test.

*see the regulation g reconciliations - results of operations the effective tax rate for the year-ended december 31, 2022 was 23.5%, an increase of 2.9% from the prior year primarily driven by charges associated with ppg's operations in russia along with a reduction in the release of reserves for uncertain tax positions compared to the prior year.
earnings per diluted share and adjusted earnings per diluted share from continuing operations for the year ended december 31, 2022 decreased year over year primarily due raw material cost inflation, lower sales volumes, unfavorable foreign currency translation impact and higher manufacturing costs related to supply and labor disruptions, partially offset by increased selling prices. refer to the regulation g reconciliations - results from operations for additional information.

was mixed by geographic region. in the u.s. and canada and latin america regions, demand was solid throughout the year in most businesses despite supply disruptions constraining sales more than other regions. demand was the softest in europe due in part to geopolitical issues, including the war in ukraine, with the largest impact on the architectural coatings business. in asia, demand was mixed, as activity in china was impacted by ongoing pandemic-related restrictions and associated disruptions, while demand conditions in the rest of asia were more stable. despite ongoing component shortages that constrained global automotive oem manufacturers' production, global builds increased by about 6% versus 2021 due to strong underlying demand in most regions and supply deficits that are expected to remain into 2023. raw material cost inflation trended higher for most of the year, finishing the fourth quarter about 35% above fourth quarter 2019 levels. in the fourth quarter 2022, raw material inflation began to moderate and is anticipated to ease further in 2023. some other key costs continued to increase in 2022, including logistics, employee wage and benefit costs, and energy costs. the company continued to collaborate with its customers to implement selling price increases to mitigate elevated input costs, resulting in an 11% increase in selling prices compared to 2021.
u.s. and canada in 2022, economic activity remained robust and continued to recover from the lower demand levels experienced in 2021 due to pandemic-related restrictions. for the full year, u.s. gross domestic product ("gdp") and industrial production increased by approximately 2% and 4%, respectively. demand in the residential and commercial construction markets was strong at the beginning of the year but softened as interest rates increased as the year progressed. new home starts decreased by a mid-single-digit percentage in 2022 versus a mid-teen percentage increase in 2021. residential remodeling was down by approximately 10% in 2022 versus 2021 as solid housing fundamentals were offset by the impact of higher interest rates. commercial construction was down approximately 10% compared to 2021. market demand for architectural paint continued to shift back to do-it-for-me ("difm") from the diy channel during the year as lower u.s. unemployment and increased mobility resulted in consumers choosing to hire professional paint contractors. earnings were aided by strong selling price increases, but negatively impacted by higher levels of inflation, including historically high raw material cost inflation and higher than normal salary and wage increases due to the high level of employment in the u.s. architectural coatings sales volumes in the u.s. and canada were negatively impacted by severe raw material shortages that prevented the company from meeting the demand for its architectural products, mostly impacting the higher demand periods of spring and summer.
automotive oem industry builds were up nearly 10% compared to 2021 as component shortages began to moderate and underlying demand for new automobiles was solid. the aerospace coatings business continued what is expected to be a multi-year recovery to return to 2019 activity levels. before the pandemic, the company's sales mix was approximately 70% commercial and 30% military. during the pandemic and through 2022, sales volumes for military applications remained solid, in part due to specification of ppg products with advantaged technology. the commercial segment remains down about 15%, as overall improved flying activity still remains below 2019 levels, mostly impacted by lower activity in china. with the lifting of pandemic-related restrictions in china, it is expected that global commercial aftermarket and new build demand will continue to improve in 2023. the automotive refinish coatings business experienced strong demand through the year as miles driven and collision claims trended closer to pre-pandemic levels. sales were constrained due to ongoing supply disruptions, which has led to lower industry inventory levels. the packaging coatings business was favorably impacted by new business wins at several new packaged beverage can customers and overall solid demand for the company's sustainable products. the traffic solutions business, which represents the ennis-flint acquisition completed in december 2020, made good progress realizing synergies and achieved a low-teen percentage growth in organic sales.
u.s. and canada organic sales increased by more than 10% compared to 2021 driven by higher selling prices in all businesses. solid year-over-year sales volume increases in the aerospace, automotive refinish, industrial, automotive oem and packaging coatings businesses were partially offset by lower year-over-year sales volumes in the architectural and protective and marine coatings businesses. aggregate regional sales volumes remain more than 10% lower than the fourth quarter 2019. the u.s. and canada remained ppg's largest region, with sales of $7.4 billion, representing approximately 42% of 2022 net sales.
europe, middle east and africa european demand for coatings softened in 2022, mostly impacted by geopolitical issues and high levels of inflation. supply chain disruptions lessened during 2022 but continued to impact certain end-use markets, most notably automotive oem. in the first quarter, activity in this region was negatively impacted by mobility restrictions associated with pandemic-related disruptions. while the impact of the pandemic eased throughout the year, consumer confidence worsened as the year progressed due to elevated costs and the war in ukraine, which significantly impacted demand for coating products. component shortages continued to constrain automotive oem sales volumes. automotive builds in 2022 were at similar levels as 2021. architectural coatings - emea organic sales were flat compared to the prior year as selling price increases were offset by lower sales volumes. net sales for architectural difm products improved as compared to the prior year. integration of the june 2021 acquisition of tikkurila continued with good progress toward realizing targeted
2022 ppg annual report and form 10-k 21
synergies. in addition, the integration efforts continued for the two automotive oem acquisitions made in 2021, wörwag and cetelon, with ppg continuing to realize acquisition-related synergies and leverage acquired product technologies to drive sales growth. net sales were aided by partial recovery in the aerospace and automotive refinish coatings businesses. demand was soft for architectural coatings, packaging coatings and general industrial coatings products.
emea net sales of $5.5 billion represented 31% of ppg's 2022 net sales, modestly higher than 2021. organic sales improved by a mid-single-digit percentage compared to 2021 led by higher selling prices and acquisition-related sales, which were partially offset by lower sales volumes. net sales, excluding the impact of foreign currency translation, increased by a low-teen percentage. sales volumes in the region were down a mid-teen percentage compared to 2019.
asia pacific and latin america the regions of asia pacific and latin america represented 27% of ppg's 2022 net sales in aggregate, similar to the prior year.
net sales were $2.8 billion in the asia pacific region, led by china, which remained ppg's second largest country by revenue. net sales in 2022 decreased by 5% compared to 2021 as higher selling prices and solid sales volume growth in india were more than offset by lower sales volumes in china due to pandemic-related restrictions and the impact of unfavorable foreign currency translation. sales activity was most impacted in china during a period of heightened mandated shut-downs in the second quarter and during the fourth quarter as the country began to move away from its zero-covid policy. in china, demand for coatings products is expected to improve in 2023 driven by stronger domestic consumption and fewer mobility restrictions. in the region, sales volumes were most unfavorable in the protective and marine, industrial, automotive refinish and packaging coatings businesses. in 2022, there were periods of strong automotive retail sales activity, partially due to government stimulus and strong sales of electric vehicles in china. during 2022, sales volume growth was strongest in india as the easing of pandemic-related restrictions led to increased economic activity. sales volumes in the region were lower by about 10% compared to 2021 and were lower by a mid-teen-percentage compared to 2019.
net sales in latin america in 2022 were $2.0 billion, representing a 16% increase compared to 2021. overall, demand in the region increased year over year driven by improved economic activity in most end-use markets. organic sales were higher by a mid-teen-percentage compared to 2021 due to higher selling prices and sales volumes. the ppg comex business made strong contributions, which continued to outpace the industry. the business added more concessionaire locations during 2022, bringing the total to over 5,100 locations. additionally, both reportable segments delivered sales volume growth on a year-over-year basis. sales volumes in the region increased by a low-single-digit percentage compared to 2019.
outlook we expect softening global economic activity in 2023 that will likely be uneven by region and end-use. as 2023 progresses, we expect demand for architectural coatings products in the u.s. to be negatively impacted by higher interest rates, while we anticipate demand to gradually improve in china as it transitions away from zero-covid policies and supply chain disruptions continue to ease. in europe, we expect demand to remain soft due to ongoing geopolitical issues and inflation. in general, most end-use markets do not have significant excess inventories, and any demand improvement should lead to a faster ramp-up of sales volumes. continued recovery is expected in the automotive refinish, automotive oem and aerospace coatings businesses, which collectively accounted for about 40% of the company's pre-pandemic sales and where the company has broad, global businesses supported by advantaged technologies.
supply chain and pandemic-related disruptions experienced during the past three years are expected to ease as 2023 progresses, which should allow for ample supply of commodity-related raw materials in all regions. we also expect the company's ability to manufacture and deliver product to improve as the year progresses, leading to better manufacturing efficiencies.
we anticipate that ppg's growth in the u.s. and canada will be led by the aerospace coatings, automotive refinish coatings and traffic solutions businesses. automotive oem industry builds in the region are expected to increase slightly compared to 2022. architectural coatings demand is expected to moderate and may fall as the year progresses due to higher interest rates, lower single-family home construction and lower sales of existing homes. traffic solutions and protective coatings demand should be aided later in 2023 as infrastructure spending continues to gain momentum.
we expect european industry demand trends in 2023 to remain similar to those experienced in the second half of 2022. automotive oem builds are expected to increase modestly from historical lows, and aerospace demand is expected to continue to recover from its pandemic lows. overall demand is expected to be similar to 2022 but mixed by country in the architectural coatings business. the integration of tikkurila will continue, and synergies from recent acquisitions should aid earnings growth. unfavorable demand trends are expected to continue to impact the packaging, protective and marine, and industrial coatings businesses. we will continue to monitor the impacts of higher energy prices and challenges with respect to energy procurement in europe and adapt our footprint, as necessary, to best serve our
2022 ppg annual report and form 10-k 22
customers. raw material availability is expected to continue to improve as the year progresses. a new cost savings program was announced in the third quarter 2022, which has a higher concentration of initiatives focused on europe. we continue to monitor the economic environment in the u.k. as its exit from the european union progresses, including monitoring the impacts on consumer sentiment, logistics, labor availability and coatings demand. to date, the u.k.'s exit from the european union has not had a material impact on the company's operations.
in the asia pacific region, we expect economic activity to improve in china after the first quarter as supply chain activity and mobility levels move closer to 2019 levels. stimulus support is expected in the region to aid economic activity. economic output in india is expected to remain robust, and activity in southeast asia is expected to benefit from the reopening of china's borders. in china, we expect growth above the global average despite challenges in the real estate market and heightened risks as the chinese economy continues to rely more on domestic consumption. the growth of china's electric vehicle subsegment, including significant opportunities for export activity, should benefit the company's automotive oem business. marine coatings new-build demand is expected to be stable as order books for large vessels and container ships remain close to multi-year highs.
in latin america, we anticipate continued stable economic conditions in mexico, most of central america and south america compared to 2022. we expect continued strong demand in the ppg comex architectural coatings business.
significant other factors we made significant progress on the global restructuring programs that were announced in 2019, 2020 and 2021. the 2019 and 2020 programs have been substantially completed. in the third quarter 2022, the company approved a business restructuring plan which included actions to reduce its global cost structure in response to current economic conditions. total restructuring savings, including the impact of acquisition synergies, was approximately $65 million in 2022. total restructuring savings are expected to be at least $60 million in 2023. we will continue to monitor and aggressively manage the company's cost structure to ensure alignment with the overall demand environment.
raw materials are our most significant input cost. ppg experiences fluctuating energy and raw material costs driven by various factors, including changes in supplier feedstock costs and inventories, global industry activity levels, foreign currency exchange rates, and global supply and demand factors.
on an aggregate basis, average raw material costs were significantly higher in 2022 versus 2021. the increases in raw material costs were primarily driven by ongoing supply constraints, including various force majeure declarations, higher energy prices, production outages at many of our suppliers, energy surcharges in europe, labor availability challenges, transportation shortages and higher ocean freight costs. ppg currently expects raw material costs to be higher by a low-single-digit percentage on a year-over-year basis in the first quarter 2023; however, we expect the negative impact of raw material inflation to lessen as 2023 progresses.
we achieved selling price improvement across all businesses in 2022, reflecting the company's efforts to offset various inflationary pressures. the company will carefully monitor all costs during 2023 and assess the need for additional selling price increases.
in 2022, we experienced unfavorable foreign currency translation throughout the year, and we expect that foreign currency rates will continue to be volatile. however, the company generally purchases raw materials, incurs manufacturing costs and sells finished goods in the same currency, so we typically incur only modest foreign currency transaction-related impacts.
the 2023 effective tax rate from continuing operations is expected to be in the range of 22% to 24%, varying by quarter. this range represents the company's best estimate.
net periodic pension expense will be higher in 2023, primarily due to declines in the market value of pension investments during 2022, resulting in a lower asset base to generate returns on plan assets in 2023. the interest cost component of pension expense will also be higher due to an increase in discount rates.
over the past five years, the company used over $2 billion of cash to repurchase approximately 21 million shares of ppg stock, including using $190 million to repurchase shares of ppg stock during 2022. the company ended the year with approximately $1.1 billion remaining under its current share repurchase authorization. during 2022, the company deployed $114 million for acquisitions, $518 million for capital expenditures and $570 million for dividends. in 2022, ppg marked the 51st annual per share dividend increase and the 123rd successive year of annual dividend payments.
ppg ended 2022 with approximately $1.2 billion in cash and short-term investments. the company expects strong cash generation in 2023.

commitments and contingent liabilities, including environmental matters ppg is involved in a number of lawsuits and claims, both actual and potential, including some that it has asserted against others, in which substantial monetary damages are sought. refer to item 3. "legal proceedings" and note 15, "commitments and contingent liabilities" in item 8 of this form 10-k for a description of certain of these lawsuits.
as discussed in item 3 and note 15, although the result of any future litigation of such lawsuits and claims is inherently unpredictable, management believes that, in the aggregate, the outcome of all lawsuits and claims involving ppg, including asbestos-related claims, will not have a material effect on ppg's consolidated financial position or liquidity; however, any such outcome may be material to the results of operations of any particular period in which costs, if any, are recognized.
as also discussed in note 15, ppg has significant reserves for environmental contingencies. refer to the environmental matters section of note 15 for details of these reserves. it is ppg's policy to accrue expenses for contingencies when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. reserves for environmental contingencies are exclusive of claims against third parties and are generally not discounted. in management's opinion, the company operates in an environmentally sound manner and the outcome of the company's environmental contingencies will not have a material effect on ppg's financial position or liquidity; however, any such outcome may be material to the results of operations of any particular period in which costs, if any, are recognized. management anticipates that the resolution of the company's environmental contingencies will occur over an extended period of time.

2022 vs. 2021
the $599 million decrease in cash from operating activities - continuing operations was primarily due to a larger increase in working capital in 2022 compared to the prior year, which reflects the impact of higher raw material costs on inventories and higher selling prices on trade receivables.
operating working capital operating working capital is a subset of total working capital and represents (1) receivables from customers, net of allowance for doubtful accounts, (2) inventories, and (3) trade liabilities. refer to note 3, "working capital detail" in item 8 of this form 10-k for further information related to the components of the company's operating working capital. we believe operating working capital represents the key components of working capital under the operating control of our businesses.

credit agreements and lines of credit in february 2021, ppg entered into a $2.0 billion term loan credit agreement (the "term loan credit agreement"). the term loan credit agreement provided the company with the ability to borrow up to an aggregate principal amount $2.0 billion on an unsecured basis prior to december 31, 2021 as further discussed in note 10, "borrowings and lines of credit" in item 8 of this form 10-k. in june 2021, ppg borrowed $700 million under the $2.0 billion term loan credit agreement. in december 2021, ppg borrowed an additional $700 million under the term loan credit agreement. in 2022, ppg repaid $300 million of the term loan credit agreement using cash on hand.
in august 2019, ppg amended and restated its five-year credit agreement (the "credit agreement") with several banks and financial institutions as further discussed in note 10, "borrowings and lines of credit" in item 8 of this form 10-k. the credit agreement amends and restates the company's existing five year credit agreement dated as of december 18, 2015. the credit agreement provides for a $2.2 billion unsecured revolving credit facility. the credit agreement will terminate on august 30, 2024. there were no amounts outstanding under the credit agreement as of december 31, 2022 and december 31, 2021.
the term loan credit agreement and credit agreement require the company to maintain a ratio of total indebtedness to total capitalization, as defined in the term loan credit agreement and credit agreement, of 60% or less; provided, that for any fiscal quarter in which the company has made an acquisition for consideration in excess of $1 billion and for the next five fiscal quarters thereafter, the ratio of total indebtedness to total capitalization may not exceed 65% at any time. as of december 31, 2022, total indebtedness to total capitalization as defined under the credit agreement and the term loan was 49%.
in addition to the amounts available under lines of credit, the company maintains access to the capital markets and may issue debt or equity securities from time to time, which may provide an additional source of liquidity.
refer to note 10, "borrowings and lines of credit" in item 8 of this form 10-k for information regarding notes entered into and repaid as well as details regarding the use and availability of committed and uncommitted lines of credit, letters of credit and debt covenants.

cash requirements we continue to believe that our cash on hand and short-term investments, cash from operations and the company's access to capital markets will continue to be sufficient to fund our operating activities, capital spending, acquisitions, dividend payments, debt service, share repurchases, contributions to pension plans, and ppg's significant cash requirements. the company's significant cash requirements include the following contractual obligations and commitments.
obligations due in:
($ in millions)                                      total   2023                                 2024-2025                  2026-2027                 thereafter long-term debt                                  $6,806                   $303                  $2,355                     $1,340                     $2,808
interest payments(1)                            $1,238                   $191                    $312                       $224                       $511

(1)interest on all outstanding debt.
(2)includes interest payments.
(3)the unconditional purchase commitments are principally take-or-pay obligations related to the purchase of certain materials, including industrial gases and electricity, consistent with customary industry practice.
the company's off-balance sheet arrangements include unconditional purchase commitments disclosed in the "liquidity and capital resources" section in the cash requirements table as well as letters of credit as discussed in note 10, "borrowings and lines of credit" in item 8 of this form 10-k.
other liquidity matters at december 31, 2022, the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits for uncertain tax positions, including an accrual of related interest and penalties along with positions only impacting the timing of tax benefits, was $162 million. the timing of payments will depend on the progress of examinations with tax authorities. ppg does not expect a significant tax payment related to these obligations within the next year. the company is unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate as to if, or when, any significant cash settlements with taxing authorities may occur.
critical accounting estimates management has evaluated the accounting policies used in the preparation of the financial statements and related notes presented in item 8 of this form 10-k and believes those policies to be reasonable and appropriate. we believe that the most critical accounting estimates made in the preparation of our financial statements are those related to accounting for contingencies, under which we accrue a loss when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated, and to accounting for pensions, other postretirement benefits, business combinations, goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets with indefinite lives because of the importance of management judgment in making the estimates necessary to apply these policies.
contingencies contingencies, by their nature, relate to uncertainties that require management to exercise judgment both in assessing the likelihood that a liability has been incurred as well as in estimating the amount of potential loss. the most important contingencies impacting our financial statements are those related to environmental remediation, to pending, impending or overtly threatened litigation against the company and to the resolution of matters related to open tax years. for more information on these matters, see note 15, "commitments and contingent liabilities" and note 13, "income taxes" in item 8 of this form 10-k.
defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans accounting for pensions and other postretirement benefits involves estimating the cost of benefits to be provided well into the future and attributing that cost over the time period each employee works. to accomplish this, we make extensive use of assumptions about inflation, investment returns, mortality, turnover, medical costs and discount rates. the company has established a process by which management reviews and selects these assumptions annually. refer to note 14, "employee benefit plans" in item 8 of this form 10-k for information on these plans and the assumptions used.
business combinations the company uses the acquisition method of accounting to allocate costs of acquired businesses to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values at the dates of acquisition. the excess costs of acquired businesses over the fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed is recognized as goodwill. the valuations of the acquired assets and liabilities impacts the determination of future operating results. in addition to using management estimates and negotiated amounts, the company uses a variety of information sources to determine the estimated fair values of acquired assets and liabilities including: third-party appraisals for the estimated value and lives of identifiable
2022 ppg annual report and form 10-k 27
intangible assets and property, plant and equipment; third-party actuaries for the estimated obligations of defined benefit pension plans and similar benefit obligations; and legal counsel or other experts to assess the obligations associated with legal, environmental and other contingent liabilities.
the business and technical judgment of management was used in determining which acquired intangible assets have indefinite lives and in determining the useful lives of acquired finite-lived intangible assets in accordance with the accounting guidance for goodwill and other intangible assets.
goodwill and intangible assets the company tests indefinite-lived intangible assets and goodwill for impairment by either performing a qualitative evaluation or a quantitative test at least annually, or more frequently if an indication of impairment arises. the qualitative evaluation is an assessment of factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit or asset is less than its carrying amount. in the quantitative test, fair values are estimated using a discounted cash flow model. key assumptions and estimates used in the discounted cash flow model include discount rates, tax rates, future revenues, operating cash flows and capital expenditures. for more information on these matters, see note 1, "summary of significant accounting policies" in item 8 of this form 10-k.
we believe that the amounts recorded in the financial statements in item 8 of this form 10-k related to these contingencies, pensions, other postretirement benefits, business combinations, goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets with indefinite lives are based on the best estimates and judgments of the appropriate ppg management, although actual outcomes could differ from our estimates.
currency comparing spot exchange rates at december 31, 2022 and at december 31, 2021, the u.s. dollar strengthened against the currencies of many countries within the regions where ppg operates, most notably the chinese yuan, the euro, and the british pound. as a result, consolidated net assets at december 31, 2022 decreased by $266 million from december 31, 2021.
comparing average exchange rates during 2022 to those of 2021, the u.s. dollar strengthened against the currencies of many countries within the regions ppg operates, including most of the countries in the emea region. this had an unfavorable impact of approximately $86 million on full year 2022 income before income taxes from the translation of this foreign income into u.s. dollars.
forward-looking statements the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 provides a safe harbor for forward-looking statements made by or on behalf of the company. management's discussion and analysis and other sections of this annual report contain forward-looking statements that reflect the company's current views with respect to future events and financial performance. you can identify forward-looking statements by the fact that they do not relate strictly to current or historic facts. forward-looking statements are identified by the use of the words "aim," "believe," "expect," "anticipate," "intend," "estimate," "project," "outlook," "forecast" and other expressions that indicate future events and trends. any forward-looking statement speaks only as of the date on which such statement is made, and the company undertakes no obligation to update any forward-looking statement, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. you are advised, however, to consult any further disclosures we make on related subjects in our reports to the sec. also, note the following cautionary statements.
many factors could cause actual results to differ materially from the company's forward-looking statements. such factors include statements related to the expected effects on our business of covid-19, global economic conditions, geopolitical issues in europe, increasing price and product competition by our competitors, fluctuations in cost and availability of raw materials, energy, labor and logistics, the ability to achieve selling price increases, the ability to recover margins, customer inventory levels, ppg inventory levels, our ability to maintain favorable supplier relationships and arrangements, the timing of and the realization of anticipated cost savings from restructuring initiatives, the ability to identify additional cost savings opportunities, the timing and expected benefits of our acquisitions, difficulties in integrating acquired businesses and achieving expected synergies therefrom, the amount of future share repurchases, economic and political conditions in the markets we serve, the ability to penetrate existing, developing and emerging foreign and domestic markets, foreign exchange rates and fluctuations in such rates, fluctuations in tax rates, the impact of future legislation, the impact of environmental regulations, unexpected business disruptions, the unpredictability of existing and possible future litigation, including asbestos litigation, and government investigations. however, it is not possible to predict or identify all such factors.
consequently, while the list of factors presented here and in item 1a is considered representative, no such list should be considered to be a complete statement of all potential risks and uncertainties. unlisted factors may present significant additional obstacles to the realization of forward-looking statements.

consequences of material differences in the results compared with those anticipated in the forward-looking statements could include, among other things, lower sales or income, business disruption, operational problems, financial loss, legal liability to third parties, other factors set forth in item 1a of this form 10-k and similar risks, any of which could have a material adverse effect on the company's consolidated financial condition, results of operations or liquidity. ppg undertakes no obligation to update any forward-looking statement, except as otherwise required by applicable law.

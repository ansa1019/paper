risk factors are not necessarily presented in the order of importance. in addition, there may be other factors, not currently known to the company, which could, in the future, materially adversely affect the company, its business, financial condition, or results of operations. this and other related disclosures made by the company in this annual report, and elsewhere from time to time, represent management's best judgment as of the date the information is given. the company does not undertake responsibility for updating any of such information, whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise, except as required by law.
investors are advised, however, to consult any further public company disclosures (such as in filings with the securities and exchange commission, in company press releases, or other public presentations) on related subjects.
risks related to global economy and industry conditions continued uncertain conditions in the global economy, labor market, and financial markets could negatively impact the company.
the company's business and operating results were impacted by the last global recession, and its related impacts, such as the credit market crisis, declining consumer and business confidence, fluctuating commodity prices, volatile exchange rates, and other challenges that impacted the global economy. similarly, as a company which operates and sells products worldwide, uncertainty in the global economy, labor market, and capital markets
(including resulting from the continuing covid-19 pandemic and subsequent changes and disruptions in business, political, and economic conditions) have impacted and may adversely impact demand for and the costs of certain eastman products and accordingly results of operations, and may adversely impact the company's financial condition and cash flows and ability to access the credit and capital markets under attractive rates and terms and negatively impact the company's liquidity or ability to pursue certain growth initiatives.

management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations volatility in costs for strategic raw material and energy commodities or disruption in the supply and transportation of these commodities and in transportation of company products could adversely impact the company's financial results.
eastman is reliant on certain strategic raw material and energy commodities for its operations and utilizes risk management tools, including hedging, as appropriate, to mitigate market fluctuations in raw material and energy costs. these risk mitigation measures do not eliminate all exposure to market fluctuations and may limit the company from fully benefiting from lower raw material costs and, conversely, offset the impact of higher raw material costs. in addition, the global covid-19 pandemic and subsequent changes and disruptions in business and economic conditions, which has adversely impacted cost and availability and transportation of commodities and transportation of company products, natural disasters, plant interruptions, supply chain and transportation disruptions (related to the global covid-19 pandemic and otherwise), changes in laws or regulations, levels of unemployment and inflation, higher interest rates, war or other outbreak of hostilities or terrorism, and breakdown or degradation of transportation and supply chain infrastructure used for delivery of strategic raw material and energy commodities and for transportation of company products, could adversely impact both the cost and availability of these commodities and sales of company products.
the company's substantial global operations subject it to risks of doing business in other countries, including u.s. and non-u.s. trade relations, which could adversely impact its business, financial condition, and results of operations.
more than half of eastman's sales for 2021 were to customers outside of north america. the company expects sales from international markets to continue to represent a significant portion of its sales. also, a significant portion of the company's manufacturing capacity is located outside of the united states. accordingly, the company's business is subject to risks related to the differing legal, political, cultural, social and regulatory requirements, and economic conditions of many jurisdictions including the unique geographic impacts of the global covid-19 pandemic. fluctuations in exchange rates may impact product demand and may adversely impact the profitability in u.s. dollars of products and services provided in foreign countries. in addition, the u.s. and foreign countries have imposed and may impose additional taxes or otherwise tax eastman's foreign income (see
"management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations - critical accounting estimates - income taxes" in part ii, item 7 of this annual report), or adopt or increase restrictions on foreign trade or investment, including currency exchange controls, tariffs or other taxes, or limitations on imports or exports (including recent and proposed changes in u.s. trade policy and resulting retaliatory actions by other countries, including china, which have recently reduced and which may increasingly reduce demand for and increase costs of impacted products or result in u.s.-based trade counterparties limiting trade with u.s.-based companies or non-u.s. customers limiting their purchases from u.s.-based companies). certain legal and political risks are also inherent in the operation of a company with eastman's global scope. for example, it may be more difficult for eastman to enforce its agreements or collect receivables through foreign legal systems, and the laws of some countries may not protect the company's intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the u.s.
failure of foreign countries to have laws to protect eastman's intellectual property rights or an inability to effectively enforce such rights in foreign countries could result in loss of valuable proprietary information.
there is also risk that foreign governments may nationalize private enterprises in certain countries where eastman operates. social and cultural norms in certain countries may not support compliance with eastman's corporate policies including those that require compliance with substantive laws and regulations. also, changes in general economic and political conditions in countries where eastman operates are a risk to the company's financial performance. as eastman continues to operate its business globally, its success will depend, in part, on its ability to anticipate and effectively manage and mitigate these and other related risks. there can be no assurance that the consequences of these and other factors relating to its multinational operations will not have an adverse impact on eastman's business, financial condition, or results of operations.
57
management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations risks related to the company's business and strategy the company's business is subject to operating risks common to chemical and specialty materials manufacturing businesses, including cybersecurity risks, any of which could disrupt manufacturing operations or related infrastructure and adversely impact results of operations.
as a global specialty materials company, eastman's business is subject to operating risks common to chemical manufacturing, storage, handling, and transportation, including explosions, fires, inclement weather, natural disasters, mechanical failure, unscheduled downtime, transportation and supply chain interruptions, remediation, chemical spills, and discharges or releases of toxic or hazardous substances or gases. significant limitation on the company's ability to manufacture products due to disruption of manufacturing operations or related infrastructure could have a material adverse impact on the company's sales revenue, costs, results of operations, credit ratings, and financial condition. disruptions could occur due to internal factors such as computer or equipment malfunction (accidental or intentional), operator error, or process failures; or external factors such as supply chain disruption, computer or equipment malfunction at third-party service providers, natural disasters, changes in laws or regulations, war or other outbreak of hostilities or terrorism, cyber-attacks, or breakdown or degradation of transportation and supply chain infrastructure used for delivery of supplies to the company or for delivery of products to customers. the company has in the past experienced cyber-attacks and breaches of its computer information systems, although none of these have had a material adverse impact on the company's operations and financial results. while the company remains committed to managing cyber related risk, no assurances can be provided that any future disruptions due to these, or other, circumstances will not have a material impact on operations (see "business - eastman chemical company general information - information security" in part i, item 1
of this annual report). unplanned disruptions of manufacturing operations or related infrastructure could be significant in scale and could negatively impact operations, neighbors, and the environment, and could have a negative impact on the company's results of operations.
growth initiatives may not achieve desired business or financial objectives and may require significant resources in addition to or different from those available or in excess of those estimated or budgeted for such initiatives.
eastman continues to identify and pursue growth opportunities through both organic and inorganic initiatives, such as eastman's sustainable innovation initiatives which aim to develop a more "circular economy." these and other growth opportunities include development and commercialization or licensing of innovative new products and technologies and related employee leadership, expertise, skill development and retention, expansion into new markets and geographic regions, alliances, ventures, and acquisitions that complement and extend the company's portfolio of businesses and capabilities. such initiatives are necessarily constrained by availability and development of additional resources, including development, attraction, and retention of employee leadership, application development, and sales and marketing talent and capabilities. there can be no assurance that such innovation, development and commercialization or licensing efforts, investments, or acquisitions and alliances
(including integration of acquired businesses) will receive necessary governmental or regulatory approvals, or result in financially successful commercialization of products, or acceptance by existing or new customers, or successful entry into new markets or otherwise achieve their underlying strategic business objectives or that they will be beneficial to the company's results of operations. there also can be no assurance that capital projects for growth efforts can be completed within the time or at the costs projected due, among other things, to demand for and availability of construction materials and labor and obtaining regulatory approvals and operating permits and reaching agreement on terms of key agreements and arrangements with potential suppliers and customers. any such delays or cost overruns or the inability to obtain such approvals or to reach such agreements on acceptable terms could negatively impact the returns from any proposed or current investments and projects.
58
management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations significant acquisitions or divestitures could expose the company to risks and uncertainties, the occurrence of any of which could materially adversely affect the company's business, financial condition, and results of operations.
while acquisitions and divestitures have been and continue to be a part of eastman's strategy, acquisitions of large companies and acquisitions or divestitures of businesses subject the company to a number of risks and uncertainties, the occurrence of any of which could have a material adverse effect on eastman. these include, but are not limited to, the possibility that the actual and projected future financial performance of the acquired or remaining business may be significantly worse than expected and that, in the case of an acquired business and as reported in "management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations - critical accounting estimates - impairment of long-lived assets - goodwill" in part ii, item 7 of this annual report, the carrying values of goodwill and certain assets from acquisitions may, as has been the case for certain acquired assets, be impaired resulting in non-cash charges to future earnings and, in the case of a divested business, the divestiture could reduce eastman's revenue and, potentially, margins and increase its costs and liabilities in the form of transition costs and retained liabilities from the operations divested, including environmental liabilities; that significant additional indebtedness may constrain the company's ability to access the credit and capital markets at attractive interest rates and favorable terms, which may negatively impact the company's liquidity or ability to pursue certain growth initiatives; that the company may not be able to achieve the cost, revenue, tax, or other "synergies" expected from any acquisition, or that there may be delays in achieving any such synergies; that management's time and effort may be dedicated to the integration of the new business or specific assets or product lines or separation of the divested business or specific assets or product lines resulting in a loss of focus on the successful operation of the company's legacy businesses; and that the company may be required to expend significant additional resources in order to integrate any acquired business or specific assets or product lines into eastman or separate any divested business or specific assets or product lines from eastman, or that the integration or separation efforts will not achieve the expected benefits.
risks related to regulatory changes and compliance legislative, regulatory, or voluntary actions, including associated with physical impacts of climate change, could increase the company's future health, safety, and environmental compliance costs.
eastman, its facilities, and its businesses are subject to complex health, safety, and environmental laws, regulations, and related voluntary actions, both in the u.s. and internationally, which require and will continue to require significant expenditures to remain in compliance with such laws, regulations, and voluntary actions. the company's accruals for such costs and associated liabilities are subject to changes in estimates on which the accruals are based. for example, any amount accrued for environmental matters reflects the company's assumptions about remediation requirements at the contaminated site, the nature of the remedy, the outcome of discussions with regulatory agencies and other potentially responsible parties at multi-party sites, and the number of and financial viability of other potentially responsible parties. changes in the estimates on which the accruals are based, unanticipated government enforcement action, or changes in health, safety, environmental, chemical control regulations and actions, and testing requirements could result in higher costs. specifically, while the company's sustainability and "circular economy" innovation initiatives are sources of competitive strength (see "business -
corporate overview - business strategy - circular economy and sustainability" in part i, item 1 of this annual report), future changes in legislation and regulation and related voluntary actions associated with physical impacts of climate change may increase the likelihood that the company's manufacturing facilities will in the future be impacted by carbon requirements, regulation of greenhouse gas emissions, and energy policy, and may result in capital expenditures, increases in costs for raw materials and energy, limitations on raw material and energy source and supply choices, and other direct and indirect compliance or other costs or consequences including decreased demand for products related to carbon-based energy sources or increased demand for goods that result in lower emissions than competing products and reputational risk resulting from operations with greenhouse gas emissions. see "business - eastman chemical company general information - compliance with environmental and other government regulations" in part i, item 1 of this annual report.

eastman has exposure to various market risks principally due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates, the pricing of various commodities, and interest rates. in an effort to manage these risks, the company employs various strategies, including pricing, inventory management, and hedging. the company enters into derivative contracts which are governed by policies, procedures, and internal processes set forth by its board of directors.
the company determines its exposures to market risk by utilizing sensitivity analyses, which measure the potential losses in fair value resulting from one or more selected hypothetical changes in foreign currency exchange rates, commodity prices, or interest rates.
foreign currency risk due to a portion of the company's operating cash flows and borrowings being denominated in foreign currencies, the company is exposed to market risk from changes in foreign currency exchange rates. the company continually evaluates its foreign currency exposure based on current market conditions and the locations in which the company conducts business. the company manages most foreign currency exposures on a consolidated basis, which allows the company to net certain exposures and take advantage of natural offsets. to mitigate foreign currency risk, from time to time, the company enters into derivative instruments to hedge the cash flows related to certain sales and purchase transactions expected within a rolling three year period and denominated in foreign currencies, and enters into forward exchange contracts to hedge certain firm commitments denominated in foreign currencies. the gains and losses on these contracts offset changes in the value of related exposures. additionally, the company, from time to time, enters into non-derivative and derivative instruments to hedge the foreign currency exposure of the net investment in certain foreign operations. the foreign currency change in the designated investment values of the foreign subsidiaries will generally be offset by a foreign currency change in the carrying value of the euro-
denominated borrowings. it is the company's policy to enter into foreign currency derivative and non-derivative instruments only to the extent considered necessary to meet its objectives as stated above. the company does not enter into foreign currency derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes.
at december 31, 2021, the market risk associated with certain cash flows under these derivative transactions assuming a 10 percent adverse move in the u.s. dollar relative to these foreign currencies was $49 million, with an additional $5 million exposure for each additional one percentage point adverse change in those foreign currency rates. since the company utilizes currency-sensitive derivative instruments for hedging anticipated foreign currency transactions, a loss in fair value from those instruments is generally offset by an increase in the value of the underlying anticipated transactions.
at december 31, 2021, a 10 percent fluctuation in the euro currency rate would have had a $238 million impact on the designated net investment values in the foreign subsidiaries. as a result of the designation of the euro-
denominated borrowings and designated cross-currency interest rate swaps as hedges of the net investments, foreign currency translation gains and losses on the borrowings and designated cross-currency interest rate swaps are recorded as a component of the "change in cumulative translation adjustment" within "other comprehensive income
(loss), net of tax" in the consolidated statements of earnings, comprehensive income and retained earnings in part ii, item 8 of this annual report. therefore, a foreign currency change in the designated investment values of the foreign subsidiaries will generally be offset by a foreign currency change in the carrying value of the euro-
denominated borrowings or the foreign currency change in the designated cross-currency interest rate swaps.
commodity risk the company is exposed to fluctuations in market prices for certain of its raw materials and energy, as well as contract sales of certain commodity products. to mitigate short-term fluctuations in market prices for certain commodities, principally propane, ethane, natural gas, paraxylene, ethylene, and benzene, as well as selling prices for ethylene, the company enters into derivative transactions, from time to time, to hedge the cash flows related to certain sales and purchase transactions expected within a rolling three year period. at december 31, 2021, the market risk associated with these derivative contracts, assuming an instantaneous parallel shift in the underlying commodity price of 10 percent and no corresponding change in the selling price of finished goods, was $12 million, with an additional $1 million of exposure at december 31, 2021 for each one percentage point move in closing price thereafter.
60
interest rate risk eastman is exposed to interest rate risk primarily as a result of its borrowing and investing activities, which include long-term borrowings used to maintain liquidity and to fund its business operations and capital requirements. the nature and amount of the company's long-term and short-term debt may vary from time to time as a result of business requirements, market conditions, and other factors. the company manages global interest rate exposure as part of regular operational and financing strategies. the company had no variable interest rate borrowings (including credit facility borrowings and commercial paper borrowings) at december 31, 2021.
eastman may enter into interest rate swaps, collars, or similar instruments with the objective of reducing interest rate volatility relating to the company's borrowing costs. as of december 31, 2021, the company had interest rate swaps outstanding with notional values of $150 million. for purposes of calculating the market risks associated with the fair value of interest-rate-sensitive instruments, the company uses a hypothetical 10 percent increase in interest rates. the corresponding market risk of the interest rate swap hedging the interest rate risk on the 3.8%
bonds maturing march 2025 and the interest rate swap hedging the variability in interest rates for long-term debt issuances was $1 million as of december 31, 2021.

report of independent registered public accounting firm to the board of directors and stockholders of eastman chemical company opinions on the financial statements and internal control over financial reporting we have audited the accompanying consolidated statements of financial position of eastman chemical company and its subsidiaries (the "company") as of december 31, 2021 and 2020, and the related consolidated statements of earnings, comprehensive income and retained earnings, and of cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended december 31, 2021, including the related notes (collectively referred to as the "consolidated financial statements"). we also have audited the company's internal control over financial reporting as of december 31, 2021, based on criteria established in internal control - integrated framework (2013) issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission (coso).
in our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the company as of december 31, 2021 and 2020, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended december 31, 2021 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america. also in our opinion, the company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of december 31, 2021, based on criteria established in internal control - integrated framework (2013) issued by the coso.
basis for opinions the company's management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in management's report on internal control over financial reporting appearing under item 9a. our responsibility is to express opinions on the company's consolidated financial statements and on the company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. we are a public accounting firm registered with the public company accounting oversight board (united states) (pcaob) and are required to be independent with respect to the company in accordance with the u.s. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the securities and exchange commission and the pcaob.
we conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the pcaob. those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.
our audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. we believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.
definition and limitations of internal control over financial reporting a company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. a company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
64
because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
critical audit matters the critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (i)
relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (ii) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. the communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.
annual goodwill impairment assessments - certain reporting units in the additives & functional products and chemical intermediates segments as described in notes 1 and 5 to the consolidated financial statements, the company's consolidated goodwill balance was $3,641 million as of december 31, 2021, and the goodwill associated with the additives & functional products and chemical intermediates segments was $1,585 million and $760 million, respectively. management conducts testing of goodwill for impairment annually in the fourth quarter or more frequently when events and circumstances indicate an impairment may have occurred. management uses an income approach, specifically a discounted cash flow model in testing the carrying value of goodwill of each reporting unit for impairment. key assumptions and estimates used in the company's goodwill impairment testing included projections of revenues and earnings before interest and taxes
("ebit"), the estimated weighted average cost of capital ("wacc") and a projected long-term growth rate. the principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the goodwill impairment assessments for certain reporting units in the additives & functional products and chemical intermediates segments is a critical audit matter are (i) the significant judgment by management when estimating the fair value of the reporting units; (ii) a high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity, and effort in performing procedures and evaluating management's significant assumptions related to projections of revenues and ebit, the estimated wacc, and the projected long-term growth rate; and (iii) the audit effort involved the use of professionals with specialized skill and knowledge. addressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. these procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to management's goodwill impairment assessments, including controls over the valuation of certain reporting units in the additives & functional products and chemical intermediates segments.
these procedures also included, among others (i) testing management's process for developing the fair value estimate of certain reporting units in the additives & functional products and chemical intermediates segments,
(ii) evaluating the appropriateness of the discounted cash flow model, (iii) testing the completeness, accuracy and relevance of underlying data used in the model, and (iv) evaluating the significant assumptions used by management related to projections of revenues and ebit, the estimated wacc, and the projected long-term growth rate.
evaluating management's assumptions related to projections of revenues and ebit and the projected long- term growth rate involved evaluating whether the assumptions used by management were reasonable considering (i) the current and past performance of the reporting unit, (ii) the consistency with external industry reports, and (iii) whether these assumptions were consistent with evidence obtained in other areas of the audit. professionals with specialized skill and knowledge were used to assist in the evaluation of the company's discounted cash flow model and the estimated wacc assumption.

notes to the audited consolidated financial statements
1.
significant accounting policies financial statement presentation the consolidated financial statements of eastman chemical company ("eastman" or the "company") and subsidiaries are prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted ("gaap") in the united states and of necessity include some amounts that are based upon management estimates and judgments. future actual results could differ from such current estimates. the consolidated financial statements include assets, liabilities, sales revenue, and expenses of all majority-owned subsidiaries and joint ventures in which a controlling interest is maintained.
eastman accounts for other joint ventures and investments in minority-owned companies where it exercises significant influence on the equity basis. intercompany transactions and balances are eliminated in consolidation.
certain prior period data has been reclassified in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying footnotes to conform to current period presentation.
recently adopted accounting standards accounting standards update ("asu") asu 2019-12 income taxes - simplifying the accounting for income taxes : on january 1, 2021, eastman adopted this update which is a part of the financial accounting standards board's ("fasb")
initiative to reduce complexity in accounting standards. adoption methods varied based on the specific tax items impacted. the adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on the company's financial statements and related disclosures.
asu 2020-01 investments - equity securities (topic 321), investments - equity method and joint ventures (topic
323), and derivatives and hedging (topic 815) - clarifying the interactions between topic 321, topic 323, and topic
815: on january 1, 2021, eastman prospectively adopted this update which provides clarification that an entity should consider observable transactions that require the application or discontinuance of the equity method of accounting for the purposes of applying the measurement alternative and clarification that certain forward contracts and purchased options to purchase securities that, upon settlement, would be accounted for under the equity method of accounting. the adoption of this standard did not have an impact to the company's financial statements and related disclosures.
asu 2021-01 reference rate reform (topic 848) : in january 2021, the fasb issued this update to clarify that certain optional expedients and exceptions under this topic for contract modifications and hedge accounting apply to derivatives instruments that use an interest rate for margining, discounting, or contract price alignment that is modified as a result of reference rate reform (the global financial markets transition in contracts, hedging relationships, and other transactions from referencing the london interbank offered rate (libor) and other interbank offered rates to new reference rates). this update was effective immediately upon release. the company has had no reference rate reform modifications to date; this update will be adopted on a prospective basis in the event of any such modifications.
accounting standards issued but not adopted as of december 31, 2021
asu 2021-05 leases - lessors - certain leases with variable lease payments (topic 842) : in july 2021, this update was issued as a part of the fasb's post-implementation review of this topic. the update provides that lessors should classify and account for a lease with variable lease payments that do not depend on a reference index or a rate as an operating lease if both: the lease would have been classified as a sales-type lease or a direct financing lease and the lessor would have otherwise recognized a day-one loss. this guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after december 15, 2021 and interim periods within those fiscal years. adoption can be applied on either a retrospective or prospective basis. management does not expect that changes required by the new standard will materially impact the company's financial statements and related disclosures.
asu 2021-08 business combinations - accounting for contract assets and contract liabilities from contracts with customers (topic 805) : the fasb issued this update in october 2021, which requires that an entity (acquirer)
recognize and measure contract assets and contract liabilities acquired in a business combination in accordance with topic 606 revenue from contracts with customers , as if it had originated the contracts. the update also provides certain practical expedients for acquirers and is applicable to all contract assets and liabilities within the scope of topic 606. this guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after december 15, 2022, including interim periods within those years. early adoption is permitted, including adoption in an interim period. adoption is on a prospective basis to business combinations occurring on or after the initial application and if adopted early, retrospectively to all business combinations for which the acquisition date occurs on or after the beginning of the fiscal year that includes the interim period of early application. management does not expect that changes required by the new standard will impact the company's financial statements and related disclosures.
69
notes to the audited consolidated financial statements asu 2021-10 government assistance - disclosures by business entities about government assistance (topic 832) : the fasb issued this guidance in november 2021, given the lack of specific authoritative guidance in gaap. the amendment requires annual disclosures about transactions with a government that are accounted for by applying a grant or contribution accounting model by analogy (for example, a grant model within international financial reporting standards).this guidance is effective for financial statements issued for annual periods beginning after december 15, 2021, and early adoption is permitted. the guidance can be adopted prospectively or retrospectively.
management does not expect that changes required by the new standard will impact the company's related disclosures.
revenue recognition eastman recognizes revenue when performance obligations of the sale are satisfied. eastman sells to customers through master sales agreements or standalone purchase orders. the majority of the company's terms of sale have a single performance obligation to transfer products. accordingly, the company recognizes revenue when control has been transferred to the customer, generally at the time of shipment of products.
eastman accounts for shipping and handling as activities to fulfill the promise to transfer the good and does not allocate revenue to those activities. all related shipping and handling costs are recognized at the time of shipment. amounts collected for sales or other similar taxes are presented net of the related tax expense rather than presenting them as additional revenue. the incremental cost of obtaining a sales contract is recognized as a selling expense when incurred given the potential amortization period for such an asset is one year or less. the possible existence of a significant financing component within a sales contract is ignored when the time between cash collection and performance is less than one year. finally, the company does not disclose any unfulfilled obligations as customer purchase order commitments have an original expected duration of one year or less and no consideration from customers is excluded from the transaction price.
the timing of eastman's customer billings does not always match the timing of revenue recognition. when the company is entitled to bill a customer in advance of the recognition of revenue, a contract liability is recognized. when the company is not entitled to bill a customer until a period after the related recognition of revenue, a contract asset is recognized. contract assets represent the company's right to consideration for the exchange of goods under a contract but which are not yet billable to a customer for consignment inventory or pursuant to certain shipping terms. contract liabilities were $ 14million and $ 18million as of december 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively, and are included as a part of "payables and other current liabilities" and "other long-term liabilities" in the consolidated statements of financial position. contract assets were $ 82million and $ 62million as of december 31,
2021 and 2020, respectively, and are included as a component of "miscellaneous receivables" in the consolidated statements of financial position.
for additional information, see note 20, "segment and regional sales information".
pension and other postretirement benefits eastman maintains defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefits plans that provide eligible employees with retirement benefits. the estimated amounts of the costs and obligations related to these benefits reflect the company's assumptions related to discount rates, expected return on plan assets, rate of compensation increase or decrease for employees, and health care cost trends. the estimated cost of providing plan benefits also depends on demographic assumptions including retirements, mortality, turnover, and plan participation.
eastman's pension and other postretirement benefit plans costs consist of two elements: 1) ongoing costs recognized quarterly, which are comprised of service and interest costs, expected returns on plan assets, and amortization of prior service credits; and 2) mark-to-market ("mtm") gains and losses recognized annually, in the fourth quarter of each year, primarily resulting from changes in actuarial assumptions for discount rates and the differences between actual and expected returns on plan assets. any interim remeasurements triggered by a curtailment, settlement, or significant plan changes are recognized in the quarter in which such remeasurement event occurs.
for additional information, see note 11, "retirement plans".
70
notes to the audited consolidated financial statements environmental costs eastman recognizes environmental remediation costs when it is probable that the company has incurred a liability at a contaminated site and the amount can be reasonably estimated. when a single amount cannot be reasonably estimated but the cost can be estimated within a range, the company recognizes the minimum undiscounted amount. this undiscounted amount reflects liabilities expected to be paid within approximately 30years and the company's assumptions about remediation requirements at the contaminated site, the nature of the remedy, the outcome of discussions with regulatory agencies and other potentially responsible parties at multi-party sites, and the number and financial viability of other potentially responsible parties. changes in the estimates on which the accruals are based, unanticipated government enforcement action, or changes in health, safety, environmental, and chemical control regulations and testing requirements could result in higher or lower costs.
the company also establishes reserves for closure and post-closure costs associated with the environmental and other assets it maintains. environmental assets include but are not limited to waste management units, such as landfills, water treatment facilities, and surface impoundments. when these types of assets are constructed or installed, a loss contingency reserve is established for the anticipated future costs associated with the retirement or closure of the asset based on its expected life and the applicable regulatory closure requirements.
the company recognizes the asset retirement obligations in the period in which they are incurred if a reasonable estimate of fair value can be made. the asset retirement obligations are discounted to expected present value and subsequently adjusted for changes in fair value. these future estimated costs are charged to earnings over the estimated useful life of the assets. if the company changes its estimate of the environmental asset retirement obligation costs or its estimate of the useful lives of these assets, earnings will be impacted in the period the estimate is changed. the associated estimated asset retirement costs are capitalized as part of the carrying value of the long-lived assets and depreciated over their useful life and charged to "cost of sales" in the consolidated statements of earnings, comprehensive income and retained earnings.
environmental costs are capitalized if they extend the life of the related property, increase its capacity, or mitigate the possibility of future contamination. the cost of operating and maintaining environmental control facilities is charged to "cost of sales" in the consolidated statements of earnings, comprehensive income and retained earnings, as incurred.
for additional information see note 13, "environmental matters and asset retirement obligations".
share-based compensation eastman recognizes compensation expense in "selling, general and administrative expense" in the consolidated statements of earnings, comprehensive income and retained earnings for stock options and other share-based compensation awards based upon the grant-date fair value over the substantive vesting period.
for additional information, see note 18, "share-based compensation plans and awards".
restructuring of operations eastman records restructuring charges for costs incurred in connection with consolidation of operations, exited business or product lines, or shutdowns of specific sites that are expected to be substantially completed within twelve months. these restructuring charges are recorded as incurred, and are associated with site closures, legal and environmental matters, demolition, contract terminations, obsolete inventory, or other costs and charges directly related to the restructuring. the company records severance charges for employee separations when the separation is probable and reasonably estimable. in the event employees are required to perform future service, the company records severance charges ratably over the remaining service period of those employees.
for additional information, see note 16, "asset impairments and restructuring charges, net".
71
notes to the audited consolidated financial statements income taxes the provision for income taxes has been determined using the asset and liability approach of accounting for income taxes. under this approach, deferred taxes represent the future tax consequences expected to occur when the reported amounts of assets and liabilities are recovered or paid. the provision for income taxes represents income taxes paid or payable for the current year plus the change in deferred taxes during the year. deferred taxes result from differences between the financial and tax bases of eastman's assets and liabilities and are adjusted for changes in tax rates and tax laws when changes are enacted. the recoverability of the company's deferred tax assets are evaluated each quarter by assessing the likelihood of future profitability and available tax planning strategies that could be implemented to realize the company's net deferred tax assets. valuation allowances are recorded to reduce deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will not be realized.
provision has been made for income taxes on unremitted earnings of subsidiaries and affiliates, except for subsidiaries in which earnings are deemed to be indefinitely reinvested. the calculation of income tax liabilities involves uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws and regulations, which are subject to legal interpretation and management judgment. eastman's income tax returns are regularly examined by federal, state and foreign tax authorities, and those audits may result in proposed adjustments. the company has evaluated these potential issues under the more-likely-than-not standard of the accounting literature. a tax position is recognized if it meets this standard and is measured at the largest amount of benefit that has a greater than 50 percent likelihood of being realized. such judgments and estimates may change based on audit settlements, court cases and interpretation of tax laws and regulations. the company accrues interest related to unrecognized income tax positions, which is included as a component of the income tax provision on the balance sheet. the accrued interest related to unrecognized income tax positions and taxes resulting from the global intangible low-tax income are recorded as a component of the income tax provision.
for additional information, see note 8, "income taxes".
cash and cash equivalents cash and cash equivalents include cash, time deposits, and readily marketable securities with original maturities of three months or less.
fair value measurements eastman records recurring and non-recurring financial assets and liabilities as well as all non-financial assets and liabilities subject to fair value measurement at the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants. these fair value principles prioritize valuation inputs across three broad levels. level 1 inputs are quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. level 2 inputs are quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets or inputs that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly through market corroboration, for substantially the full term of the financial instrument. level 3 inputs are unobservable inputs based on the company's assumptions used to measure assets and liabilities at fair value. an asset or liability's classification within the various levels is determined based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement.
accounts receivable and allowance for credit losses trade accounts receivable are recorded at the invoiced amount and do not bear interest. eastman maintains allowances for estimated credit losses, which are developed at a market, country, and region level based on risk of collection as well as current and forecasted economic conditions. the company calculates the allowance based on an assessment of the risk when the accounts receivable is recognized. write-offs are recorded at the time a customer receivable is deemed uncollectible. allowance for credit losses was $ 17million and $ 14million as of december 31,
2021 and 2020, respectively. the company does not enter into receivables of a long-term nature, also known as financing receivables, in the normal course of business.
72
notes to the audited consolidated financial statements inventories inventories measured by the last-in, first-out ("lifo") method are valued at the lower of cost or market and inventories measured by the first-in, first-out ("fifo") method are valued at the lower of cost or net realizable value. eastman determines the cost of most raw materials, work in process, and finished goods inventories in the united states and switzerland by the lifo method. the cost of all other inventories is determined by the average cost method, which approximates the fifo method. the company writes-down its inventories equal to the difference between the carrying value of inventory and the estimated market value or net realizable value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions.
for additional information, see note 3, "inventories".
properties eastman records properties at cost. maintenance and repairs are charged to earnings; replacements and betterments are capitalized. when eastman retires or otherwise disposes of assets, it removes the cost of such assets and related accumulated depreciation from the accounts. the company records any profit or loss on retirement or other disposition in "cost of sales" in the consolidated statements of earnings, comprehensive income and retained earnings. asset impairments are reflected as increases in accumulated depreciation for properties that have been placed in service. in instances when an asset has not been placed in service and is impaired, the associated costs are removed from the appropriate property accounts.
depreciation and amortization depreciation expense is calculated based on historical cost and the estimated useful lives of the assets, generally using the straight-line method. estimated useful lives for buildings and building equipment generally range from 20
to 50 years. estimated useful lives generally ranging from 3 to 33 yearsare applied to machinery and equipment in the following categories: computer software ( 3 to 5 years); office furniture and fixtures and computer equipment (
5 to 10 years); vehicles, railcars, and general machinery and equipment ( 5 to 20 years); and manufacturing-related improvements ( 20 to 33 years). accelerated depreciation is reported when the estimated useful life is shortened and continues to be reported in "cost of sales" in the consolidated statements of earnings, comprehensive income and retained earnings.
for additional information, see note 4, "properties and accumulated depreciation".
amortization expense for definite-lived intangible assets is generally determined using a straight-line method over the estimated useful life of the asset. amortization expense is reported in "cost of sales" in the consolidated statements of earnings, comprehensive income and retained earnings.
for additional information, see note 5, "goodwill and other intangible assets".
impairment of long-lived assets definite-lived assets properties and equipment and definite-lived intangible assets to be held and used by eastman are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. the review of properties and equipment and the review of definite-lived intangible assets is performed at the asset group level, which is the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities. if the carrying amount is not considered to be recoverable, an analysis of fair value is triggered. an impairment is recognized for the excess of the carrying amount of the asset over the fair value.
73
notes to the audited consolidated financial statements goodwill goodwill is an asset determined as the residual of the purchase price over the fair value of identified assets and liabilities acquired in a business combination. eastman conducts testing of goodwill for impairment annually in the fourth quarter or more frequently when events and circumstances indicate an impairment may have occurred. the testing of goodwill is performed at the "reporting unit" level which the company has determined to be its "components".
components are defined as an operating segment or one level below an operating segment, and in order to be a reporting unit, the component must 1) be a "business" as defined by applicable accounting standards (an integrated set of activities and assets that is capable of being conducted and managed for the purpose of providing a return in the form of dividends, lower costs, or other economic benefits directly to the investors or other owners, members, or participants); 2) have discrete financial information available; and 3) be reviewed regularly by company operating segment management. the company aggregates certain components into reporting units based on economic similarities. an impairment is recognized when the reporting unit's estimated fair value is less than its carrying value. the company uses an income approach, specifically a discounted cash flow model in testing the carrying value of goodwill of each reporting unit for impairment.
indefinite-lived intangible assets eastman conducts testing of indefinite-lived intangible assets annually in the fourth quarter or more frequently when events and circumstances indicate an impairment may have occurred. the carrying value of an indefinite-lived intangible asset is considered to be impaired when the fair value, as established by appraisal or based on discounted future cash flows of certain related products, is less than the respective carrying value.
indefinite-lived intangible assets, consisting primarily of various tradenames, are tested for potential impairment by comparing the estimated fair value to the carrying amount. the company uses an income approach, specifically the relief from royalty method, to test indefinite-lived intangible assets. the estimated fair value of tradenames is determined based on an assumed royalty rate savings, discounted by the calculated market participant estimated weighted average cost of capital ("wacc") plus a risk premium.
for additional information, see note 5, "goodwill and other intangible assets".
leases there are two types of leases: finance and operating. both types of leases have associated right-to-use assets and lease liabilities that are valued at the net present value of the lease payments and recognized on the consolidated statements of financial position. the discount rate used in the measurement of a right-to-use asset and lease liability is the rate implicit in the lease whenever that rate is readily determinable. if the rate implicit in the lease is not readily determinable, the collateralized incremental borrowing rate is used. the company elected the accounting policy not to apply the recognition and measurement requirements to short-term leases with a term of 12
months or less and do not include a bargain purchase option. residual guarantee payments that become probable and estimable are recognized as rent expense over the remaining life of the applicable lease.
for lease accounting policies, see note 12, "leases and other commitments".
investments the consolidated financial statements include the accounts of eastman and all its subsidiaries and entities or joint ventures in which a controlling interest is maintained. the company includes its share of earnings and losses of such investments in "net earnings attributable to eastman" and "comprehensive income attributable to eastman"
located in the consolidated statements of earnings, comprehensive income and retained earnings and in "total equity" located in the consolidated statements of financial position.
investments in affiliates over which the company has significant influence but not a controlling interest are carried under the equity method of accounting. these investments are included in "other noncurrent assets" in the consolidated statements of financial position. the company includes its share of earnings and losses of such investments in "other (income) charges, net" located in the consolidated statements of earnings, comprehensive income and retained earnings.
for additional information, see note 6, "equity investments".
74
notes to the audited consolidated financial statements derivative and non-derivative financial instruments eastman uses derivative and non-derivative instruments to manage its exposure to market risks, such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates, commodity prices, and interest rates. the company does not enter into derivative transactions for speculative purposes.
the company's derivative instruments are recognized as either assets or liabilities on the consolidated statements of financial position and measured at fair value. hedge accounting will be discontinued prospectively for all hedges that no longer qualify for hedge accounting treatment.
for additional information, see note 10, "derivative and non-derivative financial instruments".
litigation and contingent liabilities from time to time, eastman and its operations are parties to or targets of lawsuits, claims, investigations and proceedings, including product liability, personal injury, asbestos, patent and intellectual property, commercial, contract, environmental, antitrust, health and safety, and employment matters, which are handled and defended in the ordinary course of business. the company accrues a contingent loss liability for such matters when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated. when a single amount cannot be reasonably estimated but the cost can be estimated within a range, the company accrues the minimum amount. the company expenses legal costs, including those expected to be incurred in connection with a loss contingency, as incurred.
working capital management and off balance sheet arrangements the company has an off balance sheet, uncommitted accounts receivable factoring program under which entire invoices may be sold, without recourse, to third-party financial institutions. under these agreements, the company sells the invoices at face value, less a transaction fee, which substantially equals the carrying value and fair value with no gain or loss recognized, and no credit loss exposure is retained. available capacity under these agreements, which the company uses as a routine source of working capital funding, is dependent on the level of accounts receivable eligible to be sold and the financial institutions' willingness to purchase such receivables. in addition, certain agreements also require that the company continue to service, administer, and collect the sold accounts receivable at market rates. the total amount of receivables sold in 2021 and 2020 were $ 1.2billion and $
1.5billion, respectively.
the company works with suppliers to optimize payment terms and conditions on accounts payable to enhance timing of working capital and cash flows. the company has a voluntary supply chain finance program to provide suppliers with the opportunity to sell receivables due from eastman to a participating financial institution. eastman's responsibility is limited to making payments on the terms originally negotiated with suppliers, regardless of whether the suppliers sell their receivables to the financial institution. the range of payment terms eastman negotiates with suppliers are consistent, regardless of whether a supplier participates in the program. all of eastman's accounts payable and associated payments are reported consistently in the company's consolidated statements of financial position and consolidated statements of cash flows regardless of whether they are associated with a vendor who participates in the program.
2.
divestiture and business held for sale divestiture on november 1, 2021, eastman completed the previously reported sale of rubber additives (including crystextm insoluble sulfur and santoflextm antidegradants) and other product lines and related assets and technology of the global tire additives business ("rubber additives") of its additives & functional products ("afp") segment to an affiliate of one rock capital partners, llc ("one rock"). the sale did not include the eastman imperatm and other performance resins product lines of the tire additives business. the company will provide certain business transition and post-closing services to one rock on agreed terms. the business being sold was not reported as a discontinued operation because the sale did not have a major effect on the company's operations and financial results.
75
notes to the audited consolidated financial statements the total estimated consideration, after estimates of contingent consideration and post-closing adjustments and ongoing agreements through october 2027, was $ 687million. the additional amount of consideration of up to $
75million is to be paid based on performance of divested rubber additives through december 2023. the divestiture resulted in a $ 552million loss (including cumulative translation adjustment liquidation of $ 23million and certain costs to sell of $ 10 million).
the major classes of divested assets and liabilities were as follows:

separately, the company recognized $ 15million of transaction costs for the sale of the business in 2021.
transaction costs are expensed as incurred and are included in the "selling, general and administrative expenses"
line item in the consolidated statements of earnings, comprehensive income and retained earnings.
business held for sale on october 28, 2021, the company entered into a definitive agreement to sell the adhesives resins business, which includes hydrocarbon resins (including imperatm tire resins), pure monomer resins, polyolefin polymers, rosins and dispersions, and oleochemical and fatty-acid based resins product lines ("adhesives resins"), of its afp segment for $ 1billion. the sale, subject to regulatory approvals and satisfaction of other customary closing conditions, is expected to be completed in first half 2022. the final purchase price is subject to working capital and other adjustments at closing. the business being sold will not be reported as a discontinued operation because the sale will not have a major effect on the company's operations and financial results. as of the definitive agreement date and until the sale, the adhesives resins business disposal group will be classified as held for sale and reported at its carrying value given this value is lower than the estimated fair value less cost to sell. long-lived assets and definite-lived intangible assets are not depreciated or amortized while classified as held for sale.

in second quarter 2020, outside of the annual impairment testing process, the company reviewed the indefinite-lived intangible assets associated with the now divested tire additives reporting unit for impairment. as a result of the review, the company recognized intangible asset impairments of $ 123million in second quarter 2020 in the tire additives reporting unit to reduce the carrying value of the crystex tm and santoflex tm tradenames to the estimated fair value. the impairments are primarily the result of weakened demand in transportation end markets impacted by the covid-19 coronavirus global pandemic ("covid-19") and increased competitive pricing pressure as a result of global capacity increases. amortization began in third quarter 2020 for the remaining value of the crystex tm tradename of $ 42million.
amortization expense of definite-lived intangible assets was $ 108million, $ 128million, and $ 160million for 2021,
2020, and 2019, respectively. estimated amortization expense for future periods is $ 85million in 2022 and 2023, $
80million in 2024, and $ 75million in 2025 and 2026.
the company will continue to monitor both goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for any indication of events which might require additional testing before the next annual impairment test and could result in material impairment charges.

the 2021 effective tax rate includes a $ 78million decrease to the provision for income taxes primarily related to previously unrecognized tax positions resulting from finalization of prior years' income tax audits, partially offset by current year increases. additionally, the 2021 effective tax rate includes impacts of the divestiture of rubber additives, including an increase to the provision for income taxes related to non-deductible losses partially offset by a decrease to the provision for income taxes from the revaluation of deferred tax liabilities.
the 2020 effective tax rate includes a $ 27million decrease to the provision for income taxes as a result of a decrease in previously unrecognized tax positions and a $ 7million decrease to the provision for income taxes related to adjustments to certain prior year tax returns.
the 2019 effective tax rate includes a $ 7million increase to the provision for income taxes resulting from adjustments to the net tax benefit recognized in fourth quarter 2017 resulting from tax law changes, primarily the
2017 tax cuts and jobs act (the "tax reform act"). the 2019 effective tax rate also includes adjustments to the tax provision to reflect finalization of prior year's income tax returns and an increase to state income taxes related to additional valuation allowance provided against state income tax credits.
income tax incentives, in the form of tax holidays, have been granted to the company in certain jurisdictions to attract investment and encourage industrial development. the expiration of these tax holidays varies by country.
the tax holidays are conditional on the company meeting certain requirements, including employment and investment thresholds; determination of compliance with these conditions may be subject to challenge by tax authorities in those jurisdictions. no individual tax holiday had a material impact to the company's earnings in 2021, 2020, or
2019.

all foreign earnings, with the exception of short-term liquid assets on certain foreign subsidiaries, including basis differences, continue to be considered indefinitely reinvested. as of december 31, 2021, unremitted earnings of subsidiaries outside the u.s. totaled approximately $ 2.2billion of which a substantial portion has already been subject to u.s. tax. the company has not determined the deferred tax liability associated with these unremitted earnings and basis differences, as such determination is not practicable.
for certain consolidated foreign subsidiaries, income and losses directly flow through to taxable income in the u.s. these entities are also subject to taxation in the foreign tax jurisdictions. net operating loss carryforwards exist to offset future taxable income in foreign tax jurisdictions and valuation allowances are provided to reduce related deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not that this benefit will not be realized. changes in the estimated realizable amount of deferred tax assets associated with net operating losses for these entities could result in changes in the deferred tax asset valuation allowance in the foreign tax jurisdiction. at the same time, because these entities are also subject to tax in the u.s., a deferred tax liability for the expected future taxable income will be established concurrently. therefore, the impact of any reversal of valuation allowances on consolidated income tax expense will be only to the extent that there are differences between the u.s. statutory tax rate and the tax rate in the foreign jurisdiction. a valuation allowance of $ 25million at december 31, 2021
has been provided against the deferred tax asset resulting from these operating loss carryforwards.
at december 31, 2021, foreign net operating loss carryforwards totaled $ 2.3billion. of this total, $ 800million will expire in 1to 20years and $ 1.5billion have no expiration date. a valuation allowance of approximately $
175million has been provided against such net operating loss carryforwards.
at december 31, 2021, there were nofederal net operating loss carryforwards available to offset future taxable income. at december 31, 2021, foreign tax credit carryforwards of approximately $ 54million were available to reduce possible future u.s. income taxes and which expire from 2022 to 2031. as a result of the tax reform act, the company may no longer be able to utilize certain u.s. foreign tax credit carryforwards. a valuation allowance of $
36million has been established on a portion of deferred tax assets as of december 31, 2021.
82
notes to the audited consolidated financial statements at december 31, 2021, a partial valuation allowance of $ 55million has been provided against state tax credits that the company may not be able to utilize.
a partial valuation allowance of $ 46million has been established for the solutia, inc. ("solutia") state net operating loss carryforwards. the valuation allowance will be retained until there is sufficient positive evidence to conclude that it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will be realized, or the related statute expires.

(1) the carrying value of the euro-denominated 1.50% notes due may 2023 and 1.875% notes due november 2026 will fluctuate with changes in the euro exchange rate. the carrying value of these euro-denominated borrowings have been designated as non-derivative net investment hedges of a portion of the company's net investments in euro functional-currency denominated subsidiaries to offset foreign currency fluctuations.
in fourth quarter 2021, the company repaid the 3.5% notes due december 2021 ($ 300million principal) using available cash. there were no debt extinguishment costs associated with the repayment of this debt. the total consideration for this redemption is reported under financing activities on the consolidated statement of cash flows.
in fourth quarter 2020, the company repaid the 4.5% notes due january 2021 ($ 185million principal) using available cash. there were no material debt extinguishment costs associated with the early repayment of this debt. the total consideration for this redemption is reported under financing activities on the consolidated statement of cash flows.
loan agreement, credit facility, and commercial paper borrowings in second quarter 2020, the company borrowed $ 250million under a new 364-day term loan credit agreement (the "term loan") as a precautionary measure due to increased financial market volatility, particularly in the availability and terms of commercial paper, resulting from covid-19. in third quarter 2020, the term loan was repaid using available cash. the early repayment resulted in a charge of $ 1million for early debt extinguishment costs which was primarily attributable to related unamortized issuance costs.
the company has access to a $ 1.50billion revolving credit agreement (the "credit facility") that was amended and restated in december 2021. the amendments include the addition of sustainability-linked pricing terms and extending the maturity to december 2026. this resulted in a charge of $ 1million for early debt extinguishment costs which was attributable to unamortized fees. borrowings under the credit facility are subject to interest at varying spreads above quoted market rates and a commitment fee is paid on the total unused commitment. the credit facility provides available liquidity for general corporate purposes and supports commercial paper borrowings. commercial paper borrowings are classified as short-term. at december 31, 2021 and 2020, the company had no outstanding borrowings under the credit facility. at december 31, 2021, the company had nooutstanding commercial paper borrowings. at december 31, 2020, the company's commercial paper borrowings were $ 50million with a weighted average interest rate of 0.25percent.
the credit facility contains customary covenants, including requirements to maintain certain financial ratios, that determine the events of default, amounts available, and terms of borrowings. the company was in compliance with all applicable covenants at both december 31, 2021 and 2020.

notes to the audited consolidated financial statements fair value of borrowings eastman has classified its total borrowings at december 31, 2021 and 2020 under the fair value hierarchy as defined in the accounting policies in note 1, "significant accounting policies". the fair value for fixed-rate debt securities is based on quoted market prices for the same or similar debt instruments and is classified as level 2.
the fair value for the company's other borrowings primarily under the commercial paper and receivables facility equals the carrying value and is classified as level 2. at december 31, 2021 and 2020, the fair value of total borrowings was $ 5,737million and $ 6,449million, respectively. the company had no borrowings classified as level 1
or level 3 as of december 31, 2021 and 2020.
10. derivative and non-derivative financial instruments overview of hedging programs eastman is exposed to market risks, such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates, commodity prices, and interest rates. to mitigate these market risks and their effects on the cash flows of the underlying transactions and investments in foreign subsidiaries, the company uses various derivative and non-derivative financial instruments, when appropriate, in accordance with the company's hedging strategy and policies. designation is performed on a specific exposure basis to support hedge accounting. the company does not enter into derivative transactions for speculative purposes.
cash flow hedges cash flow hedges are derivative instruments designated as and used to hedge the exposure to variability in expected future cash flows that are attributable to a particular risk. the derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as a cash flow hedge are reported on the balance sheet at fair value and the changes in fair value of these hedging instruments are offset in part or in whole by corresponding changes in the anticipated cash flows of the underlying exposures being hedged. the change in the hedge instrument is reported as a component of aoci located in the consolidated statements of financial position and reclassified into earnings in the same period or periods during which the hedged transaction affects earnings. cash flows from cash flow hedges are classified as operating activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows.
foreign currency exchange rate hedging eastman manufactures and sells its products in a number of countries throughout the world and, as a result, is exposed to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. to manage the volatility relating to these exposures, the company nets the exposures on a consolidated basis to take advantage of natural offsets. to manage the remaining exposure, the company enters into currency option and forward cash flow hedges to hedge probable anticipated, but not yet committed, export sales and purchase transactions expected within a rolling three year period and denominated in foreign currencies (principally the euro). additionally, the company, from time to time, enters into forward exchange contract cash flow hedges to hedge certain firm commitments denominated in foreign currencies.
commodity hedging certain raw material and energy sources used by eastman, as well as sales of certain commodity products by the company, are subject to price volatility caused by weather, supply and demand conditions, economic variables and other unpredictable factors. this volatility is primarily related to the market pricing of benzene, ethane, ethylene, natural gas, paraxylene, and propane. in order to mitigate expected fluctuations in market prices, from time to time, the company enters into option and forward contracts and designates these contracts as cash flow hedges. the company currently hedges commodity price risks using derivative financial instrument transactions within a rolling three year period. the company weights its hedge portfolio more heavily in the first year with declining coverage over the remaining periods.
interest rate hedging eastman's policy is to manage interest expense using a mix of fixed and variable rate debt. to manage interest rate risk effectively, the company, from time to time, enters into cash flow interest rate derivative instruments, primarily forward starting swaps and treasury locks, to hedge the company's exposure to movements in interest rates prior to anticipated debt offerings. these instruments are designated as cash flow hedges.
85
notes to the audited consolidated financial statements in first, second, and third quarters 2020, eastman entered into forward-starting interest rate swaps with a notional amount of $ 25million in each period to mitigate the risk of variability in interest rates for an expected long-term debt issuance by august 2022. these swaps were designated as cash flow hedges and will be settled upon debt issuance. the total notional for outstanding forward starting swaps as of december 31, 2021 was $ 75million.
fair value hedges fair value hedges are defined as derivative or non-derivative instruments designated as and used to hedge the exposure to changes in the fair value of an asset or a liability or an identified portion thereof that is attributable to a particular risk. the derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as fair value hedges are reported as "long-term borrowings" on the consolidated statements of financial position at fair value and the changes in fair value of these hedging instruments are offset in part or in whole by corresponding changes in the anticipated fair value of the underlying exposures being hedged. the net of the change in the hedge instrument and item being hedged for qualifying fair value hedges is recognized in earnings in the same period or periods during which the hedged transaction affects earnings. cash flows from fair value hedges are classified as operating activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows.
interest rate hedging eastman's policy is to manage interest expense using a mix of fixed and variable rate debt. to manage the company's mix of fixed and variable rate debt effectively, from time to time, the company enters into interest rate swaps in which the company agrees to exchange the difference between fixed and variable interest amounts calculated by reference to an agreed upon notional principal amount. these swaps are designated as hedges of the fair value of the underlying debt obligations and the interest rate differential is reflected as an adjustment to interest expense over the life of the swaps.
net investment hedges net investment hedges are defined as derivative or non-derivative instruments designated as and used to hedge the foreign currency exposure of the net investment in certain foreign operations. the net of the change in the hedge instrument and item being hedged for qualifying net investment hedges is reported as a component of the "cumulative translation adjustment" ("cta") within aoci located in the consolidated statements of financial position. cash flows from the cta component are classified as operating activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows.
recognition in earnings of amounts previously recognized in cta is limited to circumstances such as complete or substantially complete liquidation of the net investment in the hedged foreign operation. in the event of a complete or substantially complete liquidation of the net investment, cash flows from net investment hedges are classified as investing activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows.
for derivative cross-currency interest rate swap net investment hedges, gains and losses representing hedge components excluded from the assessment of effectiveness are recognized in cta within aoci and recognized in earnings through the periodic swap interest accruals. the cross-currency interest rate swaps designated as net investment hedges are included as part of "other long-term liabilities" or "other noncurrent assets" within the consolidated statements of financial position. cash flows from excluded components are classified as operating activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows.
in september 2020, the company entered into fixed-to-fixed cross-currency swaps and designated these swaps to hedge a portion of its net investment in a euro functional currency denominated subsidiary against foreign currency fluctuations. these contracts involve the exchange of fixed u.s. dollars with fixed euro interest payments periodically over the life of the contracts and an exchange of the notional amounts at maturity. the fixed-to-fixed cross-currency swaps include € 152million ($ 180million) maturing december 2028.

fair value measurements for additional information on fair value measurement, see note 1, "significant accounting policies".
all the company's derivative assets and liabilities are currently classified as level 2. level 2 fair value is based on estimates using standard pricing models. these standard pricing models use inputs that are derived from or corroborated by observable market data such as interest rate yield curves and currency spot and forward rates. the fair value of commodity contracts is derived using forward curves supplied by an industry recognized and unrelated third party. in addition, on an ongoing basis, the company tests a subset of its valuations against valuations received from the transaction's counterparty to validate the accuracy of its standard pricing models. the company had no derivatives classified as level 1 or level 3 as of december 31, 2021 or december 31, 2020. counterparties to these derivative contracts are highly rated financial institutions which the company believes carry minimal risk of nonperformance and the company diversifies its positions among such counterparties to reduce its exposure to counterparty risk and credit losses. the company monitors the creditworthiness of its counterparties on an ongoing basis. the company did not realize a credit loss during the years ended december 31, 2021 or 2020.
all the company's derivative contracts are subject to master netting arrangements, or similar agreements, which provide for the option to settle contracts on a net basis when they settle on the same day and in the same currency. in addition, these arrangements provide for a net settlement of all contracts with a given counterparty in the event that the arrangement is terminated due to the occurrence of default or a termination event. the company does not have any cash collateral due under such agreements.

into earnings the company enters into foreign exchange derivatives denominated in multiple currencies which are transacted and settled in the same quarter. these derivatives are not designated as hedges due to the short-term nature and the gains or losses on these derivatives are marked-to-market in the line item "other (income) charges, net" of the consolidated statements of earnings, comprehensive income and retained earnings. the company recognized nogain or loss in 2021 and a net loss of $ 1million in 2020 on these derivatives.
pre-tax monetized positions and mtm gains and losses from raw materials and energy, currency, and certain interest rate hedges that were included in aoci included losses of $ 7million at december 31, 2021 and losses of $
270million at december 31, 2020. losses in aoci decreased in 2021 compared to 2020 primarily as a result of an decrease in foreign currency exchange rates, particularly the euro. if realized, approximately $ 20million in pre-
tax gains will be reclassified into earnings during the next 12 months.

retirement plans as described below, eastman offers various postretirement benefits to its employees.
defined contribution plans eastman sponsors a defined contribution employee stock ownership plan (the "esop"), which is a component of the eastman investment plan and employee stock ownership plan ("eip/esop"), under section 401(a) of the internal revenue code. eastman made a contribution in february 2022 to the eip/esop for substantially all u.s. employees equal to 5percent of their eligible compensation for the 2021 plan year. employees may allocate contributions to other investment funds within the eip from the esop at any time without restrictions. allocated shares in the esop totaled 1,909,362; 1,997,587; and 2,076,203shares as of december 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively. dividends on shares held by the eip/esop are charged to retained earnings. all shares held by the eip/esop are treated as outstanding in computing earnings per share ("eps").
in 2006, the company amended its eip/esop to provide a company match of 50percent of the first 7percent of an employee's compensation contributed to the plan for employees who are hired on or after january 1, 2007. employees who are hired on or after january 1, 2007, are also eligible for the contribution to the esop as described above.
charges for domestic contributions to the eip/esop were $ 73million, $ 67million, and $ 68million for 2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively.
defined benefit pension plans and other postretirement benefit plans pension plans eastman maintains defined benefit pension plans that provide eligible employees with retirement benefits.
effective january 1, 2000, the company's eastman retirement assistance plan, a u.s. defined benefit pension plan, was amended. employees' accrued pension benefits earned prior to january 1, 2000 are calculated based on previous plan provisions using the employee's age, years of service, and final average compensation as defined in the plans.
the amended plan uses a pension equity formula to calculate an employee's retirement benefits from january 1, 2000
forward. benefits payable will be the combined pre-2000 and post-1999 benefits. employees hired on or after january
1, 2007 are not eligible to participate in eastman's u.s. defined benefit pension plans.
benefits are paid to employees from trust funds. contributions to the trust funds are made as permitted by laws and regulations. the pension trust funds do not directly own any of the company's common stock.
pension coverage for employees of eastman's non-u.s. operations is provided, to the extent deemed appropriate, through separate plans. the company systematically provides for obligations under such plans by depositing funds with trustees, under insurance policies, or by book reserves.
other postretirement benefit plans under its other postretirement benefit plans in the u.s., eastman provides life insurance for eligible retirees hired prior to january 1, 2007. eastman provided a subsidy for pre-medicare health care and dental benefits to eligible retirees hired prior to january 1, 2007 that ended on december 31, 2021. company funding is also provided for eligible medicare retirees hired prior to january 1, 2007 with a health reimbursement arrangement. a few of the company's non-u.s. operations have supplemental health benefit plans for certain retirees, the cost of which is not significant to the company.

notes to the audited consolidated financial statements in fourth quarter 2020, the company settled approximately $ 110million of one of the u.s. defined benefit pension plans' obligation to an insurer through the purchase of a nonparticipating group annuity contract. in addition, there were settlements for several pension plans where lump sum payments exceeded the sum of the service and interest cost components of net periodic benefit cost of the respective plan for the year.
in 2020, the company had a plan amendment that changed benefits provided by a netherlands defined benefit pension plan which resulted in a remeasurement of the plan's obligation. the remeasurement resulted in a pre-tax reduction in the projected benefit obligation of $ 12million which is being amortized as a prior service from accumulated other comprehensive income over approximately 13years.

the company calculates service and interest cost components of net periodic benefit costs for its significant defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans by applying the specific spot rates along the yield curve to the plans' projected cash flows.
the fair value of plan assets for the u.s. pension plans at december 31, 2021 and 2020 was $ 1.9billion and $
1.8billion, respectively, while the fair value of plan assets at december 31, 2021 and 2020 for non-u.s. pension plans was $ 924million and $ 938million, respectively. at december 31, 2021 and 2020, the expected weighted-average long-term rate of return on u.s. pension plan assets was 7.07percent and 7.29percent, respectively. the expected weighted-average long-term rate of return on non-u.s. pension plans assets was 3.81percent and 4.04percent at december 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.

(1) cash and cash equivalents: funds generally invested in actively managed collective trust funds or interest bearing accounts.
(2) public equity - united states: common stock equity securities which are primarily valued using a market approach based on the quoted market prices.
(3) other investments: primarily consist of insurance contracts which are generally valued using a crediting rate that approximates market returns and investments in underlying securities whose market values are unobservable and determined using pricing models, discounted cash flow methodologies, or similar techniques.
(4) investments measured at net asset value: the underlying debt, public equity, and public real asset investments in this category are generally held in common trust funds, which are either actively or passively managed investment vehicles, that are valued at the net asset value per unit/share multiplied by the number of units/shares held as of the measurement date. the other alternative investments in this category are valued under the practical expedient method which is based on the most recently reported net asset value provided by the management of each private investment fund, adjusted as appropriate, for any lag between the date of the financial reports and the measurement date.

(1) cash and cash equivalents: funds generally invested in actively managed collective trust funds or interest bearing accounts.
(2) debt: the fixed income securities are primarily valued upon a market approach, using matrix pricing and considering a security's relationship to other securities for which quoted prices in an active market may be available, or an income approach, converting future cash flows to a single present value amount. inputs used in developing fair value estimates include reported trades, broker quotes, benchmark yields, and base spreads.
the company valued assets with unobservable inputs (level 3), primarily insurance contracts, using a crediting rate that approximates market returns and investments in underlying securities whose market values are unobservable and determined using pricing models, discounted cash flow methodologies, or similar techniques.

investment strategy eastman's investment strategy for its defined benefit pension plans is to maximize the long-term rate of return on plan assets within an acceptable level of risk in order to meet or exceed the plan's actuarially assumed long-term rate of return and to minimize the cost of providing pension benefits. a periodic asset/liability study is conducted in order to assist in the determination and, if necessary, modification of the appropriate long-term investment policy for the plan. the investment policy establishes a target allocation range for each asset class and the fund is managed within those ranges. the plans use a number of investment approaches including investments in equity, real estate, and fixed income funds in which the underlying securities are marketable in order to achieve this target allocation. the plans also invest in private equity and other funds. diversification is created through investments across various asset classes, geographies, fund managers, and individual securities. this investment process is designed to provide for a well-diversified portfolio with no significant concentration of risk. the investment process is monitored by an investment committee that includes senior management.
eastman's investment strategy for its veba trust is to invest in intermediate-term, well diversified, high quality investment instruments, with a primary objective of capital preservation.
the expected rate of return for all plans was determined primarily by modeling the expected long-term rates of return for the categories of investments held by the plans and the targeted allocation percentage against various potential economic scenarios.
the company made nocontributions to its u.s. defined benefit pension plans in 2021 or 2020. for 2022 calendar year, there are no minimum required cash contributions for the u.s. defined benefit pension plans under the employee retirement income security act of 1974, as amended, and the internal revenue code of 1986, as amended.

leases and other commitments leases there are two types of leases: finance and operating. both types of leases have associated right-to-use assets and lease liabilities that are valued at the net present value of the lease payments and recognized on the consolidated statements of financial position. the discount rate used in the measurement of a right-to-use asset and lease liability is the rate implicit in the lease whenever that rate is readily determinable. if the rate implicit in the lease is not readily determinable, the collateralized incremental borrowing rate is used. the company elected the accounting policy not to apply the recognition and measurement requirements to short-term leases with a term of 12
months or less and do not include a bargain purchase option.
the company has operating leases, as a lessee, with customary terms that do not include: significant variable lease payments; significant reasonably certain extensions or options required to be included in the lease term;
restrictions; or other covenants for real property, rolling stock, and machinery and equipment. real property leases primarily consist of office space and rolling stock leases primarily for railcars and fleet vehicles. at december 31, 2021 and 2020, operating right-to-use assets of $ 216 millionand $ 185 million, respectively, are included as a part of "other noncurrent assets" in the consolidated statements of financial position and includes $
3million and $ 9million of assets previously classified as lease intangibles and $ 5million and $ 9million of prepaid lease assets, respectively. operating lease liabilities are included as a part of "payables and other current liabilities" and "other long-term liabilities" in the consolidated statements of financial position.

the company has operating leases, primarily leases for railcars, with terms that require the company to guarantee a portion of the residual value of the leased assets upon termination of the lease that will expire beginning second quarter 2022. residual guarantee payments that become probable and estimable are recognized as rent expense over the remaining life of the applicable lease. management's current expectation is that the likelihood of material residual guarantee payments is remote.

estimated future payments of debt securities assumes the repayment of principal upon stated maturity, and actual amounts and the timing of such payments may differ materially due to repayment or other changes in the terms of such debt prior to maturity.
eastman had various purchase obligations at december 31, 2021 totaling approximately $ 3.1billion over a period of approximately 30years for materials, supplies, and energy incident to the ordinary conduct of business.
amounts in other liabilities represent the current estimated cash payments required to be made by the company primarily for pension and other postretirement benefits, accrued compensation benefits, environmental loss contingency estimates, uncertain tax liabilities, and commodity and foreign exchange hedging in the periods indicated. due to uncertainties in the timing of the effective settlement of tax positions with respect to taxing authorities, management is unable to determine the timing of payments related to uncertain tax liabilities and these amounts are included in the "2027 and beyond" line item.
the amount and timing of pension and other postretirement benefit payments included in other liabilities is dependent upon interest rates, health care cost trends, actual returns on plan assets, retirement and attrition rates of employees, continuation or modification of the benefit plans, and other factors. such factors can significantly impact the amount and timing of any future contributions by the company. excess contributions are periodically made by management in order to keep the plans' funded status above 80 percent under the funding provisions of the pension protection act to avoid partial benefit restrictions on accelerated forms of payment. the company's u.s. defined benefit pension plans are not currently under any benefit restrictions. see note 11,
"retirement plans", for more information regarding pension and other postretirement benefit obligations.
the resolution of uncertainties related to environmental matters included in other liabilities may have a material adverse effect on the company's consolidated results of operations in the period recognized, however, because of the availability of legal defenses, the company's preliminary assessment of actions that may be required, and, if applicable, the expected sharing of costs, management does not believe that the company's liability for these environmental matters, individually or in the aggregate, will be material to the company's consolidated financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. see note 1, "significant accounting policies", for environmental costs, and see note 13, "environmental matters and asset retirement obligations", for more information regarding outstanding environmental matters and asset retirement obligations.

notes to the audited consolidated financial statements guarantees and claims also arise during the ordinary course of business from relationships with customers, suppliers, joint venture partners, and other parties when the company undertakes an obligation to guarantee the performance of others if specified triggering events occur. non-performance under a contract could trigger an obligation of the company. the company's current other guarantees include guarantees relating to intellectual property, environmental matters, and other indemnifications and have arisen through the normal course of business.
the ultimate effect on future financial results is not subject to reasonable estimation because considerable uncertainty exists as to the final outcome of these claims, if they were to occur. these other guarantees have terms up to 30 yearswith maximum potential future payments of approximately $ 40million in the aggregate, with none of these guarantees being individually significant to the company's operating results, financial position, or liquidity. management's current expectation is that future payment or performance related to non-performance under other guarantees is remote.
13. environmental matters and asset retirement obligations certain eastman manufacturing facilities generate hazardous and nonhazardous wastes, the treatment, storage, transportation, and disposal of which are regulated by various governmental agencies. in connection with the cleanup of various hazardous waste sites, the company, along with many other entities, has been designated a potentially responsible party ("prp") by the u.s. environmental protection agency under the comprehensive environmental response, compensation and liability act, which potentially subjects prps to joint and several liability for certain cleanup costs. in addition, the company will incur costs for environmental remediation and closure and post-closure under the federal resource conservation and recovery act. reserves for environmental contingencies have been established in accordance with eastman's policies described in note 1, "significant accounting policies". the resolution of uncertainties related to environmental matters may have a material adverse effect on the company's consolidated results of operations in the period recognized. however, because of the availability of legal defenses, the company's preliminary assessment of actions that may be required, and the extended period of time that the obligations are expected to be satisfied, management does not believe that the company's liability for these environmental matters, individually or in the aggregate, will have a material adverse effect on the company's future overall financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. the company's net reserve for environmental contingencies was $ 281million and $ 285million at december 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.
environmental remediation and environmental asset retirement obligations the company's net environmental reserve for environmental contingencies, including remediation costs and asset retirement obligations, is included as part of "other noncurrent assets", "payables and other current liabilities", and "other long-term liabilities" in the consolidated statements of financial position as follows:

environmental remediation estimated future environmental expenditures for undiscounted remediation costs ranged from the best estimate or minimum of $ 253million to the maximum of $ 473million and from the best estimate or minimum of $ 257million to the maximum of $ 501million at december 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. the best estimate or minimum estimated future environmental expenditures are considered to be probable and reasonably estimable and include the amounts recognized at both december 31, 2021 and 2020.

notes to the audited consolidated financial statements costs of certain remediation projects included in the environmental reserve are subject to a cost-sharing arrangement with monsanto company ("monsanto") under the provisions of the amended and restated settlement agreement effective february 28, 2008 (the "effective date"), into which solutia entered with monsanto upon its emergence from bankruptcy (the "monsanto settlement agreement"). under the provisions of the monsanto settlement agreement, solutia, which became a wholly-owned subsidiary of eastman on july 2, 2012, shares responsibility with monsanto for remediation at certain locations outside of the boundaries of plant sites in anniston, alabama and sauget, illinois (the "shared sites"). solutia is responsible for the funding of environmental liabilities at the shared sites up to a total of $ 325million from the effective date. if remediation costs for the shared sites exceed this amount, such costs will thereafter be shared equally between solutia and monsanto. including payments by solutia prior to its acquisition by eastman, $ 110million had been paid for costs at the shared sites as of december 31, 2021. as of december 31, 2021, an additional $ 200million has been recognized for estimated future remediation costs at the shared sites, over a period of approximately 30 years.
reserves for environmental remediation include liabilities expected to be paid within approximately 30years. the amounts charged to pre-tax earnings for environmental remediation and related charges are recognized in "cost of sales" in the consolidated statements of earnings, comprehensive income and retained earnings. changes in the reserves for environmental remediation liabilities during full year 2021 and full year 2020 are summarized below:

environmental asset retirement obligations an asset retirement obligation is an obligation for the retirement of a tangible long-lived asset that is incurred upon the acquisition, construction, development, or normal operation of that long-lived asset. environmental asset retirement obligations consist of primarily closure and post-closure costs. for sites that have environmental asset retirement obligations, the best estimate recognized to date for these environmental asset retirement obligation costs was $ 28million at both december 31, 2021 and 2020.
other eastman's cash expenditures related to environmental protection and improvement were $ 281million, $ 265million, and $ 244million in 2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively, and include operating costs associated with environmental protection equipment and facilities, engineering costs, and construction costs. the cash expenditures above include environmental capital expenditures of approximately $ 38million, $ 42million, and $ 27million in 2021, 2020, and
2019, respectively.
the company has contractual asset retirement obligations not associated with environmental liabilities. eastman's non-environmental asset retirement obligations are primarily associated with the future closure of leased manufacturing assets in pace, florida and oulu, finland. these non-environmental asset retirement obligations were
$ 51million at both december 31, 2021 and 2020, and are included in "other long-term liabilities" in the consolidated statements of financial position.

legal matters from time to time, eastman and its operations are parties to, or targets of, lawsuits, claims, investigations and proceedings, including product liability, personal injury, asbestos, patent and intellectual property, commercial, contract, environmental, antitrust, health and safety, and employment matters, which are handled and defended in the ordinary course of business. while the company is unable to predict the outcome of these matters, it does not believe, based upon currently available facts, that the ultimate resolution of any such pending matters will have a material adverse effect on its overall financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.

notes to the audited consolidated financial statements the company established a benefit security trust in 1997 to provide a degree of financial security for unfunded obligations under certain unfunded plans and contributed to the trust a warrant to purchase up to 6million shares of common stock of the company for par value. the warrant, which remains outstanding, is exercisable by the trustee if the company does not meet certain funding obligations, which obligations would be triggered by certain occurrences, including a change in control or potential change in control, as defined, or failure by the company to meet its payment obligations under certain covered unfunded plans. such warrant is excluded from the computation of diluted eps because the conditions upon which the warrant becomes exercisable have not been met.
in february 2018, the company's board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to $ 2billion of the company's outstanding common stock at such times, in such amounts, and on such terms, as determined by management to be in the best interest of the company.
in december 2021, the company entered into an accelerated share repurchase program ("asr") to purchase $ 500million of the company's common stock under the 2018 authorization. in exchange for upfront payment totaling $500 million, the financial institutions committed to deliver shares during the asr's purchase period, which will end in march
2022. the total number of shares ultimately delivered will be determined at the end of the applicable purchase period based on the volume-weighted average price of the company's stock during the term of the asr, less a discount. during the fourth quarter of 2021, 3,658,314shares for a total of $ 400million were delivered to the company, representing approximately 80 percent of the expected share repurchases under the asr. the remaining $
100million has been accounted for as a reduction to "additional paid-in capital" in the company's consolidated statements of financial position, as it has been paid, but shares have not yet been delivered.
as of december 31, 2021, a total of 15,948,995shares have been repurchased under the 2018 authorization for a total of $ 1,533million. during 2021, 2020, and 2019, the company repurchased shares of common stock of 8,061,779,
1,134,052, and 4,282,409, respectively, for a cost of approximately $ 900million, $ 60million, and $ 325million, respectively.
in december 2021, the company's board of directors authorized the additional repurchase of up to $ 2.5billion of the company's outstanding common stock at such times, in such amounts, and on such terms, as determined by management to be in the best interest of the company. no shares have been repurchased under the december 2021
authorization.
the additions to paid-in capital in 2021, 2020, and 2019 are primarily for compensation expense of equity awards and employee stock option exercises, offset in 2021 by the asr payment for which shares have not yet been delivered.
the company's charitable foundation held 50,798issued and outstanding shares of the company's common stock at december 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019 which are included in treasury stock in the consolidated statements of financial position and excluded from calculations of diluted eps.
the following table sets forth the computation of basic and diluted eps:

shares underlying stock options excluded from the 2021, 2020, and 2019 calculations of diluted eps were 150,781,
2,424,826, and 2,183,875, respectively, because the grant price of these options was greater than the average market price of the company's common stock and the effect of including them in the calculation of diluted eps would have been antidilutive.

share-based compensation plans and awards
2021 omnibus stock compensation plan eastman's 2021 omnibus stock compensation plan ("2021 omnibus plan") was approved by stockholders at the may 6,
2021 annual meeting of stockholders and shall remain in effect until its fifth anniversary.the 2021 omnibus plan authorizes the compensation and management development committee of the board of directors to grant awards, designate participants, determine the types and numbers of awards, determine the terms and conditions of awards and determine the form of award settlement. under the 2021 omnibus plan, the aggregate number of shares reserved and available for issuance is 10million, which consist of shares not previously authorized for issuance under any other plan. the number of shares covered by an award is counted against this share reserve as of the grant date of the award. shares covered by full value awards (e.g. performance shares and restricted stock awards) are counted against the total number of shares available for issuance or delivery under the plan as 2.5shares for every one share covered by the award. any stock distributed pursuant to an award may consist of, in whole or in part, authorized and unissued stock, treasury stock, or stock purchased on the open market. under the 2021 omnibus plan and previous plans, the forms of awards have included restricted stock and restricted stock units, stock options, stock appreciation rights ("sars"), and performance shares. the 2021 omnibus plan is flexible as to the number of specific forms of awards, but provides that stock options and sars are to be granted at an exercise price not less than 100 percent of the per share fair market value on the date of the grant.
director stock compensation subplan eastman's 2021 director stock compensation subplan ("directors' subplan"), a component of the 2021 omnibus plan, remains in effect until terminated by the board of directors or the earlier termination of the 2021 omnibus plan.
the directors' subplan provides for structured awards of restricted shares to non-employee members of the board of directors. restricted shares awarded under the directors' subplan are subject to the same terms and conditions of the 2021 omnibus plan. the directors' subplan does not constitute a separate source of shares for grants of equity awards and all shares awarded are part of the 10 million shares authorized under the 2021 omnibus plan. shares of restricted stock are granted on the first day of a non-employee director's initial term of service and shares of restricted stock are granted each year to each non-employee director on the date of the annual meeting of stockholders.
it has been the company's practice to issue new shares rather than treasury shares for equity awards for compensation plans, including the 2021 omnibus plan and the directors' subplan, that require settlement by the issuance of common stock and to withhold or accept back shares awarded to cover the related income tax obligations of employee participants. shares of unrestricted common stock owned by non-employee directors are not eligible to be withheld or acquired to satisfy the withholding obligation related to their income taxes. shares of unrestricted common stock owned by specified senior management level employees are accepted by the company to pay the exercise price of stock options in accordance with the terms and conditions of their awards.

notes to the audited consolidated financial statements compensation expense for 2021, 2020, and 2019, total share-based compensation expense (before tax) of approximately $ 70million, $
44million, and $ 59million, respectively, was recognized in "selling, general and administrative expense" in the consolidated statements of earnings, comprehensive income and retained earnings for all share-based awards of which approximately $ 9million, $ 7million, and $ 9million, respectively, related to stock options. the compensation expense is recognized over the substantive vesting period, which may be a shorter time period than the stated vesting period for qualifying termination eligible employees as defined in the forms of award notice. approximately
$ 2million for 2021, $ 1million for 2020, and $ 3million for 2019 of stock option compensation expense was recognized each year due to qualifying termination eligibility preceding the requisite vesting period.
stock option awards options have been granted on an annual basis by the compensation and management development committee of the board of directors under the 2021 omnibus plan and predecessor plans to employees. option awards have an exercise price equal to the closing price of the company's stock on the date of grant. the term of options is 10 yearswith vesting periods that vary up to three years. vesting usually occurs ratably over the vesting period or at the end of the vesting period. the company utilizes the black scholes merton option valuation model which relies on certain assumptions to estimate an option's fair value.

the volatility rate of grants is derived from historical company common stock price volatility over the same time period as the expected term of each stock option award. the volatility rate is derived by mathematical formula utilizing the weekly high closing stock price data over the expected term. the expected dividend yield is calculated using the company's average of the last four quarterly dividend yields. the average risk-free interest rate is derived from united states department of treasury published interest rates of daily yield curves for the same time period as the expected term. the weighted average expected term reflects the analysis of historical share-based award transactions and includes option swap and reload grants which may have much shorter remaining expected terms than new option grants.

notes to the audited consolidated financial statements other share-based compensation awards in addition to stock option awards, eastman has awarded long-term performance share awards, restricted stock awards, and sars. the long-term performance share awards are based upon actual return on capital compared to a target return on capital and total stockholder return compared to a peer group ranking by total stockholder return over a three year performance period. the awards are valued using a monte carlo simulation based model and vest pro-rata over the three year performance period. the number of long-term performance award target shares granted for the 2021-2023, 2020-2022, and 2019-2021 periods were 311thousand, 423thousand, and 412thousand, respectively.
the target shares granted are assumed to be 100 percent. at the end of the three-year performance period, the actual number of shares awarded can range from zero percent to 250 percent of the target shares granted based on the award notice. the number of restricted stock awards granted during 2021, 2020, and 2019 were 166thousand,
227thousand, and 189thousand, respectively. the fair value of a restricted stock award is equal to the closing stock price of the company's stock on the date of grant and normally vests over a period of three years. the recognized compensation expense before tax for these other share-based awards in the years ended december 31, 2021,
2020, and 2019 was approximately $ 60million, $ 37million, and $ 50million, respectively. the unrecognized compensation expense before tax for these same type awards at december 31, 2021 was approximately $ 65million and will be recognized primarily over a period of two years.

disclosure controls and procedures eastman maintains a set of disclosure controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the company in reports that it files or submits under the securities exchange act of 1934 is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in securities and exchange commission rules and forms. disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by the company in the reports that it files or submits under the securities exchange act of 1934 is accumulated and communicated to the company's management, including its principal executive and principal financial officers, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. an evaluation was carried out under the supervision and with the participation of the company's management, including the chief executive officer ("ceo") and chief financial officer ("cfo"), of the effectiveness of the company's disclosure controls and procedures. based on that evaluation, the ceo and cfo have concluded that as of december 31, 2021, the company's disclosure controls and procedures were effective to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed was accumulated and communicated to management as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.
management necessarily applies its judgment in assessing the costs and benefits of such controls and procedures, which, by their nature, can provide only reasonable assurance regarding management's control objectives.
management, including the ceo and cfo, does not expect that the company's disclosure controls and procedures can prevent all possible errors or fraud. a control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance; judgments in decision-making can be faulty; and breakdowns can occur because of simple errors or mistakes. additionally, controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of one or more persons. the design of any system of controls is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and while the company's disclosure controls and procedures are designed to be effective under circumstances where they should reasonably be expected to operate effectively, there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions. because of the inherent limitations in any control system, misstatements due to possible errors or fraud may occur and not be detected.
management's report on internal control over financial reporting management of the company is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. the company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed under the supervision of the company's ceo and cfo to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of the company's financial statements for external purposes in accordance with u.s. generally accepted accounting principles.
the company's internal control over financial reporting includes policies and procedures that:
• pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect transactions and acquisitions and dispositions of assets of the company;
• provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with u.s. generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and the directors of the company;
and
• provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the company's financial statements.
because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

management has assessed the effectiveness of its internal control over financial reporting as of december 31, 2021
based on the framework established in internal control - integrated framework (2013) issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission. based on this assessment, management has determined that the company's internal control over financial reporting was effective as of december 31, 2021.
the effectiveness of the company's internal control over financial reporting as of december 31, 2021 has been audited by pricewaterhousecoopers llp, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report which appears herein.
changes in internal control over financial reporting there has been no change in the company's internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ended december 31, 2021 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially effect, the company's internal control over financial reporting.

management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations - critical accounting estimates - impairment of long-lived assets - goodwill" in part ii, item 7 of this annual report, the carrying values of goodwill and certain assets from acquisitions may, as has been the case for certain acquired assets, be impaired resulting in non-cash charges to future earnings and, in the case of a divested business, the divestiture could reduce eastman's revenue and, potentially, margins and increase its costs and liabilities in the form of transition costs and retained liabilities from the operations divested, including environmental liabilities; that significant additional indebtedness may constrain the company's ability to access the credit and capital markets at attractive interest rates and favorable terms, which may negatively impact the company's liquidity or ability to pursue certain growth initiatives; that the company may not be able to achieve the cost, revenue, tax, or other "synergies" expected from any acquisition, or that there may be delays in achieving any such synergies; that management's time and effort may be dedicated to the integration of the new business or specific assets or product lines or separation of the divested business or specific assets or product lines resulting in a loss of focus on the successful operation of the company's legacy businesses; and that the company may be required to expend significant additional resources in order to integrate any acquired business or specific assets or product lines into eastman or separate any divested business or specific assets or product lines from eastman, or that the integration or separation efforts will not achieve the expected benefits.
risks related to regulatory changes and compliance legislative, regulatory, or voluntary actions, including associated with physical impacts of climate change, could increase the company's future health, safety, and environmental compliance costs.
eastman, its facilities, and its businesses are subject to complex health, safety, and environmental laws, regulations, and related voluntary actions, both in the u.s. and internationally, which require and will continue to require significant expenditures to remain in compliance with such laws, regulations, and voluntary actions. the company's accruals for such costs and associated liabilities are subject to changes in estimates on which the accruals are based. for example, any amount accrued for environmental matters reflects the company's assumptions about remediation requirements at the contaminated site, the nature of the remedy, the outcome of discussions with regulatory agencies and other potentially responsible parties at multi-party sites, and the number of and financial viability of other potentially responsible parties. changes in the estimates on which the accruals are based, unanticipated government enforcement action, or changes in health, safety, environmental, chemical control regulations and actions, and testing requirements could result in higher costs. specifically, while the company's sustainability and "circular economy" innovation initiatives are sources of competitive strength (see "business -
corporate overview - business strategy - circular economy and sustainability" in part i, item 1 of this annual report), future changes in legislation and regulation and related voluntary actions associated with physical impacts of climate change may increase the likelihood that the company's manufacturing facilities will in the future be impacted by carbon requirements, regulation of greenhouse gas emissions, and energy policy, and may result in capital expenditures, increases in costs for raw materials and energy, limitations on raw material and energy source and supply choices, and other direct and indirect compliance or other costs or consequences including decreased demand for products related to carbon-based energy sources or increased demand for goods that result in lower emissions than competing products and reputational risk resulting from operations with greenhouse gas emissions. see "business - eastman chemical company general information - compliance with environmental and other government regulations" in part i, item 1 of this annual report.

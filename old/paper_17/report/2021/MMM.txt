item 1a. risk factors provided below is a cautionary discussion of what we believe to be the most important risk factors applicable to the company. discussion of these factors is incorporated by reference into and considered an integral part of part i, item 2, "management's discussion and analysis of financial conditions and results of operations."
table of contents risks related to the global economy and public health crises
* the company's results are impacted by the effects of, and changes in, worldwide economic, political, regulatory, international trade and other external conditions.
the company operates in more than 70 countries and derives approximately 60 percent of its revenues from outside the united states, and, accordingly, the company's business is subject to global competition and geopolitical risks that are beyond its control, such as disruptions in financial markets, economic downturns, government actions impacting international trade agreements, imposing trade restrictions such as tariffs, and retaliatory counter measures, inflation, government deficit reduction and other austerity measures in specific countries or regions, or in the various industries in which the company operates; social, political or labor conditions in specific countries or regions; or adverse changes in the availability and cost of capital, interest rates, or exchange control, ability to expatriate earnings and other regulations in the jurisdictions in which the company operates. climate change, as well as related environmental and social regulations, may negatively impact the company or its customers and suppliers, in terms of availability and cost of natural resources, sources and supply of energy, product demand and manufacturing, and the health and well-being of individuals and communities in which we operate.
* the company is subject to risks related to public health crises such as the global pandemic associated with the coronavirus (covid-19).
3m, as a global company, is impacted by public health crises such as the global pandemic associated with covid-19. the outbreak has significantly increased economic and demand uncertainty. in addition, public and private sector policies and initiatives to reduce the transmission of covid-19, such as the imposition of travel restrictions, the adoption of remote working, and government-ordered vaccine mandates, have impacted and will continue to impact 3m's operations. in these challenging and dynamic circumstances, 3m continues to work to protect its employees and the public, maintain business continuity and sustain its operations, including ensuring the safety and protection of approximately 50,000 people who work in our plants and distribution centers across the world, many of whom support the manufacturing and delivery of products that are critical in response to the global pandemic. covid-19 has impacted 3m's supply chains relative to global demand for products like respirators, surgical masks and commercial cleaning solutions. within individual regions and countries around the world, 3m is working with governments, distributors and others to prioritize supplies to the most critical customer and public health needs. in addition, trade barriers, export restrictions and other similar measures imposed by national governments also negatively impact the supplies of personal protection equipment including those made by 3m going into the most needed areas. covid-19 has also affected the ability of suppliers and vendors to provide products and services to 3m. some of these covid-related factors have increased demand for certain 3m products, while others have decreased demand from certain end markets or could make it more difficult for 3m to serve customers. 3m has received reports of price gouging, counterfeiting and other illegal or fraudulent activities involving its n95 respirators, has taken legal action in several states and continues to work with state, federal and international law enforcement to protect the public and 3m against those who seek to exploit 3m's brand and reputation and defraud others. furthermore, covid-19 has impacted and may further impact the broader economies of affected countries, including negatively impacting economic growth, the proper functioning of financial and capital markets, foreign currency exchange rates, and interest rates. for example, covid-19 has led to disruption and volatility in the global capital markets, which increases the cost of capital and could adversely impact access to capital. with increasing vaccinations and as economies start to reopen in certain parts of the world, workplace safety, for the company and others, will increasingly become a focus of concern. as part of the return to work process at the company, the company could face additional privacy and data security risks in various countries related to the collection of data regarding employees and contractors with respect to covid-19 testing, temperature checks, contact tracing, and vaccination status. as the pandemic evolves, demand for personal protection products such as disposable respirators may decline from prior levels. due to the speed and scope with which the covid situation is developing and evolving and the uncertainty of its duration and the timing of recovery, 3m is not able at this time to predict the extent to which the covid-19 pandemic may have a material effect on its consolidated results of operations or financial condition.
* foreign currency exchange rates and fluctuations in those rates may affect the company's ability to realize projected growth rates in its sales and earnings.
because the company's financial statements are denominated in u.s. dollars and approximately 60 percent of the company's revenues are derived from outside the united states, the company's results of operations and its ability to realize projected growth rates in sales and earnings could be adversely affected if the u.s. dollar strengthens significantly against foreign currencies.
table of contents risks related to legal and regulatory proceedings
* the company faces liabilities related to certain fluorochemicals, which could adversely impact our results.
as previously reported, the company has been voluntarily cooperating with various local, state, federal (primarily the u.s. environmental protection agency (epa)), and international agencies in their review of the environmental and health effects of a broad group of perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances produced by the company, collectively known as "pfas." the pfas group contains several categories and classes of durable chemicals and materials with properties that include oil, water, temperature, chemical and fire resistance, as well as electrical insulating properties. the strength of the carbon-fluorine bond also means that these compounds do not easily degrade. these characteristics have made pfas critical to the manufacture of electronic devices such as cell phones, tablets and semi-conductors. they are also used to help prevent infections in products like surgical gowns and drapes. commercial aircraft and low-emissions vehicles also rely on pfas technology. pfas compounds are currently manufactured by various companies, including 3m, and are used in everyday products. as science and technology evolve and advance, and in response to evolving knowledge and the understanding that pfas compounds had the potential to build up over time, 3m announced in 2000 that we would voluntarily phase out production of perfluorooctanoate (pfoa) and perfluorooctane sulfonate (pfos) globally as a precautionary measure. we phased out of materials used to produce certain repellants and surfactant products, with most of these activities in the u.s. completed by the end of 2002. phased out products included aqueous film forming foam (afff) and coatings for food packaging, for example. 3m currently is defending lawsuits concerning various pfas-related products and chemistries, and is subject to unasserted and asserted claims and governmental regulatory proceedings and inquiries related to the production and use of pfas in a variety of jurisdictions, as discussed in note 16, "commitments and contingencies," within the notes to consolidated financial statements. an adverse outcome in any one or more of these matters could be material to our financial results. for example, we recorded a pre-tax charge of $897 million, inclusive of legal fees and other related obligations, in the first quarter of 2018 with respect to the settlement of a matter brought by the state of minnesota involving the presence of pfas in the groundwater, surface water, fish or other aquatic life, and sediments in the state. governmental inquiries or lawsuits involving pfas could lead to our incurring liability for damages or other costs, civil or criminal proceedings, the imposition of fines and penalties, or other remedies, as well as restrictions on or added costs for our business operations going forward, including in the form of restrictions on discharges at our manufacturing facilities, suspension of their operations, switching costs in seeking alternative sources of supply, potential customer damage claims due to supply disruptions or otherwise.
* the company's future results may be affected by various asserted and unasserted legal and regulatory proceedings and legal compliance risks, including those involving product liability, antitrust, intellectual property, environmental, tax, the u.s. foreign corrupt practices act and other anti-bribery laws, u.s. trade sanctions compliance, regulations of the u.s. food and drug administration (fda) and similar foreign agencies, u.s. federal healthcare program-related laws and regulations including the false claims act, anti-kickback laws, the sunshine act, or other matters. legal compliance risks also include third-party risks where the company's suppliers, vendors or channel partners have business practices that are inconsistent with 3m's supplier responsibility code, 3m performance requirements or with legal requirements.
the outcome of these legal proceedings may differ from the company's expectations because the outcomes of litigation, including regulatory matters, are often difficult to reliably predict. although the company maintains general liability insurance, the amount of liability that may result from certain of these risks may not always be covered by, or could exceed, the applicable insurance coverage. various factors or developments can lead the company to change current estimates of liabilities and related insurance receivables where applicable, or make such estimates for matters previously not susceptible of reasonable estimates, such as a significant judicial ruling or judgment, a significant settlement, significant regulatory developments or changes in applicable law. a future adverse ruling, settlement or unfavorable development could result in future charges that could have a material adverse effect on the company's results of operations or cash flows in any particular period. in addition, negative publicity related to product liability, environmental, health and safety or other matters referenced above involving the company may negatively impact the company's reputation. for a more detailed discussion of the legal proceedings involving the company and the associated accounting estimates, see the discussion in note 16, "commitments and contingencies," within the notes to consolidated financial statements.
risks related to our products and customer preferences
* the company's results are affected by competitive conditions and customer preferences.
demand for the company's products, which impacts revenue and profit margins, is affected by (i) the development and timing of the introduction of competitive products; (ii) the company's response to downward pricing to stay competitive; (iii) changes in customer order patterns, such as changes in the levels of inventory maintained by customers and the timing of customer purchases which may be affected by announced price changes, changes in the company's incentive programs, or the customer's table of contents ability to achieve incentive goals; (iv) changes in customers' preferences for our products, including the success of products offered by our competitors, and changes in customer designs for their products that can affect the demand for some of the company's products; and (v) changes in the business environment related to disruptive technologies, such as artificial intelligence, block-chain, expanded analytics and other enhanced learnings from increasing volume of available data.
* the company's growth objectives are largely dependent on the timing and market acceptance of its new product offerings, including its ability to continually renew its pipeline of new products and to bring those products to market.
this ability is subject to difficulties or delays in product development, such as the inability to identify viable new products, obtain adequate intellectual property protection, or gain market acceptance of new products. there are no guarantees that new products will prove to be commercially successful.
* the company's future results are subject to vulnerability with respect to materials and fluctuations in the costs and availability of purchased components, compounds, raw materials, energy, and labor due to shortages, increased demand and wages, logistics, supply chain interruptions, manufacturing site disruptions, natural disasters and other disruptive factors.
the company depends on various components, compounds, raw materials, and energy (including oil and natural gas and their derivatives) supplied by others for the manufacturing of its products. supplier relationships have been and could be interrupted in the future due to supplier material shortage, climate impacts, natural and other disasters and other disruptive events, or be terminated. any sustained interruption in the company's receipt of adequate supplies, supply chain disruptions impacting the distribution of products, or disruption to key manufacturing sites' operations due to natural and other disasters or events, such as government actions relating to discharge or emission permits or other legal or regulatory requirements, could have a material adverse effect on the company. in addition, while the company has a process to minimize volatility in component and material pricing, no assurance can be given that the company will be able to successfully manage price fluctuations or that future price fluctuations or shortages will not have a material adverse effect on the company.
risks related to our business
* the company employs information technology systems to support its business, including ongoing phased implementation of an enterprise resource planning (erp) system as part of business transformation on a worldwide basis over the next several years. security breaches and other disruptions to the company's information technology infrastructure could interfere with the company's operations, compromise information belonging to the company or its customers, suppliers, and employees, exposing the company to liability which could adversely impact the company's business and reputation.
in the ordinary course of business, the company relies on centralized and local information technology networks and systems, some of which are provided, hosted or managed by vendors and other third parties, to process, transmit and store electronic information, and to manage or support a variety of businesses. additionally, the company collects and stores certain data, including proprietary business information, and has access to confidential or personal information in certain of our businesses that is subject to privacy and cybersecurity laws, regulations and customer-imposed controls. despite our cybersecurity and business continuity measures (including employee and third-party training, monitoring of networks and systems, patching, maintenance, and backup of systems and data), the company's information technology networks and infrastructure are still potentially vulnerable to the security risks of our vendors and third-party service providers, security breaches, damage, disruptions or shutdowns due to attacks by threat actors including nation-state actors, computer viruses, hardware, software, and system vulnerabilities, ransomware, service or cloud provider disruptions or security breaches, employee error or malfeasance, power outages, telecommunication or utility failures, systems failures, natural disasters or other catastrophic events. the company's adoption of remote working, initially driven by the pandemic, may also introduce additional threats or disruptions to our information technology networks and infrastructure. despite our cybersecurity measures, it is possible for security vulnerabilities to remain undetected for an extended time period, up to and including several years. while we have experienced, and expect to continue to experience, threats and disruptions to the company's information technology infrastructure, none of them to date has had a material impact to the company. any such threats or disruptions could result in legal claims or proceedings, disclosures to regulators, liability or penalties under privacy laws, interference with the company's operations, and damage to the company's reputation, which could adversely affect the company's business. although the company maintains insurance coverage for various cybersecurity and business continuity risks, there can be no guarantee that all costs or losses incurred will be fully insured.

* acquisitions, strategic alliances, divestitures, and other unusual events resulting from portfolio management actions and other evolving business strategies, and possible organizational restructuring could affect future results.
the company monitors its business portfolio and organizational structure and has made and may continue to make acquisitions, strategic alliances, divestitures and changes to its organizational structure. with respect to acquisitions, including, for example, the acquisition of acelity, inc. and its kci subsidiaries (a leading global medical technology company), future results will be affected by the company's ability to integrate acquired businesses quickly and obtain the anticipated synergies.
* the company's future results may be affected by its operational execution, including scenarios where the company generates fewer productivity improvements than estimated.
the company's financial results depend on the successful execution of its business operating plans. the company utilizes various tools, such as lean six sigma, and engages in ongoing global business transformation. business transformation is defined as changes in processes and internal/external service delivery across 3m to move to more efficient business models to improve operational efficiency and productivity, while allowing 3m to serve customers with greater speed and efficiency. this is enabled by the ongoing multi-year phased implementation of an erp system. there can be no assurance that all of the projected productivity improvements will be realized. in addition, the ability to adapt to business model and other changes and agility to respond to customer needs and service expectations are important, which, if not done successfully, could negatively impact the company's ability to win new business and enhance revenue and 3m's brand. operational challenges, including those related to customer service, pace of change and productivity improvements, could have a material adverse effect on the company's business, financial conditions and results of operations.
risks related to financial and capital markets and tax matters
* the company's defined benefit pension and postretirement plans are subject to financial market risks that could adversely impact our results.
the performance of financial markets and discount rates impact the company's funding obligations under its defined benefit plans. significant changes in market interest rates, decreases in the fair value of plan assets and investment losses on plan assets, and legislative or regulatory changes relating to defined benefit plan funding may increase the company's funding obligations and adversely impact its results of operations and cash flows.
* change in the company's credit ratings could increase cost of funding.
the company's credit ratings are important to 3m's cost of capital. the major rating agencies routinely evaluate the company's credit profile and assign debt ratings to 3m. this evaluation is based on a number of factors, which include financial strength, business and financial risk, as well as transparency with rating agencies and timeliness of financial reporting. 3m currently has an a1 credit rating with a negative outlook from moody's investors service and an a+ credit rating with a negative outlook from standard & poor's. the company's credit ratings have served to lower 3m's borrowing costs and facilitate access to a variety of lenders. the addition of further leverage to the company's capital structure could impact 3m's credit ratings in the future. failure to maintain strong investment grade ratings would adversely affect the company's cost of funding and could adversely affect liquidity and access to capital markets.
* changes in tax rates, laws or regulations could adversely impact our financial results.
the company's business is subject to tax-related external conditions, such as tax rates, tax laws and regulations, changing political environments in the u.s. and foreign jurisdictions that impact tax examination, assessment and enforcement approaches. in addition, changes in tax laws including further regulatory developments arising from u.s. tax reform legislation and/or regulations around the world could result in a tax expense or benefit recorded to the company's consolidated statement of earnings. in connection with the base erosion and profit shifting (beps) integrated framework provided by organization for economic cooperation and development (oecd), determination of multi-jurisdictional taxation rights and the rate of tax applicable to certain types of income may be subject to potential change. due to uncertainty of the regulation changes and other tax-related factors stated above, it is currently not possible to assess the ultimate impact of these actions on our financial statements.
item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations.
management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations (md&a) is designed to provide a reader of 3m's financial statements with a narrative from the perspective of management. 3m's md&a is presented in eight sections:
•overview
•results of operations
•performance by business segment
•performance by geographic area
•critical accounting estimates
•new accounting pronouncements
•financial condition and liquidity
•financial instruments forward-looking statements in item 7 may involve risks and uncertainties that could cause results to differ materially from those projected (refer to the section entitled "cautionary note concerning factors that may affect future results" in item 1 and the risk factors provided in item 1a for discussion of these risks and uncertainties).
additional information about results of operations and financial condition for 2020 and 2019 can be found in "management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations" sections in the company's annual report on form 10-k for the year ended december 31, 2020.
overview
3m is a diversified global manufacturer, technology innovator and marketer of a wide variety of products and services. effective in the first quarter of 2021, 3m made the following changes. information provided herein reflects the impact of these changes for all periods presented.
•change in accounting principle for net periodic pension and postretirement plan cost. see detailed discussion in note 1.
•change in measure of segment operating performance used by 3m's chief operating decision maker-impacting 3m's disclosed measure of segment profit/loss (business segment operating income). see additional information in note 19.
•change in alignment of certain products within 3m's consumer business segment-creating the consumer health and safety division. see additional information in note 19.
3m manages its operations in four operating business segments: safety and industrial; transportation and electronics; health care; and consumer. from a geographic perspective, any references to emea refer to europe, middle east and africa on a combined basis. references are made to organic sales (which include both organic volume impacts and selling price impacts) that is defined as the change in net sales, absent the separate impacts on sales from foreign currency translation and acquisitions, net of divestitures. acquisition and divestiture sales change impacts, if any, are measured separately for the first twelve months post-transaction. 3m believes this information is useful to investors and management in understanding ongoing operations and in analysis of ongoing operating trends.
consideration of covid-19:
3m is impacted by the global pandemic and related effects associated with the coronavirus (covid-19). risk factors with respect to covid-19 can be found in item 1a "risk factors" in this document. given the diversity of 3m's businesses, some of the factors relative to covid-19 have increased the demand for 3m products, while others have decreased demand or made it more difficult for 3m to serve customers.
overall, 3m experienced broad-based organic growth across business segments and all geographies in 2021 despite global supply challenges. 3m's total sales increased 9.9% for the full year 2021 when compared to 2020. organic sales increased 8.8% for the full year 2021 when compared to 2020. in 2021, covid-related respirator sales negatively impacted year-on-year organic sales growth by approximately 0.2% as they grew at a slower rate than the rest of the company. given the diversity of 3m's businesses, the impact of covid-19 varied across the company. in 2020, 3m experienced strong sales in personal safety, as well as in other areas such as home improvement, general cleaning, semiconductor, data center, and biopharma filtration while businesses aligned to general industrial applications with strength in abrasives and industrial adhesives and tapes. at the same time, weakness in several end markets, while improving, contributed in part to sales declines in a number of 3m's businesses such as oral care, automotive and aerospace, advanced materials, commercial solutions, stationery and office, table of contents automotive aftermarket. refer to the performance by business segment section later in md&a for additional discussion of sales by segment.
3m's operating income margins decreased 1.5 percentage points year-on-year for the year ending december 31, 2021. factoring out the impact on operating income of special items as described in the certain amounts adjusted for special items -(non-gaap measures) section below, operating income margins decreased 0.5 percentage points to 20.8 percent for the year ending december 31, 2021 when compared to 2020. various covid-19 implications contributed in part to these results.
overall, the impact of the covid-19 pandemic on 3m's consolidated results of operations was primarily driven by factors related to changes in demand for products and disruption in global supply chains. while it is not feasible to identify or quantify all the other direct and indirect implications on 3m's results of operations, below are factors that 3m believes have also affected its 2021 results when compared to 2020:
factors contributing to charges or other impacts:
•increased raw materials and logistics costs from ongoing covid-19 related global supply chain challenges further magnified by extreme weather events, such as february 2021 winter storm uri in the united states.
•cost management in discretionary spending in areas such as travel, professional services, and advertising/merchandising resulting in lower spending in 2020.
•government-sponsored covid-response stimulus and relief initiatives in 2020, including certain employee retention benefits under the coronavirus aid, relief and economic security (cares) act in the united states.
•lower incentive compensation and self-insured medical visit/insurance expense in 2020.
factors providing benefits or other impacts:
•continued productivity efforts, including year-on-year savings from restructuring actions taken in 2020 and 2021.
•period expenses of unabsorbed manufacturing costs and increased expected credit losses on customer receivables in 2020.
•restructuring actions addressing structural enterprise costs and operations in certain end markets as a result of the covid-19 pandemic and related economic impact resulting in a 2020 charge of $58 million.
•committed financial support in 2020 to various covid-relief and medical research initiatives.
•charge of $22 million in 2020 related to equity securities as discussed in the "assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis" section of note 15 that use the measurement alternative described therein in addition to an immaterial pre-tax charge related to impairment of certain indefinite lived tradenames.
refer to the financial condition and liquidity section below for more information on the company's liquidity position.
due to the speed with which the covid-19 situation is developing and evolving and the uncertainty of its duration and the timing of recovery, 3m is not able at this time to predict the extent to which the covid-19 pandemic may have a material effect on its consolidated results of operations or financial condition.

a discussion related to the components of year-on-year changes in operating income margin and earnings per diluted share follows:
organic growth/productivity and other:
•in 2021, organic volume growth and ongoing cost management offset by manufacturing headwinds from global supply chain challenges, increased compensation/benefit costs, and increased litigation-related costs increased operating income margins and earnings per diluted share year-on-year. the following also impacted results or provide additional information:
•2021 benefit of $91 million pre-tax ($0.12 per share after tax) from a favorable brazilian supreme court decision that concluded on the impact of state value-added tax when determining brazil's federal sales-based social tax-essentially lowering the social tax that 3m should have paid in prior periods.
•certain changes in legal reserve charges year-over-year. 3m regularly reviews and updates its associated liabilities and is involved in various trials and defense preparation as discussed in note 16.
•3m continued prioritization of investments in growth and sustainability.
•2021 benefit from restructuring actions taken in 2020 and positive/negative impact of year-over-year change in non-divestiture-related restructuring charges, net of adjustments, for respective periods. note 5 provides additional information relative to restructuring actions.
•lower year-on-year net gains related to certain property sales.
•covid-impacts recognized on certain assets in 2020.
•in 2020, lower organic volume growth as a result of significant covid-19 related impacts, in addition to covid-related net factors described in the preceding overview-consideration of covid-19 section, decreased both earnings per diluted share and operating income margin year-on-year. 3m also experienced year-over-year increased costs as a result of the regular review of its respirator mask liabilities and certain follow-on accelerated depreciation table of contents following some of the restructuring in 2019 and 2020. partially offsetting these increased costs were year-on-year net gains related to certain property sales (in 2020 within safety and industrial and in 2019 within corporate and unallocated), lower non divestiture-related restructuring charges year-on-year, in addition to benefits recognized in 2020 related to the restructuring and other actions taken in 2019 (and the adjustments thereto in 2020) along with continued cost management and productivity efforts.
•on a combined basis, higher defined benefit pension and postretirement service cost increased expense year-on-year for both 2021 and 2020.
selling price and raw material impact:
•in 2021, 3m experienced higher raw material, logistics, and outsourced manufacturing costs from strong end-market demand and ongoing covid-19 and related global supply chain challenges that were further magnified by extreme weather events, such as february 2021 winter storm uri in the u.s. these factors were partially offset by higher selling prices in 2021.
•in 2020, higher selling prices in addition to lower raw material cost impacts benefited operating income margins year-on-year acquisitions/divestitures:
•divestiture impacts in 2021 and 2020 are primarily comprised of the lost income from the divestiture of the company's drug delivery business (sale completed in may 2020).
•acquisition impacts, which are measured for the first twelve months post-transaction, relate to the acquisitions of m*modal (first quarter 2019), and acelity (fourth quarter 2019). the net impacts related to these acquisitions included income from operations, more than offset by transaction and integration costs. financing costs related to these acquisitions is also included.
foreign exchange impacts:
•foreign currency impacts (net of hedging) increased operating income by approximately $103 million and decreased operating income by approximately $62 million (or an increase in pre-tax earnings of approximately $119 million and a decrease in pre-tax earnings of approximately $57 million) year-on-year for 2021 and 2020, respectively. these estimates include: (a) the effects of year-on-year changes in exchange rates on translating current period functional currency profits into u.s. dollars and on current period non-functional currency denominated purchases or transfers of goods between 3m operations, and (b) year-on-year changes in transaction gains and losses, including derivative instruments designed to reduce foreign currency exchange rate risks. prior to 2021, for (a) 3m used prior year functional currency profits and non-functional currency purchase/transfer information as the base in determining these amounts. comparative prior period amounts have been updated to reflect this updated methodology.
other expense (income), net:
•higher income related to non-service cost components of pension and postretirement expense decreased expense year-on-year for both 2021 and 2020.
•interest expense (net of interest income) decreased in 2021 compared to the same periods year-on-year. 2021 interest expense also included an early debt extinguishment pre-tax charge in the first quarter of 2021.
•interest expense (net of interest income) increased in 2020, as a result of higher u.s. average debt balances and lower year-on-year interest income driven by lower average interest rates on cash balances. 2020 interest expense also included an early debt extinguishment charge in conjunction with the repayment of notes in december 2020.
income tax rate:
•certain items above reflect specific income tax rates associated therewith. overall, the effective tax rates for 2021, 2020, and 2019 were 17.8 percent, 19.7 percent, and 19.7 percent, respectively. these reflect a decrease of 1.9 percentage points from 2020 to 2021 and a flat comparison from 2019 to 2020.
•on an adjusted basis (as discussed below), the effective tax rates for 2021, 2020, and 2019 were 17.8 percent, 20.3 percent, and 20.2 percent, respectively. these reflect a decrease of 2.5 percentage points from 2020 to 2021 and an increase of 0.1 percentage points from 2019 to 2020.
•the primary factors that decreased the company's effective tax rate in 2021 were geographical income mix and favorable adjustments in 2021 related to impacts of u.s. international tax provisions. refer to note 10 for additional details.
shares of common stock outstanding:
•higher shares outstanding decreased earnings per share per diluted share for 2021, while lower shares outstanding increased earnings per share diluted share for 2020.
table of contents certain amounts adjusted for special items - (non-gaap measures):
in addition to reporting financial results in accordance with u.s. gaap, the company also provides non-gaap measures that adjust for the impacts of special items. for the periods presented, special items include the items described below. operating income (measure of segment operating performance), income before taxes, net income, earnings per share, and the effective tax rate are all measures for which 3m provides the reported gaap measure and a measure adjusted for special items. the adjusted measures are not in accordance with, nor are they a substitute for, gaap measures. the company considers these non-gaap measures in evaluating and managing the company's operations. the company believes that discussion of results adjusted for these items is meaningful to investors as it provides a useful analysis of ongoing underlying operating trends. the determination of these items may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies. special items include:
significant litigation-related charges/benefits:
•in 2020, 3m recorded a net pre-tax charge of $17 million ($13 million after tax) related to pfas (certain perfluorinated compounds) matters. the charge was more than offset by a reduction in tax expense of $52 million related to resolution of tax treatment with authorities regarding the previously disclosed 2018 agreement reached with the state of minnesota that resolved the natural resources damages lawsuit. these items, in aggregate, resulted in a $39 million after tax benefit.
•in 2019, the company recorded significant litigation-related charges of $762 million ($590 million after tax) related to pfas matters ($449 million pre-tax) and coal mine dust respirator mask lawsuits ($313 million pre-tax). these charges are further discussed in note 16.
gain/loss on sale of businesses:
•in 2020, 3m recorded a pre-tax gain of $2 million ($1 million loss after tax) related to the sale of its advanced ballistic-protection business and recognition of certain contingent consideration and a pre-tax gain of $387 million ($304 million after tax) related to the sale of its drug delivery business. refer to note 3 for further details.
•in the first quarter of 2019, 3m recorded a gain related to the sale of certain oral care technology comprising a business in addition to reflecting an earnout on a previous divestiture, which together resulted in a net gain of $8 million ($7 million after tax). in the second quarter of 2019, as a result of a "held for sale" tax benefit related to the legal entities associated with the pending divestiture of the company's gas and flame detection business, 3m recorded an after-tax gain of $43 million. in the third quarter of 2019, 3m recorded a gain related to the divestiture of the company's gas and flame detection business and an immaterial impact as a result of measuring a disposal group at the lower of its carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell, which in aggregate resulted in a pre-tax gain of $106 million ($79 million after tax).
divestiture-related restructuring actions:
•in 2020, following the divestiture of substantially all of the drug delivery business (see note 3) management approved and committed to undertake certain restructuring actions addressing corporate functional costs and manufacturing footprint across 3m in relation to the magnitude of amounts previously allocated/burdened to the divested business. as a result, 3m recorded a pre-tax charge of $55 million ($46 million after tax) and made a subsequent immaterial adjustment thereto. refer to note 5 for further details.
loss on deconsolidation of venezuelan subsidiary:
•in 2019, 3m recorded a pre-tax charge of $162 million related to the deconsolidation of the company's venezuelan subsidiary as further discussed in note 1.

managing currency risks:
the weaker u.s. dollar had a positive impact on sales in full year 2021 compared to the same period last year. net of the company's hedging strategy, foreign currency positively impacted earnings for full year 2021 compared to the same period last year. 3m utilizes a number of tools to manage currency risk related to earnings including natural hedges such as pricing, productivity, hard currency, hard currency-indexed billings, and localizing source of supply. 3m also uses financial hedges to mitigate currency risk. in the case of more liquid currencies, 3m hedges a portion of its aggregate exposure, using a 12, 24 or 36 month horizon, depending on the currency in question. for less liquid currencies, financial hedging is frequently more expensive with more limitations on tenor. thus, this risk is largely managed via local operational actions using natural hedging tools as discussed above. in either case, 3m's hedging approach is designed to mitigate a portion of foreign currency risk and reduce volatility, ultimately allowing time for 3m's businesses to respond to changes in the marketplace.
financial condition:
refer to the section entitled "financial condition and liquidity" later in md&a for a discussion of items impacting cash flows.
in november 2018, 3m's board of directors replaced the company's february 2016 repurchase program with a new repurchase program. this new program authorizes the repurchase of up to $10 billion of 3m's outstanding common stock, with no pre-established end date. in 2021, the company purchased $2.2 billion of its own stock and $0.4 billion in 2020. as of december 31, 2021, approximately $5.6 billion remained available under the authorization. in february 2022, 3m's board of directors declared a first-quarter 2022 dividend of $1.49 per share, an increase of 1 percent. this marked the 64th consecutive year of dividend increases for 3m.
raw materials:
refer to the section entitled "raw materials" in item 1 for discussion of 3m's sources and availability of raw materials in 2021.
pension and postretirement defined benefit/contribution plans:
on a worldwide basis, 3m's pension and postretirement plans were 93 percent funded at year-end 2021. the primary u.s. qualified pension plan, which is approximately 67 percent of the worldwide pension obligation, was 97 percent funded and the international pension plans were 101 percent funded. the u.s. non-qualified pension plan is not funded due to tax considerations and other factors. asset returns in 2021 for the primary u.s. qualified pension plan were 6.7%, as 3m strategically invests in both growth assets and fixed income matching assets to manage its funded status. for the primary u.s. qualified pension plan, the expected long-term rate of return on an annualized basis for 2022 is 6.00%. the primary u.s. qualified pension plan year-end 2021 discount rate was 2.89%, up 0.34 percentage points from the year-end 2020 discount rate of 2.55%. the increase in u.s. discount rates resulted in an decreased valuation of the projected benefit obligation (pbo). the primary u.s. qualified pension plan's funded status increased 5 percentage point in 2021 due to the lower pbo resulting from the discount rate increase. additional detail and discussion of international plan asset returns and discount rates is provided in note 13 (pension and postretirement benefit plans).
3m expects to contribute approximately $100 million to $200 million of cash to its global defined benefit pension and postretirement plans in 2022. the company does not have a required minimum cash pension contribution obligation for its u.s. plans in 2022. 3m expects global defined benefit pension and postretirement expense in 2022 to decrease by approximately $20 million pre-tax when compared to 2021. refer to "critical accounting estimates" within md&a and note 13 (pension and postretirement benefit plans) for additional information concerning 3m's pension and post-retirement plans.

pension and postretirement service cost expense is recorded in cost of sales, sg&a, and r&d. refer to note 13 (pension and postretirement plans) for the service cost components of net periodic benefit costs.
the company is continuing the ongoing deployment of an enterprise resource planning (erp) system on a worldwide basis, with these investments impacting cost of sales, sg&a, and r&d.
cost of sales:
cost of sales includes manufacturing, engineering and freight costs.
cost of sales, measured as a percent of sales, increased in 2021 when compared to 2020 due to higher raw material, logistics and outsourced manufacturing costs; manufacturing productivity impacts from global supply chain challenges; increased compensation and benefit costs; increased adjustments to other environmental liabilities; and increased investments in growth, productivity and sustainability. cost of sales was also impacted by year-over-year changes in restructuring charges, net of restructuring benefits. year-over-year cost increases were partially offset by lower covid-related net impacts taken in 2021 versus last year, including period expenses of unabsorbed manufacturing costs taken in 2020.
selling, general and administrative expenses:
sg&a, measured as a percent of sales, decreased in 2021 when compared to 2020. sg&a was impacted by increased litigation-related costs, compensation and benefit costs, and spending on key growth initiatives. sg&a was also impacted by year-over-year changes in restructuring charges, net of restructuring benefits. cost increases were partially offset by the impact of the favorable decision of the brazilian supreme court in the second quarter of 2021 regarding the calculation of past social taxes and ongoing general 3m cost management. prior year also included a number of covid-related net impacts as described in the overview- consideration of covid-19 section above.
research, development and related expenses:
r&d, measured as a percent of sales, decreased in 2021 when compared to 2020. 3m continued to invest in its key initiatives, including r&d aimed at disruptive innovation programs with the potential to create entirely new markets and disrupt existing markets.
gain on sale of businesses:
during 2020, the company recorded a pre-tax gain of $2 million ($1 million loss after tax) related to the sale of its advanced ballistic-protection business and recognition of certain contingent consideration. additionally, in 2020, the company recorded a pre-tax gain of $387 million ($304 after tax) related to the sale of substantially all of its drug delivery business.
other expense (income), net:
see note 6 for a detailed breakout of this line item.
interest expense (net of interest income) decreased during 2021 and increased during 2020. the decrease in 2021 was due to lower u.s. average debt balances and the impact of interest rate swaps placed during the year. 2021 interest expense also included an early debt extinguishment pre-tax charge in the first quarter of 2021. the increase in 2020 was due to higher u.s. average debt balances and lower year-on-year interest income driven by lower average interest rates on cash balances. 2020 interest expense also included an early debt extinguishment charge in conjunction with the repayment of notes in december 2020.
table of contents the non-service pension and postretirement net benefit increased $163 million and $135 million in 2021 and 2020, respectively. the higher year-on-year benefit in 2021 was primarily due to decreased expense from lower discount rates applicable to 2021. refer to note 13 for additional details.
provision for income taxes:

effective tax rate                          17.8   %           19.7   %
factors that impacted the tax rates between years are further discussed in the overview section above and in note 10.
the tax rate can vary from quarter to quarter due to discrete items, such as the settlement of income tax audits, changes in tax laws, and employee share-based payment accounting; as well as recurring factors, such as the geographic mix of income before taxes.
refer to note 10 for further discussion of income taxes.

item 1a. risk factors the following are important factors that could cause our actual operating results to differ materially from those indicated or suggested by forward-looking statements made in this annual report on form 10-k or presented elsewhere by management from time to time.
financial and operational risks we may face slowing revenue growth which could negatively impact our profitability and stock price.
the revenue growth rate we have enjoyed in recent years may not continue in future periods and could decline, which could negatively impact our profitability and stock price. our revenue depends on the amount of traffic we deliver, continued growth in demand for our performance and security solutions and our ability to maintain the prices we charge for them.
we experienced a significant increase in revenue from our media solutions in 2020 due in large part to greater consumption of online media and games during the onset of the covid-19 pandemic and associated stay-at-home orders across the globe. in 2021, our revenue growth from media solutions declined as stay-at-home orders were lifted. numerous other factors impact our revenue and traffic growth including:
•the pace of introduction of over-the-top video delivery initiatives by our customers;
•the popularity of our customers' streaming offerings as compared to those offered by companies that do not use our solutions;
•variation in the popularity of online gaming;
•media and other customers utilizing their own data centers and implementing delivery approaches that limit or eliminate reliance on third-party providers like us;
•the adoption of permanent hybrid or work from home policies by employees; and
•general macro-economic and geopolitical conditions and industry pressures.
we have experienced significant growth in revenue from our security solutions in recent years. to maintain or accelerate growth in security revenue, we must increase our industry recognition as a security solutions provider and develop or acquire new solutions in a rapidly-changing environment where security threats are constantly evolving. we must also ensure that our solutions operate effectively and are competitive with products offered by others.
we are dependent upon the overall economic health of our current and prospective customers and the continued growth and evolution of information technology. we have experienced revenue declines in recent quarters from our web performance solutions and expect this trend to continue because of increasing pricing pressure due to competition and business conditions affecting many of our customers. in addition, in 2021, some of our customers continued to experience disruptions to their businesses following the emergence of covid-19 variants. these disruptions or changes in international, national, regional and local economic conditions, such as inflation, increasing energy prices, recessionary economic cycles, protracted economic slowdowns or any deterioration in the economy could adversely affect our business. any of these circumstances would negatively impact our revenues.
our ability to increase our overall revenue also depends on many other factors including how well we can:
•retain existing customers, including by maintaining the levels of existing services they buy and by delivering consistent and quality performance levels;
•upsell new solutions to existing customers;
•expand our customer base;
•develop and sell innovative and appealing new solutions;
•successfully integrate our recent acquisitions into our business;
•address potential commoditization of our delivery-based solutions, which can lead to lower prices and loss of customers to competitors;
•counteract multi-vendor policies that could cause customers to reduce their reliance on us;
•handle other competitive threats to our business;
•adapt to changes in our customer contracting models from a committed revenue structure to a "pay-as-you-go" approach, which would make it easier for customers to stop doing business with us, or from traditional overage billing models to ones that do not incorporate surcharges for usage above committed levels; and
•manage the impact of changes in general economic conditions, public health issues, natural disasters and public unrest on our ability to sell, market and provide our solutions.
if we are unable to increase revenues, our profitability and stock price could suffer.
failure to control expenses could reduce our profitability, which would negatively impact our stock price.
maintaining or improving our profitability depends both on our ability to increase our revenue, even with the potential challenges discussed above, and limit our expenses. we base our decisions about expense levels and investments on estimates of our future revenue and future anticipated rates of growth; however, many of our expenses are fixed costs for a certain amount of time so it may not be possible to reduce costs in a timely manner or without incurring fees to exit certain obligations early. if we are unable to increase revenue through traffic growth or otherwise and limit expenses, our results of operations will suffer. if we are required to significantly reduce expenses to maintain or improve profitability, such actions may negatively affect our ability to invest in our business for innovation, systems improvements and other initiatives.
if we do not develop or acquire new solutions that are attractive to enterprises, our revenue and operating results could be adversely affected.
innovation is important to our future success. in particular, as security solutions have become, and are expected to continue to be, an increasingly important part of our business, we must be particularly adept at developing new security services that meet the constantly-changing threat landscape. the process of developing new solutions is complex, lengthy and uncertain; we must commit significant resources to developing new services or features without knowing whether our investments will result in solutions the market will accept, and we may choose to invest in business areas for which a viable market for our products does not ultimately develop. we have also experienced, and may in the future experience, delays in developing and releasing new products and product enhancements. this could cause our expenses to grow more rapidly than our revenue.
trying to innovate through acquisition can be costly and with uncertain prospects for success; we may find that attractive acquisition targets are too expensive for us to pursue which could cause us to pursue more time-consuming internal development.
failure to develop, on a cost-effective basis, innovative new or enhanced solutions that are attractive to customers and profitable to us could have a material detrimental effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.
if we are unable to compete effectively and adapt to changing market conditions, our business will be adversely affected.
we compete in markets that are intensely competitive and rapidly changing. our current and potential competitors vary by size, product offerings and geographic region, and range from start-ups that offer solutions competing with a discrete part of our business to large technology or telecommunications companies that offer, or may be planning to introduce, products and services that are broadly competitive with what we do. the primary competitive factors in our market are differentiation of technology, global presence, quality of solutions, customer service, technical expertise, security, ease-of-use, breadth of services offered, price and financial strength.
many of our current and potential competitors have substantially greater financial, technical and marketing resources, larger customer bases, broader product portfolios, longer operating histories, greater brand recognition and more established relationships in the industry than we do. as a result, some of these competitors may be able to:
•develop superior products or services;
•leverage better name recognition, particularly in the security market;
•enter new markets more easily;
•gain greater market acceptance for their products and services;
•expand their offerings more efficiently and more rapidly;
•bundle their products that are competitive with ours with other solutions they offer in a way that makes our offerings less appealing to current and potential customers;
•more quickly adapt to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements;
•take advantage of acquisition, investment and other opportunities more readily;
•offer lower prices than ours, including at levels that may not be profitable for us to match;
•spend more money on the promotion, marketing and sales of their products and services; and
•spend more money on research and development, including offering higher salaries to talented professionals which may impact our ability to hire or retain engineering and other personnel.
smaller and more nimble competitors may be able to:
•attract customers by offering less sophisticated versions of products and services than we provide at lower prices than those we charge;
•develop new business models that are disruptive to us;
•in some cases, use funds from public securities offerings or private financings to strengthen their business to enable them to better compete with us; and
•respond more quickly than we can to new or emerging technologies, changes in customer requirements and market and industry developments, resulting in superior offerings.
ultimately, any type of increased competition could result in price and revenue reductions, loss of customers and loss of market share, each of which could materially impact our business, profitability, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
we and other companies that compete in this industry and these markets experience continually shifting business relationships, reputations, commercial focuses and business priorities, all of which occur in reaction to industry and market forces and the emergence of new opportunities. these shifts have led or could lead to our customers or partners becoming our competitors; network suppliers no longer seeking to work with us; and large technology companies that previously did not appear to show interest in the markets we seek to address entering into those markets as our competitors. with this constantly changing environment, we may face operational difficulties in adjusting to the changes or our core strategies could become obsolete. any of these developments could harm our business.
defects or disruptions in our products and it systems could require us to increase spending on upgrading systems, diminish demand for our solutions or subject us to substantial liability.
our solutions are highly complex and are designed to be deployed in and across numerous large and complex networks that we do not control. from time to time, we have needed to correct errors and defects in the proprietary and open-source software that underlies our platform that have given rise to service incidents, outages and disruptions or otherwise impacted our operations. for example, during the summer of 2021, we experienced service incidents that interrupted the availability of some of our customers' websites. we could face the loss of customers as a result of recent and any future incidents as they seek alternative or supplemental providers. we have also periodically experienced customer dissatisfaction with the quality of some of our media delivery and other services, which has led to a loss of business and could lead to a loss of customers in the future. furthermore, most of our customer agreements contain service level commitments. if we fail to meet these contractual commitments, we could be obligated to provide credits for future service, or face contract termination with refunds of prepaid amounts, which could harm our business.
while we have robust quality control processes in place, there may be additional errors and defects in our software and open-source software that we leverage that may adversely affect our operations. we may not have in place adequate quality assurance procedures to ensure that we detect errors in our software and open-source software we use in a timely manner, and we may have insufficient resources to efficiently address multiple service incidents happening simultaneously or in rapid succession. we continue to invest in improving our processes and systems. if we are unable to efficiently and cost-effectively fix errors or other problems that we identify and improve the quality of our solutions or systems, or if there are unidentified errors that allow persons to improperly access our services or systems, we could experience litigation, the need to issue credits to customers, loss of revenue and market share, damage to our reputation, diversion of management attention, increased expenses and reduced profitability.
an increasing portion of our revenue is derived from sales of security solutions. defects in our security solutions could lead to negative publicity, loss of business, damages payments to customers and other negative consequences. as our solutions are adopted by an increasing number of enterprises and governments, it is possible that the individuals and organizations behind advanced malware attacks will specifically focus on finding ways to defeat our products and services. if they are successful, we could experience a serious impact on our reputation as a provider of security solutions.
our business relies on our data systems, traffic measurement systems, billing systems, ordering processes and other operational and financial reporting and control systems. we also rely on third-party software for certain essential operational services and a failure or disruption in these services could materially and adversely affect our ability to manage our business effectively. all of these systems have become increasingly complex due to the complexity of our business, use of third-party software and services, acquisitions of new businesses with different systems, and increased regulation over controls and procedures. as a result, these systems could generate errors that impact traffic measurement or invoicing, revenue recognition and financial forecasting or other parts of our business. we will need to continue to upgrade and improve our data systems, traffic measurement systems, billing systems, ordering processes and other operational and financial systems, procedures and controls. these upgrades and improvements may be difficult and costly. in addition, we could face strains on, or failures of, our internal it systems if governmental restrictions or vaccine or other mandates due to the ongoing covid-19 pandemic limit the ability of our command center personnel to work in our physical locations. if we are unable to adapt our systems and organization in a timely, efficient and cost-effective manner to accommodate changing circumstances, our business may be adversely affected.
cybersecurity breaches and attacks on us, as well as steps we need to take in an effort to prevent them, can lead to significant costs and disruptions that would harm our business, financial results and reputation.
we regularly face attempts to gain unauthorized access or deliver malicious software to the akamai intelligent edge platform and our internal it systems, with the goal of stealing proprietary information related to our business, products, employees and customers; disrupting our systems and services or those of our customers or others; or demanding ransom to return control of such systems and services. these attempts take a variety of forms, including distributed denial of service attacks, infrastructure attacks, botnets, malicious file uploads, application abuse, credential abuse, ransomware, bugs, viruses, worms and malicious software programs. there could be attempts to infiltrate our systems through our supply chain and contractors. malicious actors are known to attempt to fraudulently induce employees and suppliers to disclose sensitive information through illegal electronic spamming, phishing or other tactics. other parties may attempt to gain unauthorized physical access to our facilities in order to infiltrate our internal-use information systems. we may not be able to anticipate the techniques used in such attacks, as they change frequently and may not be recognized until launched. to date, cyber threats and other attacks have not resulted in any material adverse impact to our business or operations, but such threats are constantly evolving, increasing the difficulty of detecting and successfully defending against them.
the complexities in managing the security profile of a distributed network with vast scale and geographic reach that evolves to incorporate new capabilities expose us to both known and unknown vulnerabilities. we have discovered vulnerabilities in software used in our technology, such as the vulnerability in apache log4j 2 referred to as "log4shell" identified in late 2021 that impacted a large portion of the internet ecosystem, and may have other undiscovered vulnerabilities. these vulnerabilities, resident in either software or configurations, may require significant operational efforts to mitigate and may persist for extended periods of time and the effects of any such vulnerability could be exacerbated. our ability to detect vulnerabilities could be particularly limited during extraordinary events, such as the ongoing covid-19 pandemic, where more staff are working remotely and dealing with unusual distractions. similar security risks exist with respect to acquired companies, our business partners and the third-party vendors that we rely on for aspects of our information technology support services and administrative functions. as a result, we are subject to risks that the activities of our business partners and third-party vendors may adversely affect our business even if an attack or breach does not directly target our systems. see also the risk factor captioned we utilize third-party technology in our business, and failures or vulnerabilities, and/or litigation, related to these technologies may adversely affect our business below.
to protect our corporate and deployed networks, we must continuously engineer more secure solutions, enhance security and reliability features, improve the deployment of software updates to address security vulnerabilities, develop mitigation technologies that help to secure customers from attacks and maintain the digital security infrastructure that protects the integrity of our network and services. this is frequently costly, with a negative impact on near-term profitability. we may need to increase our spending in the future; these costs could reduce our operating margin.
any actual, alleged or perceived breach of network security in our systems or networks, or any other actual, alleged or perceived data security incident we, our customers or our third-party suppliers suffer, can result in damage to our reputation; negative publicity; loss of channel partners, customers and sales; loss of competitive advantages; increased costs to remedy any problems and otherwise respond to any incident; regulatory investigations and enforcement actions; costly litigation; and other liabilities. in addition, we may incur significant costs and operational consequences of investigating, remediating, eliminating and putting in place additional tools and devices designed to prevent actual or perceived security breaches and other security incidents, as well as the costs to comply with any notification obligations resulting from any security incidents. any of these negative outcomes could adversely impact the market perception of our solutions and customer and investor confidence in our company and otherwise seriously harm our business and operating results.
if we cannot maintain compatibility with our customers' it infrastructure, including their chosen third-party applications, our business will be harmed.
our products interoperate with our customers' it infrastructure, that often has different specifications, utilizes diverse technology, and requires compatibility with multiple communication protocols. therefore, the functionality of our technology often needs to have, and maintain, compatibility with our customers' technology environment, including their chosen third-party technology. customers, and in particular these chosen third-party applications, may change features, restrict our access to, or alter their applications in a manner that causes incompatibilities or causes us significant costs to maintain compatibility, and as a result our business could be adversely affected. such changes could functionally limit or prevent the compatibility of our products with our customers' it infrastructure, which would negatively affect adoption of our products and harm our business. if we fail to update our products to achieve compatibility with new third-party applications that our customers use, we may not be able to offer the functionality that our customers need, which would harm our business.
we face risks associated with global operations that could harm our business.
a significant portion of our employee increases, customer additions and revenue growth in recent quarters has been attributable to revenue gains outside the u.s. our operations in foreign countries subject us to risks that may increase our costs, disrupt our operations or make our operations less efficient and require significant management attention. these risks include:
•uncertainty regarding liability for content or services, including uncertainty as a result of local laws and lack of legal precedent;
•loss of revenues if the u.s. or foreign governments impose limitations on doing business with significant current or potential customers;
•adjusting to different employee/employer relationships and different regulations governing such relationships;
•becoming subject to regulatory oversight;
•corporate and personal liability for alleged or actual violations of laws and regulations;
•difficulty in staffing, training, developing and managing foreign operations as a result of distance, language, cultural differences or regulations;
•theft of intellectual property in high-risk countries where we operate;
•difficulties in enforcing contracts, collecting accounts and longer payment cycles in certain countries;
•difficulties in transferring funds from, or converting currencies in, certain countries;
•managing the costs and processes necessary to comply with export control, sanctions, anti-corruption, data protection and competition laws and regulations or other regulatory or contractual limitations on our ability to sell or develop our products and services in certain foreign markets;
•geopolitical developments, including any that impact our or our customers' ability to operate or deliver content to a country;
•other circumstances outside of our control such as trade disputes, political unrest, the imposition of sanctions, export controls, warfare, military or armed conflict, such as the russian invasion of ukraine, terrorist attacks, public health emergencies such as the ongoing covid-19 pandemic and natural disasters that could disrupt our ability to provide services or limit customer purchases of them;
•reliance on one or more channel partners over which we have limited control or influence on a day-to-day basis; and
•potentially adverse tax consequences.
we are subject to laws and regulations worldwide that differ among jurisdictions, affecting our operations in areas such as intellectual property ownership and infringement; tax; anti-corruption; internet and technology regulations; foreign exchange controls and cash repatriation; data privacy; competition; and employment. compliance with such requirements can be onerous and expensive and may otherwise impact our business operations negatively. although we have policies, controls, and procedures designed to help ensure compliance with applicable laws, there can be no assurance that our employees, contractors, suppliers or agents will not violate such laws or our policies. violations of these laws and regulations can result in fines; criminal sanctions against us, our officers or our employees; prohibitions on the conduct of our business; and damage to our reputation. see also the risk factor captioned other regulatory developments could negatively impact our business below.
our business strategy depends on the ability to source adequate transmission capacity and the equipment we need to operate our network; failure to have access to those resources could lead to loss of revenue and service disruptions.
to operate our network, we are dependent in part upon transmission capacity provided by third-party telecommunications network providers, the availability of co-location facilities to house our servers and equipment to support our operations. we may be unable to purchase the bandwidth and space we need from these providers due to limitations on their resources or other reasons outside of our control. inability to access facilities where we would like to install servers, or perform maintenance on existing servers, because of governmental restrictions on access due to stay-at-home orders or social distancing requirements due to the ongoing covid-19 pandemic or other events impedes our ability to expand or maintain capacity. as a result, there can be no assurance that we are adequately prepared for unexpected increases in bandwidth demands by our customers, particularly those under cyber-attack or impacted by pandemic-related events. failure to put in place the capacity we require to operate our business effectively could result in a reduction in, or disruption of, service to our customers and ultimately a loss of those customers.
the akamai intelligent edge platform relies on hardware equipment, including hundreds of thousands of servers deployed around the world. global supply chain constraints in the wake of the covid-19 pandemic continue to increase lead times for equipment components, which adds risk to our ability to flex to meet future business needs. disruptions in our supply chain could prevent us from purchasing needed equipment at attractive prices or at all. for example, from time to time, it has been, and may continue to be, more difficult to purchase equipment that is manufactured in areas that face disruptions to operations due to unrest or other political activity, public health issues (such as the ongoing covid-19 pandemic), safety issues, natural disasters or general economic conditions. failure to have adequate equipment, including server equipment, could harm the quality of our services, which could lead to the loss of customers and revenue.
acquisitions and other strategic transactions we complete could result in operating difficulties, dilution, diversion of management attention and other harmful consequences that may adversely impact our business and results of operations.
we expect to continue to pursue acquisitions and other types of strategic relationships that involve technology sharing or close cooperation with other companies. acquisitions and other complex transactions are accompanied by a number of risks, including the following:
•difficulty integrating the technologies, operations and personnel of acquired businesses;
•potential disruptions of our ongoing business;
•potential distraction of management;
•diversion of business resources from core operations;
•financial consequences, such as increased operating expenses, incurrence of additional debt and other dilutive effects on our earnings, particularly in the current environment where we have generally seen escalating valuations of many technology companies and increasing allocation of risk to acquirors;
•assumption of legal risks related to compliance with laws, including privacy and anti-corruption regulations;
•failure to realize synergies or other expected benefits;
•lawsuits resulting from an acquisition or disposition;
•acquisition of it systems that expose us to cybersecurity risks;
•increased accounting charges such as impairment of goodwill or intangible assets, amortization of intangible assets acquired and a reduction in the useful lives of intangible assets acquired; and
•potential unknown liabilities associated with acquired businesses.
any inability to integrate completed acquisitions or combinations in an efficient and timely manner could have an adverse impact on our results of operations. if we use a significant portion of our available cash to pay for acquisitions that are not successful, it could harm our balance sheet and limit our flexibility to pursue other opportunities without having enjoyed the intended benefits of the acquisition. as we complete any future acquisitions, we may encounter difficulty in incorporating acquired technologies into our offerings while maintaining the quality standards that are consistent with our brand and reputation. if we are not successful in completing acquisitions or other strategic transactions that we may pursue in the future, we may incur substantial expenses and devote significant management time and resources without a successful result. future acquisitions could require use of substantial portions of our available cash or result in dilutive issuances of securities.
if current and potential large customers shift to hardware-based or other diy internal solutions, our business will be negatively impacted.
we are reliant on large media and other customers to direct traffic to our network for a significant part of our revenues. in the past, some of those customers have determined that it is better for them to employ a "do-it-yourself" or "diy" strategy by putting in place equipment, software and other technology solutions for content and application delivery and security protection within their internal systems instead of using our solutions for some or all of their needs. essentially, this is another form of competition for us. as the amount of money a customer spends with us increases, the risk that they will seek alternative solutions such as diy or a multi-vendor policy likewise increases. if additional large customers shift to this model, traffic on our network and our contracted revenue commitments would decrease, which would negatively impact our business, profitability, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
if we are unable to recruit and retain key employees and qualified sales, research and development, technical, marketing and support personnel, our ability to compete could be harmed.
our future success depends upon the services of our executive officers and other key technology, sales, research and development, marketing and support personnel who have critical industry experience and relationships. like other companies in our industry, we have experienced, and we expect to continue to experience, difficulty in hiring and retaining highly skilled employees with appropriate qualifications, and, if we fail to attract new personnel or fail to retain and motivate our current personnel, our business and future growth prospects could suffer. for example, none of our officers or key employees is bound by an employment agreement for any specific term, and members of our senior management have left our company over the years for a variety of reasons. in addition, effective succession planning is important to our long-term success and our failure to ensure effective transfer of knowledge and smooth transitions involving our officers and other key personnel could hinder our strategic planning and execution.
in addition, our future success will depend upon our ability to attract and retain employees. such efforts will require time, expense and attention by our employees as there is significant competition for talented individuals in the regions in which our primary offices are located, which affects both our ability to retain key employees and hire new ones and new hires require significant training. this competition results in increased costs in the form of cash and stock-based compensation and can have a dilutive impact on our stock. the loss of the services of a significant number of our employees or any of our key employees or our inability to attract and retain new talent in a timely fashion may be disruptive to our operations and overall business.
our failure to effectively manage our operations and maintain our company culture as our business evolves and our work practices change could harm us.
our future operating results will depend on our ability to manage our operations and we believe our culture has been a key contributor to our success to date. as a result of the diversification of our business, personnel growth, increased usage of alternative working arrangements, including the designation of over 90% of roles as flexible and able to work remotely, including after the pandemic, acquisitions and international expansion in recent years, many of our employees are now based outside of our cambridge, massachusetts headquarters; however, most key management decisions are made by a relatively small group of individuals based primarily at our headquarters.
if we are unable to appropriately increase management depth, enhance succession planning and decentralize our decision-making at a pace commensurate with our actual or desired growth rates, we may not be able to achieve our financial or operational goals. it is also important to our continued success that we hire qualified personnel, properly train them and manage out poorly-performing personnel, all while maintaining our corporate culture and spirit of innovation. if we are not successful in these efforts, our growth and operations could be adversely affected.
due to the ongoing covid-19 pandemic, nearly all of our employees worldwide have been working remotely since the first quarter of 2020. we plan to roll out our flexbase program in may 2022, which will allow the more than 90% of our workforce designated as flexible to choose whether they want to work from an akamai office or their home office. although we believe a flexible working policy will help us attract and retain talent, the long-term continuation of pandemic-based restrictions and implementation of our flexbase program could, among other things, negatively impact employee morale and productivity, inhibit our ability to hire and train new employees and impede our ability to support customers at the levels they expect. in addition, certain security systems in homes or other remote workplaces may be less secure than those used in our offices, which may subject us to increased security risks, including cybersecurity-related events, and expose us to risks of data or financial loss and associated disruptions to our business operations. members of our workforce who access company data and systems remotely may not have access to technology that is as robust as that in our offices, which could cause the networks, information systems, applications and other tools available to those remote workers to be more limited or less reliable than in our offices. we may also be exposed to risks associated with the locations of remote workers, including compliance with local laws and regulations or exposure to compromised internet infrastructure. allowing members of our workforce to work remotely may create intellectual property risk if employees create intellectual property on our behalf while residing in a jurisdiction with unenforced or uncertain intellectual property laws. further, if employees fail to inform us of changes in their work location, we may be exposed to additional risks without our knowledge. if we are unable to effectively transition to a hybrid workforce, manage the cybersecurity and other risks of remote work, and maintain our corporate culture and workforce morale, our business could be harmed or otherwise negatively impacted.
our restructuring and reorganization activities may be disruptive to our operations and harm our business.
over the past several years, we have implemented internal restructurings and reorganizations designed to reduce the size and cost of our operations, improve operational efficiencies, enhance our ability to pursue market opportunities and accelerate our technology development initiatives. in february 2021, we announced a significant reorganization to create two new business groups linked to our security and edge delivery technologies as well as establishing a unified global sales force. we may take similar steps in the future as we seek to realize operating synergies, optimize our operations to achieve our target operating model and profitability objectives, respond to market forces or better reflect changes in the strategic direction of our business. disruptions in operations may occur as a result of taking these actions. taking these actions may also result in significant expense for us, including with respect to workforce reductions, as well as decreased productivity due to employee distraction and unanticipated employee turnover. substantial expense or business disruptions resulting from restructuring and reorganization activities could adversely affect our operating results.
we may have exposure to greater-than-anticipated tax liabilities.
our future income taxes could be adversely affected by earnings being lower than anticipated in jurisdictions that have lower statutory tax rates and higher than anticipated in jurisdictions that have higher statutory tax rates, or changes in tax laws, regulations or accounting principles, as well as certain discrete items such as equity-related compensation. in particular, in october 2021, a global consortium of countries agreed to establishing a new framework for international tax reform; if implemented, such reform may increase our tax liabilities and reduce our profitability. we have recorded certain tax reserves to address potential exposures involving our income tax and sales and use tax positions. these potential tax liabilities result from the varying application of statutes, rules, regulations and interpretations by different jurisdictions. we are currently subject to tax audits in various jurisdictions including the commonwealth of massachusetts. in the second quarter of 2018, we filed an appeal with the massachusetts appellate tax board, or matb, contesting adverse audit findings relating to our eligibility to claim certain tax benefits and exemptions. in july 2020, the matb ruled in our favor; however the massachusetts department of revenue has appealed the decision. if the ultimate outcome of the appeal and other audits are adverse to us, our reserves may not be adequate to cover our total actual liability, and we would need to take a financial charge. although we believe our estimates, our reserves and the positions we have taken in all jurisdictions are reasonable, the ultimate tax outcome may differ from the amounts recorded in our financial statements and may materially affect our financial results in the period or periods for which such determination is made.
fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates affect our reported operating results in u.s. dollar terms.
revenue generated and expenses incurred by our international subsidiaries are often denominated in the currencies of the local countries. as a result, our consolidated u.s. dollar financial statements are subject to fluctuations due to changes in exchange rates as the financial results of our international subsidiaries are translated from local currencies into u.s. dollars. in addition, our financial results are subject to changes in exchange rates that impact the settlement of transactions in non-functional currencies. while we have implemented a foreign currency hedging program to mitigate transactional exposures, there is no guarantee that such program will be effective.
if the accounting estimates we make, and the assumptions on which we rely, in preparing our financial statements prove inaccurate, our actual reported results may be adversely affected.
our financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the u.s. the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments about, among other things, taxes, revenue recognition, stock-based compensation, capitalization of internal-use software development costs, investments, contingent obligations, allowance for current expected credit losses, intangible assets and restructuring charges. these estimates and judgments affect, among other things, the reported amounts of our assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses, the amounts of charges accrued by us, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances and at the time they are made. if our estimates or the assumptions underlying them are not correct, actual results may differ materially from our estimates and we may need to, among other things, accrue significant additional charges that could adversely affect our results of operations, which in turn could adversely affect our stock price. in addition, new accounting pronouncements and interpretations of accounting pronouncements have occurred and may occur in the future that could adversely affect our reported financial results.
our sales to government clients subject us to risks including early termination, audits, investigations, sanctions and penalties.
we have customer contracts with the u.s. government, as well as foreign, state and local governments and their respective agencies and we may in the future increase sales to government entities. sales to government entities are subject to a number of risks. selling to government entities can be highly competitive, expensive, and time consuming, often requiring significant upfront time and expense without any assurance that these efforts will generate a sale. such government entities often have the right to terminate these contracts at any time, without cause. there is increased pressure for governments and their agencies, both domestically and internationally, to reduce spending and demand and payment for our services may be impacted by public sector budgetary cycles and funding authorizations. these factors may combine to potentially limit the revenue we derive from government contracts in the future. additionally, government contracts generally have requirements that are more complex than those found in commercial enterprise agreements and therefore are more costly to comply with. such contracts are also subject to audits and investigations that could result in civil and criminal penalties and administrative sanctions, including termination of contracts, refund of a portion of fees received, forfeiture of profits, suspension of payments, fines and suspensions or debarment from future government business.
we utilize third-party technology in our business, and failures or vulnerabilities, and/or litigation, related to these technologies may adversely affect our business.
we utilize third party technology software, services, and other technology in order to operate critical functions of our business, including the integration of certain of these technologies into our network, products and services. if these software, services, or other technology become unavailable or contain vulnerabilities, our expenses could increase and our ability to operate our network, provide our products, and our results of operations could be impaired until equivalent software, technology, or services are purchased or developed or any identified vulnerabilities are remedied. if we are unable to procure the necessary third-party technology we may need to acquire or develop alternative technology, we may have to resort to utilizing alternative technology of lower quality. this could limit and delay our ability to offer new or competitive products and increase our costs of production. as a result, our business could be significantly harmed. in addition, the use of third-party technology may expose us to third-party claims of intellectual property infringement which could cause us to incur significant costs in defense or alternative sourcing.
we rely on certain "open-source" software, the use of which could result in our having to distribute our proprietary software, including our source code, to third parties on unfavorable terms, which could materially affect our business.
certain of our offerings use software that is subject to open-source licenses. open-source code is software that is freely accessible, usable and modifiable; however, certain open-source code is governed by license agreements, the terms of which could require users of such software to make any derivative works of the software available to others on unfavorable terms or at no cost. because we use open-source code, we may be required to take remedial action in order to protect our proprietary software. such action could include replacing certain source code used in our software, discontinuing certain of our products or taking other actions that could be expensive and divert resources away from our development efforts. in addition, the terms relating to disclosure of derivative works in many open-source licenses are unclear and have not been interpreted by u.s. courts. if a court interprets one or more such open-source licenses in a manner that is unfavorable to us, we could be required to make certain of our key software available at no cost. we could also be subject to similar conditions or restrictions should there be any changes in the licensing terms of the open source software incorporated into our products. in either event, we could be required to seek licenses from third parties in order to continue offering our products, to re-engineer our products or to discontinue the sale of our products in the event re-engineering cannot be accomplished on a timely or successful basis, any of which could adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition. furthermore, open-source software may have security flaws and other deficiencies that could make our solutions less reliable and damage our business.
legal and regulatory risks evolving privacy regulations could negatively impact our profitability and business operations.
laws and regulations that apply to the internet related to privacy and data localization could pose risks to our revenues, intellectual property and customer relationships, as well as increase expenses or create other disadvantages to our business.
privacy laws are rapidly proliferating, changing and evolving globally. governments, privacy advocates and class action attorneys are increasingly scrutinizing how companies collect, process, use, store, share and transmit personal data. laws, such as the european union general data protection regulation, or gdpr, and the california consumer privacy act of 2018, or ccpa, and industry self-regulatory codes have been enacted, and more laws are being considered that may affect how we use data generated from our network as well as our ability to reach current and prospective customers, understand how our solutions are being used and respond to customer requests allowed under the laws. any perception that our business practices, our data collection activities or how our solutions operate represent an invasion of privacy, whether or not consistent with current regulations and industry practices, may subject us to public criticism or boycotts, class action lawsuits, reputational harm or actions by regulators, or claims by industry groups or other third parties, all of which could disrupt our business and expose us to liability.
engineering efforts to build new capabilities to facilitate compliance with increasing data localization requirements and new and changing privacy laws could require us to take on substantial expense and divert engineering resources from other projects. we might experience reduced demand for our offerings if we are unable to engineer products that meet our legal duties or help our customers meet their obligations under the gdpr, the ccpa or other data regulations, or if the changes we implement to comply with such laws and regulations make our offerings less attractive.
our ability to leverage the data generated by our global network of servers is important to the value of many of the solutions we offer, our operational efficiency and future product development opportunities. our ability to use data in this way may be constrained by regulatory developments. compliance with applicable laws and regulations regarding personal data may require changes in services, business practices or internal systems that result in increased costs, lower revenue, reduced efficiency or greater difficulty in competing with other firms. compliance with data regulations might limit our ability to innovate or offer certain features and functionality in some jurisdictions where we operate. failure to comply with existing or new rules may result in significant penalties or orders to stop the alleged non-compliant activity, as well as negative publicity and diversion of management time and effort.
although we take steps intended to improve the security controls across our business groups and geographies, our security controls over personal data, our training of employees and third parties on data security and other practices we follow may not prevent the improper disclosure or misuse of customer or end-user data we store and manage. improper disclosure or misuse of personal data could harm our reputation, lead to legal exposure to customers or end users, or subject us to liability under laws that protect personal data, resulting in increased costs or loss of revenue.
other regulatory developments could negatively impact our business.
local and foreign laws and regulations that apply to the internet related to, among other things, content liability, security requirements, law enforcement access to information, critical infrastructure, data localization requirements and restrictions on social media or other content could pose risks to our revenues, intellectual property and customer relationships as well as increase expenses or create other disadvantages to our business. section 230 of the u.s. communications decency act, often referred to as section 230, gives websites that host user-generated content broad protection from legal liability for content posted on their sites. proposals to repeal or amend section 230 could expose us to greater legal liability in the conduct of our business. our acceptable use policy prohibits customers from using our network to deliver illegal or inappropriate content; if customers violate that policy, we may nonetheless face reputational damage or lawsuits related to their content. regulations have been enacted or proposed in a number of countries that limit the delivery of certain types of content into those countries. enactment and expansion of such laws and regulations would negatively impact our revenues. for example, restrictions were adopted in india in 2020 prohibiting access to identified chinese applications which caused a reduction in revenue to us. in addition, such laws and regulations could cause internet service providers, or others, to block our products in order to enforce content blocking efforts. in addition, efforts to block a single product or domain name may end up blocking a number of other products or domain names in an overbroad manner that could affect our business. interpretations of laws or regulations that would subject us to regulatory supervision or, in the alternative, require us to exit a line of business or a country, could lead to loss of significant revenues and have a negative impact on the quality of our solutions. as noted with privacy compliance above, engineering efforts to build new capabilities to facilitate compliance with law enforcement access requirements, content access restrictions, or other regulations could require us to take on substantial expense and divert engineering resources from other projects. these circumstances could harm our profitability.
we may need to defend against patent or copyright infringement claims, which would cause us to incur substantial costs or limit our ability to use certain technologies in the future.
as we expand our business and develop new technologies, products and services, we have become increasingly subject to intellectual property infringement and other claims and related litigation. we have also agreed to indemnify our customers and channel and strategic partners if our solutions infringe or misappropriate specified intellectual property rights; as a result, we have been and could again become involved in litigation or claims brought against customers or channel or strategic partners if our solutions or technology are the subject of such allegations. any litigation or claims, whether or not valid, brought against us or pursuant to which we indemnify our customers or partners could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and require us to do one or more of the following:
•cease selling, incorporating or using features, functionalities, products or services that incorporate the challenged intellectual property;
•pay substantial damages and incur significant litigation expenses;
•obtain a license from the holder of the infringed intellectual property right, which license may not be available on reasonable terms or at all; or
•redesign products or services.
if we are forced to take any of these actions, our business may be seriously harmed.
our business will be adversely affected if we are unable to protect our intellectual property rights from unauthorized use or infringement by third parties.
we rely on a combination of patent, copyright, trademark and trade secret laws and contractual restrictions on disclosure to protect our intellectual property rights. these legal protections afford only limited protection, particularly in some regions outside the united states. we have previously brought lawsuits against entities that we believed were infringing our intellectual property rights but have not always prevailed. such lawsuits can be expensive and require a significant amount of attention from our management and technical personnel, and the outcomes are unpredictable. monitoring unauthorized use of our solutions is difficult, and we cannot be certain that the steps we have taken or will take will prevent unauthorized use of our technology. furthermore, we cannot be certain that any pending or future patent applications will be granted, that any future patent will not be challenged, invalidated or circumvented, or that rights granted under any patent that may be issued will provide competitive advantages to us. if we are unable to protect our proprietary rights from unauthorized use, the value of our intellectual property assets may be reduced. although we have licensed from other parties proprietary technology covered by patents, we cannot be certain that any such patents will not be challenged, invalidated or circumvented. such licenses may also be non-exclusive, meaning our competition may also be able to access such technology.
litigation may adversely impact our business.
from time to time, we are or may become involved in various legal proceedings relating to matters incidental to the ordinary course of our business, including patent, commercial, product liability, breach of contract, employment, class action, whistleblower and other litigation and claims, and governmental and other regulatory investigations and proceedings. in addition, under our charter, we could be required to indemnify and advance expenses to our directors and officers in connection with their involvement in certain actions, suits, investigations and other proceedings. such matters can be time-consuming, divert management's attention and resources and cause us to incur significant expenses. furthermore, because litigation is inherently unpredictable and may not be covered by insurance, there can be no assurance that the results of any litigation matters will not have an adverse impact on our business, results of operations, financial condition or cash flows.
global climate change and related natural resource conservation regulations could adversely impact our business.
the long-term effects of climate change on the global economy and our industry in particular remain unknown. for example, changes in weather where we operate may increase the costs of powering and cooling computer hardware we use to develop software and provide cloud-based services. in addition, catastrophic natural disasters, such as an earthquake, fire, flood or other act of god, catastrophic event or pandemic, and any similar disruption, as well as any derivative disruption, such as those to services provided through localized physical infrastructure, including utility or telecommunication outages, or any to the continuity of our, our partners', suppliers' and our customers' workforce, could have a material adverse impact on our business and operating results. our global operations are dependent on our network infrastructure, technology systems and website, including the supply of servers from our third party partners, as well as our intellectual property and personnel and any disruption to these dependencies may negatively impact our ability to respond to customers, provide services and maintain local and global business continuity. furthermore, some of our products and business functions are hosted or carried out by third parties that may be vulnerable to these same types of disruptions, the response to or resolution of which may be beyond our control. any disruption to our business could cause us to incur significant costs to repair damages to our facilities, equipment, infrastructure and business relationships.
in addition, in response to concerns about global climate change, governments may adopt new regulations affecting the use of fossil fuels or requiring the use of alternative fuel sources which could adversely impact our business. our deployed network of servers consumes significant energy resources, including those generated by the burning of fossil fuels. while we have invested in projects to support renewable energy development, our customers, investors and other stakeholders may require us to take more steps to demonstrate that we are taking ecologically responsible measures in operating our business. the costs and any expenses we may incur to make our network more energy-efficient and comply with any new regulations could make us less profitable in future periods. failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations or other requirements imposed on us could lead to fines, lost revenue and damage to our reputation.
investment-related risks our stock price has been, and may continue to be, volatile, and your investment could lose value.
the market price of our common stock has historically been volatile. trading prices may continue to fluctuate in response to a number of events and factors, including the following:
•quarterly variations in operating results;
•announcements by our customers related to their businesses that could be viewed as impacting their usage of our solutions;
•market speculation about whether we are a takeover target or considering a strategic transaction;
•announcements by competitors;
•activism by any single large stockholder or combination of stockholders or rumors about such activity;
•changes in financial estimates and recommendations by securities analysts;
•failure to meet the expectations of securities analysts;
•purchases or sales of our stock by our officers and directors;
•general economic conditions and other macro-economic factors, such as inflationary pressures;
•repurchases of shares of our common stock;
•successful cyber-attacks affecting our network or systems;
•performance by other companies in our industry; and
•geopolitical conditions such as acts of terrorism, military or armed conflicts, such as the russian invasion of ukraine, or global pandemics.
furthermore, our revenue, particularly that portion attributable to usage of our solutions beyond customer commitments, can be difficult to forecast, and, as a result, our quarterly operating results can fluctuate substantially. this concern is particularly acute with respect to our media and commerce customers. in the future, our customer contracting models may change to move away from a committed revenue structure to a "pay-as-you-go" approach, which could make it easier for customers to reduce the amount of business they do with us or leave altogether. changes in billing models and committed revenue requirements could, therefore, create challenges with our forecasting processes. because a significant portion of our cost structure is largely fixed in the short-term, revenue shortfalls tend to have a disproportionately negative impact on our profitability. if we announce revenue or profitability results that do not meet or exceed our guidance or make changes in our guidance with respect to future operating results, our stock price may decrease significantly as a result.
any of these events, as well as other circumstances discussed in these risk factors, may cause the price of our common stock to fall. in addition, the stock market in general, and the market prices of stock of publicly-traded technology companies in particular, have experienced significant volatility that often has been unrelated to the operating performance of affected companies. these broad stock market fluctuations may adversely affect the market price of our common stock, regardless of our operating performance.
any failure to meet our debt obligations would damage our business.
as of the date of this report, we had total principal amount of $1,150.0 million of convertible senior notes outstanding due in 2025, and we had total principal amount of $1,150.0 million of convertible senior notes outstanding due in 2027. we also entered into a credit facility in may 2018 that provides for an initial $500.0 million in revolving loans; under specified circumstances, we would be able to borrow an additional $500.0 million thereunder. our ability to repay any amounts we borrow under our credit facility, refinance the notes, make cash payments in connection with conversions of the notes or repurchase the notes in the event of a fundamental change (as defined in the applicable indenture governing the notes) will depend on market conditions and our future performance, which is subject to economic, financial, competitive and other factors beyond our control. we also may not use the cash we have raised through future borrowing under the credit facility or the issuance of the convertible senior notes in an optimally productive and profitable manner. if we are unable to remain profitable or if we use more cash than we generate in the future, our level of indebtedness at such time could adversely affect our operations by increasing our vulnerability to adverse changes in general economic and industry conditions and by limiting or prohibiting our ability to obtain additional financing for additional capital expenditures, acquisitions and general corporate and other purposes. if we do not have sufficient cash upon conversion of the notes or to repurchase the notes following a fundamental change, we would be in default under the terms of the notes, which could seriously harm our business. although the terms of our credit facility include certain financial ratios that potentially limit our future indebtedness, the terms of the notes do not. if we incur significantly more debt, this could intensify the risks described above.
we may issue additional shares of our common stock or instruments convertible into shares of our common stock and thereby materially and adversely affect the market price of our common stock.
our board of directors has the authority to issue additional shares of our common stock or other instruments convertible into, or exchangeable or exercisable for, shares of our common stock. if we issue additional shares of our common stock or instruments convertible into, or exchangeable or exercisable for, shares of our common stock, it may materially and adversely affect the market price of our common stock.
because we currently do not intend to pay dividends, stockholders will benefit from an investment in our common stock only if it appreciates in value.
we currently intend to retain our future earnings, if any, for use in the operation of our business and do not expect to pay any cash dividends in the foreseeable future on our common stock. as a result, the success of an investment in our common stock will depend upon any future appreciation in its value. there is no guarantee that our common stock will appreciate in value or even maintain the price at which stockholders have purchased their shares.
provisions of our charter, by-laws and delaware law may have anti-takeover effects that could prevent a change in control even if the change in control would be beneficial to our stockholders.
provisions of our charter, by-laws and delaware law could make it more difficult for a third party to control or acquire us, even if doing so would be beneficial to our stockholders. these provisions include:
•our board of directors having the right to elect directors to fill a vacancy created by the expansion of the board of directors or the resignation, death or removal of a director;
•stockholders needing to provide advance notice to nominate individuals for election to the board of directors or to propose matters that can be acted upon at a stockholders' meeting; and
•the ability of our board of directors to issue, without stockholder approval, shares of undesignated preferred stock.
further, as a delaware corporation, we are also subject to certain delaware anti-takeover provisions. under delaware law, a corporation may not engage in a business combination with any holder of 15% or more of its capital stock unless the holder has held the stock for three years or, among other things, the board of directors has approved the transaction. our board of directors could rely on delaware law to prevent or delay an acquisition of us.
if we fail to maintain an effective system of internal controls, we may not be able to accurately report our financial results or prevent fraud. as a result, our stockholders could lose confidence in our financial reporting, which could harm our business and the trading price of our common stock.
we have complied with section 404 of the sarbanes-oxley act of 2002 by assessing, strengthening and testing our system of internal controls. even though we concluded our internal control over financial reporting and disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of the end of the period covered by this report, we need to continue to maintain our processes and systems and adapt them to changes as our business evolves and we rearrange management responsibilities and reorganize our business. this continuous process of maintaining and adapting our internal controls and complying with section 404 is expensive and time-consuming and requires significant management attention. we cannot be certain that our internal control measures will continue to provide adequate control over our financial processes and reporting and ensure compliance with section 404. furthermore, as our business changes, including by expanding our operations in different markets, increasing reliance on channel partners and completing acquisitions, our internal controls may become more complex and we will be required to expend significantly more resources to ensure our internal controls remain effective. failure to implement required new or improved controls, or difficulties encountered in their implementation, could harm our operating results or cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations. if we or our independent registered public accounting firm identify material weaknesses, the disclosure of that fact, even if quickly remediated, could reduce the market's confidence in our financial statements and harm our stock price.
item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations this management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations, or md&a, should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto that appear elsewhere in this annual report on form 10-k. see "risk factors" elsewhere in this annual report on form 10-k for a discussion of certain risks associated with our business. the following discussion contains forward-looking statements. the forward-looking statements do not include the potential impact of any mergers, acquisitions, divestitures or other events that may be announced after the date hereof.
overview we provide solutions to power and protect digital experiences. the key factors that influence our financial success are our ability to build on recurring revenue commitments for our security and performance offerings, increase media traffic on our network, effectively manage the prices we charge for our solutions, develop new products and carefully manage our capital spending and other expenses. the purpose of this discussion and analysis section is to provide material information relevant to an assessment of our financial condition and results of operations from management's perspective, including to describe and explain key trends, events and other factors that impacted our reported results and that are reasonably likely to impact our future performance.
revenue for most of our solutions, our customers commit to contracts having terms of a year or longer, which allows us to have a consistent and predictable base level of revenue. in addition to a base level of revenue, we are also dependent on media customers where usage of our solutions is more variable. as a result, our revenue is impacted by the amount of media and software download traffic we serve on our network, the rate of adoption of gaming, social media and video platform offerings, the timing and variability of customer-specific one-time events and geopolitical, economic and other developments that impact our customers' businesses. seasonal variations that impact traffic on our network, such as holiday-related activities, can cause revenue fluctuations from quarter to quarter. over the longer term, our ability to expand our product portfolio and to effectively manage the prices we charge for our solutions are key factors impacting our revenue growth.
we have observed the following trends related to our revenue in recent years:
•increased sales of our security solutions have made a significant contribution to revenue growth. we plan to continue to invest in this area with a focus on further enhancing our product portfolio and extending our go-to-market capabilities, particularly in certain markets and through our channel partners.
•we have experienced increases in the amount of traffic delivered for customers that use our solutions for video, gaming downloads and social media. during 2020, we saw a dramatic increase in traffic growth on our network related to the shutdowns and restrictions from the novel coronavirus, or covid-19, pandemic. primarily as a result of the rollback of many pandemic-related restrictions, we have seen the rate of traffic growth moderate during 2021. we do not expect the events of 2020, and its impact to our revenue growth rates, to repeat in the foreseeable future.
•the prices paid by some of our customers have declined due to competition and contract renewals. during 2021 as compared to 2020, we experienced a decline in revenue from website and application delivery solutions due to the above factors, particularly in the u.s. commerce vertical. while we have increased committed recurring revenue from our solutions by upselling incremental solutions to our existing customers and adding new customers to offset the negative trends, we expect revenue challenges from our website and application performance solutions to continue in 2022.
•revenue from our international operations has been growing at a faster pace than from our u.s. operations, particularly in terms of traffic, new customer acquisition and cross-selling of incremental solutions. because we publicly report in u.s. dollars, if the dollar strengthens, our reported revenue results will be negatively impacted. conversely, a weaker dollar would benefit our reported results.
•we have experienced variations in certain types of revenue from quarter to quarter. in particular, we typically experience higher revenue in the fourth quarter of each year for some of our solutions as a result of holiday season activity. in addition, we experience quarterly variations in revenue attributable to, among other things, the nature and timing of software and gaming releases by our customers; whether there are large live sporting or other events or situations that impact the amount of media traffic on our network; and the frequency and timing of purchases of custom solutions or licensed software.
expenses our level of profitability is also impacted by our expenses, including direct costs to support our revenue such as bandwidth and co-location costs. we have observed the following trends related to our profitability in recent years:
•our profitability improved in 2021 and 2020 as compared to prior periods due to higher overall revenue as well as the effects of cost savings and efficiency initiatives we have undertaken. we have also benefited from lower travel expenses because of pandemic-related shutdowns and restrictions. we will need to continue to undertake efforts intended to improve the efficiency of operations to manage our expense growth and profitability.
•network bandwidth costs represent a significant portion of our cost of revenue. historically, we have been able to mitigate increases in these costs by reducing our network bandwidth costs per unit and investing in internal-use software development to improve the performance and efficiency of our network. our total bandwidth costs may increase in the future as a result of expected higher traffic levels and serving more traffic from higher cost regions. we will need to continue to effectively manage our bandwidth costs to maintain current levels of profitability.
•co-location costs are also a significant portion of our cost of revenue. by improving our internal-use software and managing our hardware deployments to enable us to use servers more efficiently, we have been able to manage the growth of co-location costs. we expect to continue to scale our network in the future and will need to continue to effectively manage our co-location costs to maintain current levels of profitability.
•network build-out and supporting service costs represent another significant portion of our cost of revenue. these costs include maintenance and supporting services incurred as we continue to build-out our global network. we have seen these costs increase in 2021 and 2020, as a result of our network expansion and pricing pressure from vendors. as we continue to invest in our network, we will need to effectively manage our network build-out and supporting costs.
•our employees are core to the operations of our business, and payroll and related costs, including stock-based compensation, is one of our largest expenses. it is important to the success of operations that we offer competitive compensation packages. however, we need to ensure we continue to focus on the right investments and maintain operational efficiencies to mitigate the cost of talent. we plan to continue to hire employees in support of our strategic initiatives, including through our anticipated acquisition, but do not expect overall headcount to increase significantly in 2022.
•depreciation expense related to our network equipment also contributes to our overall expense levels. during 2021, as compared to 2020, we saw higher depreciation expense due to accelerated deployment of equipment in 2020 to help meet the increased traffic demands arising during the ongoing covid-19 pandemic. we plan to continue to invest in our network in 2022 which will further increase our capital expenditures and resulting depreciation expense.
acquisitions in february 2022, we announced our intention to acquire linode limited liability company, or linode, for approximately $900.0 million, net of cash acquired and subject to post-closing adjustments. linode is an infrastructure-as-a-service platform provider that allows for developer-friendly cloud computing capabilities. the acquisition is intended to enhance our edge computing services by creating a unique cloud platform to build, run and secure applications from the cloud to the edge. the acquisition is expected to close in march 2022. linode has approximately 250 employees, and the acquisition is expected to be accretive to our earnings per share in 2022.
in october 2021, we acquired guardicore ltd., or guardicore, for $610.4 million in cash. guardicore's micro-segmentation solution is designed to limit user access to only those applications that are authorized to communicate with each other, thereby limiting the spread of malware and protecting the flow of enterprise data across the network. guardicore has approximately 270 employees, and the acquisition is expected to be dilutive to our earnings per share at least through 2022.
reorganization we are currently organized and operate in one reportable and operating segment: providing cloud services for delivering, optimizing and securing content and business applications over the internet. effective on march 1, 2021, we reorganized into two groups, both of which utilize the akamai intelligent edge platform and our global sales organization: the security technology group and the edge technology group. these groups are aligned with our product offerings. revenue from the security technology group was previously reported as revenue from cloud security solutions, and revenue from the edge technology group was previously reported as revenue from content delivery network services and all other solutions. the security technology group includes solutions that are designed to keep infrastructure, websites, applications and users safe, while the edge technology group includes solutions that enable business online, including media delivery, web performance and edge computing solutions.
remote work we have a rigorous process for assessing whether any office can reopen (and remain open) based on local government regulations, local health trends and business needs. for most locations, our facilities are expected to be closed to employees whose job responsibilities do not require in-office work. we have begun to selectively and safely reopen offices in a limited capacity for employees who would prefer to work from one of our offices. safety protocols include, but are not limited to, mandatory training, personal protective equipment, reduced capacity, social distancing, an increased cleaning schedule and, in certain jurisdictions, vaccination requirements and/or testing protocols. we have a rigorous process for assessing whether any office can reopen (and remain open) based on local government regulations, local health trends and business needs. except for employees whose job responsibilities require in-office work, none of our employees are required to fully return to the office, even those that are currently open. in addition, we plan to roll out our flexbase program in may 2022, which will allow the more than 90% of our workforce designated as flexible to choose whether they want to work from an akamai office or their home office, even after we decide it is safe to open all of our offices in light of the covid-19 pandemic.
our operations have not been significantly disrupted by the shift to remote working. while we have incurred and expect to continue to incur expenses associated with enabling remote work, reconfiguring work spaces to help ensure the safety and well-being of employees accessing our locations and re-thinking our facility footprint and the way we utilize office space, we do not currently believe those costs will materially impact our financial condition or results of operations.

the increase in our revenue in 2021 as compared to 2020 was primarily the result of continued strong growth in sales of solutions offered by our security technology group. the increase in our revenue in 2020 as compared to 2019 was primarily the result of higher media traffic volumes due in part to behavioral changes prompted by the covid-19 pandemic and continued strong growth in sales of our security technology group solutions.
the increases in security technology group revenue for 2021 as compared to 2020, and 2020 as compared to 2019, were due to growth across our security products portfolio, including bot manager, kona site defender, prolexic and our access control product suite.
the decrease in edge technology group revenue for 2021 as compared to 2020 was due to reduction in sales of application performance solutions, partially offset by growth in edge application solutions. the increase in edge technology group revenue for 2020 as compared to 2019 was primarily due to strong traffic growth, driven by video and gaming, over-the-top, or ott, as well as strong growth in our edge applications solutions stemming from behavior changes from the covid-19 pandemic. these increases were partially offset by a reduction in sales of website and application performance solutions.

the increases in cost of revenue for 2021 as compared to 2020, and 2020 as compared to 2019, was primarily due to increased investment in our network, mostly incurred in 2020, to support current and anticipated future traffic growth, which resulted in increases to amounts paid for network build-out and supporting services, higher depreciation costs of our network equipment and increases to expenses related to our co-location facilities. bandwidth fees also increased during these periods due to growth in the amount of traffic served on our network.
during 2022, we anticipate cost of revenues to increase compared to 2021, in particular amortization of internal-use software, depreciation of network equipment and payroll and related costs, due to continued investments in our network, as well as our recent and expected acquisitions. we plan to continue to focus our efforts on managing our operating margins, including continuing to manage our bandwidth, co-location and network build-out costs.

the increases in research and development expenses for 2021 as compared to 2020 were due to increased payroll and related costs, including stock-based compensation, primarily due to headcount growth, the redeployment of some employees to research and development functions from sales and marketing activities as part of our march 2021 reorganization and as a result of employees joining us through acquisitions.
the increases in research and development expenses for 2020 as compared to 2019 were due to growth in payroll and related costs as a result of merit increases and headcount growth to support investments in new product development and network scaling. these increases were partially offset by increases in capitalized salaries and related costs due to continued investment in internal-use software deployed on our network.
research and development costs are expensed as incurred, other than certain internal-use software development costs eligible for capitalization. capitalized development costs consist of payroll and related costs for personnel and external consulting expenses involved in the development of internal-use software used to deliver our services and operate our network. for the years ended december 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, we capitalized $32.2 million, $35.7 million and $33.7 million, respectively, of stock-based compensation. these capitalized internal-use software development costs are amortized to cost of revenue over their estimated useful lives, which is generally two years, but can be up to seven years based on the software developed and its expected useful life.
we expect research and development costs to increase in 2022 to support our innovation initiatives and incremental headcount due to hiring for our strategic investments and our employees acquired through our recent and anticipated acquisitions.

the decreases in sales and marketing expenses for 2021 as compared to 2020 were due to decreased payroll and related costs, including stock-based compensation, primarily as a result of headcount reductions due to the establishment of a unified global sales organization and elimination of duplicative roles as a result of our march 2021 reorganization. in connection with this, some employees who previously supported the sales organization were redeployed in march 2021 to our research and development function to focus our investments to improve security, performance, scalability and innovation across our solutions.
the decreases in sales and marketing expenses for 2020 as compared to 2019 were a result of the restrictions associated with the covid-19 pandemic that resulted in the cancellation or postponement of in-person marketing events and led to a decline in travel expenses such as airfare, lodging and other costs related to in-person customer events and meetings.
we expect sales and marketing costs to increase in 2022 as compared to 2021, due our recent and anticipated acquisitions. however, we plan to continue to carefully manage costs in an effort to manage our operating margins and to refine and optimize our go-to-market efforts.

the increase in general and administrative expenses for 2021 as compared to 2020 was primarily due to increased payroll and related costs, including stock-based compensation, as a result of annual merit increases and headcount growth, partially offset by a decrease in an endowment contribution to the akamai foundation in 2020 that did not recur in 2021.
the increase in general and administrative expenses for 2020 as compared to 2019 was primarily due to:
•an endowment contribution to the akamai foundation in 2020, which did not occur in 2019, to support the foundation's increased charitable initiatives;
•expansion of company infrastructure throughout 2019, including moving into our new corporate headquarters in cambridge, massachusetts, which increased facilities-related costs and depreciation and amortization in 2020; and
•a reduction to license patent fees as a result of our litigation with limelight networks, inc., or limelight, that did not recur in 2020.
the increases in general and administrative expenses for 2020 as compared to 2019 were also partially offset by a decrease in amounts paid to professional service providers for advisory services as well as a legal settlement charge in 2019 that did not recur in 2020.

during 2022, we expect payroll and related costs of our general and administrative functions to increase as compared to 2021 as a result of headcount growth to support the operations of the business, but we plan to continue to carefully manage costs in an effort to manage our operating margins.

the increase in amortization of acquired intangible assets for 2021 as compared to 2020, as well as 2020 as compared to 2019, was the result of amortization of assets related to our recent acquisitions.
based on acquired intangible assets as of december 31, 2021, future amortization is expected to be $48.1 million, $43.5 million, $38.9 million, $35.8 million and $31.0 million for the years ending december 31, 2022, 2023, 2024, 2025 and 2026, respectively. we anticipate that these amortization amounts will increase in future periods as a result of our anticipated acquisition of linode, which is expected to close in late march 2022.

the restructuring charge in 2021 was primarily the result of management's actions initiated in the fourth quarter of 2020 to better position us to become more agile in delivering our solutions. the restructuring charge for this action includes severance and related expenses for certain headcount reductions and software charges for software not yet placed into service that will not be implemented due to this action. in addition to the 2020 action, additional charges were incurred in 2021, related to management's plans to launch its new flexbase program in may 2022. the restructuring charge incurred for this program in 2021 includes impairments of lease-related assets for certain facilities that are no longer needed. these restructuring charges were partially offset by the release of a lease obligation for a facility previously exited as part of management actions initiated in late 2019.
the restructuring charge in 2020 was primarily the result of the management actions initiated in the fourth quarter of 2020, and the associated severance and related expenses and software charges that resulted from the action. in addition, an $8.7 million impairment of lease-related assets was incurred during 2020 to exit leased facilities related to a 2019 action, which allowed us to focus on investment with the potential to accelerate new revenue growth.
the restructuring charge in 2019 was primarily the result of the management actions initiated in 2019, and associated severance and related expenses due to headcount reductions and software charges for software not yet placed into service that was not implemented due to this action.
we do not expect material additional restructuring charges related to our prior actions. we are continuing to evaluate our facility footprint in light of our flexbase program, including our plans and ability to sublease space, but we do not currently believe such charges will materially impact our financial condition or results of operation.

interest income primarily consists of interest earned on invested cash balances and marketable securities. the decrease to interest income for 2021 as compared to 2020, and 2020 as compared to 2019, was primarily the result of investing in marketable securities having lower rates of return due to lower interest rates. we expect interest income to decrease in 2022 as a result of an anticipated lower cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities balance due to our planned acquisition of linode in march 2022.
interest expense is related to our debt transactions, which are described in note 11 to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10-k. the increase to interest expense for 2020 as compared to 2019 was primarily due to the august 2019 issuance of $1,150.0 million in par value of convertible senior notes due 2027, or 2027 notes, which bear regular interest of 0.375%, but have an effective interest rate of 3.1% due to the conversion feature. as a result of our adoption of new guidance for accounting for convertible senior notes on january 1, 2022 (see note 2 to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10-k), we expect interest expense to decrease in 2022 as a result of the elimination of the amortization of debt discounts.
other income (expense), net primarily represents net foreign exchange gains and losses mainly due to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations on intercompany and other non-functional currency transactions. other income (expense), net for the years ended december 31, 2021 and 2020 also includes gains from the sale of equity investments of $3.7 million and $7.2 million, respectively. other income (expense), net may fluctuate in the future based on changes in foreign currency exchange rates or other events.

the increase in the provision for income taxes for 2021 as compared to 2020 was mainly due to an increase in profitability and a decrease in the excess tax benefit related to stock-based compensation. these amounts were partially offset by an increase in foreign income taxed at lower rates, a decrease in state taxes, a decrease in the revaluation of certain foreign income tax liabilities due to foreign exchange rate fluctuations and the release of certain tax reserves related to the expiration of local statutes of limitations.
the decrease in the provision for income taxes for 2020 as compared to 2019 was mainly due to a decrease in intercompany sales of intellectual property, a decrease in the valuation allowance recorded against deferred tax assets related to state tax credits and an increase in foreign income taxed at lower rates. these amounts were partially offset by an increase in profitability and the release of certain tax reserves related to the expiration of local statues of limitations.
for the year ended december 31, 2021, our effective income tax rate was lower than the federal statutory tax rate due to foreign income taxed at lower rates, the excess tax benefit related to stock-based compensation and the benefit of u.s. federal, state and foreign research and development credits. these amounts were partially offset by non-deductible stock-based compensation and state taxes.
for the year ended december 31, 2020, our effective income tax rate was lower than the federal statutory tax rate due to foreign income taxed at lower rates, the impact of the excess tax benefit related to stock-based compensation and the benefit of u.s. federal, state and foreign research and development credits. these amounts were partially offset by non-deductible stock-based compensation, state taxes and the valuation allowance recorded against tax credits and foreign net operating loss carryforwards.
for the year ended december 31, 2019, our effective income tax rate was lower than the federal statutory tax rate due to the release of certain tax reserves related to the expiration of local statutes of limitations, foreign income taxed at lower rates, the excess tax benefit related to stock-based compensation and the benefit of the u.s. federal, state and foreign research and development credits. these amounts were partially offset by the valuation allowance recorded against deferred tax assets related to state tax credits, non-deductible executive compensation, an intercompany sale of intellectual property and state income taxes.
our effective income tax rate may fluctuate between fiscal years and from quarter to quarter due to items arising from discrete events, such as tax benefits from the disposition of employee equity awards, tax law changes and settlements of tax audits and assessments. our effective income tax rate is also impacted by, and may fluctuate in any given period because of, the composition of income in foreign jurisdictions where tax rates differ depending on the local statutory rates.
refer to note 19 to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10-k for additional information regarding unrecognized tax benefits that, if recognized, would impact the effective income tax rate in the next 12 months and the potential impact that current litigation related to an adverse audit finding could have on our results of operations.

during 2019, we began recognizing our share of earnings from our investment with mitsubishi ufj financial group, or mufg, in a joint venture, global open network, inc., or go-net. go-net intended to operate a blockchain-based online payment network. in february 2022, mufg, the majority owner of go-net, announced it was preparing to suspend the operations of go-net. we recorded a loss of $13.1 million during the year ended december 31, 2020, which included an $11.0 million impairment to reduce the company's investment to its fair value due to a modified business plan and continued negative projected cash flows. we recorded a loss of $14.0 million and $1.1 million during the years ended december 31, 2021 and 2019, respectively, which reflects our share of the losses incurred by go-net during those years. we expect to record additional losses in 2022 as go-net winds down its operations. however, we do not expect those losses to be more than our remaining investment on december 31, 2021 of $7.5 million.
non-gaap financial measures in addition to providing financial measurements based on generally accepted accounting principles in the united states of america, or gaap, we provide additional financial metrics that are not prepared in accordance with gaap, or non-gaap financial measures. management uses non-gaap financial measures, in addition to gaap financial measures, to understand and compare operating results across accounting periods, for financial and operational decision making, for planning and forecasting purposes, to measure executive compensation and to evaluate our financial performance. these non-gaap financial measures are non-gaap income from operations, non-gaap operating margin, non-gaap net income, non-gaap net income per share, adjusted ebitda, adjusted ebitda margin, capital expenditures and impact of foreign currency exchange rates, as discussed below.
management believes that these non-gaap financial measures reflect our ongoing business in a manner that allows for meaningful comparisons and analysis of trends in the business, as they facilitate comparing financial results across accounting periods and to those of peer companies. management also believes that these non-gaap financial measures enable investors to evaluate our operating results and future prospects in the same manner as management. these non-gaap financial measures may exclude expenses and gains that may be unusual in nature, infrequent or not reflective of our ongoing operating results.
the non-gaap financial measures do not replace the presentation of our gaap financial measures and should only be used as a supplement to, not as a substitute for, our financial results presented in accordance with gaap.
the non-gaap adjustments, and our basis for excluding them from non-gaap financial measures, are outlined below:
•amortization of acquired intangible assets - we have incurred amortization of intangible assets, included in our gaap financial statements, related to various acquisitions we have made. the amount of an acquisition's purchase price allocated to intangible assets and term of its related amortization can vary significantly and are unique to each acquisition; therefore, we exclude amortization of acquired intangible assets from our non-gaap financial measures to provide investors with a consistent basis for comparing pre- and post-acquisition operating results.
•stock-based compensation and amortization of capitalized stock-based compensation - although stock-based compensation is an important aspect of the compensation paid to our employees, the grant date fair value varies based on the stock price at the time of grant, varying valuation methodologies, subjective assumptions and the variety of award types. this makes the comparison of our current financial results to previous and future periods difficult to interpret; therefore, we believe it is useful to exclude stock-based compensation and amortization of capitalized stock-based compensation from our non-gaap financial measures in order to highlight the performance of our core business and to be consistent with the way many investors evaluate our performance and compare our operating results to peer companies.
•acquisition-related costs - acquisition-related costs include transaction fees, advisory fees, due diligence costs and other direct costs associated with strategic activities. in addition, subsequent adjustments to our initial estimated amounts of contingent consideration and indemnification associated with specific acquisitions are included within acquisition-related costs. these amounts are impacted by the timing and size of the acquisitions. we exclude acquisition-related costs from our non-gaap financial measures to provide a useful comparison of our operating results to prior periods and to our peer companies because such amounts vary significantly based on the magnitude of our acquisition transactions and do not reflect our core operations.
•restructuring charges - we have incurred restructuring charges from programs that have significantly changed either the scope of the business undertaken by us or the manner in which that business is conducted. these charges include severance and related expenses for workforce reductions, impairments of long-lived assets that will no longer be used in operations (including right-of-use assets, other facility-related property and equipment and internal-use software) and termination fees for any contracts cancelled as part of these programs. we exclude these items from our non-gaap financial measures when evaluating our continuing business performance as such items vary significantly based on the magnitude of the restructuring action and do not reflect expected future operating expenses. in addition, these charges do not necessarily provide meaningful insight into the fundamentals of current or past operations of our business.
•amortization of debt discount and issuance costs and amortization of capitalized interest expense - in august 2019, we issued $1,150 million of convertible senior notes due 2027 with a coupon interest rate of 0.375%. in may 2018, we issued $1,150 million of convertible senior notes due 2025 with a coupon interest rate of 0.125%. in february 2014, we issued $690 million of convertible senior notes due 2019 with a coupon interest rate of 0%. the imputed interest rates of these convertible senior notes were 3.10%, 4.26% and 3.20%, respectively. this is a result of the debt discounts recorded for the conversion features that are required to be separately accounted for as equity under gaap, thereby reducing the carrying values of the convertible debt instruments. the debt discounts are amortized as interest expense together with the issuance costs of the debt. the interest expense excluded from our non-gaap results is comprised of these non-cash components and is excluded from management's assessment of our operating performance because management believes the non-cash expense is not representative of ongoing operating performance.
•gains and losses on investments - we have recorded gains and losses from the disposition, changes to fair value and impairment of certain investments. we believe excluding these amounts from our non-gaap financial measures is useful to investors as the types of events giving rise to these gains and losses are not representative of our core business operations and ongoing operating performance.
•legal settlements - we have incurred losses related to the settlement of legal matters. we believe excluding these amounts from our non-gaap financial measures is useful to investors as the types of events giving rise to them are not representative of our core business operations.
•endowment of akamai foundation - we have incurred expenses to endow the akamai foundation, a private corporate foundation dedicated to encouraging the next generation of technology innovators by supporting math and science education. our first endowment was in 2018 to enable a permanent endowment for the akamai foundation to allow it to expand its reach. in the fourth quarter of 2020 we supplemented the endowment to enable specific initiatives to increase diversity in the technology industry. we believe excluding these amounts from non-gaap financial measures is useful to investors as these infrequent and nearly one-time expenses are not representative of our core business operations.
•transformation costs - we have incurred professional services fees associated with internal changes that are designed to improve operating margins and that are part of a discrete planned transformation program intended to significantly change the manner in which business is conducted. we believe excluding these amounts from our non-gaap financial measures is useful to investors as the types of events and activities giving rise to them occur infrequently and are not representative of our core business operations and ongoing operating performance.
•income and losses from equity method investment - we record income or losses on our share of earnings and losses from our equity method investment. we exclude such income and losses because we do not direct control over the operations of the investment and the related income and losses are not representative of our core business operations.
•income tax effect of non-gaap adjustments and certain discrete tax items - the non-gaap adjustments described above are reported on a pre-tax basis. the income tax effect of non-gaap adjustments is the difference between gaap and non-gaap income tax expense. non-gaap income tax expense is computed on non-gaap pre-tax income (gaap pre-tax income adjusted for non-gaap adjustments) and excludes certain discrete tax items (such as recording or releasing of valuation allowances), if any. we believe that applying the non-gaap adjustments and their related income tax effect allows us to highlight income attributable to our core operations.

(1) shares used in non-gaap per diluted share calculations have been adjusted for the years ended december 31, 2021 and 2020, for the benefit of our note hedge transactions. during 2021 and 2020, our average stock price was in excess of $95.10, which is the initial conversion price of our convertible senior notes due in 2025. see further discussion below.
(2) may not foot due to rounding.
non-gaap net income per diluted share is calculated as non-gaap net income divided by diluted weighted average common shares outstanding. gaap diluted weighted average common shares outstanding are adjusted in non-gaap per share calculations for the shares that would be delivered to us pursuant to the note hedge transactions entered into in connection with the issuance of our convertible senior notes. under gaap, shares delivered under hedge transactions are not considered offsetting shares in the fully-diluted share calculation until they are delivered. however, we would receive a benefit from the note hedge transactions and would not allow the dilution to occur, so management believes that adjusting for this benefit provides a meaningful view of net income per share. unless our weighted average stock price is greater than $95.10, the initial conversion price of the convertible senior notes due 2025, or $116.18, the initial conversion price of the convertible senior notes due 2027, there will be no difference between our gaap and non-gaap diluted weighted average common shares outstanding.
we consider adjusted ebitda to be another important indicator of the operational strength and performance of our business and a good measure of our historical operating trends. adjusted ebitda eliminates items that we do not consider to be part of our core operations. we define adjusted ebitda as gaap net income excluding the following items: interest income; income taxes; depreciation and amortization of tangible and intangible assets; stock-based compensation; amortization of capitalized stock-based compensation; acquisition-related costs; restructuring charges; gains and losses on legal settlements; costs incurred related to endowment contributions to the akamai foundation; transformation costs; foreign exchange gains and losses; interest expense; amortization of capitalized interest expense; certain gains and losses on investments; gains and losses from equity method investments; and other non-recurring or unusual items that may arise from time to time. adjusted ebitda margin represents adjusted ebitda stated as a percentage of revenue.

impact of foreign currency exchange rates revenue and earnings from our international operations have historically been an important contributor to our financial results. consequently, our financial results have been impacted, and management expects they will continue to be impacted, by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. for example, when the local currencies of our foreign subsidiaries weaken, generally our consolidated results stated in u.s. dollars are negatively impacted.
because exchange rates are a meaningful factor in understanding period-to-period comparisons, management believes the presentation of the impact of foreign currency exchange rates on revenue and earnings enhances the understanding of our financial results and evaluation of performance in comparison to prior periods. the dollar impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates presented is calculated by translating current period results using monthly average foreign currency exchange rates from the comparative period and comparing them to the reported amount. the percentage change at constant currency presented is calculated by comparing the prior period amounts as reported and the current period amounts translated using the same monthly average foreign currency exchange rates from the comparative period.
liquidity and capital resources to date, we have financed our operations primarily through public and private sales of debt and equity securities and cash generated by operations. as of december 31, 2021, our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, which primarily consisted of corporate bonds and u.s. government agency obligations, totaled $2.2 billion. factoring in our outstanding convertible senior notes of $2.3 billion, our net cash at december 31, 2021 was in a negative position of $133.8 million. we place our cash investments in instruments that meet high-quality credit standards, as specified in our investment policy. our investment policy also limits the amount of our credit exposure to any one issue or issuer and seeks to manage these assets to achieve our goals of preserving principal and maintaining adequate liquidity at all times.
changes in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities are dependent upon changes in, among other things, working capital items such as accounts receivable, deferred revenue, accounts payable and various accrued expenses, as well as changes in our capital and financial structure due to common stock repurchases, debt repayments and issuances, acquisitions, purchases and sales of marketable securities and similar events. we believe that our strong balance sheet and cash position are important competitive differentiators that provide the financial stability and flexibility to enable us to continue to make investments at opportune times.
as of december 31, 2021, we had cash and cash equivalents of $346.4 million held in accounts outside the u.s. the u.s. tax cuts and jobs act establishes a territorial tax system in the u.s., which provides companies with the potential ability to repatriate earnings with minimal u.s. federal income tax impact. as a result, our liquidity is not expected to be materially impacted by the amount of cash and cash equivalents held in accounts outside the u.s.

in accordance with the authoritative guidance for accounting for uncertainty in income taxes, as of december 31, 2021, we had unrecognized tax benefits of $23.1 million, including $7.2 million of accrued interest and penalties. we believe that it is reasonably possible that $4.8 million of our unrecognized tax benefits will be recognized by the end of 2022. the settlement period for the remaining amount of the unrecognized tax benefits is unknown.

the decrease in cash used in investing activities in 2021 as compared to 2020 was primarily driven by a decrease in purchases of marketable securities, as we did not reinvest our matured securities in order to fund our acquisition of guardicore in october 2021. the decrease was also attributable to a reduction of purchases of property and equipment as we slowed expansion of our network, as compared to 2020. these decreases were partially offset by an increase in cash paid for acquired businesses in 2021, due to the size of the acquisition completed in 2021, as compared to 2020.
the decrease in cash used in investing activities in 2020 as compared to 2019 was driven by a decrease in purchases of marketable securities. during 2019 we invested some of the proceeds from our august 2019 issuance of convertible senior notes in marketable securities, which increased our purchases in that year and did not recur in 2020. the decrease in cash used in investing activities in 2020 as compared to 2019 was partially offset by an increase in purchases of property and equipment during 2020 to support the increase in traffic we experienced on our network and expect to continue to experience in the future.

the increase in cash used in financing activities in 2021 as compared to 2020 was primarily the result of increased share repurchases. effective november 1, 2018, our board of directors authorized a $1.1 billion share repurchase program through december 31, 2021. in october 2021, our board of directors authorized a new $1.8 billion share repurchase program, effective january 1, 2022 through december 31, 2024. our goals for the share repurchase programs are to offset the dilution created by our employee equity compensation programs over time and provide the flexibility to return capital to shareholders as business and market conditions warrant, while still preserving our ability to pursue other strategic opportunities.
the change in net cash used in financing activities during 2020 as compared to 2019 was due to the net proceeds received from our august 2019 issuance of our convertible senior notes and related bond hedge and warrant transaction. the increase was partially offset by the repayment of our convertible senior notes that were due in february 2019 and a decrease in shares repurchased under our repurchase programs.
during 2021, 2020 and 2019, we repurchased 4.7 million, 2.0 million and 4.0 million shares of our common stock, respectively, at an average price per share of $109.97, $98.53 and $82.90, respectively.
convertible senior notes in august 2019, we issued $1,150.0 million in par value of convertible senior notes due 2027 and entered into related convertible note hedge and warrant transactions. we have used and expect to continue to use the net proceeds of the offering for share repurchases, working capital and general corporate purposes, including potential acquisitions and other strategic transactions.
in may 2018, we issued $1,150.0 million in par value of convertible senior notes due 2025 and entered into related convertible note hedge and warrant transactions. we used a portion of the net proceeds to repay at maturity all of our $690.0 million outstanding aggregate principle amount of convertible senior notes due in 2019. in addition, we have used and expect to continue to use the remaining net proceeds of the offering for share repurchases, working capital and general corporate purposes, including potential acquisitions and other strategic transactions.
in february 2014, we issued $690.0 million in par value of convertible senior notes due 2019 and entered into related convertible note hedge and warrant transactions. we repaid the full $690.0 million in principal amount of the notes in cash in february 2019, as the notes matured and no conversions occurred.
the terms of the notes and the hedge and warrant transactions are discussed more fully in note 11 to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10-k.
revolving credit facility in may 2018, we entered into a $500.0 million, five-year revolving credit agreement, or the credit agreement. borrowings under the facility may be used to finance working capital needs and for general corporate purposes. the facility provides for an initial $500.0 million in revolving loans. under specified circumstances, the facility can be increased to up to $1.0 billion in aggregate principal amount.
borrowings under the credit agreement bear interest, at our option, at a base rate plus a spread of 0.00% to 0.25% or an adjusted libor rate plus a spread of 0.875% to 1.25%, in each case with such spread being determined based on our consolidated leverage ratio specified in the credit agreement. regardless of what amounts, if any, are outstanding under the credit agreement, we are also obligated to pay an ongoing commitment fee on undrawn amounts at a rate of 0.075% to 0.15%, with such rate being based on our consolidated leverage ratio specified in the credit agreement.
the credit agreement contains customary representations and warranties, affirmative and negative covenants and events of default. principal covenants include a maximum consolidated leverage ratio and a minimum consolidated interest coverage ratio. there were no outstanding borrowings under the credit agreement as of december 31, 2021.
liquidity outlook based on our present business plan, we expect our current cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities balances and our forecasted cash flows from operations to be sufficient to meet our foreseeable cash needs for at least the next 12 months. our foreseeable cash needs, in addition to our recurring operating costs, include our expected capital expenditures, investments in information technology, our anticipated acquisition of linode, other potential strategic acquisitions, anticipated share repurchases, lease and purchase commitments and settlements of other long-term liabilities. in particular, our anticipated acquisition of linode will require approximately $900.0 million, net of cash acquired and subject to post-close adjustments. we plan to fund the acquisition of linode with cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities on hand. we also have access to our credit agreement, should we require additional resources to fund the acquisition of linode or other recurring operating costs.
off-balance sheet arrangements we have entered into indemnification agreements with third parties, including vendors, customers, landlords, our officers and directors, shareholders of acquired companies, joint venture partners and third parties to which we license technology. generally, these indemnification agreements require us to reimburse losses suffered by a third party due to various events, such as lawsuits arising from patent or copyright infringement or our negligence. these indemnification obligations are considered off-balance sheet arrangements in accordance with the authoritative guidance for guarantor's accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees, including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others. see note 13 to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10-k for further discussion of these indemnification agreements. the fair value of guarantees issued or modified during 2021 and 2020 was determined to be immaterial.
significant accounting policies and estimates see note 2 to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10-k for information regarding recent and newly adopted accounting pronouncements.
application of critical accounting policies and estimates overview our md&a is based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with gaap. these principles require us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses, cash flow and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. our estimates include those related to revenue recognition, accounts receivable and related reserves, valuation and impairment of marketable securities, capitalized internal-use software development costs, goodwill and acquired intangible assets, income tax reserves, impairment and useful lives of long-lived assets and stock-based compensation. we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances at the time such estimates are made. actual results may differ from these estimates. for a complete description of our significant accounting policies, see note 2 to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10-k.
definitions we define our critical accounting policies as those policies that require us to make subjective estimates and judgments about matters that are uncertain and are likely to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. our estimates are based upon assumptions and judgments about matters that are highly uncertain at the time an accounting estimate is made and applied and require us to assess a range of potential outcomes.
review of critical accounting policies and estimates revenue recognition our contracts with customers sometimes include promises to transfer multiple services to a customer. determining whether services are distinct performance obligations often requires the exercise of judgment by management. advanced features that enhance a main product or service and are highly interrelated are generally not considered distinct; rather, they are combined with the service they relate to into one performance obligation. different determinations related to combining services into performance obligations could result in differences in the timing and amount of revenue recognized in a period.
determination of the standalone selling price, or ssp, also requires the exercise of judgment by management. ssp is based on observable inputs such as the price we charge for the service when sold separately, or the discounted list price per management's approved price list. in cases where services are not sold separately or price list rates are not available, a cost-plus-margin approach or adjusted market approach is used to determine ssp. changes to ssp could result in differences in the allocation of transaction price among performance obligations, which could result in differences in the timing and amount of revenue recognized in a period.
from time to time, we enter into contracts to sell services or license technology to unrelated enterprises at or about the same time that we enter into contracts to purchase products or services from the same enterprises. consideration payable to a customer is reviewed as part of the transaction price. if the payment to the customer does not represent payment for a distinct service, revenue is recognized only up to the net amount of consideration after customer payment obligations are considered. different determinations on whether a payment represents a distinct service could result in differences in the amount of revenue recognized.
we may also resell the licenses or services of third parties. if we are acting as an agent in an arrangement with a customer to provide third party services, the transaction price reflects only the net amount to which we will be entitled, after accounting for payments made to the third party responsible for satisfying the performance obligation. different determinations on whether we are acting as an agent or a principal could change the amount of revenue recognized.
accounts receivable and related reserves trade accounts receivable are recorded at the invoiced amounts and do not bear interest. in addition to trade accounts receivable, our accounts receivable balance includes unbilled accounts that represent revenue recorded for customers that is typically billed within one month. we record allowances against our accounts receivable balance, primarily for current expected credit losses. increases and decreases in the allowance for current expected credit losses are included as a component of general and administrative expense in the consolidated statements of income.
estimates are used in determining our allowance for current expected credit losses using historical loss rates for the previous twelve months as well as expectations about the future where we have been able to develop forecasts to supports our estimates. in addition, the allowance for current expected credit losses considers outstanding balances on a customer-specific, account-by-account basis. we assess collectability based upon a review of customer receivables from prior sales with collection issues where we no longer believe that the customer has the ability to pay for services previously provided. we also perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers. if such an evaluation indicates that payment is no longer reasonably assured for services provided, any future services provided to that customer will result in the creation of a cash basis reserve until we receive consistent payments.
valuation and impairment of marketable securities we measure the fair value of our financial assets and liabilities at the end of each reporting period. fair value is defined as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. we have certain financial assets and liabilities recorded at fair value (principally cash equivalents and short- and long-term marketable securities) that have been classified as level 1, 2 or 3 within the fair value hierarchy. fair values determined by level 1 inputs utilize quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that we can access at the reporting date. fair values determined by level 2 inputs utilize data points other than quoted prices included within level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly. fair values determined by level 3 inputs are based on unobservable data points for the asset or liability.
marketable securities are considered to be impaired when a decline in fair value below cost basis is determined to be other-than-temporary. we periodically evaluate whether a decline in fair value below cost basis is other-than-temporary by considering available evidence regarding these investments including, among other factors, the duration of the period that, and extent to which, the fair value is less than cost basis; the financial health of, and business outlook for, the issuer, including industry and sector performance and operational and financing cash flow factors; overall market conditions and trends; and our intent and ability to retain our investment in the security for a period of time sufficient to allow for an anticipated recovery in market value. once a decline in fair value is determined to be other-than-temporary, a write-down is recorded and a new cost basis in the security is established. assessing the above factors involves inherent uncertainty. write-downs, if recorded, could be materially different from the actual market performance of marketable securities in our portfolio if, among other things, relevant information related to our investments and marketable securities was not publicly available or other factors not considered by us would have been relevant to the determination of impairment.
impairment and useful lives of long-lived assets we review our long-lived assets, such as property and equipment, operating lease right-of-use assets and acquired intangible assets, for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable. events that would trigger an impairment review include a change in the use of the asset or forecasted negative cash flows related to the asset. when such events occur, we compare the carrying amount of the asset to the undiscounted expected future cash flows related to the asset. if this comparison indicates that impairment is present, the amount of the impairment is calculated as the difference between the carrying amount and the fair value of the asset. if a readily determinable market price does not exist, fair value is estimated using discounted expected cash flows attributable to the asset. the estimates required to apply this accounting policy include forecasted usage of the long-lived assets, the useful lives of these assets and expected future cash flows. changes in these estimates could materially impact results from operations.
goodwill and acquired intangible assets we test goodwill for impairment on an annual basis, as of december 31, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired. we have concluded that we have one reporting unit and that our chief operating decision maker is our chief executive officer and the executive management team. we have assigned the entire balance of goodwill to our one reporting unit. the fair value of the reporting unit was based on our market capitalization as of each of december 31, 2021 and 2020, and it was substantially in excess of the carrying value of the reporting unit at each date.
acquired intangible assets consist of completed technologies, customer relationships, trademarks and trade names, non-compete agreements and acquired license rights. we engaged third party valuation specialists to assist us with the initial measurement of the fair value of acquired intangible assets. acquired intangible assets, other than goodwill, are amortized over their estimated useful lives based upon the estimated economic value derived from the related intangible assets.
income taxes our provision for income taxes is comprised of a current and a deferred portion. the current income tax provision is calculated as the estimated taxes payable or refundable on tax returns for the current year. the deferred income tax provision is calculated for the estimated future tax effects attributable to temporary differences and carryforwards by using expected tax rates in effect in the years during which the differences are expected to reverse or the carryforwards are expected to be realized.
we currently have net deferred tax assets, comprised of net operating loss, or nol, carryforwards, tax credit carryforwards and deductible temporary differences. our management periodically weighs the positive and negative evidence to determine if it is more-likely-than-not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will be realized. in determining our net deferred tax assets and valuation allowances, annualized effective tax rates and cash paid for income taxes, management is required to make judgments and estimates about domestic and foreign profitability, the timing and extent of the utilization of nol carryforwards, applicable tax rates, transfer pricing methodologies and tax planning strategies. judgments and estimates related to our projections and assumptions are inherently uncertain; therefore, actual results could differ materially from our projections.
we have recorded certain tax reserves to address potential exposures involving our income tax positions. these potential tax liabilities result from the varying application of statutes, rules, regulations and interpretations by different taxing jurisdictions. our estimate of the value of our tax reserves contains assumptions based on past experiences and judgments about the interpretation of statutes, rules and regulations by taxing jurisdictions. it is possible that the costs of the ultimate tax liability or benefit from these matters may be more or less than the amount that we estimated.
uncertainty in income taxes is recognized in our consolidated financial statements using a two-step process to determine the amount of tax benefit to be recognized. first, the tax position must be evaluated to determine the likelihood that it will be sustained upon external examination. if the tax position is deemed more-likely-than-not to be sustained based on technical merit, the tax position is then assessed to determine the amount of benefit to recognize in the financial statements. the amount of the benefit that may be recognized is the largest amount that we believe has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement.
accounting for stock-based compensation we issue stock-based compensation awards including stock options, restricted stock units and deferred stock units. we measure the fair value of these awards at the grant date and recognize such fair value as expense over the vesting period. we have selected the black-scholes option pricing model to determine the fair value of stock option awards and the monte carlo simulation model to determine the fair value of market-based restricted stock unit awards. determining the fair value of stock-based awards at the grant date requires judgment, including estimating the expected life of the stock awards and the volatility of the underlying common stock. our assumptions may differ from those used in prior periods. changes to the assumptions may have a significant impact on the fair value of stock-based awards, which could have a material impact on our financial statements. judgment is also required in estimating the number of stock-based awards that are expected to be forfeited. should our actual forfeiture rates differ significantly from our estimates, our stock-based compensation expense and results of operations could be materially impacted. in addition, for awards that vest and become exercisable only upon achievement of specified performance conditions, we make judgments and estimates each quarter about the probability that such performance conditions will be met or achieved. changes to the estimates we make from time to time may have a significant impact on our stock-based compensation expense and could materially impact our results of operations.
capitalized internal-use software costs we capitalize salaries and related costs, including stock-based compensation, of employees and consultants who devote time to the development of internal-use software development projects, as well as interest expense related to our senior convertible notes. capitalization begins during the application development stage, once the preliminary project stage has been completed. if a project constitutes an enhancement to previously-developed software, we assess whether the enhancement creates additional functionality to the software, thus qualifying the work incurred for capitalization. once the project is available for general release, capitalization ceases and we estimate the useful life of the asset and begin amortization. we periodically assess whether triggering events are present to review internal-use software for impairment. changes in our estimates related to internal-use software would increase or decrease operating expenses or amortization recorded during the period.

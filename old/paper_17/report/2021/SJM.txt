item 1a.    risk factors.
our business, operations, and financial condition are subject to various risks and uncertainties. the risk factors described below should be carefully considered, together with the other information contained or incorporated by reference in this annual report on form 10-k and our other filings with the sec, in connection with evaluating the company, our business, and the forward-looking statements contained in this annual report. additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial also may affect us. the occurrence of any of these known or unknown risks could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.
risks related to our business the covid-19 pandemic and related ongoing implications could negatively impact our business and results of operations.
the covid-19 pandemic has had, and could continue to have, a negative impact on financial markets, economic conditions, and portions of our business and industry as a result of changes in consumer behaviors, retailer inventory levels, cost inflation, manufacturing and supply chain disruption, and overall macroeconomic conditions. while our overall business has benefited from increased at-home consumption due to covid-19, our ability to sustain heightened sales is dependent on evolving consumer mobility and purchasing behavior. though the continued availability and effectiveness of vaccines may partially mitigate the risks around the continued spread of covid-19, the related ongoing implications could negatively impact our business and results of operations in a number of ways, including, but not limited to, the following:
•a shutdown or slowdown of one or more of our manufacturing facilities due to illness or labor shortages could significantly disrupt our production capabilities, particularly with respect to our coffee production, substantially all of which takes place in new orleans, louisiana;
•a slowdown or stoppage in our supply chain could result from government restrictions or labor shortages due to illness or if our suppliers, vendors, distributors, or third-party manufacturers fail to meet their obligations to us or experience disruptions in their ability to do so;
•a strain on our supply chain could result from increased consumer demand at our retail and e-commerce customers;
•an increase in commodity and other input costs could result from market volatility, particularly with respect to protein meals, fats, and green coffee, the supply chain for which has been significantly disrupted by covid-19;
•a significant portion of our workforce, including our management team, could become unable to work as a result of illness or government restrictions, or the attention of our management team could be diverted if any key employees become ill from covid-19 and are unable to work;
•an impairment in the carrying value of goodwill, other intangible assets, or other long-lived assets, or a change in the useful life of finite-lived intangible assets could occur if there are sustained changes in consumer purchasing behaviors, government restrictions, financial results, or a deterioration of macroeconomic conditions;
•a decrease in demand for away from home establishments, resulting from government restrictions and social distancing measures, has adversely affected, and may continue to adversely affect, our away from home operations;
•an increase in working capital needs could occur, caused by an increase in days sales outstanding or an extension of payment terms by our customers or a reduction of payment terms by our suppliers resulting from increased financial pressures;
•a change in demand resulting from restrictions on social interactions could affect customers' and consumers' plans to purchase or methods of purchasing our products;
•a change in demand for or availability of our products could result from retailers, distributors, or carriers modifying their restocking, fulfillment, or shipping practices;
•a shift in consumer spending as a result of the economic downturn could result in consumers moving to private label or competitive products or our lower-priced products;
•a change in trade promotions and marketing activities could occur in response to changes in consumer viewing and shopping habits resulting from the cancellation of major events, travel restrictions, and changes in in-store shopping practices;
•a fluctuation in foreign currency exchange rates or interest rates could result from market uncertainties;
•an increase in the cost or the difficulty to obtain debt or equity financing, or to refinance our debt in the future, could affect our financial condition or our ability to fund operations or future investment opportunities; and
•an increase in regulatory restrictions or continued market volatility could hinder our ability to implement price increases resulting from commodity or other input cost increases or to execute strategic business activities, including acquisitions and divestitures.
our proprietary brands, packaging designs, and manufacturing methods are essential to the value of our business, and the inability to protect these could harm the value of our brands and adversely affect our sales and profitability.
the success of our business depends significantly on our brands, know-how, and other intellectual property. we rely on a combination of trademarks, service marks, trade secrets, patents, copyrights, and similar rights to protect our intellectual property. the success of our growth strategy depends on our continued ability to use our existing trademarks and service marks in order to maintain and increase brand awareness and further develop our brands. if our efforts to protect our intellectual property are not adequate, or if any third party misappropriates or infringes on our intellectual property, the value of our brands may be harmed, which could have a material adverse effect on our business. from time to time, we are engaged in litigation to protect our intellectual property, which could result in substantial costs as well as diversion of management attention.
in particular, we consider our proprietary coffee roasting methods essential to the consistent flavor and richness of our coffee products and, therefore, essential to our coffee brands. because many of the roasting methods we use are not protected by patents, it may be difficult for us to prevent competitors from copying our roasting methods if such methods become known. we also believe that our packaging innovations, such as our aromasealtm canisters, are important to the coffee business' marketing and operational efforts. if our competitors copy our roasting or packaging methods or develop more advanced roasting or packaging methods, the value of our coffee brands may be diminished, and we could lose customers to our competitors.
we use a single national broker to represent a portion of our branded products to the retail grocery trade and any failure by the broker to effectively represent us could adversely affect our business.
we use a single national broker in the u.s. to represent a portion of our branded products to the retail grocery trade. our business would suffer disruption if this broker were to fail to perform brokerage services or to effectively represent us to the retail grocery trade, which could adversely affect our business.
loss or interruption of supply from single-source suppliers of raw materials and finished goods could have a disruptive effect on our business and adversely affect our results of operations.
we have elected to source certain raw materials, such as packaging for our folgers coffee products, as well as our jif peanut butter, and finished goods, such as k-cup® pods and our pup-peroni dog snacks, from single sources of supply. while we believe that, except as set forth below, alternative sources of these raw materials and finished goods could be obtained on commercially reasonable terms, loss or an extended interruption in supplies from a single-source supplier would result in additional costs, could have a disruptive short-term effect on our business, and could adversely affect our results of operations.
keurig is our single-source supplier for k-cup® pods, which are used in its proprietary keurig® k-cup® brewing system. there are a limited number of manufacturers other than keurig that are making pods that will work in such proprietary brewing system. if keurig is unable to supply k-cup® pods to us for any reason, it could be difficult to find an alternative supplier for such goods on commercially reasonable terms, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.
certain of our products are produced at single manufacturing sites.
we have consolidated our production capacity for certain products into single manufacturing sites, including substantially all of our coffee, milk-bone dog snacks, fruit spreads, toppings, and syrups. we could experience a production disruption at these or any of our manufacturing sites resulting in a reduction or elimination of the availability of some of our products. if we are not able to obtain alternate production capability in a timely manner, our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be adversely affected.
a significant interruption in the operation of any of our supply chain or distribution capabilities could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.
our ability and the ability of our third-party suppliers and service providers, distributors, and contract manufacturers to manufacture, distribute, and sell products is critical to our success. a significant interruption in the operation of any of our manufacturing or distribution capabilities, or the manufacturing or distribution capabilities of our suppliers, distributors, or contract manufacturers, or a service failure by a third-party service provider, whether as a result of adverse weather conditions or a natural disaster, work stoppage, terrorism, pandemic illness (such as the covid-19 pandemic), or other causes, could significantly impair our ability to operate our business. in particular, substantially all of our coffee production takes place in new orleans, louisiana, and is subject to risks associated with hurricane and other weather-related events, and some of our production facilities are located in places where tornadoes or wildfires can frequently occur, such as alabama, kansas, and california. in addition, we are actively monitoring covid-19 and its impact on our supply chain and consolidated results of operations, which could be negatively impacted in a number of ways, as previously noted. failure to take adequate steps to mitigate the likelihood or potential impact of such events, or to effectively manage such events if they occur, could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.
our business could be harmed by strikes or work stoppages.
as of april 30, 2021, 24 percent of our full-time employees, located at eight manufacturing locations, are covered by collective bargaining agreements. these contracts vary in term depending on location, with five contracts expiring in 2022, representing 8 percent of our total employees. we cannot assure that we will be able to renew these collective bargaining agreements on the same or more favorable terms as the current agreements, or at all, without production interruptions caused by labor stoppages. if a strike or work stoppage were to occur in connection with negotiations of new collective bargaining agreements or as a result of disputes under collective bargaining agreements with labor unions, our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be materially adversely affected.
the success of our business depends substantially on consumer perceptions of our brands.
we are the branded market leader in several categories both in the u.s. and canada. we believe that maintaining and continually enhancing the value of our brands is critical to the success of our business. brand value is based in large part on consumer perceptions. success in promoting and enhancing brand value depends in large part on our ability to provide high-quality products. brand value could diminish significantly as a result of a number of factors, such as if we fail to preserve the quality of our products, if we are perceived to act in an irresponsible manner, if the company or our brands otherwise receive negative publicity, if our brands fail to deliver a consistently positive consumer experience, or if our products become unavailable to consumers. the growing use of social and digital media by consumers increases the speed and extent that information and opinions can be shared. negative posts or comments about us or our brands or products on social or digital media could damage our brands and reputation. if we are unable to build and sustain brand equity by offering recognizably superior products, we may be unable to maintain premium pricing over private label products. if our brand values are diminished, our revenues and operating results could be materially adversely affected. in addition, anything that harms the dunkin' or rachael ray brands could adversely affect the success of our exclusive licensing agreements with the owners of these brands.
we may not be able to attract, develop, and retain the highly skilled people we need to support our business.
we depend on the skills and continued service of key employees, including our experienced management team. in addition, our ability to achieve our strategic and operating goals depends on our ability to identify, recruit, hire, train, and retain qualified individuals. we compete with other companies both within and outside of our industry for talented people, and we may lose key employees or fail to attract, recruit, train, develop, and retain other talented individuals. any such loss, failure, or negative perception with respect to these individuals may adversely affect our business or financial results. in addition, activities related to identifying, recruiting, hiring, integrating, and training qualified individuals may require significant time and expense. we may not be able to locate suitable replacements for any key employees who leave or to offer employment to potential replacements on reasonable terms, each of which may adversely affect our business and financial results.
our operations are subject to the general risks associated with acquisitions, divestitures, and restructurings.
our stated strategic vision is to own and market a portfolio of food and beverage brands that combines number one and leading brands with emerging, on-trend brands to drive balanced, long-term growth, primarily in north america. we have historically made strategic acquisitions of brands and businesses, including ainsworth, and intend to do so in the future in support of this strategy. if we are unable to complete acquisitions or to successfully integrate and develop acquired businesses, including the effective management of integration and related restructuring costs, we could fail to achieve the anticipated synergies and cost savings, or the expected increases in revenues and operating results, either of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial results.
in addition, we have made strategic divestitures of brands and businesses, including the sale of the crisco, natural balance, and u.s. baking businesses, and we may do so in the future. if we are unable to complete divestitures or successfully transition divested businesses, including the effective management of the related separation and stranded overhead costs and transition services, our business and financial results could be negatively impacted. divestitures and related restructuring costs, such as the restructuring plan entered into in 2021, require a significant amount of management and operational resources. these additional demands could divert management's attention from core business operations, potentially adversely impacting existing business relationships and employee morale, resulting in negative impacts on our financial performance.
we may not realize the benefits we expect from our cost reduction and other cash management initiatives.
we continuously pursue initiatives to reduce costs, increase effectiveness, and optimize cash flow. we may not realize all of the anticipated cost savings or other benefits from such initiatives. other events and circumstances, such as financial or strategic difficulties, delays, or unexpected costs, may also adversely impact our ability to realize all of the anticipated cost savings or other benefits, or cause us not to realize such cost savings or other benefits on the expected timetable. if we are unable to realize the anticipated benefits, our ability to fund other initiatives may be adversely affected. finally, the complexity of the implementation will require a substantial amount of management and operational resources. our management team must successfully execute the administrative and operational changes necessary to achieve the anticipated benefits of the initiatives. these and related demands on our resources may divert the organization's attention from other business issues, have adverse effects on existing business relationships with suppliers and customers, and impact employee morale. any failure to implement these initiatives in accordance with our plans could adversely affect our business and financial results.
risks related to our industry our operations are subject to the general risks of the food industry.
the food industry is subject to risks posed by food spoilage and contamination, product tampering, product recall, and consumer product liability claims. our operations could be impacted by both genuine and fictitious claims regarding our products as well as our competitors' products. in the event of product contamination or tampering, we may need to recall some of our products. a widespread product recall could result in significant loss due to the cost of conducting a product recall, including destruction of inventory and the loss of sales resulting from the unavailability of product for a period of time. we could also suffer losses from a significant product liability judgment against us. a significant product recall or a product liability judgment, involving either us or our competitors, could also result in a loss of consumer confidence in our food products or the food category, and an actual or perceived loss of value of our brands, materially impacting consumer demand.
changes in our relationships with significant customers, including the loss of our largest customer, could adversely affect our results of operations.
sales to walmart inc. and subsidiaries amounted to 32 percent of net sales in 2021. these sales are primarily included in our u.s. retail market segments. trade receivables - net at april 30, 2021, included amounts due from walmart inc. and subsidiaries of $149.7 million, or 28 percent of the total trade receivables - net balance. during 2021, our top 10 customers, collectively, accounted for approximately 60 percent of consolidated net sales. we expect that a significant portion of our revenues will continue to be derived from a limited number of customers as the retail environment continues to consolidate. our customers are generally not contractually obligated to purchase from us. these customers make purchase decisions based on a combination of price, promotional support, product quality, consumer demand, customer service performance, their desired inventory levels, and other factors. changes in customers' strategies, including a reduction in the number of brands they carry or a shift of shelf space to private label products, may adversely affect sales and profitability. customers also may respond to price increases by reducing distribution, resulting in reduced sales of our products. additionally, our customers may face financial or other difficulties that may impact their operations and their purchases from us, which could adversely affect our results of operations. a reduction in sales to one or more major customers could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.
we operate in the competitive food industry and continued demand for our products may be affected by our failure to effectively compete or by changes in consumer preferences.
we face competition across our product lines from other food companies with the primary methods and factors in competition being product quality, price, packaging, product innovation, nutritional value, convenience, customer service, advertising, and promotion. continued success is dependent on product innovation, the ability to secure and maintain adequate retail shelf space and to compete in new and growing channels, and effective and sufficient trade merchandising, advertising, and marketing programs. in particular, technology-based systems, which give consumers the ability to shop through e-commerce websites and mobile commerce applications, are also significantly altering the retail landscape in many of our markets. we are committed to expanding our presence in e-commerce, transforming our manufacturing, commercial, and corporate operations through digital technologies, and enhancing our data analytics capabilities to develop new commercial insights. however, if we are unable to effectively compete in the expanding e-commerce market, adequately leverage technology to improve operating efficiencies, or develop the data analytics capabilities needed to generate actionable commercial insights, our business performance may be impacted, which may negatively impact our financial condition and results of operations.
some of our competitors have substantial financial, marketing, and other resources, and competition with them in our various markets, channels, and product lines could cause us to reduce prices, increase marketing or other expenditures, or lose category share. category share and growth could also be adversely impacted if we are not successful in introducing new products. introduction of new products and product extensions requires significant development and marketing investment. if our products fail to meet consumer preferences, or we fail to introduce new and improved products on a timely basis, then the return on that investment will be less than anticipated and our strategy to grow sales and profits through investment in innovation will be less successful. in order to generate future revenues and profits, we must continue to sell products that appeal to our customers and consumers. specifically, there are a number of trends in consumer preferences that may impact us and the food industry as a whole, including convenience, flavor variety, an emphasis on protein and snacking, and the desire for transparent product labeling and simple and natural ingredients.
we may be limited in our ability to pass cost increases on to our customers in the form of price increases or may realize a decrease in sales volume to the extent price increases are implemented.
we may not be able to pass some or all of any increases in the price of raw materials, energy, and other input costs to our customers by raising prices. to the extent competitors do not also increase their prices, customers and consumers may choose to purchase competing products or may shift purchases to private label or other lower-priced offerings, which may adversely affect our results of operations.
consumers may be less willing or able to pay a price differential for our branded products and may increasingly purchase lower-priced offerings and may forego some purchases altogether, especially during economic downturns. retailers may also increase levels of promotional activity for lower-priced offerings as they seek to maintain sales volumes during times of economic uncertainty. accordingly, sales volumes of our branded products could be reduced or lead to a shift in sales mix toward our lower-margin offerings. as a result, decreased demand for our products may adversely affect our results of operations.
our ability to competitively serve customers depends on the availability of reliable transportation. increases in logistics and other transportation-related costs could adversely impact our results of operations.
logistics and other transportation-related costs have a significant impact on our earnings and results of operations. we use multiple forms of transportation, including ships, trucks, and railcars, to bring our products to market. disruption to the timely supply of these services or increases in the cost of these services for any reason, including availability or cost of fuel, regulations affecting the industry, labor shortages in the transportation industry, service failures by third-party service providers, accidents, natural disasters, or a pandemic illness (such as covid-19), which may impact the transportation infrastructure or demand for transportation services, could have an adverse effect on our ability to serve our customers, and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.
we must leverage our brand value to compete against private label products.
in nearly all of our product categories, we compete against branded products as well as private label products. our products must provide higher value and/or quality to our consumers than alternatives, particularly during periods of economic uncertainty. consumers may not buy our products if relative differences in value and/or quality between our products and private label products change in favor of competitors' products or if consumers perceive this type of change. if consumers prefer private label products, which are typically sold at lower prices, then we could lose category share or sales volumes or shift our product mix to lower margin offerings, which could have a material effect on our business and consolidated financial position and on the consolidated results of our operations and profitability.
financial risks our results may be adversely impacted as a result of increased cost, limited availability, and/or insufficient quality of raw materials, including commodities and agricultural products.
we and our business partners purchase and use large quantities of many different commodities and agricultural products in the manufacturing of our products, including green coffee, peanuts, protein meals, oils and fats, grains, sweeteners, and fruit.
in addition, we and our business partners utilize significant quantities of plastic, glass, and cardboard to package our products and natural gas and fuel oil to manufacture, package, and distribute our products. the prices of these commodities, agricultural products, and other materials are subject to volatility and can fluctuate due to conditions that are difficult to predict, including global supply and demand, commodity market fluctuations, crop sizes and yield fluctuations, weather, natural disasters, pandemic illness (such as the covid-19 pandemic), foreign currency fluctuations, investor speculation, trade agreements, political unrest, consumer demand, and changes in governmental agricultural programs. in particular, the supply chain for protein meals, fats, and green coffee has been significantly disrupted by the covid-19 pandemic; therefore, the price for these commodities has increased and may continue to increase due to such disruptions. we also compete for certain raw materials, notably corn and soy-based agricultural products, with the biofuels industry, which has resulted in increased prices for these raw materials. additionally, farm acreage currently devoted to other agricultural products we purchase may be utilized for biofuels crops resulting in higher costs for the other agricultural products we utilize. although we use futures, options, basis, and fixed price contracts to manage commodity price volatility in some instances, commodity price increases ultimately result in corresponding increases in our raw material and energy costs.
due to the significance of green coffee to our coffee business, combined with our ability to only partially mitigate future price risk through purchasing practices and hedging activities, significant increases or decreases in the cost of green coffee could have an adverse impact on our profitability, as compared to that of our competitors. in addition, if we are not able to purchase sufficient quantities of green coffee due to any of the above factors or to a worldwide or regional shortage, we may not be able to fulfill the demand for our coffee, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.
our efforts to manage commodity, foreign currency exchange, and other price volatility through derivative instruments could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.
we use derivative instruments, including commodity futures and options, to reduce the price volatility associated with anticipated commodity purchases. the extent of our derivative position at any given time depends on our assessment of the markets for these commodities. if we fail to take a derivative position and costs subsequently increase, or if we institute a position and costs subsequently decrease, our costs may be greater than anticipated or higher than our competitors' costs and our financial results could be adversely affected. in addition, our liquidity may be adversely impacted by the cash margin requirements of the commodities exchanges or the failure of a counterparty to perform in accordance with a contract.
we currently do not qualify any of our commodity or foreign currency exchange derivatives for hedge accounting treatment. we instead mark-to-market our derivatives through the statement of consolidated income, which results in changes in the fair value of all of our derivatives being immediately recognized in consolidated earnings, resulting in potential volatility in both gross profit and net income. these gains and losses are reported in cost of products sold in our statement of consolidated income but are excluded from our segment operating results and non-gaap earnings until the related inventory is sold, at which time the gains and losses are reclassified to segment profit and non-gaap earnings. although this accounting treatment aligns the derivative gains and losses with the underlying exposure being hedged within segment results, it may result in volatility in our consolidated earnings.
weak financial performance, downgrades in our credit ratings, or disruptions in the financial markets may adversely affect our ability to access capital in the future.
we may need new or additional financing in the future to conduct our operations, expand our business, or refinance existing indebtedness, which would be dependent upon our financial performance. any downgrade in our credit ratings, particularly our short-term rating, would likely impact the amount of commercial paper we could issue and increase our commercial paper borrowing costs. the liquidity of the overall capital markets and the state of the economy, including the food and beverage industry, may make credit and capital markets more difficult for us to access, even though we have an established revolving credit facility. from time to time, we have relied, and also may rely in the future, on access to financial markets as a source of liquidity for working capital requirements, acquisitions, and general corporate purposes. in particular, our access to funds under our revolving credit facility is dependent on the ability of the financial institutions that are parties to that facility to meet their funding commitments. the obligations of the financial institutions under our revolving credit facility are several and not joint and, as a result, a funding default by one or more institutions does not need to be made up by the others. in addition, long-term volatility and disruptions in the capital and credit markets as a result of uncertainty, changing or increased regulation of financial institutions, reduced alternatives, or the failure of significant financial institutions could adversely affect our access to the liquidity needed for our businesses in the longer term. such disruptions could require us to take measures to conserve cash until the markets stabilize or until alternative credit arrangements or other funding for our business needs can be arranged. disruptions in the capital and credit markets could also result in higher interest rates on publicly issued debt securities and increased costs under credit facilities. continuation of these disruptions would increase our interest expense and capital costs and could adversely affect our results of operations and financial position. furthermore, as a result of covid-19, we may experience an increase in the cost of or the difficulty to obtain debt or equity financing, or to refinance our debt in the future, which could also affect our financial condition or our ability to fund operations or future investment opportunities.
our fixed- and variable-rate debt use the london interbank offered rate ("libor") as a benchmark for establishing interest rates, and we enter into interest rate swaps from time to time that contain a variable element based on libor. the financial conduct authority in the united kingdom has stated that it will not require banks to submit libor beyond calendar year 2021. once libor ceases to be available, we may need to amend affected agreements, and we cannot predict what alternative index will be negotiated with our counterparties. although we do not anticipate a significant impact to our financial position as a result of this transition given our current mix of fixed- and variable-rate debt, our interest expense could increase, and our available cash flow for general corporate requirements may be adversely affected.
our substantial debt obligations could restrict our operations and financial condition. additionally, our ability to generate cash to make payments on our indebtedness depends on many factors beyond our control.
as of april 30, 2021, we had $4.8 billion of short-term borrowings and long-term debt. we may also incur additional indebtedness in the future. our debt service obligations will require us to use a portion of our operating cash flow to pay interest and principal on indebtedness rather than for other corporate purposes, including funding future expansion of our business and ongoing capital expenditures, which could impede our growth. our substantial indebtedness could have other adverse consequences, including:
•making it more difficult for us to satisfy our financial obligations;
•increasing our vulnerability to adverse economic, regulatory, and industry conditions, and placing us at a disadvantage compared to our competitors that are less leveraged;
•limiting our ability to compete and our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industry in which we operate;
•limiting our ability to borrow additional funds for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, and general corporate or other purposes; and
•exposing us to greater interest rate risk, including the risk to variable borrowings of a rate increase and the risk to fixed borrowings of a rate decrease.
our ability to make payments on our indebtedness will depend on our ability to generate cash in the future. our ability to generate cash is subject to general economic, financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory, and other factors, many of which are beyond our control. our business may not generate sufficient cash flow from operations, and future borrowings may not be available to us in an amount sufficient to enable us to pay our indebtedness when scheduled payments are due or to fund other liquidity needs. in these circumstances, we may need to refinance all or a portion of our indebtedness on or before maturity. any refinancing of our debt could be at higher interest rates and may require make-whole payments and compliance with more onerous covenants, which could further restrict our business operations. our ability to refinance our indebtedness or obtain additional financing would depend on, among other things, our financial condition at the time, restriction in the agreements governing our indebtedness, and the condition of the financial markets and the industry in which we operate. as a result, we may not be able to refinance any of our indebtedness on commercially reasonable terms or at all. without this financing, we may have to seek additional equity or debt financing or restructure our debt, which could harm our long-term business prospects. our failure to comply with the terms of any existing or future indebtedness could result in an event of default which, if not cured or waived, could result in the acceleration of the payment of all of our debt.
a material impairment in the carrying value of acquired goodwill or other intangible assets could negatively affect our consolidated operating results and net worth.
a significant portion of our assets is composed of goodwill and other intangible assets, the majority of which are not amortized but are reviewed for impairment at least annually on february 1, and more often if indicators of impairment exist. at april 30, 2021, the carrying value of goodwill and other intangible assets totaled $12.1 billion, compared to total assets of $16.3 billion and total shareholders' equity of $8.1 billion. if the carrying value of these assets exceeds the current estimated fair value, the asset would be considered impaired, and this would result in a noncash charge to earnings, which could be material. events and conditions that could result in impairment include a sustained drop in the market price of our common shares, increased competition or loss of market share, obsolescence, product claims that result in a significant loss of sales or profitability over the product life, deterioration in macroeconomic conditions, or declining financial performance in comparison to projected results.
as of april 30, 2021, goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets totaled $6.0 billion and $2.9 billion, respectively. the carrying values of the goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets were $2.4 billion and $1.4 billion, respectively, within the u.s. retail pet foods segment, and $2.1 billion and $1.2 billion, respectively, within the u.s. retail coffee segment, which represent approximately 80 percent of the total goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets as of april 30, 2021. furthermore, the carrying values of the goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets within the u.s. retail pet foods segment are susceptible to future impairment charges due to narrow differences between fair value and carrying value, which is primarily attributable to the recognition of these assets at fair value resulting from recent impairment charges and the acquisition of ainsworth in 2019. to date, we have recognized $465.0 million of impairment charges related to the goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets acquired as part of the big heart pet brands ("big heart") acquisition in 2015, primarily as a result of reductions in our long-term net sales and profitability projections.
we do not believe that the pet foods reporting unit or any of the indefinite-lived assets within the u.s. retail pet foods segment are more likely than not impaired as of april 30, 2021. however, further changes to the assumptions regarding the future performance of the u.s. retail pet foods segment or its brands, an adverse change to macroeconomic conditions, or a change to other assumptions could result in additional impairment losses in the future, which could be significant. as of april 30, 2021, the estimated fair value was substantially in excess of the carrying value for the majority of the remaining reporting units and material indefinite-lived intangible assets, and in all such instances, the estimated fair value exceeded the carrying value by greater than 10 percent, with the exception of the rachael ray nutrish brand within the u.s. retail pet foods segment.
furthermore, we continue to evaluate the potential impact of covid-19 on the fair value of our goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets. while we concluded there were no indicators of impairment as of april 30, 2021, any significant sustained adverse change in consumer purchasing behaviors, government restrictions, financial results, or macroeconomic conditions could result in future impairment, specifically as it relates to the away from home reporting unit, which has experienced a significant decline in demand as a result of covid-19. for additional information, refer to note 7: goodwill and other intangible assets.
risks related to regulation and litigation we could be subject to adverse publicity or claims from consumers.
certain of our products contain ingredients which are the subject of public scrutiny, including the suggestion that consumption may have adverse health effects. although we strive to respond to consumer preferences and social expectations, we may not be successful in these efforts. an unfavorable report on the effects of ingredients present in our products, product recalls, or negative publicity or litigation could influence consumer preferences, significantly reduce the demand for our products, and adversely affect our profitability.
we may also be subject to complaints from or litigation by consumers who allege food and beverage-related illness, or other quality, health, or operational concerns. adverse publicity resulting from such allegations could materially adversely affect us, regardless of whether such allegations are true or whether we are ultimately held liable. a lawsuit or claim could result in an adverse decision against us, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.
changes in tax, environmental, or other regulations and laws, or their application, or failure to comply with existing licensing, trade, and other regulations and laws could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition.
we are subject to income and other taxes, primarily in the u.s. and canada, based upon the jurisdictions in which our sales and profits are determined to be earned and taxed. federal, state, and foreign statutory tax rates and taxing regimes have been subject to significant change and continue to evolve. our interpretation of current tax laws and their applicability to our business, as well as any changes to existing laws, can significantly impact our effective tax rate and deferred tax balances. in particular, recent proposals brought forth by the new u.s. presidential administration include increases to federal income tax rates that, if enacted, could have a material impact to our financial results. we are also subject to regular reviews, examinations, and audits by the internal revenue service ("irs") and other taxing authorities with respect to taxes within and outside of the u.s. although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable, the final outcome of tax controversies could result in material incremental tax liabilities, including interest and penalties. our effective tax rate is also influenced by the geography, timing, nature, and magnitude of transactions, such as acquisitions and divestitures, restructuring activities, and impairment charges.
our operations are subject to various regulations and laws, in addition to tax laws, administered by federal, state, and local government agencies in the u.s. as well as to regulations and laws administered by government agencies in canada and other countries in which we have operations and our products are sold. in particular, the manufacturing, marketing, packaging, labeling, distribution, and sale of food products are each subject to governmental regulation that is increasingly extensive, encompassing such matters as ingredients (including whether a product contains genetically modified ingredients), packaging, pricing, advertising, relations with distributors and retailers, health, safety, data privacy, and the environment. additionally, we are routinely subject to new or modified securities regulations, other laws and regulations, and accounting and reporting standards.
in the u.s., we are required to comply with federal laws, such as the food, drug and cosmetic act, the food safety modernization act, the occupational safety and health act, the clean air act, the clean water act, the resource conservation and recovery act, the tariff act, laws governing equal employment opportunity, and various other federal statutes and regulations. we are also subject to various state and local statutes and regulations, including the california safe drinking water and toxic enforcement act of 1986 (better known as "proposition 65"), which requires that a specific warning appear on any product sold in the state of california that contains a substance listed by that state as having been found to cause cancer or birth defects. proposition 65 exposes all food and beverage producers to the possibility of having to provide warnings on their products, as well as civil penalties.
we regularly move data across national and state borders to conduct our operations and, consequently, are subject to a variety of laws and regulations in the u.s. and other jurisdictions regarding privacy, data protection, and data security, including those related to the collection, storage, handling, use, disclosure, transfer, and security of personal data. there is significant uncertainty with respect to compliance with such privacy and data protection laws and regulations, because they are continuously evolving and developing and may be interpreted and applied differently from country to country and state to state and may create inconsistent or conflicting requirements.
complying with new regulations and laws, or changes to existing regulations and laws, or their application could increase our costs or adversely affect our sales of certain products. in addition, our failure or inability to comply with applicable regulations and laws could subject us to civil remedies, including fines, injunctions, recalls or seizures, and potential criminal sanctions, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition.
our operations in certain developing markets expose us to regulatory risks.
in many countries outside of the u.s., particularly in those with developing economies, it may be common for others to engage in business practices prohibited by laws and regulations applicable to us, such as the u.s. foreign corrupt practices act or similar local anti-bribery or anti-corruption laws. these laws generally prohibit companies and their employees, contractors, or agents from making improper payments to government officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. failure to comply with these laws could subject us to civil and criminal penalties that could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.
changes in climate or legal, regulatory, or market measures to address climate change may negatively affect our business and operations.
there is significant political and scientific concern that emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases may alter the composition of the global atmosphere in ways that are affecting and are expected to continue affecting the global climate. the emission of such greenhouse gases may have an adverse impact on global temperatures, weather patterns, and the frequency and severity of extreme weather and natural disasters. in the event that climate change has a negative effect on agricultural productivity, we may be subject to decreased availability or less favorable pricing for certain commodities that are necessary for our products, such as green coffee, peanuts, protein meals, oils and fats, grains, sweeteners, and fruit. we may also be subjected to decreased availability or less favorable pricing for water as a result of such change, which could impact our manufacturing and distribution operations. in addition, natural disasters and extreme weather conditions may disrupt the productivity of our facilities or the operation of our supply chain. specifically, due to unforeseen weather events in texas, oklahoma, and kansas during 2021, our pet manufacturing facilities in kansas were temporarily shut down. although we consider this to be an uncommon event, extreme weather could disrupt our production in the future, adversely affecting our ability to meet customer deadlines and supply demands.
increasing concern over climate change also may result in more regulatory requirements to reduce or mitigate the effects of greenhouse gases. in the event that such regulations are enacted and are more rigorous than existing regulations, we may experience significant increases in costs of operation and delivery. in particular, increased regulation of utility providers, fuel emissions, or suppliers could substantially increase our operating, distribution, or supply chain costs. we could also face increased costs related to defending and resolving legal claims and other litigation related to climate change. as a result, climate change could negatively affect our results of operations, cash flows, or financial position.
general risk factors we may be unable to grow market share of our products.
we operate in the competitive food industry whose growth potential is positively correlated to population growth. our success depends in part on our ability to grow our brands faster than the population in general. we consider our ability to build and sustain the equity of our brands critical to our market share growth. if we do not succeed in these efforts, our market share growth may slow, which could have a material impact on our results of operations.
if our information technology systems fail to perform adequately or we are unable to protect such information technology systems against data corruption, cyber-based attacks, or network security breaches, our operations could be disrupted, and we may suffer financial damage or loss because of lost or misappropriated information.
we rely on information technology networks and systems, including the internet, to process, transmit, and store electronic information, and the importance of such networks and systems has increased due to many of our employees working remotely as a result of the covid-19 pandemic. in particular, we depend on our information technology infrastructure to effectively manage our business data, supply chain, logistics, finance, and other business processes and for digital marketing activities and electronic communications between company personnel and our customers and suppliers. if we do not allocate and effectively manage the resources necessary to build, sustain, and protect an appropriate technology infrastructure, or we do not effectively implement system upgrades, our business or financial results could be negatively impacted. we are regularly the target of attempted cyber and other security threats. therefore, we continuously monitor and update our information technology networks and infrastructure to prevent, detect, address, and mitigate the risk of unauthorized access, misuse, computer viruses, and other events that could have a security impact. we invest in industry standard security technology to protect our data and business processes against the risk of data security breaches and cyber-based attacks. we believe our security technology tools and processes provide adequate measures of protection against security breaches and in reducing cybersecurity risks. nevertheless, despite continued vigilance in these areas, security breaches or system failures of our infrastructure, whether due to attacks by hackers, employee error, or other causes, can create system disruptions, shutdowns, transaction errors, or unauthorized disclosure of confidential information. if we are unable to prevent such breaches or failures, our operations could be disrupted, or we may suffer financial damage or loss because of lost or misappropriated information. in addition, the cost to remediate any damages to our information technology systems suffered as a result of a cyber-based attack could be significant.
further, we have outsourced several information technology support services and administrative functions, including benefit plan administration and other functions, to third-party service providers, and may outsource other functions in the future to achieve cost savings and efficiencies. in addition, certain of our processes rely on third-party cloud computing services. if the service providers to which we outsource these functions do not perform effectively, we may not be able to achieve the expected benefits and may have to incur additional costs to correct errors made by such service providers. depending on the function involved, such errors may also lead to business disruption, processing inefficiencies, inaccurate financial reporting, the loss of or damage to intellectual property through security breach, the loss of sensitive data through security breach, or otherwise.

(dollars and shares in millions, unless otherwise noted, except per share data)
company background inspired by more than 120 years of business success and five generations of family leadership, the j. m. smucker company makes food that people and pets love. the company's portfolio of 40+ brands, which are found in nearly 90 percent of u.s. homes and countless away from home dining locations, include iconic products consumers have always loved such as folgers, jif, and milk-bone, plus new favorites like café bustelo, smucker's uncrustables, and rachael ray nutrish. over the past two decades, the company has grown by thoughtfully acquiring leading and emerging brands, while ensuring the business has a positive impact on its 7,000+ employees, the communities it is a part of, and the planet.
we have three reportable segments: u.s. retail pet foods, u.s. retail coffee, and u.s. retail consumer foods. effective during the first quarter of 2021, the presentation of international and away from home represents a combination of all other operating segments that are not individually reportable. as a result of leadership changes, these operating segments are being managed and reported separately and no longer represent a reportable segment for segment reporting purposes. segment results for prior periods have not been modified, as the combination of these operating segments represents the previously reported international and away from home reportable segment.
the u.s. retail market segments in total comprised 88 percent of net sales in 2021 and represent a major portion of our strategic focus - the sale of branded food and beverage products with leadership positions to consumers through retail outlets in north america. in the u.s. retail market segments, our products are sold primarily to food retailers, club stores, discount and dollar stores, food wholesalers, online retailers, pet specialty stores, natural foods stores and distributors, drug stores, military commissaries, and mass merchandisers. international and away from home includes the sale of products distributed domestically and in foreign countries through retail channels and foodservice distributors and operators (e.g., health care operators, restaurants, lodging, hospitality, offices, k-12, colleges and universities, and convenience stores).
strategic overview we remain rooted in our basic beliefs of quality, people, ethics, growth, and independence established by our founder and namesake, jerome smucker, more than a century ago. today, these basic beliefs are the core of our unique corporate culture and serve as a foundation for decision-making and actions. we have been led by five generations of family leadership, having had only six chief executive officers in 124 years. this continuity of management and thought extends to the broader leadership team that embodies the values and embraces the business practices that have contributed to our consistent growth. our strategic vision is to own and market a portfolio of food and beverage brands that combines number one and leading brands with emerging, on-trend brands to drive balanced, long-term growth, primarily in north america.
our strategic growth objectives include increasing net sales by 2 percent and operating income excluding non-gaap adjustments ("adjusted operating income") by 5 percent on average over the long term. related to income per diluted share excluding non-gaap adjustments ("adjusted earnings per share"), our strategic growth objective is to achieve an average increase of 8 percent over the long term. we expect organic growth, including new products, to drive much of our top-line growth, while the contribution from acquisitions will vary from year to year. our non-gaap adjustments include amortization expense and impairment charges related to intangible assets; divestiture, acquisition, integration, and restructuring costs ("special project costs"); gains and losses related to the sale of a business; unallocated gains and losses on commodity and foreign currency exchange derivative activities ("unallocated derivative gains and losses"); and other one-time items that do not directly reflect ongoing operating results. refer to "non-gaap financial measures" in this discussion and analysis for additional information. due to the unknown and potentially prolonged impact of covid-19, we may experience difficulties or be delayed in achieving our long-term strategies; however, we continue to evaluate the effects from covid-19 on our long-term growth objectives.
net sales has increased at a compound annual growth rate of 1 percent over the past five years, while adjusted operating income and adjusted earnings per share have increased at a rate of 1 percent and 4 percent, respectively, over the same period. these increases were driven by increased at-home consumption for the u.s. retail coffee and u.s. retail consumer foods segments and the ainsworth acquisition in 2019, partially offset by the reduction in net sales from the divestitures of the crisco and natural balance businesses in 2021 and the u.s. baking business in 2019. net cash provided by operating activities has increased at a compound annual growth rate of 1 percent over the past five years. our cash deployment strategy is to balance reinvesting in our business through acquisitions and capital expenditures with returning cash to our shareholders through the payment of dividends and share repurchases. our deployment strategy also includes a significant focus on debt repayment.
on december 1, 2020, we sold the crisco oils and shortening business to b&g foods. the transaction included oils and shortening products sold under the crisco brand, primarily in the u.s. and canada, certain trademarks and licensing agreements, dedicated manufacturing and warehouse facilities located in cincinnati, ohio, and approximately 160 employees who supported the crisco business. under our ownership, the business generated net sales of $198.9 and $269.2 in 2021 and 2020, respectively, primarily included in the u.s. retail consumer foods segment. we received net proceeds from the divestiture of $530.2, which were net of cash transaction costs and included a working capital adjustment. upon completion of the transaction, we recognized a pre-tax gain of $114.8 during 2021, which is included in other operating expense (income) - net within the statement of consolidated income.
on january 29, 2021, we sold the natural balance premium pet food business to nexus. the transaction included pet food products sold under the natural balance brand, certain trademarks and licensing agreements, and select employees who supported the natural balance business. under our ownership, the business generated net sales of $156.7 and $222.8 in 2021 and 2020, respectively, included in the u.s. retail pet foods segment. we received net proceeds from the divestiture of $33.8, which were net of cash transaction costs and included a working capital adjustment. upon completion of the transaction, we recognized a pre-tax loss of $89.5 during 2021, which is included in other operating expense (income) - net within the statement of consolidated income.
covid-19
the spread of covid-19 throughout the united states and the international community has had, and will continue to have, an impact on financial markets, economic conditions, and portions of our business and industry.
during 2021, state governments reopened their economies, while adhering to new guidelines and enhanced safety measures, such as social distancing and face mask protocols. while there has been a general downward trend in u.s. cases in calendar year 2021, consumers continue to stay at home more frequently as a precaution, and as a result, at-home food consumption and demand remains elevated. we anticipate these changes in consumer behavior to continue into 2022, dependent upon continued vaccine availability and effectiveness, as well as the impact of additional strains of the virus.
we commenced a phased approach to reopen our corporate headquarters in orrville, ohio, with increased safety protocols. however, occupancy levels remain low as the majority of our office-based employees continue to work remotely where possible, and we continue to monitor the latest public health and government guidance related to covid-19. we have crisis management teams at all of our facilities, which are monitoring the evolving situation and implementing risk mitigation actions as necessary. to date, there has been minimal disruption in our supply chain network, including the supply of our ingredients, packaging, or other sourced materials, although it is possible that more significant disruptions could occur if the covid-19 pandemic continues to impact markets around the world, including the impact of e-commerce pressures on freight charges and potential shipping delays due to supply and demand imbalances. we also continue to work closely with our customers and external business partners, taking additional actions to ensure safety and business continuity and maximize product availability. we have increased production at all of our facilities and expanded the availability of appointments at distribution centers. all of our production operations remain open, and none have experienced significant disruptions or labor reductions related to covid-19. furthermore, we have implemented measures to manage order volumes to ensure a consistent supply across our retail partners during this period of high demand.
during 2021, we continued to experience an increase in orders, primarily across our u.s. retail coffee and u.s. retail consumer foods segments, in response to the increased consumer demand for our products related to the elevated at-home consumption. it is anticipated that the increase in consumer demand will continue, to a lesser extent, through the beginning of 2022. a decline in products sold in away from home channels has also been experienced as a result of covid-19, which has negatively impacted our net sales in our away from home operating segment, and we expect covid-19 will continue to adversely affect our net sales while government-mandated safety measures are in place and consumers continue to stay at home as a precaution. however, as states have reopened their economies during 2021, our net sales for the away from home channels improved compared to the initial months of the pandemic. this trend could reverse during 2022 if cases rise and governments impose additional safety measures that further impact away from home consumption, which is partially dependent upon continued vaccine availability and effectiveness. overall, the impact of covid-19 remains uncertain and ultimately depends on the length and severity of the pandemic, inclusive of the introduction of new strains of the virus; the federal, state, and local government actions taken in response; continued vaccine availability and effectiveness; and the macroeconomic environment. we will continue to evaluate the nature and extent to which covid-19 will impact our business, supply chain, consolidated results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity.

(a)net sales excluding divestitures and foreign currency exchange is a non-gaap financial measure used to evaluate performance internally. this measure provides useful information to investors because it enables comparison of results on a year-over-year basis.
net sales in 2021 increased $201.7, or 3 percent, which includes $166.0 of noncomparable net sales in the prior year related to the crisco and natural balance divestitures. net sales excluding divestitures and foreign currency exchange increased $360.0, or 5 percent, driven by favorable volume/mix across all of our retail businesses, supported by increased at-home consumption for the u.s. retail coffee and u.s. retail consumer foods segments. the retail business growth was partially offset by unfavorable volume/mix for the away from home operating segment.

operating income increased $163.7, or 13 percent, primarily reflecting the increase in gross profit, a $52.4 intangible asset impairment charge in the prior year, and a $25.3 net pre-tax gain related to the divestitures of the crisco and natural balance businesses, partially offset by a $48.8 increase in selling, distribution, and administrative ("sd&a") expenses.
our non-gaap adjustments include amortization expense and impairment charges related to intangible assets; special project costs; gains and losses related to the sale of a business; unallocated derivative gains and losses; and other one-time items that do not directly reflect ongoing operating results. refer to "non-gaap financial measures" in this discussion and analysis for additional information. gross profit excluding non-gaap adjustments ("adjusted gross profit") increased $66.1, or 2 percent, in 2021, reflecting the exclusion of unallocated derivative gains, as compared to gaap gross profit. adjusted operating income increased $20.1, or 1 percent, as compared to the prior year, further reflecting the exclusion of impairment charges and the net pre-tax gain on divestitures.
interest expense net interest expense decreased $12.1, or 6 percent, in 2021, primarily as a result of reduced debt outstanding as compared to the prior year. for additional information, see "capital resources" in this discussion and analysis.
other income (expense) - net net other expense increased $30.6 in 2021, primarily reflecting pension settlement charges of $35.5, which includes the aggregate $29.6 pre-tax settlement charges recognized during 2021 related to the purchase of a group annuity contract to transfer our canadian defined benefit pension plan obligations to an insurance company. for further information, refer to note 9: pensions and other postretirement benefits.
income taxes income taxes increased $48.4, or 20 percent, in 2021, as compared to the prior year. the effective tax rate of 25.2 percent for 2021 varied from the u.s. statutory tax rate of 21.0 percent primarily due to the impact of state income taxes, as well as additional net income tax expense related to the divestitures of the crisco and natural balance businesses during the third quarter of 2021. the effective tax rate of 24.1 percent for 2020 varied from the u.s. statutory tax rate of 21.0 percent primarily due to the impact of state income taxes. we anticipate a full-year effective tax rate for 2022 to be approximately 24.0 percent. for additional information, refer to note 14: income taxes.
restructuring activities a restructuring program was approved by the board during the third quarter of 2021 associated with opportunities identified to reduce our overall cost structure and optimize our organizational design, inclusive of stranded overhead associated with recent divestitures of the crisco and natural balance businesses. for additional information related to these divestitures, see note 4: divestitures. during the fourth quarter of 2021, we substantially completed an organizational redesign related to our corporate headquarters and announced plans to close our suffolk, virginia, production facility by the end of 2022, as a result of a new strategic partnership for the production of our away from home liquid coffee. while the entire scope of the program cannot be quantified at this time, we expect to incur approximately $85.0 in costs associated with the restructuring activities approved to date. approximately half of these costs are expected to be accelerated depreciation and other transition and termination costs associated with our cost reduction and margin management initiatives, while the remainder represents employee-related costs. we anticipate the activities associated with this restructuring program will be completed by the end of 2023, with over half of the costs expected to be incurred by the end of 2022. we have incurred total cumulative restructuring costs of $24.1, which were all incurred during the second half of 2021. for further information, refer to note 3: integration and restructuring costs.
commodities overview the raw materials we use in each of our segments are primarily commodities, agricultural-based products, and packaging materials. the most significant of these materials, based on 2021 annual spend, are green coffee, peanuts, protein meals, oils and fats, and plastic containers. green coffee, corn, certain meals, oils, and grains are traded on active regulated exchanges, and the price of these commodities fluctuates based on market conditions. derivative instruments, including futures and options, are used to minimize the impact of price volatility for these commodities.
we source green coffee from more than 20 coffee-producing countries. its price is subject to high volatility due to factors such as weather, global supply and demand, plant disease, investor speculation, and political and economic conditions in the source countries.
we source peanuts, protein meals, and oils and fats mainly from north america. we are one of the largest procurers of peanuts in the u.s. and frequently enter into long-term purchase contracts for various periods of time to mitigate the risk of a shortage of this commodity. the oils we purchase are mainly peanut and soybean. the price of peanuts, protein meals, and oils are driven primarily by weather, which impacts crop sizes and yield, as well as global demand, especially from large importing countries such as china and india. in particular, the supply chain for protein meals, fats, and green coffee has been significantly disrupted by the covid-19 pandemic, and therefore, the price for these commodities has increased and may continue to increase due to such disruptions. furthermore, the price of peanuts has been impacted by the recent decrease in crop supply.
we frequently enter into long-term contracts to purchase plastic containers, which are sourced mainly from within the u.s. plastic resin is made from petrochemical feedstock and natural gas feedstock, and the price can be influenced by feedstock, energy, and crude oil prices as well as global economic conditions.
excluding the impact of derivative gains and losses, our overall commodity costs in 2021 were higher than in 2020, primarily due to higher costs for green coffee and peanuts.
segment results we have three reportable segments: u.s. retail pet foods, u.s. retail coffee, and u.s. retail consumer foods. effective during the first quarter of 2021, the presentation of international and away from home represents a combination of all other operating segments that are not individually reportable. as a result of leadership changes, these operating segments are being managed and reported separately and no longer represent a reportable segment for segment reporting purposes. segment results for prior periods have not been modified, as the combination of these operating segments represents the previously reported international and away from home reportable segment.
the u.s. retail pet foods segment primarily includes domestic sales of rachael ray nutrish, meow mix, milk-bone, 9lives, kibbles 'n bits, pup-peroni, and nature's recipe branded products; the u.s. retail coffee segment primarily includes the domestic sales of folgers, dunkin', and café bustelo branded coffee; and the u.s. retail consumer foods segment primarily includes domestic sales of smucker's and jif branded products. international and away from home includes the sale of products distributed domestically and in foreign countries through retail channels and foodservice distributors and operators (e.g., health care operators, restaurants, lodging, hospitality, offices, k-12, colleges and universities, and convenience stores).

u.s. retail pet foods the u.s. retail pet foods segment net sales decreased $25.0 in 2021, inclusive of the impact of $53.6 of noncomparable net sales in the prior year related to the divested natural balance business. excluding the noncomparable impact of the divested business, net sales increased $28.6, or 1 percent, primarily due to favorable volume/mix, partially offset by lower net price realization. the favorable volume/mix contributed 2 percentage points to net sales, primarily reflecting growth for dog snacks and cat food, driven by milk-bone and pup-peroni dog snacks, as well as 9lives and meow mix cat food, partially offset by declines for dog food, driven by nature's recipe and kibbles 'n bits. lower net price realization reduced net sales by 1 percentage point, primarily reflecting increased trade spend. segment profit decreased $65.7, driven by lower net pricing, increased marketing expense, and a recovery in the prior year from a legal settlement related to a supplier issue.
u.s. retail coffee the u.s. retail coffee segment net sales increased $225.1 in 2021, reflecting favorable volume/mix, which contributed 11 percentage points to net sales, related to growth for the dunkin', café bustelo, and folgers brands. the favorable volume/mix primarily reflects elevated at-home coffee consumption. net price realization reduced net sales by 1 percentage point. segment profit increased $78.1, primarily due to the favorable volume/mix, partially offset by increased marketing expense.
u.s. retail consumer foods the u.s. retail consumer foods segment net sales increased $104.0 in 2021, inclusive of the impact of $101.2 of noncomparable net sales in the prior year related to the divested crisco business. excluding the noncomparable impact of the divested business, net sales increased $205.2, or 13 percent, primarily due to favorable volume/mix, which contributed 8 percentage points to net sales, reflecting growth for the smucker's brand, inclusive of uncrustables frozen sandwiches and fruit spreads, and jif peanut butter. the favorable volume/mix primarily reflects elevated at-home consumption and continued growth of our uncrustables brand. higher net pricing increased net sales by 4 percentage points, primarily driven by the impact of a peanut butter list price increase taken on the jif brand during the second quarter of 2021. segment profit increased $82.8, reflecting the favorable impact of higher net pricing, the increased contribution from volume/mix, and the lapping of a write-off of equipment related to the discontinuation of jif power ups® during the prior year, partially offset by the noncomparable segment profit in the prior year related to the divested crisco business and increased marketing expense.
international and away from home international and away from home net sales decreased $102.4 in 2021, including the noncomparable impact of $11.2 of net sales in the prior year related to the divested crisco business. excluding the noncomparable impact of the divested business, net sales decreased $91.2, primarily reflecting a 21 percent decline for the away from home operating segment, partially offset by net sales growth of 4 percent for the international operating segment. unfavorable volume/mix for the combined businesses reduced net sales by 10 percentage points, primarily driven by coffee, portion control, and sweetener products in away from home channels. these declines were partially offset by gains for uncrustables frozen sandwiches in away from home channels and dog snacks and cat food in the international operating segment. foreign currency exchange had a $7.7 favorable impact on net sales. segment profit decreased $49.3, primarily reflecting the unfavorable volume/mix and higher input costs, partially offset by lower sd&a expenses.
liquidity and capital resources liquidity our principal source of funds is cash generated from operations, supplemented by borrowings against our commercial paper program and revolving credit facility. total cash and cash equivalents decreased to $334.3 at april 30, 2021, compared to $391.1 at april 30, 2020.
the following table presents selected cash flow information.

(a)free cash flow is a non-gaap financial measure used by management to evaluate the amount of cash available for debt repayment, dividend distribution, acquisition opportunities, share repurchases, and other corporate purposes.
the $310.2 increase in cash provided by operating activities in 2021 was primarily driven by a favorable benefit from lapping the settlement of interest rate contracts for $239.8 during 2020. in addition, net income adjusted for noncash items was higher in the current year. the cash required to fund working capital decreased compared to the prior year, primarily related to lower payments for accounts payable driven by working capital initiatives, inclusive of a supplier financing program entered into during the second half of 2020, and an increase in cash from trade receivables due to the timing of sales and payments, which was mostly offset by increased inventory levels reflecting the lapping of increased consumer demand in the fourth quarter of 2020.
cash provided by investing activities in 2021 primarily consisted of net proceeds from the divestitures of the crisco and natural balance businesses of $564.0 and a decrease of $54.0 in our derivative cash margin account balances, partially offset by $306.7 in capital expenditures. cash used for investing activities in 2020 primarily consisted of $269.3 in capital expenditures.
cash used for financing activities in 2021 consisted primarily of long-term debt repayments of $700.0, purchase of treasury shares of $678.4, dividend payments of $403.2, and a net decrease in short-term borrowings of $166.4. cash used for financing activities in 2020 consisted primarily of long-term debt repayments of $900.0, dividend payments of $396.8, and a $185.8 net decrease in short-term borrowings, partially offset by $798.2 in long-term debt proceeds.
supplier financing program as part of ongoing efforts to maximize working capital, we work with our suppliers to optimize our terms and conditions, which includes the extension of payment terms. payment terms with our suppliers, which we deem to be commercially reasonable, generally range from 0 to 120 days. during the second half of 2020, we entered into an agreement with a third-party administrator to provide an accounts payable tracking system and facilitate a supplier financing program which allows participating suppliers the ability to monitor and voluntarily elect to sell our payment obligations to a designated third-party financial institution. participating suppliers can sell one or more of our payment obligations at their sole discretion, and our rights and obligations to our suppliers are not impacted. we have no economic interest in a supplier's decision to enter into these agreements. our obligations to our suppliers, including amounts due and scheduled payment terms, are not impacted by our suppliers' decisions to sell amounts under these arrangements. as of april 30, 2021 and 2020, $304.2 and $157.5 of our outstanding payment obligations, respectively, were elected and sold to a financial institution by participating suppliers. during 2021 and 2020, we paid $663.5 and $31.8, respectively, to a financial institution for payment obligations that were settled through the supplier financing program.
contingencies we, like other food manufacturers, are from time to time subject to various administrative, regulatory, and other legal proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business. we are currently a defendant in a variety of such legal proceedings, including certain lawsuits related to the alleged price-fixing of shelf stable tuna products prior to 2011 by a business previously owned by, but divested prior to our acquisition of, big heart, the significant majority of which were settled and paid during 2019 and 2020. while we cannot predict with certainty the ultimate results of the remaining proceedings or potential settlements associated with these or other matters, we have accrued losses for certain contingent liabilities that we have determined are probable and reasonably estimable at april 30, 2021. based on the information known to date, with the exception of the matters discussed below, we do not believe the final outcome of these proceedings would have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.
in addition to the legal proceedings discussed above, we are currently a defendant in council for education and research on toxics ("cert") v. brad barry llc, et al., which alleges that we, in addition to nearly eighty other defendants (collectively the "defendants") who manufacture, package, distribute, or sell packaged coffee, failed to provide warnings for our coffee products of exposure to the chemical acrylamide as required under proposition 65. cert sought equitable relief, including warnings to consumers, as well as civil penalties in the amount of the statutory maximum of $2,500 per day per violation of proposition 65. in addition, cert asserted that every consumed cup of coffee, absent a compliant warning, was equivalent to a violation under proposition 65. in june 2019, the state agency responsible for administering the proposition 65 program, the california office of environmental health hazard assessment ("oehha"), approved a regulation clarifying that cancer warnings are not required for coffee under proposition 65, and in august 2020, the trial court granted the defendants' motion for summary judgment based on the regulation. cert appealed the ruling in november 2020 to the california court of appeals for the second appellate district, which is currently pending.
we are also defendants in nine pending putative class action lawsuits filed in federal courts in california, florida, illinois, missouri, texas, washington, and washington d.c. the plaintiffs in those actions assert claims arising under various state laws for false advertising, consumer protection, deceptive and unfair trade practices, and similar statutes. their claims are premised on allegations that we have misrepresented the number of servings that can be made from various canisters of folgers coffee on the packaging for those products. five of the lawsuits have been transferred to the united states district court for the western district of missouri for coordinated pre-trial proceedings. similar claims have been asserted against certain retailers of our folgers coffee products, and indemnity claims have been asserted by such retailers against us. various other potential plaintiffs have threatened to assert similar claims against us.
the outcome and the financial impact of these cases, if any, cannot be predicted at this time. accordingly, no loss contingency has been recorded for these matters as of april 30, 2021, and the likelihood of loss is not considered probable or estimable. however, if we are required to pay significant damages, our business and financial results could be adversely impacted, and sales of those products could suffer not only in these locations but elsewhere. for additional information, see note 16: contingencies.

during the third quarter of 2021, we prepaid, in full, the remaining outstanding balance of the $1.5 billion term loan credit agreement ("term loan") that was entered into in april 2018 to partially finance the ainsworth acquisition, as discussed in note 2: acquisition. during 2021 and 2020, we prepaid $700.0 and $100.0 on the term loan, respectively.
we have available a $1.8 billion unsecured revolving credit facility with a group of 11 banks that matures in september 2022. additionally, we participate in a commercial paper program under which we can issue short-term, unsecured commercial paper not to exceed $1.8 billion at any time. the commercial paper program is backed by our revolving credit facility and reduces what we can borrow under the revolving credit facility by the amount of commercial paper outstanding. commercial paper will be used as a continuing source of short-term financing for general corporate purposes. as of april 30, 2021, we had $82.0 of short-term borrowings outstanding, all of which were issued under our commercial paper program, at a weighted-average interest rate of 0.17 percent.
we are in compliance with all of our debt covenants. for additional information on our long-term debt, sources of liquidity, and debt covenants, see note 8: debt and financing arrangements.
on october 22, 2020, the board authorized the repurchase of up to 5.0 million common shares, in addition to the 3.6 million common shares that remained available for repurchase pursuant to prior authorizations of the board, for a total of 8.6 million common shares available for repurchase. under the repurchase program, a total of 5.8 million common shares were repurchased for $671.9 during 2021. included in the total repurchases during the third quarter of 2021 were 2.0 million common shares repurchased under a 10b5-1 plan entered into on december 30, 2020. at april 30, 2021, approximately 2.8 million common shares remain available for repurchase pursuant to the board's authorizations. we did not repurchase any common shares under a repurchase plan authorized by the board during 2020.
the following table presents certain cash requirements related to 2022 investing and financing activities based on our current expectations.
projection year ending april 30, 2022
principal payments - excludes the impact of potential debt refinancing              $1,150.0
dividend payments - based on current rates and common shares outstanding               390.0
capital expenditures                                                                   380.0
interest payments                                                                      153.4
absent any material acquisitions or other significant investments, we believe that cash on hand, combined with cash provided by operations, borrowings available under our commercial paper program and revolving credit facility, and access to capital markets, will be sufficient to meet our cash requirements for the next 12 months, including the payment of quarterly dividends, principal and interest payments on debt outstanding, and capital expenditures. however, as a result of covid-19, we may experience an increase in the cost or the difficulty to obtain debt or equity financing, or to refinance our debt in the future, which could affect our financial condition or our ability to fund operations or future investment opportunities.
during 2021, we returned $100.0 of foreign cash to the u.s. from canada. the repatriation was subject to $5.0 of foreign withholding taxes, while u.s. federal and state income taxes were not significant. as of april 30, 2021, we have re-evaluated our global cash needs and determined that a portion of our undistributed earnings, primarily in canada, are no longer permanently reinvested, resulting in the recognition of an immaterial deferred tax liability.
non-gaap financial measures we use non-gaap financial measures including: net sales excluding divestitures and foreign currency exchange; adjusted gross profit; adjusted operating income; adjusted income; adjusted earnings per share; earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization, and impairment charges related to intangible assets ("ebitda (as adjusted)"); and free cash flow, as key measures for purposes of evaluating performance internally. we believe that investors' understanding of our performance is enhanced by disclosing these performance measures. furthermore, these non-gaap financial measures are used by management in preparation of the annual budget and for the monthly analyses of our operating results. the board also utilizes certain non-gaap financial measures as components for measuring performance for incentive compensation purposes.
non-gaap financial measures exclude certain items affecting comparability that can significantly affect the year-over-year assessment of operating results, which include amortization expense and impairment charges related to intangible assets; special project costs; gains and losses related to the sale of a business; unallocated derivative gains and losses; and other one-time items that do not directly reflect ongoing operating results. additionally, income taxes, as adjusted is calculated using an adjusted effective income tax rate that is applied to adjusted income before income taxes and reflects the exclusion of the previously discussed items, as well as any adjustments for one-time tax related activities, when they occur. while this adjusted effective income tax rate does not generally differ materially from our gaap effective tax rate, certain exclusions from non-gaap results, such as the permanent tax impacts associated with the crisco and natural balance divestitures, can significantly impact our adjusted effective income tax rate.
these non-gaap financial measures are not intended to replace the presentation of financial results in accordance with u.s. gaap. rather, the presentation of these non-gaap financial measures supplements other metrics we use to internally evaluate our businesses and facilitate the comparison of past and present operations and liquidity. these non-gaap financial measures may not be comparable to similar measures used by other companies and may exclude certain nondiscretionary expenses and cash payments.
the following table reconciles certain non-gaap financial measures to the comparable gaap financial measure. see page 23 for a reconciliation of net sales adjusted for certain noncomparable items to the comparable gaap financial measure.

off-balance sheet arrangements we do not have material off-balance sheet arrangements, financings, or other relationships with unconsolidated entities or other persons, also known as variable interest entities. transactions with related parties are in the ordinary course of business and are not material to our results of operations, financial condition, or cash flows.

(a)long-term debt obligations, including current portion, excludes the impact of offering discounts, make-whole payments, and debt issuance costs.
(b)interest payments consists of the interest payments for our fixed-rate senior notes.
(c)operating lease obligations consists of the minimum rental commitments under non-cancelable operating leases.
(d)purchase obligations includes agreements that are enforceable and legally bind us to purchase goods or services, which primarily consist of obligations related to normal, ongoing purchase obligations in which we have guaranteed payment to ensure availability of raw materials. we expect to receive consideration for these purchase obligations in the form of materials and services. these purchase obligations do not represent all future purchases expected, but represent only those items for which we are contractually obligated. amounts included in the table above represent our current best estimate of payments due. actual cash payments may vary due to the variable pricing components of certain purchase obligations.
(e)other liabilities consists primarily of projected commitments associated with our defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans, as well as $4.5 related to financing lease obligations. the liability for unrecognized tax benefits and tax-related net interest of $11.9 under the financial accounting standards board ("fasb") accounting standards codification ("asc") 740, income taxes, is excluded, since we are unable to reasonably estimate the timing of cash settlements with the respective taxing authorities.
critical accounting estimates and policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with u.s. gaap requires that we make estimates and assumptions that in certain circumstances affect amounts reported in the accompanying consolidated financial statements. in preparing these financial statements, we have made our best estimates and judgments of certain amounts included in the financial statements, giving due consideration to materiality. we do not believe there is a great likelihood that materially different amounts would be reported under different conditions or using different assumptions related to the accounting policies described below. however, application of these accounting policies involves the exercise of judgment and use of assumptions as to future uncertainties and, as a result, actual results could differ from these estimates.
trade marketing and merchandising programs: in order to support our products, various promotional activities are conducted through retail, distributors, or directly with consumers, including in-store display and product placement programs, price discounts, coupons, and other similar activities. the costs of these programs are classified as a reduction of sales. we regularly review and revise, when we deem necessary, estimates of costs for these promotional programs based on estimates of what will be redeemed by retail, distributors, or consumers. these estimates are made using various techniques, including historical data on performance of similar promotional programs. differences between estimated expenditures and actual performance are recognized as a change in estimate in a subsequent period. during 2021, 2020, and 2019, subsequent period adjustments were less than 2 percent of both consolidated pre-tax income and cash provided by operating activities. these promotional expenditures, including amounts classified as a reduction of sales, represented 39 percent of net sales in 2021.
income taxes: we account for income taxes using the liability method. in the ordinary course of business, we are exposed to uncertainties related to tax filing positions and periodically assess the technical merits of these tax positions for all tax years that remain subject to examination, based upon the latest information available. for material uncertain tax positions, we have recognized a liability for unrecognized tax benefits, including any applicable interest and penalty charges.
we routinely evaluate the likelihood of realizing the benefit of our deferred tax assets and may record a valuation allowance if, based on all available evidence, we determine that it is more likely than not that all or some portion of such assets will not be realized. valuation allowances related to deferred tax assets can be affected by changes in tax laws, statutory tax rates, and projected future taxable income levels. changes in estimated realization of deferred tax assets would result in an adjustment to income in the period in which that determination is made, unless such changes are determined to be an adjustment to goodwill within the allowable measurement period under the acquisition method of accounting.
the future tax benefit arising from the net deductible temporary differences and tax carryforwards was $229.6 and $244.8 at april 30, 2021 and 2020, respectively. in evaluating our ability to recover our deferred tax assets within the jurisdiction from which they arise, we consider all available positive and negative evidence, including scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income, tax planning strategies, and results of operations. for those jurisdictions where the expiration date of tax carryforwards or the projected operating results indicate that realization is not likely, a valuation allowance would have been provided.
as of april 30, 2021, the company has re-evaluated its global cash needs and determined that a portion of the undistributed foreign earnings, primarily in canada, are no longer permanently reinvested.
goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets: a significant portion of our assets is composed of goodwill and other intangible assets, the majority of which are not amortized but are reviewed for impairment at least annually on february 1, and more often if indicators of impairment exist. at april 30, 2021, the carrying value of goodwill and other intangible assets totaled $12.1 billion, compared to total assets of $16.3 billion and total shareholders' equity of $8.1 billion. if the carrying value of these assets exceeds the current estimated fair value, the asset is considered impaired, and this would result in a noncash charge to earnings. any such impairment charge would reduce earnings and could be material. events and conditions that could result in impairment include a sustained drop in the market price of our common shares, increased competition or loss of market share, obsolescence, product claims that result in a significant loss of sales or profitability over the product life, deterioration in macroeconomic conditions, or declining financial performance in comparison to projected results.
to test for goodwill impairment, we estimate the fair value of each of our reporting units using both a discounted cash flow valuation technique and a market-based approach. the impairment test incorporates estimates of future cash flows; allocations of certain assets, liabilities, and cash flows among reporting units; future growth rates; terminal value amounts; and the applicable weighted-average cost of capital used to discount those estimated cash flows. the estimates and projections used in the calculation of fair value are consistent with our current and long-range plans, including anticipated changes in market conditions, industry trends, growth rates, and planned capital expenditures. changes in forecasted operations and other estimates and assumptions could impact the assessment of impairment in the future.
at april 30, 2021, goodwill totaled $6.0 billion. goodwill is substantially concentrated within the u.s. retail pet foods, u.s. retail coffee, and u.s. retail consumer foods segments. during 2021, no goodwill impairment was recognized as a result of the evaluations performed throughout the year. the estimated fair value of each of our reporting units for which there is a goodwill balance was substantially in excess of its carrying value as of the annual test date, with the exception of the pet foods reporting unit, for which its fair value exceeded its carrying value by approximately 6 percent. a sensitivity analysis was performed for the pet foods reporting unit, assuming a hypothetical 50-basis-point decrease in the expected long-term growth rate or a hypothetical 50-basis-point increase in the weighted-average cost of capital, and both scenarios independently yielded an estimated fair value for the pet foods reporting unit below carrying value.
other indefinite-lived intangible assets, consisting entirely of trademarks, are also tested for impairment at least annually and more often if events or changes in circumstances indicate their carrying values may be below their fair values. to test these assets for impairment, we estimate the fair value of each asset based on a discounted cash flow model using various inputs, including projected revenues, an assumed royalty rate, and a discount rate. changes in these estimates and assumptions could impact the assessment of impairment in the future.
at april 30, 2021, other indefinite-lived intangible assets totaled $2.9 billion. trademarks that represent our leading brands comprise approximately 90 percent of the total carrying value of other indefinite-lived intangible assets. as of april 30, 2021, the estimated fair value was substantially in excess of the carrying value for the majority of these leading brand trademarks, and in all instances, the estimated fair value exceeded the carrying value by greater than 10 percent, with the exception of the rachael ray nutrish brand within the u.s. retail pet foods segment.
the carrying values of the goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets within the u.s. retail pet foods segment were
$2.4 billion and $1.4 billion, respectively, as of april 30, 2021. these intangible assets remain susceptible to future impairment charges due to narrow differences between fair value and carrying value, which is primarily attributable to the recognition of these assets at fair value resulting from recent impairment charges and the acquisition of ainsworth in 2019. any significant adverse change in our near- or long-term projections or macroeconomic conditions could result in future impairment charges which could be material.
furthermore, we continue to evaluate the potential impact of covid-19 on the fair value of our goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets. while we concluded there were no indicators of impairment as of april 30, 2021, any significant sustained adverse change in consumer purchasing behaviors, government restrictions, financial results, or macroeconomic conditions could result in future impairment, specifically as it relates to the away from home reporting unit, which has experienced a significant decline in demand as a result of covid-19. as of april 30, 2021, the goodwill related to the away from home reporting unit represented approximately 60 percent of the goodwill within international and away from home. for additional information, see note 7: goodwill and other intangible assets.
pension and other postretirement benefit plans: to determine the ultimate obligation under our defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans, we must estimate the future cost of benefits and attribute that cost to the time period during which each covered employee works. various actuarial assumptions must be made in order to predict and measure costs and obligations many years prior to the settlement date, the most significant being the interest rates used to discount the obligations of the plans, the long-term rates of return on the plans' assets, mortality assumptions, assumed pay increases, and the health care cost trend rates. we, along with third-party actuaries and investment managers, review all of these assumptions on an ongoing basis to ensure that the most reasonable information available is being considered.
we utilize a spot rate methodology for the estimation of service and interest cost for our plans by applying specific spot rates along the yield curve to the relevant projected cash flows to provide a better estimate of service and interest costs. for 2022 expense recognition, we will use weighted-average discount rates for the u.s. defined benefit pension plans of 3.13 percent to determine benefit obligation, 3.53 percent to determine service cost, and 2.40 percent to determine interest cost, and a rate of compensation increase of 3.55 percent. for the canadian defined benefit pension plans, we will use weighted-average discount rates of 2.15 percent to determine benefit obligation and 1.95 percent to determine interest cost. in addition, we anticipate using an expected rate of return on plan assets of 4.59 percent and 1.70 percent for the u.s. and canadian defined benefit pension plans, respectively.

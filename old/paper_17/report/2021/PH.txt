item 1a. risk factors.
the following "risk factors" identify what we believe to be the risks that could materially adversely affect our financial and/or operational performance. these risk factors should be considered and evaluated together with information incorporated by reference or otherwise included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10-k. additional risks not currently known to the company or that the company currently believes are immaterial also may impair the company's business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
business and operational risks the novel coronavirus ("covid-19") pandemic has disrupted our operations and could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition.
the covid-19 pandemic, along with the response to the pandemic by governmental and other actors, has disrupted our operations and is expected to continue to negatively impact our operations in the future, which impact may be material. we have experienced, and may continue to experience, mandatory and voluntary facility closures in certain jurisdictions in which we operate. furthermore, several of our customers temporarily suspended their operations and we have experienced less demand for our products. disruptions to our customers in the aerospace industry, which is facing diminished demand, have been and may continue to be challenging. additionally, the covid-19 outbreak has, and could further, disrupt our supply chain. facility closures or other restrictions, as well as supply chain disruptions, could materially adversely affect our ability to adequately staff, supply or otherwise maintain our operations. moreover, because certain of our employees continue to work from home, we may be subject to increased vulnerability to cyber and other information technology risks. we have modified, and may further modify, our business practices in response to the risks and negative impacts associated with the covid-19 pandemic. however, there can be no assurance that these measures will be temporary or successful.
the impact of the covid-19 pandemic continues to evolve and its ultimate duration, severity and disruption to our business, customers and supply chain, and the related financial impact to us, cannot be accurately forecasted at this time. should such disruption continue for an extended period, the adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition could be more severe than previously anticipated. additionally, weak economic conditions generally as a result of the covid-19 pandemic could result in impairment in value of our tangible or intangible assets. furthermore, future public health crises are possible and could involve some or all of the risks discussed above.
risks arising from uncertainty in worldwide and regional economic conditions may harm our business and make it difficult to project long-term performance.
our business is sensitive to global macro-economic conditions. future macroeconomic downturns may have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition, as well as our distributors, customers and suppliers, and on activity in many of the industries and markets we serve. among the economic factors which may have such an effect are manufacturing and other end-market activity, global pandemics, currency exchange rates, air travel trends, difficulties entering new markets, tariffs and governmental trade and monetary policies, and general economic conditions such as inflation, deflation, interest rates and credit availability. these factors may, among other things, negatively impact our level of purchases, capital expenditures, and creditworthiness, as well as our distributors, customers and suppliers, and, therefore, the company's revenues, operating profits, margins, and order rates.
we cannot predict changes in worldwide or regional economic conditions and government policies, as such conditions are highly volatile and beyond our control. if these conditions deteriorate or remain at depressed levels for extended periods, however, our business, results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected.
as a global business, we are exposed to economic, political and other risks in different countries in which we operate, which could materially reduce our sales, profitability or cash flows, or materially increase our liabilities.
our net sales derived from customers outside the united states were approximately 40 percent in 2021, 37 percent in 2020 and 39 percent in 2019. in addition, many of our manufacturing operations and suppliers are located outside the united states. the company expects net sales from non-u.s. markets to continue to represent a significant portion of its total net sales. our non-u.s. operations are subject to risks in addition to those facing our domestic operations, including:
•fluctuations in currency exchange rates and/or changes in monetary policy;
•public health crises, including pandemics;
•limitations on ownership and on repatriation of earnings;
•transportation delays and interruptions;
•political, social and economic instability and disruptions;
•government embargoes or trade restrictions;
•the imposition of duties and tariffs and other trade barriers;
•import and export controls;
•labor unrest and current and changing regulatory environments;
•the potential for nationalization of enterprises;
•difficulties in staffing and managing multi-national operations;
•limitations on our ability to enforce legal rights and remedies;
•potentially adverse tax consequences; and
•difficulties in implementing restructuring actions on a timely basis.
if we are unable to successfully manage the risks associated with expanding our global business or adequately manage operational fluctuations internationally, the risks could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition.
increased cybersecurity threats and more sophisticated and targeted computer crime could pose a risk to our information technology systems.
we rely extensively on information technology systems to manage and operate our business, some of which are managed by third parties. the security and functionality of these information technology systems, and the processing of data by these systems, are critical to our business operations. if these systems, or any part of the systems, are damaged, intruded upon, attacked, shutdown or cease to function properly (whether by planned upgrades, force majeure, telecommunications failures, criminal acts, including hardware or software break-ins or extortion attempts, or viruses, or other cybersecurity incidents) and we suffer any resulting interruption in our ability to manage and operate our business or if our products are affected, our results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected. as a result of the covid-19 pandemic, certain of our employees continue to work from home, which may increase our vulnerability to cyber and other information technology risks. in addition to existing risks, any adoption or deployment of new technologies via acquisitions or internal initiatives may increase our exposure to risks, breaches, or failures, which could materially adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition. furthermore, the company may have access to sensitive, confidential, or personal data or information that may be subject to privacy and security laws, regulations, or other contractually-imposed controls. despite our use of reasonable and appropriate controls, material security breaches, theft, misplaced, lost or corrupted data, programming, or employee errors and/or malfeasance could lead to the compromise or improper use of such sensitive, confidential, or personal data or information, resulting in possible negative consequences, such as fines, ransom demands, penalties, loss of reputation, competitiveness or customers, or other negative consequences resulting in adverse impacts to our results of operations or financial condition.
changes in the demand for and supply of our products may adversely affect our financial results, financial condition and cash flow.
demand for and supply of our products has been and may be adversely affected by numerous factors, some of which we cannot predict or control. such factors include:
•changes in business relationships with and purchases by or from major customers, suppliers or distributors, including delays or cancellations in shipments, disputes regarding contract terms or significant changes in financial condition, and changes in contract cost and revenue estimates for new development programs, including changes as a result of the covid-19 pandemic;
•changes in product mix;
•changes in the market acceptance of our products;
•increased competition in the markets we serve;
•declines in the general level of industrial production, including as a result of the covid-19 pandemic;
•weakness in the end-markets we serve, including as a result of the covid-19 pandemic;
•fluctuations in the availability or the prices of raw materials; and
•fluctuations in currency exchange rates.
if any of these factors occur, the demand for and supply of our products could suffer, which could materially adversely affect the company's results of operations.
the development of new products and technologies requires substantial investment and is required to remain competitive in the markets we serve. if we are unable to successfully introduce new commercial products, our profitability could be adversely affected.
the markets we serve are characterized by rapidly changing technologies and frequent introductions of new products and services. our ability to develop new products based on technological innovation can affect our competitive position and often requires the investment of significant resources. if we cannot develop, or have difficulties or delays developing new and enhanced products and services, or if we fail to gain market or regulatory acceptance of new products and technologies, our revenues may be materially reduced and our competitive position could be materially adversely affected. in addition, we may invest in research and development of products and services, or in acquisitions or other investments, that do not lead to significant revenue, which could adversely affect our profitability.
price and supply fluctuations of the raw materials used in our production processes and by our suppliers of component parts could negatively impact our financial results.
our supply of raw materials could be interrupted for a variety of reasons, including availability and pricing. furthermore, changes to united states and other countries' tariff and import/export regulations have in the past and may in the future have a negative impact on the availability and pricing of raw materials. prices for raw materials necessary for production have fluctuated significantly in the past and significant increases could adversely affect our results of operations and profit margins. our efforts to manage these fluctuations by, among other things, passing along price increases to our customers, may be subject to a time delay between the increased raw material prices and our ability to increase the price of our products, or we may be unable to increase the prices of our products due to pricing pressure, contract terms or other factors. any such inability to manage fluctuations could adversely impact our results of operations and cash flows.
our suppliers of component parts may significantly and quickly increase their prices in response to increases in costs of raw materials that they use to manufacture the component parts. as a result, we may not be able to increase our prices commensurately with our increased costs. consequently, our results of operations or financial condition could be materially adversely affected.
changes in the competitive environment in which we operate may eliminate any competitive advantages that we currently have, which could adversely impact our business.
our operations are subject to competition from a wide variety of global, regional and local competitors, which could adversely affect our results of operations by creating downward pricing pressure and/or a decline in our margins or market shares. to compete successfully, we must excel in terms of product quality and innovation, technological and engineering capability, manufacturing and distribution capability, delivery, price competitiveness, and customer experience.
strategic transactions risks we are subject to risks relating to the pending acquisition of meggitt.
on august 2, 2021, we announced our proposed acquisition of meggitt. meggitt is a leader in design, manufacturing and aftermarket support of technically differentiated systems and equipment in aerospace, defense and selected energy markets.
the proposed acquisition of meggitt would expand the size of our aerospace systems segment relative to our other segment, increasing our susceptibility to conditions in the end markets served by our aerospace systems segment. there are numerous risks and uncertainties associated with the proposed acquisition, including:
•completion of the acquisition is subject to a number of conditions, some of which are outside of our control. among these conditions are the approval by meggitt's stockholders of the acquisition and the receipt of certain regulatory approvals, including the expiration or termination of any applicable waiting period (and any extension thereof) under the hart-scott-rodino antitrust improvement act of 1976, as amended, and under the antitrust and foreign investment/national security laws of certain other non-u.s. jurisdictions including the united kingdom and european union;
•the company's and meggitt's existing business relationships with third parties, including customers and service providers, may be disrupted due to uncertainty associated with the acquisition, which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations, cash flows and financial position or those of the combined company;
•failure to complete the acquisition could negatively impact our stock price and our future business and financial results;
•both we and meggitt will incur significant transaction costs in connection with the acquisition, which costs may exceed those currently anticipated;
•we intend to pay for the acquisition of meggitt and pay other fees and expenses required to be paid in connection with the acquisition with cash on hand and proceeds of new indebtedness. there can be no assurance that we will be able to execute such financing transactions on acceptable terms, in a timely manner or at all;
•the covid-19 pandemic may delay or prevent the completion of the acquisition;
•after completion of the acquisition, we may be unable to successfully integrate our and meggitt's business and, as a result, may fail to realize the anticipated benefits and cost savings of the transaction in the intended timeframe or at all, which could adversely affect the value of our common stock;
•our results after the proposed acquisition of meggitt may suffer if we do not effectively manage our expanded operations following the acquisition; and
•meggitt may have difficulty retaining, motivating, and attracting executives and other employees in light of the pending acquisition, and failure to do so could harm the company.
any of the foregoing risks and uncertainties could have a material adverse effect on our earnings, cash flows and financial condition.
we are subject to risks relating to acquisitions and joint ventures, and risks relating to the integration of acquired companies, including risks related to the integration of lord corporation ("lord") and exotic metals forming company ("exotic") and the potential acquisition of meggitt.
we expect to continue our strategy of identifying and acquiring businesses with complementary products and services, and entering into joint ventures, which we believe will enhance our operations and profitability. however, there can be no assurance that we will be able to continue to find suitable businesses to purchase or joint venture opportunities, or that we will be able to acquire such businesses or enter into such joint ventures on acceptable terms. furthermore, there are no assurances that we will be able to avoid acquiring or assuming unexpected liabilities. if we are unable to avoid these risks, our results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected.
in addition, we may not be able to integrate successfully any businesses that we purchase into our existing business and it is possible that any acquired businesses or joint ventures may not be profitable. for example, we have devoted significant management attention and resources to integrating the business and operations of lord and exotic. we may encounter, or have encountered, the following difficulties during the integration process:
•the consequences of a change in tax treatment, including the cost of integration and compliance and the possibility that the full benefits anticipated to result from the acquisitions may not be realized;
•delays in the integration of management teams, strategies, operations, products, and services;
•differences in business backgrounds, corporate cultures, and management philosophies that may delay successful integration;
•the ability to retain key employees;
•the ability to create and enforce uniform standards, controls, procedures, policies, and information systems;
•challenges of integrating complex systems, technologies, networks, and other assets of the acquired companies in a manner that minimizes any adverse impact or disruptions to customers, suppliers, employees, and other constituencies; and
•unknown liabilities and unforeseen increased expenses or delays associated with the integration beyond current estimates.
the successful integration of new businesses and the success of joint ventures also depend on our ability to manage these new businesses and cut excess costs. if we are unable to avoid these risks, our results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected.
our results may be adversely affected if expanded operations from the acquisition of lord and exotic, and the potential acquisition of meggitt, are not effectively managed.
our recent acquisitions have greatly expanded the size and complexity of our business. our future success depends, in part, on the ability to manage this expanded business, which may pose or has posed substantial challenges for management, including challenges related to the management and monitoring of the expanded global operations and new manufacturing processes and products, and the associated costs and complexity. there can be no assurance of successful management of these matters or that we will realize the expected benefits of the acquisitions.
the company may be subject to risks relating to organizational changes.
we regularly execute organizational changes such as acquisitions, divestitures and realignments to support our growth and cost management strategies. we also engage in initiatives aimed to increase productivity, efficiencies and cash flow and to reduce costs. the company commits significant resources to identify, develop and retain key employees to ensure uninterrupted leadership and direction. if we are unable to successfully manage these and other organizational changes, the ability to complete such activities and realize anticipated synergies or cost savings as well as our results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected. we cannot offer assurances that any of these initiatives will be beneficial to the extent anticipated, or that the estimated efficiency improvements, incremental cost savings or cash flow improvements will be realized as anticipated or at all.
financial risks increasing costs of certain employee and retiree benefits could adversely affect our liability for such benefits.
the funding requirements and the amount of expenses recorded for our defined benefit pension plans are dependent on changes in market interest rates and the value of plan assets, which are dependent on actual plan asset returns. significant changes in market interest rates and decreases in the fair value of plan assets and investment losses on plan assets would increase funding requirements and expenses and may adversely impact our results of operations.
the company absorbs a portion of healthcare costs for its employees. if healthcare costs rise significantly and we continue to absorb the majority of these costs, these increasing costs may adversely impact our future results of operations.
additional liabilities relating to changes in tax rates or exposure to additional income tax liabilities could adversely impact our financial condition and cash flow.
we are subject to income taxes in the u.s. and various non-u.s. jurisdictions. our domestic and international tax liabilities are dependent upon the location of earnings among these different jurisdictions. our future results of operation could be adversely affected by changes in effective tax rate as a result of changes in tax laws and judicial or regulatory interpretation thereof, the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in overall profitability, changes in u.s. generally accepted accounting principles ("gaap"), or changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets. in addition, the amount of income taxes paid by the company is subject to ongoing audits by u.s. federal, state and local tax authorities and by non-u.s. tax authorities. if these audits result in assessments different from amounts reserved, future financial results may include unfavorable adjustments to the company's tax liabilities, which could have a material adverse effect on the company's results of operations.
our indebtedness and restrictive covenants under our credit facilities could limit our operational and financial flexibility.
we have incurred significant indebtedness, and may, and expect to if the potential acquisition of meggitt is completed, incur additional debt for acquisitions, operations, research and development and capital expenditures, or for other reasons related to our overall capital deployment strategy. our ability to make interest and scheduled principal payments and meet restrictive covenants could be adversely impacted by changes in the availability, terms and cost of capital, changes in interest rates or changes in our credit ratings or our outlook. these changes could increase our cost of financing and limit our debt capacity, thereby limiting our ability to pursue acquisition opportunities, react to market conditions and meet operational and capital needs, which may place us at a competitive disadvantage.
we carry goodwill on our balance sheet, which is subject to impairment testing and could subject us to significant non-cash charges to earnings in the future if impairment occurs.
we have goodwill recorded on our balance sheet. goodwill is not amortized, but is tested for impairment annually in the second quarter or more often if events or changes in circumstances indicate a potential impairment may exist. factors that could indicate that our goodwill is impaired include a decline in our stock price and market capitalization, lower than projected operating results and cash flows, and slower growth rates in our industry. declines in our stock price, lower operating results and any decline in industry conditions in the future could increase the risk of impairment. impairment testing incorporates our estimates of future operating results and cash flows, estimates of allocations of certain assets and cash flows among reporting units, estimates of future growth rates, and our judgment regarding the applicable discount rates used on estimated operating results and cash flows. if we determine at a future time that further impairment exists, it may result in a significant non-cash charge to earnings and lower stockholders' equity.
legal and regulatory risks as a provider of products to the u.s. government, we are subject to additional risks related to future government spending as well as unusual performance conditions and enhanced compliance risks.
in addition to the risks identified herein, doing business with the u.s. government subjects us to unusual risks, including dependence on the level of government spending and compliance with and changes in governmental acquisition regulations. agreements relating to the sale of products to government entities may be subject to termination, reduction or modification, either at the convenience of the government or for our failure to perform, or other unsatisfactory performance under the applicable contract. we are subject to government investigations of our business practices and compliance with government acquisition regulations. if the company were charged with wrongdoing as a result of any such investigation, it could be suspended from bidding on or receiving awards of new government contracts, and we could be subject to fines or penalties associated with contract non-compliance or resulting from such investigations, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.
litigation and legal and regulatory proceedings against the company could decrease our liquidity, impair our financial condition and adversely affect our results of operations.
from time to time, we are subject to litigation or other commercial disputes and other legal and regulatory proceedings relating to our business. due to the inherent uncertainties of any litigation, commercial disputes or other legal or regulatory proceedings, we cannot accurately predict their ultimate outcome, including the outcome of any related appeals. an unfavorable outcome could materially adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations. furthermore, as required by u.s. gaap, we establish reserves based on our assessment of contingencies, including contingencies related to legal claims asserted against us. subsequent developments in legal proceedings may affect our assessment and estimates of the loss contingency recorded as a reserve and require us to make payments in excess of our reserves, which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations.
we are subject to national and international laws and regulations, such as the anti-corruption laws of the u.s. foreign corrupt practices act and the u.k. bribery act, relating to our business and our employees. despite our policies, procedures and compliance programs, our internal controls and compliance systems may not be able to protect the company from prohibited acts willfully committed by our employees, agents or business partners that would violate such applicable laws and regulations. any such improper acts could damage the company's reputation, subject us to civil or criminal judgments, fines or penalties, and could otherwise disrupt the company's business, and as a result, could materially adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.
further, our operations are subject to certain antitrust and competition laws in the jurisdictions in which we conduct our business, in particular the united states and europe. these laws prohibit, among other things, anticompetitive agreements and practices. if any of our commercial agreements or practices are found to violate or infringe such laws, we may be subject to civil and other penalties. we may also be subject to third-party claims for damages. further, agreements that infringe antitrust and competition laws may be void and unenforceable, in whole or in part, or require modification in order to be lawful and enforceable. accordingly, any violation of these laws could harm our reputation and could have a material adverse effect on our earnings, cash flows and financial condition.
due to the nature of our business and products, we may be liable for damages based on product liability claims.
our businesses expose us to potential product liability risks that are inherent in the design, manufacture and sale of our products and the products of third-party vendors that we use or resell. significant product liability claims could have a material adverse effect on the company's financial condition, liquidity and results of operations. although we currently maintain what we believe to be suitable and adequate product liability insurance, there can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain our insurance on acceptable terms or that our insurance will provide adequate protection against all potential significant liabilities.
failure to protect our intellectual property and know-how could reduce or eliminate any competitive advantage and reduce our sales and profitability, and the cost of protecting our intellectual property may be significant.
protecting our intellectual property is critical to our innovation efforts. we own a number of patents, trade secrets, copyrights, trademarks, trade names and other forms of intellectual property related to our products and services throughout the world and the operation of our business. we also have exclusive and non-exclusive rights to intellectual property owned by others. our intellectual property may be challenged, stolen or otherwise infringed upon by third parties or we may be unable to maintain, renew or enter into new license agreements with third-party owners of intellectual property on reasonable terms. in addition, the global nature of our business increases the risk that our intellectual property may be subject to infringement, theft or other unauthorized use or disclosure by others. in some cases, our ability to protect our intellectual property rights by legal recourse or otherwise may be limited, particularly in countries where laws or enforcement practices are inadequate or undeveloped. unauthorized use or disclosure of our intellectual property rights or our inability to protect intellectual property and preserve associated intellectual property rights could lead to reputational harm and/or adversely impact our competitive position and results of operations.
we may be required to make material expenditures in order to comply with environmental laws and climate change regulations, or incur additional liabilities under these laws and regulations.
our operations necessitate the use and handling of hazardous materials and, as a result, subject us to various u.s. federal, state and local laws and regulations, as well as non-u.s. laws, designed to protect the environment and to regulate the discharge of materials into the environment. these laws impose penalties, fines and other sanctions for non-compliance and liability for response costs, property damages and personal injury resulting from past and current spills, disposals or other releases of, or the exposure to, hazardous materials. among other laws, we are subject to the u.s. federal "superfund" law, under which we have been designated as a "potentially responsible party" and may be liable for clean-up costs associated with various waste sites, some of which are on the united states environmental protection agency's superfund priority list. we could incur substantial costs as a result of non-compliance with or liability for cleanup or other costs or damages under environmental laws, including the "superfund" law.
in addition, increased worldwide focus on climate change issues has led to legislative and regulatory efforts to limit greenhouse gas emissions, including regulation of such emissions through a "cap-and-trade" system globally. increased regulation of greenhouse gas emissions and other climate change concerns could subject us to additional costs and restrictions, including increased energy and raw material costs. until definitive regulations are adopted, we are not able to predict how such regulations would affect our business, operations or financial results.
we may be subject to other more stringent environmental laws in the future. if more stringent environmental laws are enacted in the future, these laws could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.
item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations.
forward-looking statements forward-looking statements contained in this and other written and oral reports are made based on known events and circumstances at the time of release, and as such, are subject in the future to unforeseen uncertainties and risks. often but not always, these statements may be identified from the use of forward-looking terminology such as "anticipates," "believes," "may," "should," "could," "potential," "continues," "plans," "forecasts," "estimates," "projects," "predicts," "would," "intends," "expects," "targets," "is likely," "will," or the negative of these terms and similar expressions, and include all statements regarding future performance, earnings projections, events or developments. neither the company nor any of its respective associates or directors, officers or advisers, provides any representation, assurance or guarantee that the occurrence of the events expressed or implied in any forward-looking statements in this document will actually occur. the company cautions readers not to place undue reliance on these statements. it is possible that the future performance and earnings projections of the company, including its individual segments, may differ materially from past performance or current expectations, depending on economic conditions within its mobile, industrial and aerospace markets, and the company's ability to maintain and achieve anticipated benefits associated with announced realignment activities, strategic initiatives to improve operating margins, actions taken to combat the effects of the current economic environment, and growth, innovation and global diversification initiatives. additionally, the actual impact of changes in tax laws in the united states and foreign jurisdictions and any judicial or regulatory interpretation thereof on future performance and earnings projections may impact the company's tax calculations. a change in the economic conditions in individual markets may have a particularly volatile effect on segment performance.

our order rates provide a near-term perspective of the company's outlook particularly when viewed in the context of prior and future order rates. the company publishes its order rates on a quarterly basis. the lead time between the time an order is received and revenue is realized generally ranges from one day to 12 weeks for mobile and industrial orders and from one day to 18 months for aerospace orders.
in march 2020, the world health organization declared the outbreak of covid-19 a pandemic. we continue to monitor the impact of the covid-19 pandemic, which has negatively impacted demand and continues to create economic uncertainty. disruption within the aerospace industry, which is facing the consequences of travel restrictions and considerably lower demand, was significant and is expected to continue. the extent to which our business and results of operations will be impacted by the pandemic over the long term will depend on future developments that cannot be accurately predicted at this time. these developments include the availability, acceptance, distribution and effectiveness of vaccines; new information concerning the severity and spread of covid-19 and its variants; and actions by government authorities to contain the pandemic or mitigate its economic, public health and other impacts.
we continue to prioritize the safety of our team members. to minimize the spread of covid-19 in our workplaces, we implemented rigorous prevention, screening and hygiene protocols. additionally, we are strategically managing costs through reductions in discretionary spending. we continue to prioritize capital expenditures related to safety and strategic investments.
at the same time, we are appropriately addressing the ongoing needs of our business so that we may continue to serve our customers.

*year ended june 30, 2020 amounts have been adjusted to reflect the change in inventory accounting method, as described in notes 1 and 7 to the consolidated financial statements.
net sales in 2021 increased from the 2020 amount due to higher volume in both the diversified industrial international and diversified industrial north american businesses, partially offset by lower volume in the aerospace systems segment. the effect of currency rate changes increased net sales in 2021 by approximately $257 million, of which $244 million was attributable to the diversified industrial international operations. prior-year acquisitions contributed approximately $394 million in net sales during 2021.
gross profit margin (calculated as net sales less cost of sales, divided by net sales) increased in 2021 primarily due to higher margins in all businesses. gross profit margin in 2021 included net foreign currency transaction gains of $11 million and $10 million in 2021 and 2020, respectively. gross profit margin also benefited from the absence of acquisition-related expenses, which were included in cost of sales in 2020, of $69 million. cost of sales included business realignment and acquisition integration charges of $35 million in 2021 compared to $60 million in 2020.
selling, general and administrative expenses ("sg&a") decreased eight percent in 2021 primarily due to benefits from lower discretionary spending and wage and salary expense resulting from actions taken in response to business conditions resulting from the covid-19 pandemic. during 2021, sg&a also benefited from the absence of acquisition-related expenses of $119 million, which were incurred in 2020. these benefits were partially offset by higher intangible asset amortization expense related to prior-year acquisitions and higher stock compensation expense. sg&a also included business realignment and acquisition integration charges of $23 million and $38 million in 2021 and 2020, respectively.
interest expense in 2021 decreased due to both lower interest rates and lower average debt outstanding.

gain on disposal of assets in 2021 primarily consists of a gain of $101 million on the sale of land. in 2020, it includes gains of $12 million on the sale of real estate, partially offset by net losses on divestitures and asset sales and writedowns.
effective tax rate in 2021 was higher than 2020 primarily due to an overall decrease in discrete tax benefits.

the above presentation reconciles the percentage changes in net sales of the diversified industrial segment reported in accordance with u.s. gaap to percentage changes in net sales adjusted to remove the effects of acquisitions made within the prior four fiscal quarters as well as the effects of currency exchange rates (a non-gaap measure). the effects of acquisitions and currency exchange rates are removed to allow investors and the company to meaningfully evaluate the percentage changes in net sales on a comparable basis from period to period.
sales in 2021 for the diversified industrial north american operations increased 3.4 percent from 2020. acquisitions increased sales by $188 million, and the effect of currency exchange rates increased sales by approximately $8 million. excluding acquisitions and the effect of currency rate changes, sales in 2021 for the diversified industrial north american operations increased 0.4 percent from prior-year levels reflecting higher demand from distributors and end users in the refrigeration, cars and light truck, farm and agriculture and life sciences markets, partially offset by a decrease in end-user demand in the oil and gas and general industrial machinery markets.

sales in the diversified industrial international operations increased 17.3 percent in 2021. acquisitions increased sales by approximately $136 million in 2021. the effect of currency rate changes increased sales by $244 million, reflecting the weakening of the u.s. dollar primarily against currencies in the eurozone countries, china and the united kingdom. excluding acquisitions and the effect of currency rate changes, sales in 2021 for the diversified industrial international operations increased 8.9 percent from 2020 levels primarily due to higher demand from distributors and end users in both the mobile and industrial markets. during 2021, the asia pacific region, europe, and latin america accounted for approximately 60 percent, 26 percent, and 14 percent, respectively, of the increase in sales.
within the asia pacific region, the increase in sales was primarily due to higher demand from distributors and end users in the construction equipment, semiconductor, cars and light truck, general industrial machinery, engine and life sciences markets, partially offset by a decrease in end-user demand in the oil and gas market.
within europe, the increase in sales was primarily due to higher demand from distributors and end users in the construction equipment, heavy-duty truck and power generation markets, partially offset by a decrease in end-user demand in the general industrial machinery, oil and gas and marine markets.
within latin america, the increase in sales was primarily due to higher demand from distributors and end users in the farm and agriculture, construction equipment, cars and light truck and heavy-duty truck markets, partially offset by a decrease in end-user demand in the oil and gas market.
operating margins in 2021 increased in both the diversified industrial north american and international operations primarily due to higher sales volume and benefits from overall cost reductions, including lower discretionary spending, wage and salary reductions, current and prior-year restructuring actions in response to business conditions resulting from the covid-19 pandemic, the absence of acquisition-related expenses, and productivity improvements.
the following business realignment and acquisition integration charges are included in diversified industrial north america and diversified industrial international operating income:
(dollars in millions)                                     2021                2020
diversified industrial north america                    $14                 $41
diversified industrial international                     36                  32
during 2021, business realignment charges primarily include actions taken to address the impact of covid-19 on our business, but also include charges related to the company's simplification initiative. the simplification initiative is aimed at reducing organizational and process complexity and is being implemented by operating units around the world. during 2020, business realignment charges primarily include charges related to the company's simplification initiative, but also include permanent workforce reductions to address the impact of covid-19 on our business. acquisition integration charges relate to the 2020 acquisition of lord.
the majority of the diversified industrial international business realignment and acquisition integration charges were incurred in europe. we anticipate that cost savings realized from the workforce reduction measures taken during 2021 will increase operating income for 2022 by approximately one percent in both the diversified industrial north american and international operations. in 2022, we expect to continue to take actions necessary to structure appropriately the operations of the diversified industrial segment. these actions are expected to result in approximately $40 million in business realignment and acquisition integration charges in 2022. however, continually changing business conditions could impact the ultimate costs we incur.
the increase in diversified industrial segment backlog in 2021 was primarily due to orders exceeding shipments in both the north american and international businesses, with each business accounting for approximately 50 percent of the change. within the international business, this increase in backlog was primarily related to orders exceeding shipments in both europe and the asia pacific region. backlog consists of written firm orders from a customer to deliver products and, in the case of blanket purchase orders, only includes the portion of the order for which a schedule or release date has been agreed to with the customer. the dollar value of backlog is equal to the amount that is expected to be billed to the customer and reported as a sale.

sales in 2021 were lower than the 2020 level primarily due to lower volume in the commercial oem and aftermarket businesses due to the market conditions as a result of covid-19. this decrease was partially offset by higher volume in the military oem and aftermarket businesses as well as a $71 million increase in sales from prior-year acquisitions.
operating margin decreased in 2021 primarily due to lower sales volume in the commercial oem and aftermarket businesses and lower aftermarket profitability. lower sales volume and aftermarket profitability were partially offset by lower engineering development expenses, overall cost reductions, lower business realignment and acquisition integration charges and the benefits from such actions.
the disruption in the aerospace industry due to the covid-19 pandemic has been significant and we have taken actions necessary to structure appropriately the operations of the aerospace systems segment. we do not currently intend to incur significant additional business realignment and acquisition integration charges in 2022. however, continually changing business conditions could impact the ultimate costs we incur. we anticipate that cost savings realized from the workforce reduction measures taken during 2021 will increase segment operating income for 2022 by approximately two percent.
the increase in backlog in 2021 was primarily due to orders exceeding shipments in the military oem business, partially offset by shipments exceeding orders in the military aftermarket and commercial oem and aftermarket businesses. backlog consists of written firm orders from a customer to deliver products and, in the case of blanket purchase orders, only includes the portion of the order for which a schedule or release date has been agreed to with the customer. the dollar value of backlog is equal to the amount that is expected to be billed to the customer and reported as a sale.

corporate general and administrative expenses increased slightly in 2021 primarily due to increases in stock compensation expense, deferred compensation expense and charitable contributions. these increases were partially offset by benefits from lower discretionary spending and wage and salary expense as a result of actions taken in response to business conditions resulting from the covid-19 pandemic.

our goal is to maintain an investment-grade credit profile. the rating agencies periodically update our credit ratings as events occur. at june 30, 2021, the long-term credit ratings assigned to the company's senior debt securities by the credit rating agencies engaged by the company were as follows:
fitch ratings                          bbb+
moody's investor services, inc.        baa1
standard &amp; poor's                  bbb+
we continue to actively monitor our liquidity position and working capital needs and prioritize capital expenditures related to safety and strategic investments. the company remains in a stable overall capital resources and liquidity position that is adequate to meet its projected needs. in march 2020, the company suspended the share repurchase program in response to business uncertainty resulting from the covid-19 pandemic. during february 2021, the company reinitiated the share repurchase program and repurchased shares totaling $100 million during the remainder of the fiscal year.
the company has a line of credit totaling $2,500 million through a multi-currency revolving credit agreement with a group of banks, all of which was available as of june 30, 2021. the credit agreement expires in september 2024; however, the company has the right to request a one-year extension of the expiration date on an annual basis, which request may result in changes to the current terms and conditions of the credit agreement. advances from the credit agreement can be used for general corporate purposes, including acquisitions, and for the refinancing of existing indebtedness. the credit agreement requires the payment of an annual facility fee, the amount of which is dependent upon the company's credit ratings. although a lowering of the company's credit ratings would increase the cost of future debt, it would not limit the company's ability to use the credit agreement nor would it accelerate the repayment of any outstanding borrowings. refer to note 9 to the consolidated financial statements in part ii, item 8 of this annual report on form 10-k for further discussion.
the company is currently authorized to sell up to $2,500 million of short-term commercial paper notes. there were no outstanding commercial paper notes as of june 30, 2021, and the largest amount of commercial paper notes outstanding during the last quarter of 2021 was $203 million.
the company's credit agreements and indentures governing certain debt securities contain various covenants, the violation of which would limit or preclude the use of the credit agreements for future borrowings, or might accelerate the maturity of the related outstanding borrowings covered by the indentures. based on the company's rating level at june 30, 2021, the most restrictive financial covenant provides that the ratio of debt to debt-shareholders' equity cannot exceed 0.65 to 1.0. at june 30, 2021, the company's debt to debt-shareholders' equity ratio was 0.44 to 1.0. we are in compliance and expect to remain in compliance with all covenants set forth in the credit agreement and indentures.
on august 2, 2021, the company announced that it reached an agreement on the terms of a recommended cash acquisition of the entire issued and to be issued ordinary share capital of meggitt for 800 pence per share, or approximately £6,308 million. we intend to fund the proposed acquisition with cash and new debt. the proposed acquisition remains subject to customary closing conditions, including regulatory clearances and approval by meggitt's shareholders.
in connection with the proposed acquisition, the company entered into a bridge credit agreement (the "bridge credit agreement") on august 2, 2021. under the bridge credit agreement, lenders are committed to provide senior, unsecured financing in the aggregate principal amount of £6,524 million. any borrowings made under the bridge credit agreement would mature 364 days from the initial funding date. the commitments are intended to be drawn to finance the proposed acquisition of meggitt only to the extent that we do not arrange for alternative financing prior to closing.
contractual obligations - the total amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits, including interest, for uncertain tax positions was $119 million at june 30, 2021. payment of these obligations would result from settlements with worldwide taxing authorities. due to the difficulty in determining the timing of the settlements, these obligations are not included in the following summary of the company's fixed contractual obligations. references to notes are to the notes to the consolidated financial statements in part ii, item 8 of this annual report on form 10-k.

critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america ("gaap") requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes. the policies discussed below are considered by management to be more critical than other policies because their application places the most significant demands on management's judgment.
revenue recognition - revenues are recognized when control of performance obligations, which are distinct goods or services within the contract, is transferred to the customer. control is transferred when the customer has the ability to direct the use of and obtain the benefits from the goods or services. a majority of our revenues are recognized at a point in time when control is transferred to the customer, which is generally at the time of shipment. however, a portion of our revenues are recognized over time if the customer simultaneously receives control as we perform work under a contract, if the customer controls the asset as it is being produced, or if the product has no alternative use and we have a contractual right to payment.
for contracts where revenue is recognized over time, we use the cost-to-cost, efforts expended or units of delivery method depending on the nature of the contract, including length of production time. the estimation of costs and efforts expended requires judgment on the part of management due to the duration of the contractual agreements as well as the technical nature of the products involved. adjustments to these estimates are made on a consistent basis and a contract reserve is established when the estimated costs to complete a contract exceed the expected contract revenues.
when there are multiple performance obligations within a contract, the transaction price is allocated to each performance obligation based on its standalone selling price. the primary method used to estimate a standalone selling price is the price observed in standalone sales to customers for the same product or service. revenue is recognized when control of the individual performance obligations is transferred to the customer.
we consider the contractual consideration payable by the customer and assesses variable consideration that may affect the total transaction price. variable consideration is included in the estimated transaction price when there is a basis to reasonably estimate the amount, including whether the estimate should be constrained in order to avoid a significant reversal of revenue in a future period. these estimates are based on historical experience, anticipated performance under the terms of the contract and our best judgment at the time.
impairment of goodwill and long-lived assets - we test goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level on an annual basis and between annual tests whenever events or circumstances indicate the carrying value of a reporting unit may exceed its fair value. our six reporting units are equivalent to our operating segments. as quoted market prices are not available for our reporting units, determining whether an impairment occurred requires the valuation of the respective reporting unit, which is estimated using both income-based and market-based valuation methods. the income-based valuation method utilizes a discounted cash flow model which requires several assumptions, including future sales growth and operating margin levels as well as assumptions regarding future industry-specific market conditions. each reporting unit regularly prepares discrete operating forecasts and uses these forecasts as the basis for the assumptions in the discounted cash flow analysis. within the discounted cash flow models, the company uses a discount rate, commensurate with its cost of capital but adjusted for inherent business risks, and an appropriate terminal growth factor. the market-based valuation performed for each reporting unit includes an analysis consisting of market-adjusted multiples based on key data points for guideline public companies. we also reconcile the estimated aggregate fair value of our reporting units resulting from these procedures to our overall market capitalization.
at december 31, 2020, the company performed its annual goodwill impairment test for each of its six reporting units. the results of this test indicated the fair value substantially exceeded carrying value for all reporting units. we continually monitor our reporting units for impairment indicators and update assumptions used in the most recent calculation of a reporting unit's fair value as appropriate. we did not identify any events or circumstances during 2021 that required performance of an interim impairment test.
long-lived assets held for use, which primarily includes finite-lived intangible assets and property, plant and equipment, are evaluated for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the undiscounted net cash flows to be generated by their use over their expected useful lives and eventual disposition are less than their carrying value. the long-term nature of these assets requires the estimation of their cash inflows and outflows several years into the future and only takes into consideration technological advances known at the time of the impairment test. during 2021, the company did not record any material impairment related to long-lived assets.
pensions - the annual net periodic expense and benefit obligations related to the company's defined benefit plans are determined on an actuarial basis. this determination requires critical assumptions regarding the discount rate, long-term rate of return on plan assets, increases in compensation levels and amortization periods for actuarial gains and losses. assumptions are determined based on company data and appropriate market indicators and are evaluated each year as of the plans' measurement date. changes in the assumptions to reflect actual experience as well as the amortization of actuarial gains and losses could result in a material change in the annual net periodic expense and benefit obligations reported in the financial statements.
for the company's domestic qualified defined benefit plan, a 50 basis point change in the assumed long-term rate of return on plan assets is estimated to have an $18 million increase in annual pension expense and a 50 basis point decrease in the discount rate is estimated to increase annual pension expense by $27 million. as of june 30, 2021, $707 million of past years' net actuarial losses related to the company's domestic qualified defined benefit plan are subject to amortization in the future. these losses will generally be amortized over approximately seven years and will negatively affect earnings in the future. any actuarial gains experienced in future years will help reduce the effect of the net actuarial loss amortization. further information on pensions is provided in note 12 to the consolidated financial statements in part ii, item 8 of this annual report on form 10-k.
income taxes - significant judgment is required in determining the company's income tax expense and in evaluating tax positions. deferred income tax assets and liabilities have been recorded for the differences between the financial accounting and income tax basis of assets and liabilities. factors considered by the company in determining the probability of realizing deferred income tax assets include forecasted operating earnings, available tax planning strategies and the time period over which the temporary differences will reverse. the company reviews its tax positions on a regular basis and adjusts the balances as new information becomes available. for those tax positions where it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will be sustained, the largest amount of tax benefit with a greater than 50 percent likelihood of being realized upon examination by a taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information will be recorded. for those income tax positions where it is not more likely than not that a tax benefit will be sustained, no tax benefit has been recognized in the consolidated financial statements. further information on income taxes is provided in note 5 to the consolidated financial statements in part ii, item 8 of this annual report on form 10-k.
loss contingencies - the company has a number of loss exposures incurred in the ordinary course of business such as environmental claims, product liability and litigation reserves. establishing loss accruals for these matters requires management's estimate and judgment with regards to risk exposure and ultimate liability or realization. we review these loss accruals periodically and make adjustments to reflect the most recent facts and circumstances.
recently issued accounting pronouncements recently issued accounting pronouncements are described in note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, included in part ii, item 8 of this annual report on form 10-k.
in november 2020, the sec issued final rule release no. 33-10890, management's discussion and analysis, selected financial data, and supplementary financial information. this rule, which became effective on february 10, 2021, amended certain sec disclosure requirements in order to modernize, simplify and enhance certain financial disclosure requirements in regulation s-k. specifically, the amendments eliminate the requirement for selected financial data, streamline the requirement to disclose supplementary financial information, and amend management's discussion and analysis. the final rule is applicable for fiscal years ending on or after august 9, 2021, however, early adoption on an item-by-item basis is permitted after february 10, 2021. we early adopted the amendments to two items resulting in the elimination of item 301, selected financial data, from part ii, item 6 of this report and the omission of regulation s-k item 302(a), supplementary financial information, from the notes to our consolidated financial statements in part ii, item 8 of this report.

item 1a: risk factors in evaluating the company, careful consideration should be given to the following risk factors, in addition to the other information included in this annual report on form 10-k, including the consolidated financial statements and the related notes. each of these risk factors could adversely affect, and in some cases may have already affected, the company's business, operating results, cash flows and/or financial condition, as well as adversely affect the value of an investment in the company's common stock.
risk related to covid-19 and other infectious diseases the ongoing covid-19 pandemic is expected to continue to pose risks to our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows, and other epidemics or outbreaks of infectious diseases may have a similar impact.
we face risks related to outbreaks of infectious diseases, including the ongoing covid-19 pandemic. in response to covid-19, national and local governments around the world instituted certain measures, including travel bans, prohibitions on group events and gatherings, shutdowns of certain businesses, curfews, shelter-in-place orders and recommendations to practice social distancing. existing measures may be extended in certain regions and additional measures may be imposed to combat the covid-19 pandemic or future outbreaks of infectious diseases.
among the effects of covid-19, and potential effects of other similar outbreaks, on the company could include, but are not limited to, reduced consumer and investor confidence, instability in the credit and financial markets, volatile corporate profits, supply chain inefficiencies, and reduced business and consumer spending, which could adversely affect our results of operations by reducing our sales, margins and/or net income as a result of rising costs, a slowdown in customer orders or order cancellations. to the extent the covid-19 pandemic, or a future outbreak, adversely affects our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows, it may also heighten many of the other risks described in this section. the ultimate impact of covid-19, as well as future outbreaks of infectious diseases, is dependent on future developments, including the duration of the pandemic and the related length of its impact on the global economy, which are uncertain and cannot be predicted at this time.
business risks the sales of many of our products are dependent on the health of the vehicle repair market and the changing requirements of vehicle repair.
we believe sales of many of our products are dependent on the changing vehicle repair requirements, the number of vehicles on the road, the general aging of vehicles and the number of miles driven. these factors affect the frequency, type and amount of service and repair performed on vehicles by technicians, and therefore affect the demand for the number of technicians, the prosperity of technicians and, consequently, the demand technicians have for our tools, other products and services, as well as the value technicians place on those products and services. the use of other methods of transportation, including more frequent use of public transportation in the future, could result in a decrease in the use of privately-operated vehicles. a decrease in the use of privately-operated vehicles may lead to fewer repairs and less demand for our products.
2021 annual report in addition, the number of electric and hybrid vehicles developed and sold has risen in recent years, and is expected to continue to increase in the future. while we believe that advances in vehicle technologies provide us with opportunities to provide innovative products and solutions to the vehicle repair market, if we are not able to execute on those possibilities, our business and results of operations could suffer.
the performance of snap-on's mobile tool distribution business depends on the success of its franchisees.
approximately 42% of our consolidated net revenues in 2021 were generated by the snap-on tools group, which consists of snap-on's business operations primarily serving vehicle service and repair technicians through the company's worldwide mobile tool distribution channel. snap-on's success is dependent on its relationships with franchisees, individually and collectively, as they are the primary sales and service link between the company and vehicle service and repair technicians, who are an important class of end users for snap-on's products and services.
if our franchisees are not successful, or if we do not maintain an effective relationship with our franchisees, the delivery of products, the collection of receivables and/or our relationship with end users could be adversely affected and thereby negatively impact our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
in addition, if we are unable to maintain effective relationships with franchisees, snap-on or the franchisees may choose to terminate the relationship, which may result in: (i) open routes, in which end-user customers are not provided reliable service; (ii) litigation resulting from termination; (iii) reduced collections or increased charge-offs of franchisee receivables owed to snap-on; and/or (iv) reduced collections or increased charge-offs of finance and contract receivables.
the inability to continue to introduce new products that respond to customer needs and achieve market acceptance could result in lower revenues and reduced profitability.
sales from new products represent a significant portion of our net sales and are expected to continue to represent a significant component of our future net sales. we may not be able to compete effectively unless we continue to enhance existing products or introduce new products to the marketplace in a timely manner. product improvements and new product introductions require significant financial and other resources, including significant planning, design, development, sourcing and testing at the technological, product and manufacturing process levels. our competitors' new products may beat our products to market, be more effective, contain more features, be less expensive than our products, and/or render our products obsolete. any new products that we develop may not receive market acceptance or otherwise generate any meaningful net sales or profits for us relative to our expectations based on, among other things, existing and anticipated investments in manufacturing capacity and commitments to fund advertising, marketing, promotional programs and research and development.
failure to adequately protect intellectual property, or claims of infringement, could adversely affect our business, reputation, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
intellectual property rights are an important and integral component of our business and failure to obtain or maintain adequate protection of our intellectual property rights for any reason could have a material adverse effect on our business. we attempt to protect our intellectual property rights through a combination of patent, trademark, copyright and trade secret laws, as well as licensing agreements and third-party nondisclosure and assignment agreements. in addition, we have been, and in the future may be, subject to claims of intellectual property infringement against us by third parties; whether or not these claims have merit, we could be required to expend significant resources in defense of those claims. adverse determinations in a judicial or administrative proceeding or via a settlement could prevent us from manufacturing and selling our products, prevent us from stopping others from manufacturing and selling competing products, and/or result in payments for damages. in the event of an infringement claim, we may also be required to spend significant resources to develop alternatives or obtain licenses, which may not be available on reasonable terms or at all, and may reduce our sales and disrupt our production. failure to obtain or maintain adequate protection of our intellectual property rights for any reason could have a material adverse effect on our business.
snap-on incorporated the global tool, equipment, diagnostics, and repair information industries are competitive.
we face strong competition in all of our market segments. price competition in our various industries is intense and pricing pressures from competitors and customers continue to increase. in general, as a manufacturer and marketer of premium products and services, the expectations of snap-on's customers and its franchisees are high and continue to increase. any inability to maintain customer satisfaction could diminish snap-on's premium image and reputation and could result in a lessening of our ability to command premium pricing. we expect that the level of competition will remain high in the future, which could limit our ability to maintain or increase market share or profitability.
foreign operations are subject to political, economic and other risks that could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
approximately 31% of our revenues in 2021 were generated outside of the united states. future growth rates and success of our business depends in large part on continued growth in our non-u.s. operations, including growth in emerging markets and critical industries. numerous risks and uncertainties affect our non-u.s. operations. these include political, economic and social instability, such as acts of war, armed conflicts, civil disturbance or acts of terrorism, local labor conditions, trade relations with china, changes in government policies and regulations, including those intended to address climate change, imposition or increases in withholding and other taxes on remittances and other payments by international subsidiaries, as well as exposure to liabilities under anti-bribery and anti-corruption laws in various countries, such as the u.s. foreign corrupt practices act, currency volatility, transportation delays or interruptions, sovereign debt uncertainties and difficulties in enforcement of contract and intellectual property rights, reputational risks related to, among other factors, different standards and practices among countries, as well as natural disasters, weather events and outbreaks of infectious diseases. should the economic environment in our non-u.s. markets deteriorate from current levels, our results of operations and financial position could be materially impacted, including as a result of the effects of potential impairment write-downs of goodwill and/or other intangible assets related to these businesses.
the united kingdom ("u.k.") has formally left the european union ("brexit"). as part of the agreement between the u.k. and the european union regarding brexit, there is a new series of customs and regulatory checks, including rules of origin and stringent local content requirements. there are also restrictions on the free movement of people and temporary visas for work-related purposes have been re-introduced. the implications of brexit, including disruptions to trade and the movement of goods, services and people between the u.k. and the european union or other countries, may lead to additional cost, delays and volatility in currency exchange rates, as well as create legal and global economic uncertainty. these and other potential implications could adversely affect our business and results of operations.
operational risks risks associated with the disruption of manufacturing operations could adversely affect our profitability or competitive position.
we manufacture a significant portion of the products we sell. any prolonged disruption in the operations of our existing manufacturing facilities, whether due to technical or labor difficulties, facility consolidation or closure actions, lack of raw material or component availability, destruction of or damage to any facility (as a result of natural disasters, climate or weather events, use and storage of hazardous materials, acts of war, sabotage, terrorism, civil unrest or other events), or other reasons, including outbreaks of infectious diseases, such as the ongoing covid-19 pandemic, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
2021 annual report price fluctuations and shortages of raw materials, components, certain purchased finished goods and energy sources could adversely affect the ability to obtain needed materials or products and could adversely affect our results of operations.
snap-on's supply of raw materials and purchased components are generally available from numerous suppliers, and the company continuously works to expand its supplier base to ensure availability. the principal raw material used in the manufacture of our products is steel, which we purchase in competitive, price-sensitive markets. to meet snap-on's high quality standards, our steel needs range from specialized alloys, which are available only from a limited group of approved suppliers, to common alloys, which are available from multiple suppliers. some of these materials have been, and in the future may be, in short supply, particularly in the event of mill shutdowns or production cut backs. in addition, outbreaks of infectious diseases, weather events or other circumstances beyond our control could also impact the availability of raw materials and components. physical risks of climate change may also impact the availability and cost of materials, sources and supply of energy and could also increase operating costs. raw materials, components and certain purchased finished goods can exhibit price and demand cyclicality, including as a result of tariffs, other trade protection measures, inflationary factors, and supply chain inefficiencies. associated unexpected variability could result in an increase in product costs and require snap-on to increase prices to maintain margins.
we use various energy sources to transport, produce and distribute products, and some of our products have components that are petroleum based. petroleum and energy prices have periodically increased significantly over short periods of time; future volatility and changes may be caused by market fluctuations, supply and demand, currency fluctuations, production and transportation disruptions, climate change regulations, world events and changes in governmental programs. energy price increases raise both our operating costs and the costs of our materials, and we may not be able to increase our prices enough to offset these costs in certain areas. higher prices also may reduce the level of future customer orders and our profitability.
failure to maintain effective distribution of products and services could adversely impact revenue, gross margin and profitability.
we use a variety of distribution methods to sell our products and services. successfully managing the interaction of our distribution efforts to reach various potential customer segments for our products and services is a complex process. moreover, since each distribution method has distinct risks, costs and gross margins, our failure to implement the most advantageous balance in the delivery model for our products and services could adversely affect our revenue, gross margins and profitability.
data security and information technology infrastructure and security are critical to supporting business objectives; failure of our systems to operate effectively could adversely affect our business and reputation.
we depend heavily on information technology infrastructure to achieve our business objectives and to protect sensitive information, and continually invest in improving such systems. problems that impair or compromise this infrastructure, including natural disasters, power outages, major network failures, security breaches or malicious attacks, or during system upgrades and/or new system implementations, could impede our ability to record or process orders, manufacture and ship in a timely manner, manage our financial services operations including originating, processing, accounting for and collecting receivables, protect sensitive data of the company, our customers, our suppliers and business partners, or otherwise carry on business in the normal course. any such events, if significant, could cause us to lose customers and/or revenue and could require us to incur significant expense to remediate, including as a result of legal or regulatory claims, proceedings, fines or penalties, and could also damage our reputation. while we have taken steps to maintain adequate data security and address these risks and uncertainties by implementing security technologies, internal controls, network and data center resiliency, and redundancy and recovery processes, as well as by securing insurance, these measures may be inadequate. these risks may be heightened when associates work remotely.
in association with initiatives to better integrate business units, rationalize our operating footprint and improve responsiveness to franchisees and customers, snap-on is continually enhancing its global enterprise resource planning (erp) management information systems. as we integrate, implement and deploy new information technology processes and enhance our information infrastructure across our global operations, we could experience disruptions in our business that could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
snap-on incorporated failure to attract, retain and effectively manage qualified personnel could lead to a loss of revenue and/or profitability.
snap-on's success depends, in part, on the efforts and abilities of its senior management team and other key employees. their skills, experience and industry contacts significantly benefit our operations and administration. the failure to attract and retain members of our senior management team and other key employees, to effectively develop personnel and to execute succession plans could have a negative effect on our operating results. in addition, transitions of important responsibilities to new individuals inherently include the possibility of disruptions to our business and operations, which could negatively affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
we may not successfully integrate businesses we acquire, which could have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
the pursuit of growth through acquisitions, including participation in joint ventures, involves significant risks that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. these risks include:
•loss of the acquired businesses' customers;
•inability to integrate successfully the acquired businesses' operations;
•inability to coordinate management and integrate and retain employees of the acquired businesses;
•unforeseen or contingent liabilities of the acquired businesses;
•large write-offs or write-downs, or the impairment of goodwill or other intangible assets;
•difficulties in implementing and maintaining consistent standards, controls, procedures, policies and information systems;
•failure to realize anticipated synergies, economies of scale or other anticipated benefits, or to maintain operating margins;
•strain on our personnel, systems and resources, and diversion of attention from other priorities;
•incurrence of additional debt and related interest expense; and
•the dilutive effect in the event of the issuance of additional equity securities.
the steps taken to restructure operations, rationalize operating footprint, lower operating expenses and achieve greater efficiencies in the supply chain could disrupt business.
we have taken steps in the past, and may take additional steps in the future, intended to improve customer service and drive further efficiencies as well as reduce costs, some of which could be disruptive to our business. future efforts to reduce components of expense could result in the recording of charges for inventory and technology-related write-offs, workforce reduction costs or other charges relating to the consolidation or closure of facilities. if we were to incur a substantial charge or are unable to effectively manage our cost reduction and restructuring efforts, our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected in certain periods.
financial risks our inability to provide acceptable financing alternatives to franchisees and other end-user customers could adversely impact our operating results.
an integral component of our business and profitability is our ability to offer competitive financing alternatives to franchisees and other end-user customers. the lack of our ability to offer such alternatives or obtain capital resources or other financing to support our receivables on terms that we believe are attractive, whether resulting from the state of the financial markets, our own operating performance, or other factors, would negatively affect our operating results and financial condition. adverse fluctuations in interest rates and/or our ability to provide competitive financing programs could also have an adverse impact on our revenue and profitability.
2021 annual report exposure to credit risks of customers and resellers may make it difficult to collect receivables, and our allowances for credit losses for receivables may prove inadequate, which could adversely affect operating results and financial condition.
a decline in industry and/or economic conditions could have the potential to weaken the financial position of some of our customers, including financial services customers. if circumstances surrounding our customers' ability to repay their credit obligations were to deteriorate and result in the write-down or write-off of such receivables, it would negatively affect our operating results for the relevant period and, if large, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
the company maintains allowances for credit losses for receivables to provide for defaults and nonperformance. these allowances represent an estimate of losses over the remaining contractual lives of our receivables which include current market conditions and estimates for reasonable and supportable forecasts, when appropriate. the determination of the appropriate levels of the allowances for credit losses involves a high degree of subjectivity and judgement, and requires the company to make estimates of credit risks, which may undergo material changes as a result of economic conditions and other factors. the company's allowances may not be adequate to cover actual losses, and future allowances for credit losses could materially and adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
foreign operations are subject to currency exchange, inflation, interest and other risks that could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
the reporting currency for snap-on's consolidated financial statements is the u.s. dollar. certain of the company's assets, liabilities, expenses and revenues are denominated in currencies other than the u.s. dollar. in preparing snap-on's consolidated financial statements, those assets, liabilities, expenses and revenues are translated into u.s. dollars at applicable exchange rates. increases or decreases in exchange rates between the u.s. dollar and other currencies affect the u.s. dollar value of those items, as reflected in the consolidated financial statements. substantial fluctuations in the value of the u.s. dollar or other transactional currencies could have a significant impact on the company's financial condition and results of operations.
we are also affected by changes in inflation rates and interest rates. additionally, cash generated in certain non-u.s. jurisdictions may be difficult to repatriate to the united states in a tax-efficient manner. our foreign operations are also subject to other risks and challenges, such as the need to staff and manage diverse workforces, respond to the needs of multiple national and international marketplaces, and differing business climates and cultures in various countries.
adverse developments in the credit and financial markets could negatively impact the availability of credit that we and our customers need to operate our businesses.
we depend upon the availability of credit to operate our business, including the financing of receivables from end-user customers that are originated by our financial services businesses. our end-user customers, franchisees and suppliers also require access to credit for their businesses. at times, world financial markets have been unstable and subject to uncertainty. adverse developments in the credit and financial markets, or unfavorable changes in snap-on's credit rating, could negatively impact the availability of future financing and the terms on which it might be available to snap-on, its end-user customers, franchisees and suppliers. inability to access credit or capital markets, or a deterioration in the terms on which financing might be available, could have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
increasing our financial leverage could affect our operations and profitability.
the maximum available credit under our multi-currency revolving credit facility is $800 million. the company's leverage ratio may affect both our availability of additional capital resources as well as our operations in several ways, including:
•the terms on which credit may be available to us could be less attractive, both in the economic terms of the credit and the covenants stipulated by the credit terms;
•the possible lack of availability of additional credit or access to the commercial paper market;
•the potential for higher levels of interest expense to service or maintain our outstanding debt;
•the possibility of additional borrowings in the future to repay our indebtedness when it comes due; and
•the possible diversion of capital resources from other uses.
while we believe we will have the ability to service our debt and obtain additional resources in the future if and when needed, that will depend upon our results of operations and financial position at the time, the then-current state of the credit and financial markets, and other factors that may be beyond our control. therefore, we cannot give assurances that credit will be available on terms that we consider attractive, or at all, if and when necessary or beneficial to us.
snap-on incorporated failure to achieve expected investment returns on pension plan assets, as well as changes in interest rates or plan demographics, could adversely impact our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.
snap-on sponsors various defined benefit pension plans (the "pension plans"). the assets of the pension plans are diversified in an attempt to mitigate the risk of a large loss. required funding for the company's domestic defined benefit pension plans is determined in accordance with guidelines set forth in the federal employee retirement income security act ("erisa"); foreign defined benefit pension plans are funded in accordance with local statutes or practice. additional contributions to enhance the funded status of the pension plans can be made at the company's discretion. however, there can be no assurance that the value of the pension plan assets, or the investment returns on those plan assets, will be sufficient to meet the future benefit obligations of such plans. in addition, during periods of adverse investment market conditions and declining interest rates, the company may be required to make additional cash contributions to the pension plans that could reduce our financial flexibility. changes in plan demographics, including an increase in the number of retirements or changes in life expectancy assumptions, may also increase the costs and funding requirements of the obligations related to the company's pension plans.
our pension plan obligations are affected by changes in market interest rates. significant fluctuations in market interest rates have added, and may further add, volatility to our pension plan obligations. in periods of declining market interest rates, our pension plan obligations generally increase; in periods of increasing market interest rates, our pension plan obligations generally decrease. while our plan assets are broadly diversified, there are inherent market risks associated with investments; if adverse market conditions occur, our plan assets could incur significant or material losses. since we may need to make additional contributions to address changes in obligations and/or a loss in plan assets, the combination of declining market interest rates, past or future plan asset investment losses, and/or changes in plan demographics could adversely impact our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.
the company's pension plan expense is comprised of the following factors: (i) service cost; (ii) interest on projected benefit obligations; (iii) expected return on plan assets; (iv) the amortization of prior service costs and credits; (v) effects of actuarial gains and losses; and (vi) settlement/curtailment costs, when applicable. the accounting for pensions involves the estimation of a number of factors that are highly uncertain. certain factors, such as the interest on projected benefit obligations and the expected return on plan assets, are impacted by changes in market interest rates and the value of plan assets. a significant decrease in market interest rates and a decrease in the fair value of plan assets would increase net pension expense and may adversely affect the company's future results of operations. see note 12 to the consolidated financial statements for further information on the company's pension plans.
the recognition of impairment charges on goodwill or other intangible assets would adversely impact our future financial condition and results of operations.
we have a substantial amount of goodwill and purchased intangible assets, almost all of which are booked in the commercial & industrial group and in the repair systems & information group. we are required to perform impairment tests on our goodwill and other intangibles annually or at any time when events occur that could impact the value of our business segments. our determination of whether impairment has occurred is based on a comparison of each of our reporting units' fair market value with its carrying value.
significant and unanticipated changes in circumstances, such as significant and long-term adverse changes in business climate, adverse actions by regulators, unanticipated competition, the loss of key customers, and/or changes in technology or markets, could require a provision for impairment in a future period that could substantially impact our reported earnings and reduce our consolidated net worth and shareholders' equity. should the economic environment in these markets deteriorate, our results of operations and financial position could be materially impacted, including as a result of the effects of potential impairment write-downs of goodwill and/or other intangible assets related to these businesses.
legal and regulatory risks legislation and regulations relating to our business and the countries where we operate, including those related to sustainability matters, as well as any changes to such legislation or regulations, in addition to new compliance obligations or a failure to maintain existing compliance requirements, may, if significant, affect our business, reputation, results of operations and financial condition.
significant changes to legislative and regulatory activity, and compliance burdens, including those associated with: (i) sales to our government, military and defense contractor customers; and (ii) classification of third parties, including our franchisees, as independent from the company, as well as the manner in which they are applied, could significantly impact our business and the economy as a whole.
2021 annual report financial services businesses of all kinds are subject to significant and complex regulations and enforcement. in addition to potentially increasing the costs and other requirements of doing business due to compliance obligations, new laws and regulations, or changes to existing laws and regulations, as well as the enforcement thereof, may affect the relationships between creditors and debtors, inhibit the rights of creditors to collect amounts owed to them, expand liability for certain actions or inaction, or limit the types of financial products or services offered, any or all of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. failure to comply with any of these laws or regulations could also result in civil, criminal, monetary and/or non-monetary penalties, damage to our reputation, and/or the incurrence of remediation costs.
in recent years there has been increased public awareness, concern and focus on environmental and sustainability issues, including matters related to global climate change. the current focus on these matters is expected to result in additional and/or more restrictive regulations, requirements and/or industry or third-party standards to reduce or mitigate global warming and other environmental or sustainability risks, though the timing is uncertain.
increased regulatory requirements or standards may result in increased compliance or input costs, including those related to energy or raw materials, for us and our suppliers. if environmental laws or regulations or industry standards are either changed or adopted, and impose significant operational restrictions and compliance requirements upon the company, the company's business, reputation, results of operations, financial condition and competitive position could be negatively impacted. for example, if significant increases in fuel economy requirements or changes to vehicle emissions requirements for internal combustion engine vehicles were imposed, there could be a decrease in demand for such vehicles and a reduction in miles driven, which could adversely impact the demand for certain of our products and services. furthermore, an inability to successfully manage climate change or sustainability matters, or to effectively respond to new, or changes in, legal or regulatory requirements concerning sustainability matters, or increased operating or manufacturing costs due to changes in the regulatory environment, could adversely affect our business.
these developments, and other potential future legislation and regulations, including the increasing global regulation of privacy rights, may also adversely affect the customers to which, and the markets into which, we sell our products, and increase our costs and otherwise negatively affect our business, reputation, results of operations and financial condition, including in ways that cannot yet be foreseen.
product liability claims and litigation could affect our business, reputation, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
the products that we design and/or manufacture, and/or the services we provide, can lead to product liability claims or other legal claims being filed against us. to the extent that plaintiffs are successful in showing that a defect in a product's design, manufacture or warnings led to personal injury or property damage, or that our provision of services resulted in similar injury or damage, we may be subject to claims for damages. although we are insured for damages above a certain amount, we bear the costs and expenses associated with defending claims, including frivolous lawsuits, and are responsible for damages up to the insurance retention amount. in addition to claims concerning individual products, as a manufacturer, we can be subject to costs, potential negative publicity and lawsuits related to product recalls, which could adversely impact our results of operations and damage our reputation.
legal disputes could adversely affect our business, reputation, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
from time to time we are subject to legal disputes that are being litigated and/or settled in the ordinary course of business. disputes or future lawsuits could result in the diversion of management's time and attention away from business operations. additionally, negative developments with respect to legal disputes and the costs incurred in defending ourselves, even if successful, could have an adverse impact on the company and its reputation. successful outcomes, at trial or on appeal, can never be assured. adverse outcomes or settlements could also require us to pay damages, potentially in excess of amounts reserved, or incur liability for other remedies that could have a material adverse effect on our business, reputation, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
snap-on incorporated our operations expose us to the risk of environmental liabilities, costs, litigation and violations that could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and reputation.
certain of our operations are subject to environmental laws and regulations in the jurisdictions in which they operate, which impose limitations on the discharge of pollutants into the ground, air and water and establish standards for the generation, treatment, use, storage and disposal of hazardous wastes. we must also comply with various health and safety regulations in the united states and abroad in connection with our operations. failure to comply with any of these laws could result in civil and criminal, monetary and non-monetary penalties and damage to our reputation. in addition, we may incur costs related to remedial efforts or alleged environmental damage associated with past or current waste disposal practices. we cannot provide assurance that our costs of complying with current or future environmental protection and health and safety laws will not exceed our estimates.
the inability to successfully defend claims from taxing authorities could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
we conduct business in many countries, which requires us to interpret the income tax laws and rulings in each of those taxing jurisdictions. due to the subjectivity of tax laws in and between jurisdictions, as well as the subjectivity of factual interpretations, our estimates of income tax liabilities may differ from actual payments or assessments. claims from taxing authorities related to these differences could have an adverse impact on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
general risk factor economic conditions and world events could affect our operating results.
in addition to the specific risks above, we, our franchisees and our customers, may be adversely affected by changing economic conditions, including conditions that may particularly impact specific regions. these conditions may result in reduced consumer and investor confidence, instability in the credit and financial markets, volatile corporate profits, and reduced business and consumer spending. we, our franchisees and our customers, and the economy as a whole, also may be affected by future world or local events outside our control, such as tariffs and other trade protection measures put in place by the united states or other countries, acts of terrorism, developments in the war on terrorism, armed conflicts, civil unrest, conflicts in international situations, weather events and natural disasters, outbreaks of infectious diseases such as the ongoing covid-19 pandemic, as well as government-related developments or issues, including changes in tax laws and regulations, including regulations related to climate change and other sustainability matters, and changes in financial accounting standards. these factors may affect the results of operations by reducing our sales, margins and/or net earnings as a result of a slowdown in customer orders or order cancellations, impact the availability and/or pricing of raw materials and/or the supply chain, and could potentially lead to future impairment of goodwill or other intangible assets. in addition, political, social turmoil, international conflicts and terrorist acts may put pressure on global economic conditions. unstable political, social and economic conditions may make it difficult for our franchisees, customers, suppliers and us to accurately forecast and plan future business activities. if such conditions persist, our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be negatively affected.
item 7: management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations management overview we believe our 2021 operating results demonstrate the continued momentum of our operations and confirms the resilience of our markets and our considerable capabilities to overcome the challenges of the covid environment. throughout the turbulence, we maintained and further developed our ongoing advantages in our products, brands and people. at the same time, we leveraged existing proficiencies to focus on expanding our professional customer base, not only in automotive repair, but in adjacent markets, additional geographies and other areas, including critical industries, where the cost and penalties for failure can be high. snap-on's value proposition of making work easier for serious professionals is an ongoing strength as we move forward along our runways for coherent growth:
•enhancing the franchise network, where we continued to focus on helping our franchisees extend their reach through innovative selling processes and productivity initiatives that break the traditional time and space barriers inherent in a mobile van;
•expanding with repair shop owners and managers, where we continued to make progress in connecting with customers and translating the resulting insights into innovation that solves specific challenges in the repair facility;
•further extending to critical industries, where we continued to grow our lines of products customized for specific industries, including through further integration of acquisitions; and
•building in emerging markets, where we continued to maintain manufacturing capacity, as well as refine product lines and distribution capabilities.
our strategic priorities and plans for 2022 involve continuing to build on our snap-on value creation processes - our suite of strategic principles and processes we employ every day designed to create value, and employed in the areas of safety, quality, customer connection, innovation and rapid continuous improvement ("rapid continuous improvement" or "rci"). we expect to continue to deploy these processes in our existing operations as well as into our recently acquired businesses.
snap-on's rci initiatives employ a structured set of tools and processes across multiple businesses and geographies intended to eliminate waste and improve operations. savings from snap-on's rci initiatives reflect benefits from a wide variety of ongoing efficiency, productivity and process improvements, including savings generated from product design cost reductions, improved manufacturing line set-up and change-over practices, lower-cost sourcing initiatives and facility consolidations. unless individually significant, it is not practicable to disclose each rci activity that generated savings and/or segregate rci savings embedded in sales volume increases.
our global financial services operations continue to serve a significant strategic role in offering financing options to our franchisees, to their customers, and to customers in other parts of our business. we expect that our global financial services business, which includes both snap-on credit llc ("soc") in the united states and our other international finance subsidiaries, will continue to be a meaningful contributor to our operating earnings going forward.

a discussion regarding our financial condition and results of operations for fiscal 2020 compared to fiscal 2019 can be found under "part ii, item 7: management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations," in our annual report on the form 10-k for the fiscal year ended january 2, 2021, which was filed with the sec on february 11, 2021, and is available on the sec's website at www.sec.gov as well as in the "investors" section of our corporate website at www.snapon.com.
2021 annual report management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations (continued)
non-gaap measures references in this management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations to "organic sales" refer to sales from continuing operations calculated in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states of america ("gaap"), adjusted to exclude acquisition-related sales and the impact of foreign currency translation. management evaluates the company's sales performance based on organic sales growth, which primarily reflects growth from the company's existing businesses as a result of increased output, expanded customer base, geographic expansion, new product development and pricing changes, and excludes sales contributions from acquired operations the company did not own as of the comparable prior-year reporting period. organic sales also exclude the effects of foreign currency translation as foreign currency translation is subject to volatility that can obscure underlying business trends. management believes that the non-gaap financial measure of organic sales is meaningful to investors as it provides them with useful information to aid in identifying underlying growth trends in the company's businesses and facilitates comparisons of its sales performance with prior periods.
effect of covid-19
our markets and our operations possess and, indeed, have demonstrated considerable resilience against the effects of the pandemic. during 2021, the impact on sales and the need for remediating costs associated with the pandemic have lessened, particularly from the heavily-impacted second quarter of 2020. the company sustained the accommodation of its operations to the virus environment, continuing without significant disruption to serve its franchisees and other professional customers as they performed their essential work, while taking what it believes to be appropriate measures to ensure the health and safety of its people. throughout the pandemic, snap-on has generally maintained its workforce and manufacturing capacity, as well as its investments in brand building and product development. as the global supply chain inefficiencies and associated cost increases caused by the covid-19 pandemic have developed, the company has taken steps to ensure access to raw materials, components and purchased finished goods, and to provide for counterbalancing price and efficiency offsets. see also part i, item 1a: risk factors - risk related to covid-19 and other infectious diseases.

financial services revenue is generally dependent on the size of the average financial services portfolio during the period, as well as on the average yield on receivables in the period. financial services revenue of $349.7 million in 2021 was unchanged from 2020, as the size of the average financial services portfolio and the average yields on receivables were largely the same in both years. in both 2021 and 2020, the average yield on finance receivables was 17.7% and the average yield on contract receivables was 8.5%. originations of $1,073.2 million in 2021 increased $36.6 million, or 3.5%, from 2020 levels.
financial services expenses primarily include personnel-related and other general and administrative costs, as well as expenses for credit losses. these expenses are generally more dependent on changes in the financial services portfolio than they are on the revenue of the segment. financial services expenses in 2021 decreased $23.4 million from last year primarily due to lower provisions for credit losses as compared to those recorded in 2020, which included a $2.6 million charge related to higher credit reserves resulting from the economic uncertainty associated with the covid-19 pandemic. as a percentage of the average financial services portfolio, financial services expenses were 3.5% and 4.6% in 2021 and 2020, respectively.
as a result of these factors, segment operating earnings of $272.0 million in 2021, including $2.3 million of favorable foreign currency effects, increased $23.4 million, or 9.4%, from 2020 levels.

snap-on incorporated liquidity and capital resources snap-on's growth has historically been funded by a combination of cash provided by operating activities and debt financing. snap-on believes that its cash from operations and collections of finance receivables, coupled with its sources of borrowings and available cash on hand, are sufficient to fund its currently anticipated requirements for scheduled debt repayments, payments of interest and dividends, new receivables originated by our financial services businesses, capital expenditures, working capital, the funding of pension plans, and funding for share repurchases and acquisitions, if and as they arise.
due to snap-on's credit rating over the years, external funds have been available at an acceptable cost. as of february 4, 2022, snap-on's long-term debt and commercial paper were rated, respectively, a2 and p-1 by moody's investors service; a- and a-2 by standard & poor's; and a and f1 by fitch ratings. snap-on believes that its current credit arrangements are sound and that the strength of its balance sheet affords the company the financial flexibility, including through access to financial markets for potential new financing, to respond to both internal growth opportunities and those available through acquisitions. however, snap-on cannot provide any assurance that financing will be available in the future on acceptable terms, or that its debt ratings will not decrease.
the following discussion focuses on information included in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.
as of 2021 year end, working capital (current assets less current liabilities) of $2,071.2 million increased $153.1 million from $1,918.1 million as of 2020 year end primarily as a result of other net changes in working capital discussed below.

cash and cash equivalents of $780.0 million as of 2021 year end decreased $143.4 million from 2020 year-end levels primarily due to: (i) the funding of $878.1 million of new finance receivables; (ii) the repurchase of 1,943,900 shares of the company's common stock for $431.3 million; (iii) dividend payments to shareholders of $275.8 million; (iv) the repayment of $250.0 million of the 2021 notes; (v) the funding of $199.7 million for acquisitions; and (vi) the funding of $70.1 million for capital expenditures. these decreases in cash and cash equivalents were partially offset by: (i) $966.6 million of cash generated from operations; (ii) $854.2 million of cash from collections of finance receivables; (iii) $162.4 million of cash proceeds from stock purchase and option plan exercises; and (iv) $3.3 million of net proceeds from notes payable and other short-term borrowings.
of the $780.0 million of cash and cash equivalents as of 2021 year end, $293.1 million was held outside of the united states. snap-on maintains non-u.s. funds in its foreign operations to: (i) provide adequate working capital; (ii) satisfy various regulatory requirements; and/or (iii) take advantage of business expansion opportunities as they arise. although the tax cuts and jobs act ("tax act") generally eliminated u.s. federal taxation of dividends from foreign subsidiaries, such dividends may still be subject to state income taxation and foreign withholding taxes. snap-on periodically evaluates its cash held outside the united states and may pursue opportunities to repatriate certain foreign cash amounts to the extent that it can be accomplished in a tax efficient manner.
2021 annual report management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations (continued)
trade and other accounts receivable - net of $682.3 million as of 2021 year end increased $41.6 million from 2020 year-end levels primarily due to higher sales and $9.7 million from acquisitions, partially offset by $12.5 million of foreign currency translation. days sales outstanding (trade and other accounts receivable - net as of the respective period end, divided by the respective trailing 12 months sales, times 360 days) was 58 days and 64 days at the respective 2021 and 2020 year ends.
the current portions of net finance and contract receivables of $652.7 million as of 2021 year end compared to $642.7 million at 2020 year end. the long-term portions of net finance and contract receivables of $1,492.2 million as of 2021 year end compared to $1,511.0 million at 2020 year end. the combined $8.8 million decrease in net current and long-term finance and contract receivables compared to 2020 year-end levels is primarily due to $36.6 million of higher originations more than offset by collections and other reductions as well as $2.6 million of unfavorable foreign currency translation.
inventories - net of $803.8 million as of 2021 year end increased $57.3 million from 2020 year-end levels primarily to support higher customer demand, new product innovations and $2.8 million from acquisitions, partially offset by $16.1 million of foreign currency translation. as of 2021 and 2020 year end, inventory turns (trailing 12 months of cost of goods sold, divided by the average of the beginning and ending inventory balance for the trailing 12 months) were 2.8 turns and 2.4 turns, respectively. inventories accounted for using the first-in, first-out ("fifo") method as of 2021 and 2020 year end approximated 60% and 57% of total inventories, respectively. all other inventories are accounted for using the last-in, first-out ("lifo") method. the company's lifo reserve was $87.2 million and $84.0 million at 2021 and 2020 year end, respectively.
as of 2021 year end, notes payable and current maturities of long-term debt consisted of $17.4 million of other notes. notes payable of $268.5 million as of 2020 year end consisted of $250.0 million of the 2021 notes and $18.5 million of other notes.
average notes payable outstanding, including commercial paper borrowings in 2020 and short-term credit facility borrowings in both years, were $16.7 million and $68.4 million in 2021 and 2020, respectively. the 2021 weighted-average interest rate on such borrowings of 8.39% compared with 2.98% in 2020. there were no commercial paper borrowings during 2021. average commercial paper borrowings were $41.0 million in 2020 with a weighted-average interest rate of 1.53%. no commercial paper was outstanding as of year-end 2021 or 2020. there were no amounts borrowed under the short-term credit facility during 2021. average short-term credit facility borrowings were $13.9 million in 2020 with a weighted-average interest rate of 1.7%. no amounts were outstanding under the short-term credit facility as of year-end 2021 or 2020. at 2021 year end, the weighted-average interest rate on outstanding notes payable of 8.39% compared with 8.87% in 2020. the 2021 year-end rate decreased primarily due to lower rates on local borrowings in emerging markets.
accounts payable of $277.6 million as of 2021 year end increased $54.7 million from 2020 year-end levels, primarily due to the timing of payments and $3.4 million from acquisitions, partially offset by $3.4 million of foreign currency translation.
other accrued liabilities of $424.3 million as of 2021 year end decreased $21.2 million from 2020 year-end levels primarily due to lower tax accruals and $7.1 million of foreign currency translation, partially offset by $3.7 million from acquisitions.
long-term debt of $1,182.9 million as of 2021 year end consisted of: (i) $300.0 million of unsecured 3.25% notes that mature on march 1, 2027 (the "2027 notes"); (ii) $400.0 million of unsecured 4.10% notes that mature on march 1, 2048 ("the 2048 notes"); and (iii) $500.0 million of 3.10% notes that mature on may 1, 2050 (the "2050 notes"), partially offset by $17.1 million from the net effects of debt amortization costs.
snap-on has an $800 million multi-currency revolving credit facility that terminates on september 16, 2024 (the "credit facility"); no amounts were outstanding under the credit facility as of january 1, 2022. borrowings under the credit facility bear interest at varying rates based on either: (i) snap-on's then-current, long-term debt ratings; or (ii) snap-on's then-current ratio of consolidated debt net of certain cash adjustments ("consolidated net debt") to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization and certain other adjustments for the preceding four fiscal quarters then ended (the "consolidated net debt to ebitda ratio"). the credit facility's financial covenant requires that snap-on maintain, as of each fiscal quarter end, either (i) a ratio not greater than 0.60 to 1.00 of consolidated net debt to the sum of consolidated net debt plus total equity and less accumulated other comprehensive income or loss (the "leverage ratio"); or (ii) a consolidated net debt to ebitda ratio not greater than 3.50 to 1.00. snap-on may, up to two times during any five-year period during the term of the credit facility (including any extensions thereof), elect to increase the maximum leverage ratio to 0.65 to 1.00 and/or increase the maximum consolidated net debt to ebitda ratio to 4.00 to 1.00 for four consecutive fiscal quarters in connection with certain material acquisitions (as defined in the related credit agreement). as of january 1, 2022, the company's actual ratios of 0.09 and 0.37 respectively, were both within the permitted ranges set forth in this financial covenant. snap-on generally issues commercial paper to fund its financing needs on a short-term basis and uses the credit facility as back-up liquidity to support such commercial paper issuances.
snap-on incorporated snap-on's credit facility and other debt agreements also contain certain usual and customary borrowing, affirmative, negative and maintenance covenants. as of 2021 year end, snap-on was in compliance with all covenants of its credit facility and other debt agreements.
snap-on believes it has sufficient available cash and access to both committed and uncommitted credit facilities to cover its expected funding needs on both a short-term and long-term basis. snap-on manages its aggregate short-term borrowings so as not to exceed its availability under the credit facility. snap-on believes that it can access short-term debt markets, predominantly through commercial paper issuances and existing lines of credit, to fund its short-term requirements and to ensure near-term liquidity. snap-on regularly monitors the credit and financial markets and, if it believes conditions are favorable, it may take advantage of such conditions to issue long-term debt to further improve its liquidity and capital resources. near-term liquidity requirements for snap-on include payments of interest and dividends, funding to support new receivables originated by our financial services businesses, capital expenditures, working capital, the funding of pension plans, and funding for share repurchases and acquisitions, if and as they arise. snap-on intends to make contributions of $9.4 million to its foreign pension plans and $9.5 million to its domestic pension plans in 2022, as required by law. depending on market and other conditions, snap-on may make discretionary cash contributions to its pension plans in 2022.
snap-on's long-term financing strategy is to maintain continuous access to the debt markets to accommodate its liquidity needs, including the potential use of commercial paper, additional fixed-term debt and/or securitizations.
the following discussion focuses on information included in the accompanying consolidated statements of cash flows.
operating activities net cash provided by operating activities of $966.6 million in 2021 decreased $42.0 million from $1,008.6 million in 2020. the $42.0 million decrease is primarily due to a $253.6 million change in net operating assets and liabilities, partially offset by a $195.0 million increase in net earnings.
depreciation expense was $75.6 million in 2021 and $73.3 million in 2020. amortization expense was $29.2 million in 2021 and $23.4 million in 2020. see note 7 to the consolidated financial statements for information on goodwill and other intangible assets.
investing activities net cash used by investing activities of $290.4 million in 2021 included additions to finance receivables of $878.1 million, partially offset by collections of $854.2 million. net cash used by investing activities of $187.8 million in 2020 included additions to finance receivables of $835.0 million, partially offset by collections of $750.3 million. finance receivables are comprised of extended-term installment payment contracts to both technicians and independent shop owners (i.e., franchisees' customers) to enable them to purchase tools, diagnostics, and equipment products on an extended-term payment plan, generally with payment terms of approximately four years.
net cash used by investing activities in 2021 also included a total of $199.7 million for the acquisitions of dealer-fx, autocrib germany and pradines. net cash used by investing activities in 2020 included a total of $41.5 million for the acquisitions of sigmavision and autocrib and a $0.2 million working capital adjustment for the 2019 cognitran acquisition. see note 3 to the consolidated financial statements for information about acquisitions.
capital expenditures in 2021 and 2020 totaled $70.1 million and $65.6 million, respectively. capital expenditures in both years included continued investments related to the company's execution of its strategic value creation processes. the company also invested in: (i) new product, efficiency, safety and cost reduction initiatives that are intended to expand and improve its manufacturing and distribution capabilities worldwide; (ii) new production and machine tooling to enhance manufacturing operations, as well as ongoing replacements of manufacturing and distribution equipment, particularly in the united states; and (iii) the ongoing enhancement of the company's global enterprise resource planning (erp) management information systems. snap-on believes that its cash generated from operations, as well as its available cash on hand and funds available from its credit facilities will be sufficient to fund the company's capital expenditure requirements in 2022.
2021 annual report management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations (continued)
financing activities net cash used by financing activities of $818.8 million in 2021 included the $250.0 million repayment of the 2021 notes at maturity and net proceeds from notes payable and other short-term borrowings of $3.3 million. net cash used by financing activities of $84.3 million in 2020 included snap-on's sale, on april 27, 2020, of $500 million of the 2050 notes at a discount, from which snap-on received $489.9 million of net proceeds, reflecting $4.4 million of transaction costs, partially offset by repayments of notes payable and other short-term borrowings of $187.2 million.
proceeds from stock purchase and option plan exercises totaled $162.4 million in 2021 and $55.8 million in 2020. snap-on has undertaken stock repurchases from time to time to offset dilution created by shares issued for employee and franchisee stock purchase plans, as well as stock options, and for other corporate purposes. in 2021, snap-on repurchased 1,943,900 shares of its common stock for $431.3 million under its previously announced share repurchase programs. as of 2021 year end, snap-on had remaining availability to repurchase up to an additional $454.9 million in common stock pursuant to its board's authorizations. the purchase of snap-on common stock is at the company's discretion, subject to prevailing financial and market conditions. snap-on repurchased 1,109,000 shares of its common stock for $174.3 million in 2020. snap-on believes that its cash generated from operations, available cash on hand, and funds available from its credit facilities, will be sufficient to fund the company's additional share repurchases, if any.
snap-on has paid consecutive quarterly cash dividends, without interruption or reduction, since 1939. cash dividends paid in 2021 and 2020 totaled $275.8 million and $243.3 million, respectively. on november 4, 2021, the company announced that its board increased the quarterly cash dividend by 15.4% to $1.42 per share ($5.68 per share annualized). quarterly dividends in 2021 were $1.42 per share in the fourth quarter and $1.23 per share in the first three quarters ($5.11 per share for the year). quarterly dividends in 2020 were $1.23 per share in the fourth quarter and $1.08 per share in the first three quarters ($4.47 per share for the year).
2021                   2020
cash dividends paid per common share                                                  $5.11                  $4.47
cash dividends paid as a percentage of prior-year retained earnings                     5.3   %                5.1   %
snap-on believes that its cash generated from operations, available cash on hand, and funds available from its credit facilities, will be sufficient to pay dividends in 2022.
contractual obligations and commitments snap-on's contractual obligations for long-term debt and operating and finance leases are reflected in the consolidated balance sheets; see note 10 and note 17 to the consolidated financial statements for information on the company's long-term debt and leases. snap-on also enters into contracts for future purchases in the normal course of business. as of year-end 2021, the company had $147.5 million in purchase commitments to be paid in 2022 and $17.3 million to be paid thereafter.
snap-on intends to make contributions of $9.4 million to its foreign pension plans and $9.5 million to its domestic pension plans in 2022, as required by law.  depending on market and other conditions, snap-on may make additional discretionary cash contributions to its pension plans in 2022; see note 12 and note 13 to the consolidated financial statements for information on the company's benefit plans and payments.
due to the uncertainty of the timing of settlements with taxing authorities, snap-on is unable to make reasonably reliable estimates of the period of cash settlement of unrecognized tax benefits totaling $8.9 million for its remaining uncertain tax liabilities. see note 9 to the consolidated financial statements for information on income taxes.
snap-on incorporated environmental matters snap-on is subject to various federal, state and local government requirements regulating the discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment. snap-on's policy is to comply with these requirements and the company believes that, as a general matter, its policies, practices and procedures are properly designed to prevent unreasonable risk of environmental damage, and of resulting financial liability, in connection with its business. some risk of environmental damage is, however, inherent in some of snap-on's operations and products, as it is with other companies engaged in similar businesses.
snap-on is and has been engaged in the handling, manufacture, use and disposal of many substances classified as hazardous or toxic by one or more regulatory agencies. snap-on believes that, as a general matter, its handling, manufacture, use and disposal of these substances are in accordance with environmental laws and regulations. it is possible, however, that future knowledge or other developments, such as improved capability to detect substances in the environment or increasingly strict environmental laws and standards and enforcement policies, could affect the company's handling, manufacture, use or disposal of these substances.
in recent years there has been increased public awareness, concern and focus on environmental and sustainability issues, including matters related to global climate change. the current focus on these matters is expected to result in additional and/or more restrictive regulations, requirements and/or industry or third-party standards to reduce or mitigate global warming and other environmental or sustainability risks, though the timing is uncertain. snap-on is monitoring developments in this area.
new accounting standards see note 1 to the consolidated financial statements for information on new accounting standards.
critical accounting policies and estimates the consolidated financial statements and related notes contain information that is pertinent to management's discussion and analysis. the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america ("gaap") requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. these estimates are generally based on historical experience, current conditions and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily available from other sources, as well as identifying and assessing our accounting treatment with respect to commitments and contingencies. actual results could differ from those estimates.
in addition to the company's significant accounting policies described in note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, snap-on considers the following policies and estimates to be the most critical in understanding the judgments that are involved in the preparation of the company's consolidated financial statements and the uncertainties that could impact the company's financial position, results of operations and cash flows.
allowance for credit losses on finance receivables: the allowance for credit losses on finance receivables is maintained at a level management believes is adequate to cover expected losses in snap-on's finance receivables portfolio as of the reporting date. the allowance represents management's estimate of the expected losses in the company's finance receivables portfolio based on ongoing assessments and evaluations of credit losses over the expected contractual life of the receivables portfolio considering collectability, historical loss experience, current conditions and future market changes. determination of the proper level of allowance requires management to exercise judgment about the timing, frequency and severity of credit losses that could materially affect the provision for credit losses and, as a result, net earnings. the allowance takes into consideration numerous quantitative and qualitative factors that include receivable type, historical loss experience, delinquency trends, collection experience, current and future economic conditions and credit risk characteristics. some of these factors are influenced by items such as the customers' financial condition, past payment experience, credit bureau and proprietary snap-on credit model information, as well as the value of the underlying collateral. changes in economic conditions and assumptions, including the resulting credit quality metrics relative to the performance of the finance receivables portfolio, create uncertainty and could result in changes to both the allowance for credit losses and provision for credit losses.

management utilizes established policies and procedures in an effort to ensure the estimates and assumptions are well controlled, reviewed and consistently applied. as of january 1, 2022, the ratio of the allowance for credit losses to finance receivables was 3.90%. as of january 2, 2021, the allowance ratio was 4.38%.  while management believes it exercises prudent judgment and applies reasonable assumptions in establishing its estimates for allowances for finance receivables, there can be no assurance that changes in economic conditions or other factors would not adversely impact the financial health of our customers and result in changes to the estimates used in the allowance calculation. for reference, a 100 bps increase in the allowance ratios for finance receivables as of january 1, 2022, would have increased snap-on's 2021 provision for credit losses and related allowance for credit losses by approximately $17.2 million.

impairment of goodwill: goodwill is tested for impairment annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the assets might be impaired. annual impairment tests are performed by the company in the second quarter of each year using information available as of april month end.
snap-on evaluates the recoverability of goodwill by estimating the future discounted cash flows of the businesses to which the goodwill relates. estimated cash flows and related goodwill are grouped at the reporting unit level. the company has determined that its reporting units for testing goodwill impairment are its operating segments or components of an operating segment that constitute a business for which discrete financial information is available and for which segment management regularly reviews the operating results. within its four reportable operating segments, the company has identified 11 reporting units.
snap-on evaluates the recoverability of goodwill by utilizing an income approach that estimates the fair value of the future discounted cash flows of the reporting units to which the goodwill relates. the future projections, which are based on both past performance and the projections and assumptions used in the company's operating plans, are subject to change as a result of changing economic and competitive conditions. this approach reflects management's internal outlook at the reporting units, which management believes provides the best determination of value due to management's insight and experience with the reporting units. significant estimates used by management in the discounted cash flows methodology include estimates of future cash flows based on expected growth rates, price increases, working capital levels, expected benefits from rci initiatives, and a weighted-average cost of capital that reflects the specific risk profile of the reporting unit being tested. the company's methodologies for valuing goodwill are applied consistently on a year-over-year basis; the assumptions used in performing the second quarter 2021 impairment calculations were evaluated in light of then-current market and business conditions. snap-on continues to believe that the future discounted cash flow valuation model provides the most reasonable and meaningful fair value estimate based upon the reporting units' projections of future operating results and cash flows and replicates how market participants would value the company's reporting units in an orderly transaction.
in the event the fair value of a reporting unit is less than the carrying value, including goodwill, the company would then record an impairment charge based on the excess of a reporting units carrying amount over its fair value.
inherent in fair value determinations are significant judgments and estimates, including material assumptions about future revenue, profitability and cash flows, the company's operational plans and its interpretation of current economic indicators. should the operations of the businesses with which goodwill is associated incur significant declines in profitability and cash flow due to significant and long-term deterioration in macroeconomic, industry and market conditions, the loss of key customers, changes in technology or markets, significant changes in key personnel or litigation, a significant and sustained decrease in share price and/or other events, including effects from the sale or disposal of a reporting unit, some or all of the recorded goodwill could be subject to impairment and could result in a material adverse effect on snap-on's financial position or results of operations.
snap-on incorporated snap-on completed its annual impairment testing of goodwill in the second quarter of 2021, which did not result in any impairment. as of 2021 year end, the company has no accumulated impairment losses. although the company consistently uses the same methods in developing the assumptions and estimates underlying the fair value calculations, such estimates are uncertain by nature and can vary from actual results. in performing its annual impairment testing the company performed a sensitivity analysis on the material assumptions used in the discounted cash flow valuation models for each of its 11 reporting units. based on the company's second quarter 2021 impairment testing, and assuming a hypothetical 10% decrease in the estimated fair values of each of its 11 reporting units, the hypothetical fair value of each of the company's 11 reporting units would have been greater than its carrying value. see note 7 to the consolidated financial statements for further information about goodwill.
pension benefits: the pension benefit obligation and related pension expense are calculated in accordance with gaap and are impacted by certain actuarial assumptions. changes in these assumptions are primarily influenced by factors outside of snap-on's control, such as changes in economic conditions, and can have a significant effect on the amounts reported in the financial statements. snap-on believes that the two most critical assumptions are (i) the expected return on plan assets; and (ii) the assumed discount rate.
snap-on's domestic pension plans have a long-term investment horizon and a total return strategy that emphasizes a capital growth objective. in 2021, the long-term investment performance objective for snap-on's domestic plans' assets was to achieve net of expense returns that met or exceeded the 6.75% domestic expected return on plan assets assumption. snap-on uses a three-year, market-related value asset method of amortizing the difference between actual and expected returns on its domestic plans' assets. as of 2021 year end, snap-on's domestic pension plans' assets comprised approximately 86% of the company's worldwide pension plan assets.
based on forward-looking capital market expectations, snap-on selected an expected return on plan assets assumption for its u.s. pension plans of 6.50%, a decrease of 25 bps from 2021, to be used in determining pension expense for 2022. in estimating the domestic expected return on plan assets, snap-on utilizes a nominal returns forecasting method. for each asset class, future returns are estimated by identifying the premium of riskier asset classes over lower risk alternatives. the methodology constructs expected returns using a "building block" approach to the individual components of total return. these forecasts are stated in both nominal and real (after inflation) terms. this process first considers the long-term historical return premium based on the longest set of data available for each asset class. these premiums, calculated using the geometric mean, are then adjusted based on current relative valuation levels, macro-economic conditions, and the expected alpha related to active investment management. the asset return assumption is also adjusted by an implicit expense load for estimated administrative and investment-related expenses. since asset allocation is a key determinant of expected investment returns, the current and expected mix of plan assets are also considered when setting the assumption.
pension expense increases as the expected rate of return on plan assets decreases. lowering the expected rate of return assumption for snap-on's domestic pension plans' assets by 50 bps would have increased snap-on's 2021 domestic pension expense by approximately $6.2 million.
the objective of snap-on's discount rate assumption is to reflect the rate at which the pension benefits could be effectively settled. in making this determination, the company takes into account the timing and amount of benefits that would be available under the plans. the domestic discount rate as of 2021 and 2020 year end was selected based on a cash flow matching methodology developed by the company's outside actuaries and which incorporates a review of current economic conditions. this methodology matches the plans' yearly projected cash flows for benefits and service costs to those of hypothetical bond portfolios using high-quality, aa rated or better, corporate bonds from either moody's investors service or standard & poor's credit rating agencies available at the measurement date. this technique calculates bond portfolios that produce adequate cash flows to pay the plans' projected yearly benefits and then selects the portfolio with the highest yield and uses that yield as the recommended discount rate.
2021 annual report management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations (continued)
the selection of the 2.9% weighted-average discount rate for snap-on's domestic pension plans as of 2021 year end (compared to 2.7% as of 2020 year end) represents the single rate that produces the same present value of cash flows as the estimated benefit plan payments. lowering snap-on's domestic discount rate assumption by 50 bps would have increased snap-on's 2021 domestic pension expense and projected benefit obligation by approximately $4.0 million and $77.0 million, respectively. as of 2021 year end, snap-on's domestic projected benefit obligation comprised approximately 82% of snap-on's worldwide projected benefit obligation. the weighted-average discount rate for snap-on's foreign pension plans of 2.0% (compared to 1.7% as of 2020 year end) represents the single rate that produces the same present value of cash flows as the estimated benefit plan payments. lowering snap-on's foreign discount rate assumption by 50 bps would have increased snap-on's 2021 foreign pension expense and projected benefit obligation by approximately $2.4 million and $27.8 million, respectively.
actuarial gains and losses in excess of 10 percent of the greater of the projected benefit obligation or market-related value of assets are amortized on a straight-line basis over the average remaining service period of active participants or over the average remaining life expectancy for plans with primarily inactive participants. prior service costs and credits resulting from plan amendments are amortized in equal annual amounts over the average remaining service period of active participants or over the average remaining life expectancy for plans with primarily inactive participants.
to determine the 2022 net periodic benefit cost, snap-on is using weighted-average discount rates for its domestic and foreign pension plans of 2.9% and 2.0%, respectively, and an expected return on plan assets for its domestic pension plans of 6.50%. the expected returns on plan assets for foreign pension plans ranged from 1.3% to 5.6% as of 2021 year end. due to the net change in these two key assumptions, in addition to the overall benefit plan status, snap-on expects to have pension income in 2022. other factors, such as changes in plan demographics and discretionary contributions, may further increase or decrease pension income in 2022. see note 12 to the consolidated financial statements for further information on pension plans.
outlook covid-19, its subsequent variants, as well as related supply chain inefficiencies, continue to impact economic activity worldwide in 2022. snap-on is accommodating to the virus-related turbulence and is capitalizing on opportunities in this mixed environment. the company believes that our markets and our operations possess and, indeed, have demonstrated considerable resilience against the impact of the virus and that there will be ongoing advancement even in the midst of the pandemic. the trajectory, however, may be uncertain due to the evolving nature and duration of the situation.
snap-on expects to make continued progress in 2022 along its defined runways for coherent growth, leveraging capabilities already demonstrated in the automotive repair arena and developing and expanding its professional customer base, not only in automotive repair, but in adjacent markets, additional geographies and other areas, including extending in critical industries, where the cost and penalties for failure can be high. in pursuit of these initiatives, it is projected that capital expenditures in 2022 will be in a range of $90 million to $100 million. snap-on continues to respond to global macroeconomic challenges through its rci process and other cost reduction initiatives.
snap-on currently anticipates that its full year 2022 effective income tax rate will be in the range of 23% to 24%.

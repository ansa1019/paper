2021 10-k our technologies, systems and networks may be subject to cyberattacks.
our business, like others within the oil and gas industry, has become increasingly dependent on digital technologies, some of which are managed by third
-party service providers on whom we rely to help us collect, host or process information.
among other activities, we rely on digital technology to estimate oil and gas reserves, process and record financial and operating data, analyze seismic and drilling information and communicate with employees and third-parties.
as a result, we face various cybersecurity threats such as attempts to gain unauthorized access to, or control of, sensitive information about our operations and our employees, attempts to render our data or systems
(or those of third-parties with whom we do business, including third-party cloud and it service providers) corrupted or unusable, threats to the security of our facilities and infrastructure as well as those of third-parties with whom we do business, including third-party cloud and it service providers, and attempted cyber terrorism.
in addition, computers control oil and gas production, processing equipment and distribution systems globally and are necessary to deliver our production to market.
a disruption, failure, or a cyberattack of these operating systems, or of the networks ,
software and infrastructure on which they rely, many of which are not owned or operated by us, could damage critical production, distribution or storage assets, delay or prevent delivery to markets, make it difficult or impossible to accurately account for production and settle transactions, or negatively impact public health or safety, economic security, or national security.
although we have experienced occasional cybersecurity incidents, none have had a material effect on our business, operations or reputation.
as cyberattacks have continued to evolve, we have become subject to new government-imposed security requirements to implement specific mitigation measures to protect against ransomware attacks and other known threats to information and operations technology.
in response, we must continually expend additional resources to continue to modify or enhance our protective measures or to investigate and remediate any vulnerabilities detected.
our implementation of reasonable security procedures and controls to monitor and mitigate security threats and to increase security for our information, facilities and infrastructure may result in increased costs.
despite our ongoing investments in security resources, talent and business practices, we are unable to assure that any security measures will be completely effective.
if our systems and infrastructure were to be breached, damaged or disrupted, we could be subject to serious negative consequences, including disruption of our operations, damage to our reputation, a loss of counterparty trust, reimbursement or other costs, increased compliance costs, litigation exposure and legal liability or regulatory fines, penalties or intervention.
in addition, we have exposure to cybersecurity incidents and the negative impacts of such incidents related to our data and proprietary information housed on third-party it systems, including the cloud.
any of these could materially and adversel y
affect our business, results of operations or financial condition, and any of the foregoing can be exacerbated by a delay or failure to detect a cybersecurity incident or the full extent of such incident notwithstanding reasonable security procedures and controls.
the prevalence of remote working during the pandemic has introduced additional cybersecurity risk.
although we have business continuity plans in place, our operations may be adversely affected by significant and widespread disruption to our systems and infrastructure that support our business.
while we continue to evolve and modify our business continuity plans, there can be no assurance that they will be completely effective in avoiding disruption and business impacts.
further, our insurance may not be adequate to compensate us for all resulting losses, and the cost to obtain adequate coverage may increase for us in the future.

business environment and executive overview conocophillips is one of the world's leading e&p companies based on both production and reserves with operations and activities in 14 countries.
our diverse, low cost of supply portfolio includes resource-rich unconventional plays in north america; conventional assets in north america, europe and asia; lng developments; oil sands assets in canada; and an inventory of global conventional and unconventional exploration prospects.
headquartered in houston, texas, at december 31, 2021, we employed approximately
9,900 people worldwide and had total assets of $91 billion.
completed acquisitions on january 15, 2021, we completed our acquisition of concho resources inc. (concho), an independent oil and gas exploration and production company with operations across new mexico and west texas in an all-stock transaction for $13.1 billion.
see note 3
.
in december 2021, we completed our acquisition of shell enterprises llc's (shell) assets in the delaware basin in an all-cash transaction for $8.7 billion after customary adjustments.
assets acquired include approximately
225,000 net acres of producing properties located entirely in texas.

see item 1a "risk factors" for further discussion of the risks related to integration of the assets acquired.
overview after an unprecedented 2020, the energy landscape improved throughout
2021 with prices reaching pre-pandemic levels in the second half of the year;
however, we expect prices will continue to be cyclical and volatile.
our view is that a successful business strategy in the e&p industry must be resilient in lower price environments while also retaining upside during periods of higher prices.
as such, we are unhedged, remain highly disciplined in our investment decisions and continually monitor market fundamentals, including opec plus updates regarding supply guidance and inventory levels.
although global oil demand improved through
2021, the global economic recovery remains uncertain and subject to various risk factors, including actions taken to stem the proliferation of covid-

conocophillips
2021 10-k as the macro energy environment continues to evolve, we are embracing what we believe sector leadership requires through what we call our triple mandate.
we believe that conocophillips will play an essential role in meeting energy transition pathway demand delivering superior and consistent returns on and of capital through the price cycles, and achieving our net zero ambition on operational emissions, while retaining the flexibility to successfully adapt as the future unfolds.
our triple mandate is supported by financial principles and capital allocation priorities that should allow us to deliver superior returns through the cycles.
our financial principles consist of maintaining balance sheet strength, providing peer-leading distributions, making disciplined investments, and delivering esg excellence, all of which are in service to delivering competitive financial returns.
our 2021 acquisitions of concho and the shell permian assets further reinforce our differential value proposition.
in 2021, we successfully delivered on our priorities.
total company production was
1,567 mboed yielding cash provided by operating activities of $17 billion.
we invested
$5.3 billion into the business in the form of capital expenditures and provided returns of capital to shareholders of approximately
$6 billion through our ordinary dividend and share repurchases.
for 2021, our ordinary dividend returned $2.4 billion which included an increase from 43 cents per share to 46 cents per share, effective in december.
share repurchases resumed in february and amounted to $3.6 billion inclusive of our paced monetization program related to the cenovus energy (cve)
common shares owned.
see note 5
.
we also demonstrated our commitment to preserving our top-tier balance sheet with an announcement to reduce the company's gross debt by $5 billion over five years through a combination of natural and accelerated maturities.
as part of our ongoing portfolio high-grading and optimization efforts, in december 2021, we announced two transactions in our asia pacific segment enhancing our diverse portfolio.
this included notifying origin energy of our intent to exercise our preemption right to purchase an additional 10 percent shareholding interest in aplng for $1.645 billion, before customary adjustments, and the sale of our interests in indonesia for approximately $1.4
billion before customary adjustments.
in addition to those transactions, in january 2022, we entered into a divestiture agreement to sell our interest in noncore assets within our lower 48 segment for $440 million.
these transactions are expected to close in the first half of 2022.
for more information on aplng, see note 4
and for more information on pending dispositions, see note 3
.
we announced an increase in our disposition target to $4 to $5 billion in proceeds by year-end 2023, with approximately $2 billion sourced from the permian basin.
as of year-end 2021, we have generated
$0.3 billion in disposition proceeds.
the proceeds from these transactions will be used in accordance with the company's priorities, including returns of capital to shareholders and reduction of gross debt.
in december 2021, we announced the initiation of a three-tier return of capital framework.
this framework is structured to continue delivering a compelling, growing ordinary dividend and through
-cycle share repurchases.
it includes the addition of a vroc tier.
the vroc tier will provide a flexible tool for meeting our commitment of returning greater than 30 percent of cash from operating activities during periods where commodity prices are meaningfully higher than our planning price range.
we have set our expected
2022 total return of capital from all three tiers at approximately
$8 billion.

in 2021, we reaffirmed and improved upon our commitment to esg leadership and excellence and the specific targets we set in october 2020
when we became the first u.s.-based oil and gas company to adopt a paris-aligned climate-risk strategy.
our commitment includes:
●
net-zero ambition for operational (scope 1 and 2) emissions by 2050 with active advocacy for a price on carbon to address end-use (scope 3) emissions;
●
targeting a reduction in gross operated and net equity operational ghg emissions intensity by 40 to 50
percent from 2016 levels by 2030;
●
zero routine flaring by 2030, with an ambition to get there by 2025;
●
10 percent reduction target for methane emissions intensity by 2025 from a 2019 baseline, in addition to the 65 percent reduction we have made since 2015;
●
adding continuous methane detection devices to our operations, with an initial focus on the larger lower
48 facilities;
●
dedicated low carbon technology organization responsible for identifying and prioritizing global emissions reduction initiatives and opportunities associated with the energy transition, ccus and hydrogen; and
●
esg performance factoring into executive and employee compensation programs.
to support this commitment, in december 2021, we announced that approximately $0.2 billion of our 2022
company-wide capital expenditures would be dedicated to energy transition efforts across the company's global operations aimed at accelerating the reduction of the company's scope 1 and 2 emissions and to pursue business opportunities that address end-use emissions and early-stage low-carbon technology opportunities that leverage the company's adjacencies.
operationally, we remain focused on safely executing the business.
production increased 440 mboed or 39
percent in 2021, compared to 2020.
production excluding libya for 2021 was 1,527 mboed.
after adjusting for closed acquisitions and dispositions, impacts from 2020 curtailments,
2021 winter storm uri and the conversion of concho two-stream contracted volumes to a three-stream basis, production increased by 28 mboed or 2 percent.
this increase was primarily due to new production from the lower 48 and other development programs across the portfolio, partially offset by normal field decline.
production from libya averaged
40 mboed in 2021.
management's discussion and analysis

conocophillips
2021 10-k key operating and financial summary significant items during 2021 and recent announcements included the following:
●
announced an increase to expected 2022 return of capital to shareholders to a total of $8 billion, with the incremental $1 billion to be distributed through share repurchases and vroc tiers;
●
acquired and integrated concho, capturing over $1 billion of synergies and savings ahead of schedule;
acquired shell's permian assets on december 1, 2021;
●
exercised preemption right to purchase an additional 10 percent shareholding interest in aplng, expected to close in the first quarter of 2022;
●
generated $0.3 billion in disposition proceeds from noncore sales and entered into agreements to sell an additional $1.8 billion in assets, subject to customary closing adjustments;
●

●
net cash provided by operating activities was $17 billion, exceeding capital expenditures and investments of $5.3 billion;
●
distributed $6.0 billion to shareholders through $2.4 billion in dividends and $3.6 billion of share repurchases, representing over 30 percent return of cash provided by operating activities to shareholders;
●
ended the year with cash and cash equivalents of $5.0 billion and short-term investments of $0.4 billion, totaling over $5.4 billion in ending cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments
;
●
initiated a paced monetization of the company's cve investment, generating $1.1
billion in proceeds through the sale of 117 million shares, with the funds applied to share repurchases; 91 million cve shares remained outstanding at year
-end 2021; and
●
advanced the company's net-zero ambition by announcing an increase in scope 1 and 2 ghg emissions-
intensity reduction targets to 40 to 50 percent from a 2016 baseline on a net equity and gross operated basis by 2030, from the previous target of 35 to 45 percent on only a gross operated basis.
business environment brent crude oil prices averaged
$71 per barrel in 2021, compared with $42 per barrel in
2020.
the energy industry has periodically experienced this type of volatility due to fluctuating supply-and-demand conditions and such volatility may persist in the future.
commodity prices are the most significant factor impacting our profitability and related reinvestment of operating cash flows into our business.
our strategy is to create value through price cycles by delivering on the financial principles that underpin our value proposition; balance sheet strength, peer leading distributions, disciplined investments and esg excellence, all of which support strong financial returns.
●
balance sheet strength.
a strong balance sheet is a strategic asset that provides flexibility through price cycles.
we strive to maintain our 'a'
-rating, and we have committed to reducing gross debt by $5 billion over the next five years.
this will reduce interest expense and provide resilience in periods of volatility.
we ended the year with over
$5 billion in cash, maintaining balance sheet strength even after completing the all-cash acquisition of shell's permian assets.
●
peer leading distributions.
we believe in delivering value to our shareholders via our three-tiered return of capital framework, which consists of a growing, sustainable dividend, share repurchases, and beginning in 2022, the addition of vroc.
in 2021, we paid dividends on our common stock of approximately
$2.4
billion and repurchased $3.6 billion of our common stock partially sourced from our paced monetization program related to the cve common shares owned.
our combined dividends and repurchases represented over 30 percent of our net cash provided by operating activities.
our first vroc of $0.20
cents per share was paid on january 14, 2022, to shareholders of record as of january
3, 2022.
our vroc will be made at the board of director's discretion, subject to market conditions and other factors.

●
disciplined investments.
our goal is to achieve strong free cash flow by exercising capital discipline, controlling our costs, and safely and reliably delivering production.
we expect to make capital investments sufficient to sustain production throughout the price cycles.
free cash flow provides funds that are available to return to shareholders, strengthen the balance sheet or reinvest back into the business for future cash flow expansion
.
o exercise capital discipline.
we participate in a commodity price-driven and capital-intensive industry, with varying lead times from when an investment decision is made to when an asset is operational and generates cash flow.
as a result, we must invest significant capital dollars to develop newly discovered fields, maintain existing fields, and construct pipelines and lng facilities.
we allocate capital across a geographically diverse, low cost of supply resource base, which combined with legacy assets results in low overall production decline.
cost of supply is the wti equivalent price that generates a 10 percent after-tax return on a point-forward and fully burdened basis.
fully burdened includes capital infrastructure, foreign exchange, cost of carbon, price-related inflation and g&a.
in setting our capital plans, we exercise a rigorous approach that evaluates projects using these cost of supply criteria, which we believe will lead to value maximization and cash flow expansion using an optimized investment pace, not production growth for growth's sake.
our cash allocation priorities call for the investment of sufficient capital to sustain production and provide returns of capital to shareholders.
o control our costs.
controlling operating and overhead costs, without compromising safety or environmental stewardship, is a high priority.
using various methodologies, we monitor these costs monthly, on an absolute-dollar basis and a per-unit basis and report to management.
managing operating and overhead costs is critical to maintaining a competitive position in our industry, particularly in a low commodity price environment.
the ability to control our operating and overhead costs positively impacts our ability to deliver strong cash from operations.
o optimize our portfolio.
in 2021, we completed the acquisition of concho and shell's permian assets, significantly increasing our unconventional portfolio with many additional years of low cost of supply inventory.
the addition of this highly complementary acreage in the midland and delaware basins created a sizeable permian presence to augment our leading unconventional positions in the eagle ford and bakken in the lower 48.
in our asia pacific segment, we notified origin energy of our intent to exercise our preemption right to purchase an additional 10 percent shareholding interest in aplng and announced the sale of our interests in indonesia.
see note 3
.
we continue to evaluate our assets to determine whether they compete for capital within our portfolio and optimize as necessary, directing capital towards the most competitive investments and disposing of assets that don't compete.
as such, in conjunction with our shell permian acquisition announcement, we communicated an increase in our planned disposition target to $4
to $5 billion in proceeds by year-end
2023 as part of our ongoing portfolio high-grading and optimization efforts.
o add to our proved reserve base.
we primarily add to our proved reserve base in three ways:
◾
acquire interest in existing or new fields.
◾
apply new technologies and processes to improve recovery from existing fields.
◾
successfully explore, develop and exploit new and existing fields.
as required by current authoritative guidelines, the estimated future date when an asset will reach the end of its economic life is based on historical 12-month first-of-month average prices and current costs.
this date estimates when production will end and affects the amount of estimated reserves.
therefore, as prices and cost levels change from year to year, the estimate of proved reserves also changes.
generally, our proved reserves decrease as prices decline and increase as prices rise.
management's discussion and analysis
39
conocophillips
2021 10-k reserve replacement represents the net change in proved reserves, net of production, divided by our current year production, as shown in our supplemental reserve table disclosures.
our reserve replacement was 377 percent in 2021, reflecting a net increase from purchases and sales as well as higher prices.
our organic reserve replacement, which excluded a net increase of
1,115 mmboe from sales and purchases, was
189 percent in 2021.
in the three years ended december 31, 2021, our reserve replacement was 155 percent.
our organic reserve replacement during the three years ended december 31, 2021, which excluded a net increase of 1,022 mmboe related to sales and purchases, was 88 percent.
access to additional resources may become increasingly difficult as commodity prices can make projects uneconomic or unattractive.
in addition, prohibition of direct investment in some nations, national fiscal terms, political instability, competition from national oil companies, and lack of access to high-potential areas due to environmental or other regulation may negatively impact our ability to increase our reserve base.
as such, the timing and level at which we add to our reserve base may, or may not, allow us to fully replace our production over subsequent years.
●
esg leadership.
safety and environmental stewardship, including the operati onal integrity of our assets, remain our highest priorities.
we are committed to protecting the health and safety of everyone who has a role in our operations and the communities in which we operate.
we strive to conduct our business with respect and care for the local and global environment and systematically manage risk to drive sustainable business operations.
in september 2021, we reaffirmed and improved upon our commitment to esg leadership and excellence and the specific targets that we set in october 2020 when we became the first u.s. based oil and gas company to adopt a paris-aligned climate-risk strategy.
our comprehensive energy transition strategy is designed to sustainably meet global energy demand while delivering competitive returns on and of capital through the energy transition.
our strategy also recognizes the importance of reducing society's end-use emissions to meet global climate goals.
as an e&p company, active only in the upstream side of the business, we do not produce end-use products directly for consumers.
we believe that if everyone addressed their scope 1 and 2 emissions, scope
3
would also be addressed.
this is why we have consistently taken a prominent role in advocating that scope 3 emissions be addressed through a well-designed economywide price on carbon. in addition, we are making early-stage investments in transition opportunities with the potential to generate competitive returns that will help address end-use emissions, including ccus and hydrogen.
we are also engaging with our supply chain on their emissions targets.
other significant factors that can affect our profitability include:
●
energy commodity prices.
our earnings and operating cash flows generally correlate with crude oil and natural gas commodity prices.
commodity price levels are subject to factors external to the company and over which we have no control, including but not limited to global economic health, supply disruptions or fears thereof caused by civil unrest or military conflicts, actions taken by opec plus and other producing countries, environmental laws, tax regulations, governmental policies, global pandemics and weather-
related disruptions.
the following graph depicts the average benchmark prices for wti crude oil, brent crude oil and u.s. henry hub natural gas over the past three years:
management's discussion and analysis conocophillips
2021 10-k
40
brent crude oil prices averaged
$70.73 per barrel in 2021, an increase of 70 percent compared with
$41.68 per barrel in 2020.
similarly, wti crude oil prices increased 72 percent from $39.37
per barrel in
2020 to $67.92 per barrel in 2021.
following covid-19 economic shutdowns in early 2020, global oil demand increased steadily through the year alongside the global economic recovery.
opec plus supply restraint, capital discipline by u.s. e&p's and various unplanned supply disruptions in producing countries moderated supply growth, reducing excess global inventories and putting upward pressure on global oil prices.
henry hub natural gas prices increased
85 percent from an average of $2.08 per mmbtu in 2020 to $3.85
per mmbtu in 2021.
extreme weather events in many parts of the world and several global lng liquefaction outages depleted global natural gas inventories in early 2021, generating strong demand for u.s. lng exports and supporting robust domestic demand.
our realized bitumen price increased 368 percent from an average of $8.02
per barrel in 2020 to $37.52
per barrel in 2021.
the increase was largely driven by strength in wti, reflective of increasing global demand and opec discipline.
the wcs differential to wti at hardisty remained fairly flat as record high production offsets incremental pipeline capacity.
we continue to optimize bitumen price realizations through improvements in alternate blend capability which results in lower diluent costs and access to the u.s. gulf coast market through rail and pipeline contracts.
our worldwide annual average realized price increased 70 percent from $32.15
per boe in 2020 to $54.63
per boe in 2021 primarily due to higher realized oil, natural gas and bitumen prices.
north america's energy supply landscape has been transformed from one of resource scarcity to one of abundance.
in recent years, the use of hydraulic fracturing and horizontal drilling in unconventional formations has led to increased industry actual and forecasted crude oil and natural gas production in the u.s.
although providing significant short

and long-term growth opportunities for our company, the increased abundance of crude oil and natural gas due to development of unconventional plays could also have adverse financial implications to us, including: an extended period of low commodity prices;
production curtailments; and delay of plans to develop areas such as unconventional fields.
should one or more of these events occur, our revenues would be reduced, and additional asset impairments might be possible.

impairments
.
we participate in a capital
-intensive industry.
at times, our pp&e and investments become impaired when, for example, commodity prices decline significantly for long periods of time, our reserve estimates are revised downward, a decision to dispose of an asset leads to a write-down to its fair value, or the current fair value of an investment is less than its carrying amount and the loss in value is deemed other than temporary.
as we optimize our assets in the future, it is reasonably possible we may incur future losses upon sale or impairment charges to long-lived assets used in operations, investments in nonconsolidated entities accounted for under the equity method, and unproved properties.
for more information on our impairments, see note 6
and note 7
.
●
effective tax rate
.
our operations are in countries with different tax rates and fiscal structures.
accordingly, even in a stable commodity price and fiscal/regulatory environment, our overall effective tax rate can vary significantly between periods based on the "mix" of before-tax earnings within our global operations.
●
fiscal and regulatory environment
.
our operations can be affected by changing economic, regulatory and political environments in the various countries in which we operate, including civil unrest or strained relationships with governments that may impact our operations or investments.
these changing environments could negatively impact our results of operations, and further changes to increase government fiscal take could have a negative impact on future operations.
our management carefully considers the fiscal and regulatory environment when evaluating projects or determining the levels and locations of our activity.
outlook production and capital
2022 operating plan capital budget is $7.2 billion.
the plan includes funding for ongoing development drilling programs, major projects, exploration and appraisal activities, base maintenance and
$0.2 billion for projects to reduce the company's scope 1 and 2 emissions intensity and investme nts in several early-stage low-carbon opportunities that address end-use emissions.
production guidance is 1.8 mmboed in 2022 including libya but excluding the impacts from the pending indonesia disposition and acquisition of additional aplng shareholding interest.
first quarter 2022 production is expected to be 1.75 mmboed to 1.79 mmboed.
operating segments we manage our operations through six operating segments, which are primarily defined by geographic region:
alaska; lower 48; canada; europe, middle east and north africa; asia pacific; and other international.
corporate and other represents income and costs not directly associated with an operating segment, such as most interest expense, premiums incurred on the early retirement of debt, corporate overhead, certain technology activities, as well as licensing revenues.
our key performance indicators, shown in the statistical tables provided at the beginning of the operating segment sections that follow, reflect results from our operations, including commodity prices and production.

net income (loss) attributable to conocophillips increased $10.8 billion in 2021.
2021 earnings were positively impacted by:
●
higher realized commodity prices.
●
higher sales volumes primarily due to our concho acquisition and absence of production curtailments.
see note 3
.
●
a gain of $1,040 million after-tax on our cenovus energy (cve) common shares in 2021, as compared to a
$855 million after-tax loss on those shares in 2020.
●
lower exploration expenses due to:
o absence of a 2020 impairment for $648 million after
-tax for the entire carrying value of capitalized undeveloped leasehold costs related to our alaska north slope gas asset.
o lower dry hole expenses.
o absence of early cancellation of our 2020 winter exploration program in alaska.
o absence of unproved property impairment and dry hole expenses in 2020 for the kamunsu east field in malaysia, which is no longer in our development plans.
●
higher equity in earnings of affiliates, primarily due to higher lng sales prices.
●
contingent payments related to prior dispositions in our canada and lower 48 segments.
●
an after-tax gain of $194 million recognized for a fid bonus associated with our australia
-west divestiture in 2020.
see note 3
.
●
lower impairments, primarily due to the absence of impairments recognized in 2020 for noncore assets in our lower 48 segment partially offset by an impairment in our aplng investment included within our asia pacific segment.
see note 7
.
these increases in net income (loss) were partly offset by:
●
higher production and operating expenses and taxes other than income taxes, primarily due to higher sales volumes.
●
higher dd&a expenses caused by higher production volumes, partially offset by lower rates driven from positive reserve revisions due to higher commodity prices in 2021.
●
absence of a $597 million after-tax gain on our australia-west divestiture completed in may
2020.
●
restructuring and transaction expenses of $341 million after-tax associated with the concho and shell acquisitions in addition to mark-to-market impacts on certain key employee compensation programs.

income statement analysis unless otherwise indicated, all results in income statement analysis are before-tax.
sales and other operating revenues increased 144 percent in 2021, mainly due to higher realized commodity prices and higher sales volumes.
equity in earnings of affiliates increased
$400 million in 2021, primarily due to higher earnings driven by higher lng and crude prices, partially offset by a higher effective tax rate related to equity method investments in our europe, middle east and north africa segment
.
gain on dispositions decreased $63 million in 2021, primarily due to the absence of a $587 million gain related to our 2020 australia-west divestiture and a $179 million loss associated with the sale of noncore assets in our other international segment.
the decreases were partially offset by $200 million related to a fid bonus associated with our australia-west divestiture, gains recognized for contingent payments associated with previous dispositions in our canada and lower 48 segments and gains on sales of certain noncore assets in our lower 48 segment.
other income (loss) increased $1.7 billion in 2021, primarily due to a gain of $1,040 million on our cve common shares in 2021, as compared to a $855 million loss on those shares in 2020.
see note 5
.
purchased commodities increased 125 percent in 2021, primarily in line with higher gas and crude prices and volumes.
production and operating expenses increased $1,350 million in 2021, primarily in line with higher production volumes.
selling, general and administrative expenses increased $289 million in 2021, primarily due to transaction and restructuring expenses associated with our concho acquisition and higher compensation and benefits costs, including mark-to-market impacts of certain key employee compensation programs.
exploration expenses decreased
$1,113 million in 2021, primarily due to the absence of 2020 expenses including an $828 million impairment for the entire carrying value of capitalized undeveloped leasehold costs related to our alaska north slope gas asset, the early cancellation of our
2020 winter exploration program in alaska, and absence of unproved property impairment and dry hole expenses from 2020 for the kamunsu east field in malaysia.
2021
also saw lower dry hole expenses in alaska.
impairments decreased $139 million in 2021, primarily due to the absence of impairments recognized in 2020 for noncore assets in our lower 48 segment partially offset by an impairment in our aplng investment included within our asia pacific segment in 2021.
for additional information, see note 7
and note 13
.
taxes other than income taxes increased
$880 million in 2021, caused primarily by higher commodity prices and higher lower 48 sales volumes.

2021 10-k we explore for, produce, transport and market crude oil, bitumen, natural gas, lng and ngls on a worldwide basis.
at december 31, 2021, our operations were producing in the u.s., norway, canada, australia, indonesia, china, malaysia, qatar and libya.
total production, including libya, of 1,567 mboed increased 440 mboed or 39 percent in 2021 compared with
2020, primarily due to:
●
higher volumes in lower 48 due to our concho acquisition
.
●
new wells online in lower 48, canada, norway, malaysia and alaska.
●
absence of production curtailments, primarily in our north american assets.
●
higher production in libya due to the absence of a forced shutdown of the es sider export terminal and other eastern export terminals.
●
improved well performance in norway, canada, alaska and china.
the increase in production during 2021 was partly offset by:
●
normal field decline.
●
absence of production from australia
-west due to our second quarter
2020 disposition.
production excluding libya for 2021 was 1,527 mboed.
after adjusting for closed acquisitions and dispositions, impacts from 2020 curtailments, 2021 winter storm uri and the conversion of concho two-stream contracted volumes to a three-stream basis, production increased by 28 mboed or 2 percent.
this increase was primarily due to new production from the lower 48 and other development programs across the portfolio, partially offset by normal field decline. production from libya averaged 40 mboed in 2021.

earnings were negatively impacted by:
●
higher taxes other than income taxes primarily due to higher realized crude oil prices.
production average production decreased 1 mboed in 2021 compared with 2020, primarily due to:
●
normal field decline.
the production decrease was partly offset by:
●
absence of curtailments.
●
improved production at our western north slope assets as a result of net royalty interest changes associated with periodic redetermination.
●
improved performance in the greater prudhoe area and western north slope assets.
●
new wells online across the segment.

to meet our short-
and long-term liquidity requirements, we look to a variety of funding sources, including cash generated from operating activities, proceeds from asset sales, our commercial paper and credit facility programs and our ability to sell securities using our shelf registration statement.
in 2021, the primary uses of our available cash were $8.7 billion for the acquisition of shell permian;
$5.3 billion to support our ongoing capital expenditures and investments program;
$3.6 billion to repurchase our common stock;
$2.4 billion to pay dividends;
and $1.2
billion for hedging, transaction and restructuring costs.
in 2021, cash and cash equivalents increased by
$2.0
billion to $5.0 billion.
at december 31, 2021, we had cash and cash equivalents of $5.0 billion, short-term investments of $0.4 billion, and available borrowing capacity under our credit facility of $6.0 billion, totaling approximately $11.5 billion of liquidity.
we believe current cash balances and cash generated by operations, together with access to external sources of funds as described below in the "significant changes in capital" section, will be sufficient to meet our funding requirements in the near- and long-term, including our capital spending program, dividend payments and required debt payments.
significant changes in capital operating activities in 2021, cash provided by operating activities was $17 billion, compared with $4.8 billion for 2020.
the increase is primarily due to higher realized commodity prices and higher sales volumes, mostly resulting from our acquisition of concho.
the increase was partly offset by the $0.8 billion in settlement of oil and gas hedging positions acquired from concho, and approximately
$0.4 billion of transaction and restructuring costs.
our short-
and long-term operating cash flows are highly dependent upon prices for crude oil, bitumen, natural gas, lng and ngls.
prices and margins in our industry have historically been volatile and are driven by market conditions over which we have no control.
absent other mitigating factors, as these prices and margins fluctuate, we would expect a corresponding change in our operating cash flows.
the level of absolute production volumes, as well as product and location mix, impacts our cash flows.
full-year production averaged
1,567 mboed in 2021.
full-year production excluding libya averaged 1,527
mboed.
adjusting for closed acquisitions and dispositions, impacts from 2020 curtailments, 2021 winter storm uri and the conversion of concho two-stream contracted volumes to a three-stream basis, production increased 28 mboed or
2 percent.
first quarter 2022 production is expected to be 1.75 mmboed to 1.79 mmboed.
future production is subject to numerous uncertainties, including, among others, the volatile crude oil and natural gas price environment, which may impact investment decisions; the effects of price changes on production sharing and variable-royalty contracts;
acquisition and disposition of fields; field production decline rates;
new technologies;
operating efficiencies; timing of startups and major turnarounds; political instability;
weather-related disruptions;

2021 10-k and the addition of proved reserves through exploratory success and their timely and cost
-effective development.
while we actively manage these factors, production levels can cause variability in cash flows, although generally this variability has not been as significant as that caused by commodity prices.
to maintain or grow our production volumes on an ongoing basis, we must continue to add to our proved reserve base.
our proved reserves generally increase as prices rise and decrease as prices decline.
reserve replacement represents the net change in proved reserves, net of production, divided by our current year production.
for information on proved reserves, including both developed and undeveloped reserves, see the reserve table disclosures contained in "supplementary data - oil and gas operations."
see "item 1a-risk factors - unless we successfully develop our resources, the scope of our business will decline, resulting in an adverse impact to our business."
as discussed in the "critical accounting estimates"
section, engineering estimates of proved reserves are imprecise; therefore, reserves may be revised upward or downward each year due to the impact of changes in commodity prices or as more technical data becomes available on reservoirs.
it is not possible to reliably predict how revisions will impact future reserve quantities.
investing activities in 2021, we invested $5.3 billion in capital expenditures.
capital expenditures invested in 2020 and 2019 were
$4.7 billion and $6.6 billion, respectively.
for information about our capital expenditures and investments, see the
"capital expenditures and investments"
section.
in december 2021, we completed our acquisition of shell's assets in the delaware basin for cash consideration of approximately $8.7 billion after customary adjustments.
we funded this transaction with cash on hand.
we completed our acquisition of concho on january 15, 2021.
the assets acquired in the transaction included
$382
million of cash.
the net impact of these items is recognized within "acquisition of businesses, net of cash acquired" on our consolidated sta tement of cash flows.
see note 3.
in 2021, we announced a disposition target of $4 to $5 billion in disposition proceeds by year-end
2023.
only proceeds from transactions announced or initiated in the third quarter of 2021 or later will be counted toward this target.
the proceeds from these transactions will be used in accordance with the company's priorities, including returns of capital to shareholders and reduction of gross debt.
to date, we have achieved $0.3 billion from the sale of noncore assets in our lower 48 segment.
total proceeds from asset dispositions in 2021 were $1.7 billion.
including the $250 million mentioned above, we also received cash proceeds of $1.14 billion from sales of our investment in cve common shares and $244 million of contingent payments related to dispositions completed before
2021.
see note 3.
in may 2021, we announced and began a paced monetization of our investment in cve with the plan to direct proceeds toward our existing share repurchase program.
we expect to fully dispose of our cve common shares by early 2022, however, the sales pace will be guided by market conditions, and we retain discretion to adjust accordingly.
see note 5.
proceeds from asset sales in 2020 were $1.3

financing activities we have a revolving credit facility totaling $6.0 billion, expiring in may 2023.
our revolving credit facility may be used for direct bank borrowings, the issuance of letters of credit totaling up to $500 million, or as support for our commercial paper program.
the revolving credit facility is broadly syndicated among financial institutions and does not contain any material adverse change provisions or any covenants requiring maintenance of specified financial ratios or credit ratings.
the facility agreement contains a cross-default provision relating to the failure to pay principal or interest on other debt obligations of $200 million or more by conocophillips, or any of its consolidated subsidiaries.
the amount of the facility is not subject to the redetermination prior to its expiration date.
credit facility borrowings may bear interest at a margin above rates offered by certain designated banks in the london interbank market or at a margin above the overnight federal funds rate or prime rates offered by certain designated banks in the u.s.
the agreement calls for commitment fees on available, but unused, amounts.
the agreement also contains early termination rights if our current directors or their approved successors cease to be a majority of the board of directors.
the revolving credit facility supports conocophillips company's ability to issue up to $6.0 billion of commercial paper, which is primarily a funding source for short-term working capital needs.
commercial paper maturities are generally limited to 90 days.
with no commercial paper outstanding and no direct borrowings or letters of credit, we had access to $6.0 billion in available borrowing capacity under the revolving credit facility at december 31,
2021.
on january 15, 2021, we completed the acquisition of concho in an all-stock transaction. in the acquisition, we assumed concho's publicly traded debt and in december 2020, we launched an offer to exchange concho's publicly traded debt for debt issued by conocophillips.
there were no impacts to conocophillips'
credit ratings as a result of the debt exchange.
in june 2021, we reaffirmed our commitment to preserving our 'a'
-rated balance sheet by restating our intent to reduce gross debt by $5 billion over the next five years, driving a more resilient and efficient capital structure.

on january 25, 2021, s&p revised the industry risk assessment for the e&p industry to 'moderately high' from
'intermediate' based on a view of increasing risks from the energy transition, price volatility, and weaker profitability.
on february 11, 2021, s&p downgraded its rating of our long-term debt from "a"
to "a

"stable" outlook and affirmed this rating in november 2021.
in october 2021, moody's affirmed its "a3"
rating of our long-term debt and revised its outlook from "stable" to "positive".
in december 2021, fitch affirmed its rating of our long-term debt as "a"
with a "stable" outlook.
we do not have any ratings triggers on any of our corporate debt that would cause an automatic default, and thereby impact our access to liquidity, upon downgrade of our credit ratings.
if our credit ratings are downgraded from their current levels, it could increase the cost of corporate debt available to us and restrict our access to the commercial paper markets.
if our credit rating were to deteriorate to a level prohibiting us from accessing the commercial paper market, we would still be able to access funds under our revolving credit facility.
certain of our project-related contracts, commercial contracts and derivative instruments contain provisions requiring us to post collateral.
many of these contracts and instruments permit us to post either cash or letters of credit as collateral.
at december 31, 2021 and 2020, we had direct bank letters of credit of $337 million and
$249
million, respectively, which secured performance obligations related to various purchase commitments incident to the ordinary conduct of business.
in the event of credit ratings downgrades, we may be required to post additional letters of credit.

in december 2021, we announced our expected 2022 return of capital program and the initiation of a three-tier return of capital framework.
the framework is structured to deliver a compelling, growing ordinary dividend and through-cycle share repurchases.
it includes the addition of a discretionary vroc tier.
the vroc will provide a flexible tool for meeting our commitment of returning greater than
30 percent of cash from operating activities during periods where commodity prices are meaningfully higher than our planning price range.
we have set our expected 2022 total capital returns at approximately $8 billion, consisting of distributions from each of the three tiers.
consistent with our commitment to deliver value to shareholders, in 2021, we paid $2.4 billion, $1.75 per share of common stock, in ordinary dividends. this was an increase over 2020 and 2019, when we paid $1.69 and
$1.34 per share of common stock, respectively.
on february 3, 2022, we announced a quarterly dividend of $0.46 per share, payable march 1, 2022, to stockholders of record at the close of business on february
14, 2022.
on january 14,
2022, we paid the first vroc payment of $0.20 per share to shareholders of record as of january 3, 2022.
on february 3, 2022, we announced a vroc of $0.30 per share, payable on april 14, 2022, to stockholders of record at the close of business on march 31, 2022.
the ordinary dividend and vroc are subject to numerous considerations and will be determined and approved each quarter by the board of directors.
we expect to announce the vroc when we announce our ordinary dividend, but the quarterly payouts will be staggered from the ordinary dividend, resulting in up to eight cash distributions throughout the year.
in late 2016, we initiated our current share repurchase program with board of director's authorization of $25
billion of our common stock.
share repurchases were $3.6
billion, $0.9 billion, and $3.5 billion in 2021, 2020, and
2019, respectively.
as of december 31, 2021, share repurchases since the inception of our current program totaled 247 million shares and $14 billion.
repurchases are made at management's discretion, at prevailing prices, subject to market conditions and other factors.
for more information on factors considered when determining the levels of returns of capital see "item 1a-risk factors - our ability to execute our capital return program is subject to certain considerations."
in addition to the priorities described above, we have contractual obligations to purchase goods and services of approximately $11.8 billion.
we expect to fulfill $6 billion of these obligations in 2022. these figures exclude purchase commitments for jointly owned fields and facilities where we are not the operator.
purchase obligations of $5.3 billion are related to agreements to access and utilize the capacity of third
-party equipment and facilities, including pipelines and lng product terminals, to transport, process, treat and store commodities.
purchase obligations of $5.3 billion are related to market-based contracts for commodity product purchases with third parties.
the remainder is primarily our net share of purchase commitments for materials and services for jointly owned fields and facilities where we are the operator.

●
u.s. federal clean water act, which governs discharges to water bodies.
●
european union regulation for registration, evaluation, authorization and restriction of chemicals

●
u.s. federal comprehensive environmental response, compensation and liability act (cercla or superfund), which imposes liability on generators, transporters and arrangers of hazardous substances at sites where hazardous substance releases have occurred or are threatening to occur.
●
u.s. federal resource conservation and recovery act (rcra), which governs the treatment, storage, and disposal of solid waste.
●
u.s. federal oil pollution act of 1990 (opa90), under which owners and operators of onshore facilities and pipelines, lessees or permittees of an area in which an offshore facility is located, and owners and operators of vessels are liable for removal costs and damages that result from a discharge of oil into navigable waters of the u.s.
●
u.s. federal emergency planning and community right-to-know act (epcra), which requires facilities to report toxic chemical inventories with local emergency planning committees and response departments.
●
u.s. federal safe drinking water act, which governs the disposal of wastewater in underground injection wells.
●
u.s. department of the interior regulations, which relate to offshore oil and gas operations in u.s. waters and impose liability for the cost of pollution cleanup resulting from operations, as well as potential liability for pollution damages.
●

2021 10-k these laws and their implementing regulations set limits on emissions and, in the case of discharges to water, establish water quality limits, and establish standards and impose obligations for the remediation of releases of hazardous substances and hazardous wastes.
they also, in most cases, require permits in association with new or modified operations.
these permits can require an applicant to collect substantial information in connection with the application process, which can be expensive and time-consuming.
in addition, there can be delays associated with notice and comment periods and the agency's processing of the application.
many of the delays associated with the permitting process are beyond the control of the applicant.
many states and foreign countries where we operate also have or are developing, similar environmental laws and regulations governing these same types of activities.
while similar, in some cases these regulations may impose additional, or more stringent, requirements that can add to the cost and difficulty of marketing or transporting products across state and international borders.
the ultimate financial impact arising from environmental laws and regulations is neither clearly known nor easily determinable as new standards, such as air emission standards and water quality standards, continue to evolve.
however, environmental laws and regulations, including those that may arise to address concerns about global climate change, are expected to continue to have an increasing impact on our operations in the u.s. and in other countries in which we operate.
notable areas of potential impacts include air emission compliance and remediation obligations in the u.s.
and canada.
an example is the use of hydraulic fracturing, an essential completion technique that facilitates production of oil and natural gas otherwise trapped in lower permeability rock formations.
a range of local, state, federal, or national laws and regulations currently govern hydraulic fracturing operations, with hydraulic fracturing currently prohibited in some jurisdictions.
although hydraulic fracturing has been conducted for many decades, a number of new laws, regulations and permitting requirements are under consideration by various state environmental agencies, and others which could result in increased costs, operating restrictions, operational delays and/or limit the ability to develop oil and natural gas resources.
governmental restrictions on hydraulic fracturing could impact the overall profitability or viability of certain of our oil and natural gas investments.
we have adopted operating principles that incorporate established industry standards designed to meet or exceed government requirements.
our practices continually evolve as technology improves and regulations change.
we also are subject to certain laws and regulations relating to environmental remediation obligations associated with current and past operations.
such laws and regulations include cercla and rcra and their state equivalents.
longer-term expenditures are subject to considerable uncertainty and may fluctuate significantly.
we occasionally receive requests for information or notices of potential liability from the epa and state environmental agencies alleging that we are a potentially responsible party under cercla or an equivalent state statute.
on occasion, we also have been made a party to cost recovery litigation by those agencies or by private parties.
these requests, notices and lawsuits assert potential liability for remediation costs at various sites that typically are not owned by us, but allegedly contain wastes attributable to our past operations.
as of december 31, 2021, there were 15 sites around the u.s. in which we were identified as a potentially responsible party under cercla and comparable state laws.
capital resources and liquidity conocophillips
2021 10-k
60
for most superfund sites, our potential liability will be significantly less than the total site remediation costs because the percentage of waste attributable to us, versus that attributable to all other potentially responsible parties, is relatively low.
although liability of those potentially responsible is generally joint and several for federal sites and frequently so for state sites, other potentially responsible parties at sites where we are a party typically have had the financial strength to meet their obligations, and where they have not, or where potentially responsible parties could not be located, our share of liability has not increased materially.
many of the sites at which we are potentially responsible are still under investigation by the epa or the state agencies concerned.
prior to actual cleanup, those potentially responsible normally assess site conditions, apportion responsibility and determine the appropriate remediation.
in some instances, we may have no liability or attain a settlement of liability.
actual cleanup costs generally occur after the parties obtain epa or equivalent state agency approval.
there are relatively few sites where we are a major participant, and given the timing and amounts of anticipated expenditures, neither the cost of remediation at those sites nor such costs at all cercla sites, in the aggregate, is expected to have a material adverse effect on our competitive or financial condition.
expensed environmental costs were $632 million in 2021 and are expected to be about $642 million and
$700 million in 2022 and 2023, respectively.
capitalized environmental costs were $184 million in 2021 and are expected to be about $218 million and $316 million in
2022 and 2023, respectively.
accrued liabilities for remediation activities are not reduced for potential recoveries from insurers or other third parties and are not discounted (except those assumed in a purchase business combination, which we do record on a discounted basis).
many of these liabilities result from cercla, rcra ,
and similar state or international laws that require us to undertake certain investigative and remedial activities at sites where we conduct or once conducted operations or at sites where conocophillips-generated waste was disposed.
the accrual also includes a number of sites we identified that may require environmental remediation but which are not currently the subject of cercla, rcra, or other agency enforcement activities.
the laws that require or address environmental remediation may apply retroactively and regardless of fault, the legality of the original activities or the current ownership or control of sites.
if applicable, we accrue receivables for probable insurance or other third-party recoveries.
in the future, we may incur significant costs under both cercla and rcra.
remediation activities vary substantially in duration and cost from site to site, depending on the mix of unique site characteristics, evolving remediation technologies, diverse regulatory agencies and enforcement policies, and the presence or absence of potentially liable third parties.
therefore, it is difficult to develop reasonable estimates of future site remediation costs.
at december 31, 2021, our balance sheet included total accrued environmental costs of $187 million, compared with $180 million at december 31, 2020, for remediation activities in the u.s. and canada.
we expect to incur a substantial amount of these expenditures within the next 30 years.
notwithstanding any of the foregoing, and as with other companies engaged in similar businesses, environmental costs and liabilities are inherent concerns in our operations and products, and there can be no assurance that material costs and liabilities will not be incurred.
however, we currently do not expect any material adverse effect upon our results of operations or financial position as a result of compliance with current environmental laws and regulations.

2021 10-k climate change continuing political and social attention to the issue of global climate change has resulted in a broad range of proposed or promulgated state, national and international laws focusing on ghg reduction.
these proposed or promulgated laws apply or could apply in countries where we have interests or may have interests in the future.
laws in this field continue to evolve, and while it is not possible to accurately estimate either a timetable for implementation or our future compliance costs relating to implementation, such laws, if enacted, could have a material impact on our results of operations and financial condition.
examples of legislation and precursors for possible regulation that do or could affect our operations include:
●
european emissions trading scheme (ets), the program through which many of the eu member states are implementing the kyoto protocol.
our cost of compliance with the eu ets in 2021 was approximately $19
million (net share before-tax
).
●
u.k. emissions trading scheme, the program with which the u.k. has replaced the ets.
our cost of compliance with the u.k. ets in 2021 was approximately
$2.8 million (net share before
-tax).
●
the alberta technology innovation and emissions reduction
(tier) regulation requires any existing facility with emissions equal to or greater than 100,000 metric tonnes of carbon dioxide, or equivalent, per year to meet a facility benchmark intensity.
the total cost of these regulations in 2021 was approximately $1
million (net share before-tax)
.
●
the u.s. supreme court decision in massachusetts v. epa,
549 u.s. 497, 127 s.ct. 1438 (2007), confirmed that the epa has the authority to regulate carbon dioxide as an "air pollutant" under the federal clean air act.
●
the u.s. epa's announcement on march 29, 2010 (published as "interpretation of regulations that determine pollutants covered by clean air act permitting programs,"
75 fed. reg. 17004 (april 2, 2010)), and the epa's and u.s. department of transportation's joint promulgation of a final rule on april 1, 2010, that triggers regulation of ghgs under the clean air act, may trigger more climate-based claims for damages, and may result in longer agency review time for development projects.
●
the u.s. epa's announcement on january 14, 2015, outlining a series of steps it plans to take to address methane and smog-forming volatile organic compound emissions from the oil and gas industry.
●
the u.s. government has announced on september 17, 2021 the global methane pledge, a global initiative to reduce global methane emissions by at least 30 percent from 2020 levels by 2030.
●
carbon taxes in certain jurisdictions.
our cost of compliance with norwegian carbon legislation in 2021
were fees of approximately
$35 million (net share before
-tax).
we also incur a carbon tax for emissions from fossil fuel combustion in our british columbia and alberta operations in canada, totaling approximately $5.7 million (net share before-tax).
●
the agreement reached in paris in december 2015 at the 21
st conference of the parties to the united nations framework convention on climate change, setting out a process for achieving global emission reductions.
the new administration has recommitted the united states to the paris agreement, and a significant number of u.s. state and local governments and major corporations headquartered in the u.s.
have also announced related commitments.
accordingly, the u.s. administration set a new target on april 22, 2021 of a 50 to 52 percent reduction in ghg emissions from 2005 levels in 2030.
in the u.s., some additional form of regulation may be forthcoming in the future at the federal and state levels with respect to ghg emissions.
such regulation could take any of several forms that may result in the creation of additional costs in the form of taxes, the restriction of output, investments of capital to maintain compliance with laws and regulations, or required acquisition or trading of emission allowances.
we are working to continuously improve operational and energy efficiency through resource and energy conservation throughout our operations.

compliance with changes in laws and regulations that create a ghg tax, emission trading scheme or ghg reduction policies could significantly increase our costs, reduce demand for fossil energy derived products, impact the cost and availability of capital and increase our exposure to litigation.
such laws and regulations could also increase demand for less carbon intensive energy sources, including natural gas.
the ultimate impact on our financial performance, either positive or negative, will depend on a number of factors, including but not limited to:
●
whether and to what extent legislation or regulation is enacted.
●
the timing of the introduction of such legislation or regulation.
●
the nature of the legislation (such as a cap and trade system or a tax on emissions)
or regulation.
●
the price placed on ghg emissions (either by the market or through a tax).
●
the ghg reductions required.
●
the price and availability of offsets.
●
the amount and allocation of allowances.
●
technological and scientific developments leading to new products or services.
●
any potential significant physical effects of climate change (such as increased severe weather events, changes in sea levels and changes in temperature).
●
whether, and the extent to which, increased compliance costs are ultimately reflected in the prices of our products and services.
see item 1a-risk factors - existing and future laws, regulations and internal initiatives relating to global climate changes, such as limitations on ghg emissions may impact or limit our business plans, result in significant expenditures, promote alternative uses of energy or reduce demand for our products and note 11
for information on climate change litigation.
company response to climate
-related risks the company has responded by putting in place a sustainable development risk management standard covering the assessment and registration of significant and high sustainable development risks based on their consequence and likelihood of occurrence.
we have developed a company-wide climate change action plan with the goal of tracking mitigation activities for each climate-related risk included in the corporate sustainable development risk register.
the risks addressed in our climate change action plan fall into four broad categories:
●
ghg-related legislation and regulation.
●
ghg emissions management.
●
physical climate-related impacts.
●
climate-related disclosure and reporting.
emissions are categorized into three different scopes.
gross operated and net equity scope 1 and scope 2 ghg emissions help us understand our climate transition risk.
●
scope 1 emissions are direct ghg emissions from sources that we control or in which we have ownership interest.
●
scope 2 emissions are indirect ghg emissions from the generation of purchased electricity or steam that we consume.
●
scope 3 emissions are indirect emissions from sources that we neither own nor control.

2021 10-k we announced in october 2020 the adoption of a paris-aligned climate risk framework with the objective of implementing a coherent set of choices designed to facilitate the success of our existing exploration and production business through the energy transition.
given the uncertainties remaining about how the energy transition will evolve, the strategy aims to be robust across a range of potential future outcomes.
the strategy is comprised of four pillars:
●
targets
:
our target framework consists of a hierarchy of targets, from a long-term ambition that sets the direction and aim of the strategy, to a medium-term performance target for ghg emissions intensity, to shorter-term targets for flaring and methane intensity reductions.
these performance targets are supported by lower-level internal business unit goals to enable the company to achieve the company-
wide targets.
in september 2021, we increased our interim operational target and have set it to reduce our gross operated and net equity (scope 1 and 2) emissions intensity by
40 to 50 percent from 2016
levels by 2030, an improvement from the previously announced target of 35 to 45 percent on only a gross operated basis, with an ambition to achieve net-zero operated emissions by 2050.
we have joined the world bank flaring initiative to work towards zero routine flaring of associated gas by 2030, with an ambition to meet that goal by 2025.
●
technology choices:
we expanded our marginal abatement cost curve process to provide a broader range of opportunities for emission reduction technology.
●
portfolio choices: our corporate authorization process requires all qualifying projects to include a ghg price in their project approval economics.
different ghg prices are used depending on the region or jurisdiction.
projects in jurisdictions with existing ghg pricing regimes incorporate the existing ghg price and forecast into their economics.
projects where no existing ghg pricing regime exists utilize a scenario forecast from our internally consistent world energy model.
in this way, both existing and emerging regulatory requirements are considered in our decision-making.
the company does not use an estimated market cost of ghg emissions when assessing reserves in jurisdictions without existing ghg regulations
.
this is in contrast to changes to the cost of existing ghg emission regulations which can impact our reserves calculations.
●
external engagement: our external engagement aims to differentiate conocophillips within the oil and gas sector with our approach to managing climate-related risk.
we are a founding member of the climate leadership council (clc), an international policy institute founded in collaboration with business and environmental interests to develop a carbon dividend plan.
participation in the clc provides another opportunity for ongoing dialogue about carbon pricing and framing the issues in alignment with our public policy principles.
we also belong to and fund americans for carbon dividends, the education and advocacy branch of the clc.

critical accounting estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management to select appropriate accounting policies and to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses.
see note 1
for descriptions of our major accounting policies.
certain of these accounting policies involve judgments and uncertainties to such an extent there is a reasonable likelihood materially different amounts would have been reported under different conditions, or if different assumptions had been used.
these critical accounting estimates are discussed with the audit and finance committee of the board of directors at least annually.
we believe the following discussions of critical accounting estimates address all important accounting areas where the nature of accounting estimates or assumptions is material due to the levels of subjectivity and judgment necessary to account for highly uncertain matters or the susceptibility of such matters to change.
oil and gas accounting accounting for oil and gas activity is subject to special accounting rules unique to the oil and gas industry.
the acquisition of g&g seismic information, prior to the discovery of proved reserves, is expensed as incurred, similar to accounting for research and development costs.
however, leasehold acquisition costs and exploratory well costs are capitalized on the balance sheet pending determination of whether proved oil and gas reserves have been recognized.
property acquisition costs at year-end 2021, we held $9.3 billion of net capitalized unproved property costs which consisted primarily of individually significant and pooled leaseholds, mineral rights held in perpetuity by title ownership, exploratory wells currently being drilled, and to a lesser extent, suspended exploratory wells and capitalized interest.
this amount increased by $6.9 billion at december 31, 2021 as compared to december 31, 2020, primarily due to the concho and shell permian acquisitions in the permian basin where we have an ongoing significant and active development program.
outside of the permian basin, the remaining
$2.0 billion is concentrated in 9 major development areas.
management periodically assesses our unproved property for impairment based on the results of exploration and drilling efforts and the outlook for commercialization.
for individually significant leaseholds, management periodically assesses for impairment based on exploration and drilling efforts to date.
for insignificant individual leasehold acquisition costs, management exercises judgment and determines a percentage probability that the prospect ultimately will fail to find proved oil and gas reserves, including estimates of future expirations, and pools that leasehold information with others in similar geographic areas.
for prospects in areas with limited, or no, previous exploratory drilling, the percentage probability of ultimate failure is normally judged to be quite high.
this judgmental percentage is multiplied by the leasehold acquisition cost, and that product is divided by the contractual period of the leasehold to determine a periodic leasehold impairment charge that is reported in exploration expense.
this judgmental probability percentage is reassessed and adjusted throughout the contractual period of the leasehold based on favorable or unfavorable exploratory activity on the leasehold or on adjacent leaseholds, and leasehold impairment amortization expense is adjusted prospectively.
exploratory costs for exploratory wells, drilling costs are temporarily capitalized, or "suspended,"
on the balance sheet, pending a determination of whether potentially economic oil and gas reserves have been discovered by the drilling effort to justify development.
65
conocophillips
2021 10-k if exploratory wells encounter potentially economic quantities of oil and gas, the well costs remain capitalized on the balance sheet as long as sufficient progress assessing the reserves and the economic and operating viability of the project is being made.
the accounting notion of "sufficient progress" is a judgmental area, but the accounting rules do prohibit continued capitalization of suspended well costs on the expectation future market conditions will improve or new technologies will be found that would make the development economically profitable.
often, the ability to move into the development phase and record proved reserves is dependent on obtaining permits and government or co-venturer approvals, the timing of which is ultimately beyond our control.
exploratory well costs remain suspended as long as we are actively pursuing such approvals and permits, and believe they will be obtained.
once all required approvals and permits have been obtained, the projects are moved into the development phase, and the oil and gas reserves are designated as proved reserves.
at year-end 2021, total suspended well costs were $660 million, compared with $682 million at year-end 2020.
for additional information on suspended wells, including an aging analysis, see note 6
.
proved reserves engineering estimates of the quantities of proved reserves are inherently imprecise and represent only approximate amounts because of the judgments involved in developing such information.
reserve estimates are based on geological and engineering assessments of in-place hydrocarbon volumes, the production plan, historical extraction recovery and processing yield factors, installed plant operating capacity and approved operating limits.
the reliability of these estimates at any point in time depends on both the quality and quantity of the technical and economic data and the efficiency of extracting and processing the hydrocarbons.
despite the inherent imprecision in these engineering estimates, accounting rules require disclosure of "proved"
reserve estimates due to the importance of these estimates to better understand the perceived value and future cash flows of a company's operations.
there are several authoritative guidelines regarding the engineering criteria that must be met before estimated reserves can be designated as "proved."
our geosciences and reservoir engineering organization has policies and procedures in place consistent with these authoritative guidelines.
we have trained and experienced internal engineering personnel who estimate our proved reserves held by consolidated companies, as well as our share of equity affiliates.
see oil and gas supplemental disclosures for additional information.
proved reserve estimates are adjusted annually in the fourth quarter and during the year if significant changes occur, and take into account recent production and subsurface information about each field.
also, as required by current authoritative guidelines, the estimated future date when an asset will reach the end of its economic life is based on 12-month average prices and current costs.
this date estimates when production will end and affects the amount of estimated reserves.
therefore, as prices and cost levels change from year to year, the estimate of proved reserves also changes.
generally, our proved reserves decrease as prices decline and increase as prices rise.
our proved reserves include estimat ed quantities related to pscs, reported under the "economic interest"
method, as well as variable-royalty regimes, and are subject to fluctuations in commodity prices; recoverable operating expenses; and capital costs.
if costs remain stable, reserve quantities attributable to recovery of costs will change inversely to changes in commodity prices.
we would expect reserves from these contracts to decrease when product prices rise and increase when prices decline.
the estimation of proved reserves is also important to the income statement because the proved reserve estimate for a field serves as the denominator in the unit-of-production calculation of the dd&a of the capitalized costs for that asset.
at year-end 2021, the net book value of productive pp&e subject to a unit-of-production calculation was approximately $52 billion and the dd&a recorded on these assets in
2021 was approximately $7.0 billion.
the estimated proved reserves for our consolidated operations were 2.5 billion boe at the end of 2020 and 4.0 billion boe at the end of 2021.
if the estimates of proved reserves used in the unit-of-production calculations had been lower by 10 percent across all calculations, before-tax dd&a in 2021 would have increased by an estimated
$774 million.

business combination-valuation of oil and gas properties for recent transactions, management applied the principles of acquisition accounting under fasb asc topic 805

"business combinations" and allocated the purchase price to assets acquired and liabilities assumed, based on their estimated fair values as of the acquisition date.
estimating the fair values involved making various assumptions, of which the most significant assumptions relate to the fair values assigned to proved and unproved oil and gas properties.
management utilized a discounted cash flow approach, based on market participant assumptions, and engaged third party valuation experts in preparing fair value estimates.
significant inputs incorporated within the valuation include future commodity price assumptions and production profiles of reserve estimates, the pace of drilling plans, future operating and development costs, inflation rates, and discount rates using a market
-based weighted average cost of capital determined at the time of the acquisition.
when estimating the fair value of unproved properties, additional risk-weighting adjustments are applied to probable and possible reserves.
the assumptions and inputs incorporated within the fair value estimates are subject to considerable management judgement and are based on industry, market, and economic conditions prevalent at the time of the acquisition.
although we based these estimates on assumptions believed to be reasonable, these estimates are inherently unpredictable and uncertain and actual results could differ.
see note 3
.
impairments long-lived assets used in operations are assessed for impairment whenever changes in facts and circumstances indicate a possible significant deterioration in the future cash flows expected to be generated by an asset group.
if there is an indication the carrying amount of an asset may not be recovered, a recoverability test is performed using management's assumptions for prices, volumes and future development plans.
if the sum of the undiscounted cash flows before income-taxes is less than the carrying value of the asset group, the carrying value is written down to estimated fair value and reported as an impairment in the periods in which the determination is made.
individual assets are grouped for impairment purposes at the lowest level for which there are identifiable cash flows that are largely independent of the cash flows of other groups of assets-generally on a field-by-field basis for e&p assets.
because there usually is a lack of quoted market prices for long-lived assets, the fair value of impaired assets is typically determined based on the present values of expected future cash flows using discount rates and prices believed to be consistent with those used by principal market participants, or based on a multiple of operating cash flow validated with historical market transactions of similar assets where possible.
the expected future cash flows used for impairment reviews and related fair value calculations are based on estimated future production volumes, commodity prices, operating costs and capital decisions, considering all available evidence at the date of review.
differing assumptions could affect the timing and the amount of an impairment in any period.
see note 6
and note 7
.
investments in nonconsolidated entities accounted for under the equity method are assessed for impairment whenever changes in the facts and circumstances indicate a loss in value has occurred.
such evidence of a loss in value might include our inability to recover the carrying amount, the lack of sustained earnings capacity which would justify the current investment amount, or a current fair value less than the investment's carrying amount.
when such a condition is judgmentally determined to be other than temporary, an impairment charge is recognized for the difference between the investment's carrying value and its estimated fair value.
when determining whether a decline in value is other than temporary, management considers factors such as the length of time and extent of the decline, the investee's financial condition and near-term prospects, and our ability and intention to retain our investment for a period that will be sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in the market value of the investment.
since quoted market prices are usually not available, the fair value is typically based on the present value of expected future cash flows using discount rates and prices believed to be consistent with those used by principal market participants, plus market analysis of comparable assets owned by the investee, if appropriate.
differing assumptions could affect the timing and the amount of an impairment of an investment in any period.

2021 10-k asset retirement obligations and environmental costs under various contracts, permits and regulations, we have material legal obligations to remove tangible equipment and restore the land or seabed at the end of operations at operational sites.
our largest asset removal obligations involve plugging and abandonment of wells, removal and disposal of offshore oil and gas platforms around the world, as well as oil and gas production facilities and pipelines in alaska.
fair value is estimated using a
present value approach, incorporating assumptions about estimated amounts and timing of settlements and impacts of the use of technologies.
estimating future asset removal costs requires significant judgement.
most of these removal obligations are many years, or decades, in the future and the contracts and regulations often have vague descriptions of what removal practices and criteria must be met when the removal event actually occurs.
the carrying value of our asset retirement obligation estimate is sensitive to inputs such as asset removal technologies and costs, regulatory and other compliance considerations, expenditure timing, and other inputs into valuation of the obligation, including discount and inflation rates, which are all subject to change between the time of initial recognition of the liability and future settlement of our obligation.
normally, changes in asset removal obligations are reflected in the income statement as increases or decreases to dd&a over the remaining life of the assets.
however, for assets at or nearing the end of their operations, as well as previously sold assets for which we retained the asset removal obligation, an increase in the asset removal obligation can result in an immediate charge to earnings, because any increase in pp&e due to the increased obligation would immediately be subject to impairment, due to the low fair value of these properties.
in addition to asset removal obligations, under the above or similar contracts, permits and regulations, we have certain environmental-related projects.
these are primarily related to remediation activities required by canada and various states within the u.s.
at exploration and production sites.
future environmental remediation costs are difficult to estimate because they are subject to change due to such factors as the uncertain magnitude of cleanup costs, the unknown time and extent of such remedial actions that may be required, and the determination of our liability in proportion to that of other responsible parties.
see note 8
.
projected benefit obligations the actuarial determination of projected benefit obligations and company contribution requirements involves judgment about uncertain future events, including estimated retirement dates, salary levels at retirement, mortality rates, lump-sum election rates, rates of return on plan assets, future health care cost-trend rates, and rates of utilization of health care services by retirees.
due to the specialized nature of these calculations, we engage outside actuarial firms to assist in the determination of these projected benefit obligations and company contribution requirements.
ultimately, we will be required to fund all vested benefits under pension and postretirement benefit plans not funded by plan assets or investment returns, but the judgmental assumptions used in the actuarial calculations significantly affect periodic financial statements and funding patterns over time.
projected benefit obligations are particularly sensitive to the discount rate assumption.
a 100 basis-point decrease in the discount rate assumption would increase projected benefit obligations by $1.0 billion.
benefit expense is sensitive to the discount rate and return on plan assets assumptions.
a 100 basis-point decrease in the discount rate assumption would increase annual benefit expense by $70 million, while a 100 basis-point decrease in the return on plan assets assumption would increase annual benefit expense by $60 million.
in determining the discount rate, we use yields on high-quality fixed income investments matched to the estimated benefit cash flows of our plans.
we are also exposed to the possibility that lump sum retirement benefits taken from pension plans during the year could exceed the total of service and interest components of annual pension expense and trigger accelerated recognition of a portion of unrecognized net actuarial losses and gains.
these benefit payments are based on decisions by plan participants and are therefore difficult to predict.
in the event there is a significant reduction in the expected years of future service of present employees or the elimination of the accrual of defined benefits for some or all of their future services for a significant number of employees, we could recognize a curtailment gain or loss.

contingencies a number of claims and lawsuits are made against the company arising in the ordinary course of business.
management exercises judgment related to accounting and disclosure of these claims which includes losses, damages, and underpayments associated with environmental remediation, tax, contracts, and other legal disputes.
as we learn new facts concerning contingencies, we reassess our position both with respect to amounts recognized and disclosed considering changes to the probability of additional losses and potential exposure.
however, actual losses can and do vary from estimates for a variety of reasons including legal, arbitration, or other third-party decisions; settlement discussions;
evaluation of scope of damages; interpretation of regulatory or contractual terms; expected timing of future actions; and proportion of liability shared with other responsible parties.
estimated future costs related to contingencies are subject to change as events evolve and as additional information becomes available during the administrative and litigation processes.
for additional information on contingent liabilities, see the "contingencies"
section within "capital resources and liquidity" and note 11
.
income taxes we are subject to income taxation in numerous jurisdictions worldwide.
we record deferred tax assets and liabilities to account for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements and our tax returns.
we routinely assess our deferred tax assets and reduce such assets by a valuation allowance if we deem it is more likely than not that some portion, or all, of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.
in assessing the need for adjustments to existing valuation allowances, we consider all available positive and negative evidence.
positive evidence includes reversals of temporary differences, forecasts of future taxable income, assessment of future business assumptions and applicable tax planning strategies that are prudent and feasible.
negative evidence includes losses in recent years as well as the forecasts of future net income (loss) in the realizable period.
in making our assessment regarding valuation allowances, we weight the evidence based on objectivity.
numerous judgments and assumptions are inherent in the determination of future taxable income, including factors such as future operating conditions and the assessment of the effects of foreign taxes on our u.s.
federal income taxes
(particularly as related to prevai ling oil and gas prices).
see note 17
.
we regularly assess and, if required, establish accruals for uncertain tax positions that could result from assessments of additional tax by taxing jurisdictions in countries where we operate.
we recognize a tax benefit from an uncertain tax position when it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination, based on the technical merits of the position.
these accruals for uncertain tax positions are subject to a significant amount of judgment and are reviewed and adjusted on a periodic basis in light of changing facts and circumstances considering the progress of ongoing tax audits, court proceedings, changes in applicable tax laws, including tax case rulings and legislative guidance, or expiration of the applicable statute of limitations.

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk financial instrument market risk we and certain of our subsidiaries hold and issue derivative contracts and financial instruments that expose our cash flows or earnings to changes in commodity prices, foreign currency exchange rates or interest rates.
we may use financial and commodity-based derivative contracts to manage the risks produced by changes in the prices of natural gas, crude oil and related products; fluctuations in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates; or to capture market opportunities.
our use of derivative instruments is governed by an "authority limitations" document approved by our board of directors that prohibits the use of highly leveraged derivatives or derivative instruments without sufficient liquidity.
the authority limitations document also establishes the value at risk (var)
limits for the company, and compliance with these limits is monitored daily.
the executive vice president and chief financial officer, who reports to the chief executive officer, monitors commodity price risk and risks resulting from foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates.
the commercial organization manages our commercial marketing, optimizes our commodity flows and positions, and monitors risks.
commodity price risk our commercial organization uses futures, forwards, swaps and options in various markets to accomplish the following objectives:
●
meet customer needs.
consistent with our policy to generally remain exposed to market prices, we use swap contracts to convert fixed-price sales contracts, which are often requested by natural gas consumers, to floating market prices.
●
enable us to use market knowledge to capture opportunities such as moving physical commodities to more profitable locations and storing commodities to capture seasonal or time premiums.
we may use derivatives to optimize these activities.
we use a var model to estimate the loss in fair value that could potentially result on a single day from the effect of adverse changes in market conditions on the derivative financial instruments and derivative commodity instruments we hold or issue, including commodity purchases and sales contracts recorded on the balance sheet at december 31, 2021, as derivative instruments.
using monte carlo simulation, a 95 percent confidence level and a one-day holding period, the var for those instruments issued or held for trading purposes or held for purposes other than trading at december 31, 2021 and 2020, was immaterial to our consolidated cash flows and net income attributable to conocophillips.
interest rate risk the following table provides information about our debt instruments that are sensitive to changes in u.s. interest rates.
the table presents principal cash flows and related weighted-average interest rates by expected maturity dates.
weighted-average variable rates are based on effective rates at the reporting date.
the carrying amount of our floating-rate debt approximates its fair value.
a hypothetical 10 percent change in prevailing interest rates would not have a material impact on interest expense associated with our floating-rate debt.
the fair value of the fixed-rate debt is measured using prices available from a pricing service that is corroborated by market data.
changes to prevailing interest rates would not impact our cash flows associated with fixed rate debt, unless we elect to repurchase or retire such debt prior to maturity.

foreign currency exchange risk we have foreign currency exchange rate risk resulting from international operations.
we do not comprehensively hedge the exposure to currency exchange rate changes although we may choose to selectively hedge certain foreign currency exchange rate exposures, such as firm commitments for capital projects or local currency tax payments, dividends and cash returns from net investments in foreign affiliates to be remitted within the coming year, and investments in equity securities.
at december 31, 2021 and 2020, we held foreign currency exchange forwards hedging cross-border commercial activity and foreign currency exchange swaps for purposes of mitigating our cash-related exposures.
although these forwards and swaps hedge exposures to fluctuations in exchange rates, we elected not to utilize hedge accounting.
as a result, the change in the fair value of these foreign currency exchange derivatives is recorded directly in earnings.
at december 31, 2021, we had outstanding foreign currency exchange forward contracts to buy $1.9 billion aud at
$0.715 aud against the u.s. dollar.
at december 31, 2020, we had outstanding foreign currency exchange forward contracts to sell $0.45 billion cad at $0.748
cad against the u.s. dollar.
based on the assumed volatility in the fair value calculation, the net fair value of these foreign currency contracts at december 31, 2021 and december 31,
2020, were a before-tax gain of $21 million and before
-tax loss of $16 million, respectively.
based on an adverse hypothetical 10 percent change in the december 2021 and december 2020 exchange rate, this would result in an additional before-tax loss of $134 million and $39 million, respectively.
the sensitivity analysis is based on changing one assumption while holding all other assumptions constant, which in practice may be unlikely to occur, as changes in some of the assumptions may be correlated.

2021 10-k reports of management management prepared, and is responsible for, the consolidated financial statements and the other information appearing in this annual report.
the consolidated financial statements present fairly the company's financial position, results of operations and cash flows in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states.
in preparing its consolidated financial statements, the company includes amounts that are based on estimates and judgments management believes are reasonable under the circumstances.
the company's financial statements have been audited by ernst & young llp, an independent registered public accounting firm appointed by the audit and finance committee of the board of directors and ratified by stockholders.
management has made available to ernst & young llp all of the company's financial records and related data, as well as the minutes of stockholders' and directors'

assessment of internal control over financial reporting management is also responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting.
conocophillips' internal control system was designed to provide reasonable assurance to the company's management and directors regarding the preparation and fair presentatio n
of published financial statements.
all internal control systems, no matter how well designed, have inherent limitations.
therefore, even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation.
management assessed the effectiveness of the company's internal control over financial reporting as of december 31, 2021.
in making this assessment, it used the criteria set forth by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission in internal control-integrated framework (2013)
.
based on our assessment, we believe the company's internal control over financial reporting was effective as of december 31, 2021.
management's assessment of, and conclusion on, the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting did not include the internal controls of the assets acquired from shell enterprise llc in december 2021.
the total assets acquired represented approximately 10 percent of the company's consolidated total assets at december 31, 2021.
ernst & young llp has issued an audit report on the company's internal control over financial reporting as of december 31, 2021, and their report is included herein.

2021 10-k accounting for asset retirement obligations for certain offshore properties description of the matter at december 31, 2021, the asset retirement obligation (aro) balance totaled
$5.9 billion. as further described in note 8, the company records aros in the period in which they are incurred, typically when the asset is installed at the production location. the estimation of obligations related to certain offshore assets requires significant judgment given the magnitude and higher estimation uncertainty related to plugging and abandonment of wells and removal and disposal of offshore oil and gas platforms, facilities and pipelines costs
(collectively, removal costs). furthermore, given certain of these assets are nearing the end of their operations, the impact of changes in these aros may result in a material impact to earnings given the relatively short remainin g
useful lives of the assets.
auditing the company's aros for the obligations identified above is complex and highly judgmental due to the significant estimation required by management in determining the obligations. in particular, the estimates were sensitive to significant subjective assumptions such as removal cost estimates and end of field life, which are affected by expectations about future market or economic conditions.
how we addressed the matter in our audit we obtained an understanding, evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of the company's internal controls over its aro estimation process, including management's review of the significant assumptions that have a material effect on the determination of the obligations. we also tested management's controls over the completeness and accuracy of the financial data used in the valuation.
to test the aros for the obligations identified above, our audit procedures included, among others, assessing the significant assumptions and inputs used in the valuation, including removal cost estimates and end of field life assumptions. for example, we evaluated removal cost estimates by comparing to settlements and recent removal activities and costs.
we also compared end of field life assumptions to production forecasts.
depreciation, depletion and amortization of proved oil and gas properties, plants and equipment description of the matter at december 31, 2021, the net book value of the company's proved oil and gas properties, plants and equipment (pp&e) was $52 billion, and depreciation, depletion and amortization
(dd&a) expense was $7.0 billion for the year then ended. as described in note 1, under the successful efforts method of accounting, dd&a of pp&e on producing hydrocarbon properties and steam-assisted gravity drainage facilities and certain pipeline and liquified natural gas assets (those which are expected to have a declining utilization pattern) are determined by the unit-of-production method. the unit-of-production method uses proved oil and gas reserves, as estimated by the company's internal reservoir engineers.
proved oil and gas reserve estimates are based on geological and engineering assessments of in-place hydrocarbon volumes, the production plan, historical extraction recovery and processing yield factors, installed plant operating capacity and approved operating limits.
significant judgment is required by the company's internal reservoir engineers in evaluating geological and engineering data when estimating proved oil and gas reserves.
estimating proved oil and gas reserves also requires the selection of inputs, including oil and gas price assumptions, future operating and capital costs assumptions and tax rates by jurisdiction, among others. because of the complexity involved in estimating proved oil and gas reserves, management also used an independent petroleum engineering consulting firm to perform a review of the processes and controls used by the company's internal reservoir engineers to determine estimates of proved oil and gas reserves.

auditing the company's dd&a calculation is complex because of the use of the work of the internal reservoir engineers and the independent petroleum engineering consulting firm and the evaluation of management's determination of the inputs described above used by the internal reservoir engineers in estimating proved oil and gas reserves.
how we addressed the matter in our audit we obtained an understanding, evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of the company's internal controls over its processes to calculate dd&a, including management's controls over the completeness and accuracy of the financial data provided to the internal reservoir engineers for use in estimating proved oil and gas reserves.
our audit procedures included, among others, evaluating the professional qualifications and objectivity of the company's internal reservoir engineers primarily responsible for overseeing the preparation of the proved oil and gas reserve estimates and the independent petroleum engineering consulting firm used to review the company's processes and controls. in addition, in assessing whether we can use the work of the internal reservoir engineers, we evaluated the completeness and accuracy of the financial data and inputs described above used by the internal reservoir engineers in estimating proved oil and gas reserves by agreeing them to source documentation and we identified and evaluated corroborative and contrary evidence. we also tested the accuracy of the dd&a calculation, including comparing the proved oil and gas reserve amounts used in the calculation to the company's reserve report.
valuation and recognition of proved and unproved oil & gas properties acquired in business combinations description of the matter during 2021, the company closed its acquisition of concho resources inc. and its acquisition of permian assets from shell enterprises llc resulting in the recognition of proved and unproved oil and gas properties within net properties, plants and equipment of $18.9 billion and $8.6 billion, respectively.
as described in note 3, the transactions were accounted for as business combinations under fasb asc 805 using the acquisition method, which requires assets acquired and liabilities assumed to be measured at their acquisition date fair values.
oil and gas properties were valued using a discounted cash flow approach based on market participant assumptions and third party valuation experts were engaged by the company to prepare fair value estimates.
significant inputs to the valuation of proved and unproved oil and gas properties include estimates of future commodity price assumptions and production profiles of reserve estimates, the pace of drilling plans, future operating costs and discount rates using a market
-based weighted average cost of capital.
auditing the company's accounting for its valuation of proved and unproved oil and gas properties is complex and considerably judgmental due to the significant estimation required by management of reserves and resources associated with the acquired assets and the sensitivity of significant assumptions used in determining the fair value.
in evaluating the reasonableness of management's estimates and assumptions used, the audit testing procedures performed required a high degree of auditor judgment and additional effort, including involving internal specialists.
how we addressed the matter in our audit we obtained an understanding, evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of the company's internal controls over its process to estimate the fair value of the acquired proved and unproved oil and gas properties, including management's review of the significant assumptions used as inputs to the fair value calculations and final recording of the analysis.

2021 10-k to test the estimated fair value of the acquired proved and unproved oil and gas properties, our audit procedures included, among others, evaluating the significant assumptions used and testing the completeness and accuracy of the underlying data supporting the significant assumptions. for example, we compared certain significant assumptions to current industry, third-party data and historical results for reasonableness. we also performed sensitivity analyses of significant assumptions, to evaluate the extent of their impact to the fair value calculation. in addition, we involved our valuation specialists to assist with certain significant assumptions included in the fair value estimate.
furthermore, we evaluated the professional qualifications and objectivity of the third party valuation specialist engaged by the company to prepare the fair value of the acquired proved and unproved oil and gas properties.

report of independent registered public accounting firm to the stockholders and the board of directors of conocophillips opinion on internal control over financial reporting we have audited conocophillips'
internal control over financial reporting as of december 31, 2021, based on criteria established in internal control
-integrated framework issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission (2013 framework) (the coso criteria).
in our opinion, conocophillips
(the company) maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of december 31, 2021, based on the coso criteria. as indicated under the heading "assessment of internal control over financial reporting" in the accompanying reports of management, management's assessment of and conclusion on the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting did not include the internal controls of the assets acquired from shell enterprise llc, which is included in the 2021 consolidated financial statements of conocophillips and constituted approximately
10 percent of consolidated total assets as of december 31, 2021.
our audit of internal control over financial reporting of conocophillips also did not include an evaluation of the internal control over financial reporting of the assets acquired from shell enterprise llc.
we also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the public company accounting oversight board
(united states) (pcaob), the consolidated balance sheets of the company as of december 31, 2021 and 2020, the related consolidated income statement, consolidated statements of comprehensive income, changes in equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended december 31, 2021, and the related notes and our report dated february 17, 2022, expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.
basis for opinion the company's management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included under the heading
"assessment of internal control over financial reporting" in the accompanying "reports of management."
our responsibility is to express an opinion on the company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. we are a public accounting firm registered with the pcaob and are required to be independent with respect to the company in accordance with the u.s.
federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the securities and exchange commission and the pcaob.
we conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the pcaob. those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.
our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances.
we believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

2021 10-k definition and limitations of internal control over financial reporting a company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. a company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that
(1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company;
and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

2021 10-k notes to consolidated financial statements note 1-accounting policies
●
consolidation principles and investments
-our consolidated financial statements include the accounts of majority-owned, controlled subsidiaries and, if applicable, variable interest entities where we are the primary beneficiary.
the equity method is used to account for investments in affiliates in which we have the ability to exert significant influence over the affiliates' operating and financial policies.
when we do not have the ability to exert significant influence, the investment is measured at fair value except when the investment does not have a readily determinable fair value.
for those exceptions, it will be measured at cost minus impairment, plus or minus observable price changes in orderly transactions for an identical or similar investment of the same issuer.
undivided interests in oil and gas joint ventures, pipelines, natural gas plants and terminals are consolidated on a proportionate basis.
other securities and investments are generally carried at cost.
we manage our operations through six operating segments, defined by geographic region:
alaska; lower 48; canada; europe, middle east and north africa; asia pacific; and other international.
see note 23
.
●
foreign currency translation
-adjustments resulting from the process of translating foreign functional currency financial statements into u.s. dollars are included in accumulated other comprehensive loss in common stockholders' equity.
foreign currency transaction gains and losses are included in current earnings.
some of our foreign operations use their local currency as the functional currency.
●
use of estimates
-the preparation of financial statements in conformity with u.s. gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and the disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities.
actual results could differ from these estimates.
●
revenue recognition
-revenues associated with the sales of crude oil, bitumen, natural gas, lng, ngls and other items are recognized at the point in time when the customer obtains control of the asset.
in evaluating when a customer has control of the asset, we primarily consider whether the transfer of legal title and physical delivery has occurred, whether the customer has significant risks and rewards of ownership and whether the customer has accepted delivery and a right to payment exists.
these products are typically sold at prevailing market prices.
we allocate variable market-based consideration to deliveries (performance obligations)
in the current period as that consideration relates specifically to our efforts to transfer control of current period deliveries to the customer and represents the amount we expect to be entitled to in exchange for the related products.
payment is typically due within 30 days or less.
revenues associated with transactions commonly called buy/sell contracts, in which the purchase and sale of inventory with the same counterparty are entered into "in contemplation"
of one another, are combined and reported net (i.e., on the same income statement line).
●
shipping and handling costs
-we typically incur shipping and handling costs prior to control transferring to the customer and account for these activities as fulfillment costs.
accordingly, we include shipping and handling costs in production and operating expenses for production activities.
transportation costs related to marketing activities are recorded in purchased commodities.
freight costs billed to customers are treated as a component of the transaction price and recorded as a component of revenue when the customer obtains control.
●
cash equivalents
-cash equivalents are highly liquid, short-term investments that are readily convertible to known amounts of cash and have original maturities of 90 days or less from their date of purchase.
they are carried at cost plus accrued interest, which approximates fair value.
notes to consolidated financial statements conocophillips
2021 10-k
88
●
short-term investments
-short-term investments include investments in bank time deposits and marketable securities (commercial paper and government obligations)
which are carried at cost plus accrued interest and have original maturities of greater than 90 days but within one year or when the remaining maturities are within one year.
we also invest in financial instruments classified as available for sale debt securities which are carried at fair value. those instruments are included in short-term investments when they have remaining maturities within one year as of the balance sheet date.
●
long-term investments in debt securities
-long-term investments in debt securities includes financial instruments classified as available for sale debt securities with remaining maturities greater than one year as of the balance sheet date.
they are carried at fair value and presented within the "investments and long-term receivables" line of our consolidated balance sheet.
●
inventories
-we have several valuation methods for our various types of inventories and consistently use the following methods for each type of inventory.
the majority of our commodity-related inventories are recorded at cost using the lifo basis.
we measure these inventories at the lower-of-cost-or-market in the aggregate.
any necessary lower-of-cost-or-market write-downs at year end are recorded as permanent adjustments to the lifo cost basis.
lifo is used to better match current inventory costs with current revenues.
costs include both direct and indirect expenditures incurred in bringing an item or product to its existing condition and location, but not unusual/nonrecurring costs or research and development costs.
materials, supplies and other miscellaneous inventories, such as tubular goods and well equipment, are valued using various methods, including the weighted-average
-cost method and the fifo method, consistent with industry practice.
●
fair value measurements
-assets and liabilities measured at fair value and required to be categorized within the fair value hierarchy are categorized into one of three different levels depending on the observability of the inputs employed in the measurement.
level 1 inputs are quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
level 2 inputs are observable inputs other than quoted prices included within level 1 for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly through market
-corroborated inputs.
level 3 inputs are unobservable inputs for the asset or liability reflecting significant modifications to observable related market data or our assumptions about pricing by market participants.
●
derivative instruments
-derivative instruments are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value.
if the right of offset exists and certain other criteria are met, derivative assets and liabilities with the same counterparty are netted on the balance sheet and the collateral payable or receivable is netted against derivative assets and derivative liabilities, respectively.
recognition and classification of the gain or loss that results from recording and adjusting a derivative to fair value depends on the purpose for issuing or holding the derivative.
gains and losses from derivatives not accounted for as hedges are recognized immediately in earnings.
we do not apply hedge accounting to our derivative instruments.
●
oil and gas exploration and development
-oil and gas exploration and development costs are accounted for using the successful efforts method of accounting.
property acquisition costs
-oil and gas leasehold acquisition costs are capitalized and included in the balance sheet caption pp&e.
leasehold impairment is recognized based on exploratory experience and management's judgment.
upon achievement of all conditions necessary for reserves to be classified as proved, the associated leasehold costs are reclassified to proved properties.
exploratory costs
-geological and geophysical costs and the costs of carrying and retaining undeveloped properties are expensed as incurred.
exploratory well costs are capitalized, or
"suspended,"
on the balance sheet pending further evaluation of whether economically recoverable reserves have been found.
if economically recoverable reserves are not found, exploratory well costs are expensed as dry holes.
if exploratory wells encounter potentially economic quantities of oil and notes to consolidated financial statements
89
conocophillips
2021 10-k gas, the well costs remain capitalized on the balance sheet as long as sufficient progress assessing the reserves and the economic and operating viability of the project is being made.
for complex exploratory discoveries, it is not unusual to have exploratory wells remain suspended on the balance sheet for several years while we perform additional appraisal drilling and seismic work on the potential oil and gas field or while we seek government or co-venturer approval of development plans or seek environmental permitting.
once all required approvals and permits have been obtained, the projects are moved into the development phase, and the oil and gas resources are designated as proved reserves.
management reviews suspended well balances quarterly, continuously monitors the results of the additional appraisal drilling and seismic work, and expenses the suspended well costs as dry holes when it judges the potential field does not warrant further investment in the near term.
see note 6
.
development costs
-costs incurred to drill and equip development wells, including unsuccessful development wells, are capital ized.
depletion and amortization
-leasehold costs of producing properties are depleted using the unit-of-
production method based on estimated proved oil and gas reserves.
amortization of development costs is based on the unit-of-production method using estimated proved developed oil and gas reserves.
●
capitalized interest
-interest from external borrowings is capitalized on major projects with an expected construction period of one year or longer.
capitalized interest is added to the cost of the underlying asset and is amortized over the useful lives of the assets in the same manner as the underlying assets.
●
depreciation and amortization
-depreciation and amortization of pp&e on producing hydrocarbon properties and sagd facilities and certain pipeline and lng assets (those which are expected to have a declining utilization pattern), are determined by the unit-of-production method.
depreciation and amortization of all other pp&e are determined by either the individual-unit-straight-line method or the group-straight-line method (for those individual units that are highly integrated with other units).
●
impairment of properties, plants and equipment
-long-lived assets used in operations are assessed for impairment whenever changes in facts and circumstances indicate a possible significant deterioration in the future cash flows expected to be generated by an asset group.
if there is an indication the carrying amount of an asset may not be recovered, a recoverability test is performed using management's assumptions for prices, volumes and future development plans.
if the sum of the undiscounted cash flows before income-taxes is less than the carrying value of the asset group, the carrying value is written down to estimated fair value and reported as an impairment in the period in which the determination is made.
individual assets are grouped for impairment purposes at the lowest level for which there are identifiable cash flows that are largely independent of the cash flows of other groups of assets-generally on a field-by-field basis for e&p assets.
because there usually is a lack of quoted market prices for long-
lived assets, the fair value of impaired assets is typically determined based on the present values of expected future cash flows using discount rates and prices believed to be consistent with those used by principal market participants, or based on a multiple of operating cash flow validated with historical market transactions of similar assets where possible.
the expected future cash flows used for impairment reviews and related fair value calculations are based on estimated future production volumes, commodity prices, operating costs and capital decisions, considering all available evidence at the date of review.
the impairment review includes cash flows from proved developed and undeveloped reserves, including any development expenditures necessary to achieve that production.
additionally, when probable and possible reserves exist, an appropriate risk-
adjusted amount of these reserves may be included in the impairment calculation.
notes to consolidated financial statements conocophillips
2021 10-k
90
long-lived assets committed by management for disposal within one year are accounted for at the lower of amortized cost or fair value, less cost to sell, with fair value determined using a binding negotiated price, if available, or present value of expected future cash flows as previously described.
●
maintenance and repairs
-costs of maintenance and repairs, which are not significant improvements, are expensed when incurred.
●
property dispositions
-when complete units of depreciable property are sold, the asset cost and related accumulated depreciation are eliminated, with any gain or loss reflected in the "gain on dispositions" line of our consolidated income statement.
when partial units of depreciable property are disposed of or retired which do not significantly alter the dd&a rate, the difference between asset cost and salvage value is charged or credited to accumulated depreciation.
●
asset retirement obligations and environmental costs
-the fair value of legal obligations to retire and remove long-lived assets are recorded in the period in which the obligation is incurred
(typically when the asset is installed at the production location).
fair value is estimated using a present value approach, incorporating assumptions about estimated amounts and timing of settlements and impacts of the use of technologies.
see note 8
.
environmental expenditures are expensed or capitalized, depending upon their future economic benefit.
expenditures relating to an existing condition caused by past operations, and those having no future economic benefit, are expensed.
liabilities for environmental expenditures are recorded on an undiscounted basis (unless acquired through a business combination, which we record on a discounted basis) when environmental assessments or cleanups are probable and the costs can be reasonably estimated.
recoveries of environmental remediation costs from other parties are recorded as assets when their receipt is probable and estimable.
●
impairment of investments in nonconsolidated entities
-investments in nonconsolidated entities are assessed for impairment whenever changes in the facts and circumstances indicate a loss in value has occurred.
when such a condition is judgmentally determined to be other than temporary, the carrying value of the investment is written down to fair value.
the fair value of the impaired investment is based on quoted market prices, if available, or upon the present value of expected future cash flows using discount rates and prices believed to be consistent with those used by principal market participants, plus market analysis of comparable assets owned by the investee, if appropriate.
●
guarantees
-the fair value of a guarantee is determined and recorded as a liability at the time the guarantee is given.
the initial liability is subsequently reduced as we are released from exposure under the guarantee.
we amortize the guarantee liability over the relevant time period, if one exists, based on the facts and circumstances surrounding each type of guarantee.
in cases where the guarantee term is indefinite, we reverse the liability when we have information indicating the liability is essentially relieved or amortize it over an appropriate time period as the fair value of our guarantee exposure declines over time.
we amortize the guarantee liability to the related income statement line item based on the nature of the guarantee.
when it becomes probable that we will have to perform on a guarantee, we accrue a
separate liability if it is reasonably estimable, based on the facts and circumstances at that time.
we reverse the fair value liability only when there is no further exposure under the guarantee.
●
share-based compensation
-we recognize share
-based compensation expense over the shorter of the service period (i.e., the stated period of time required to earn the award) or the period beginning at the start of the service period and ending when an employee first becomes eligible for retirement.
we have elected to recognize expense on a straight-line basis over the service period for the entire award, whether the award was granted with ratable or cliff vesting.
notes to consolidated financial statements

conocophillips
2021 10-k
●
income taxes
-deferred income taxes are computed using the liability method and are provided on all temporary differences between the financial reporting basis and the tax basis of our assets and liabilities, except for deferred taxes on income and temporary differences related to the cumulative translation adjustment considered to be permanently reinvested in certain foreign subsidiaries and foreign corporate joint ventures.
allowable tax credits are applied currently as reductions of the provision for income taxes.
interest related to unrecognized tax benefits is reflected in interest and debt expense, and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits are reflected in production and operating expenses.
●
taxes collected from customers and remitted to governmental authorities
-sales and value-added taxes are recorded net.
●
net income (loss) per share of common stock
-basic net income (loss) per share of common stock is calculated based upon the daily weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the year.
also, this calculation includes fully vested stock and unit awards that have not yet been issued as common stock, along with an adjustment to net income (loss) for dividend equivalents paid on unvested unit awards that are considered participating securities.
diluted net income per share of common stock includes unvested stock, unit or option awards granted under our compensation plans and vested but unexercised stock options, but only to the extent these instruments dilute net income per share, primarily under the treasury-stock method.
diluted net loss per share, which is calculated the same as basic net loss per share, does not assume conversion or exercise of securities that would have an antidilutive effect.
treasury stock is excluded from the daily weighted
-average number of common shares outstanding in both calculations.
the earnings per share impact of the participating securities is immaterial.

during the year, we completed the acquisitions of concho resources inc. (concho) and of shell enterprises llc's
(shell) permian assets.
the acquisitions were accounted for as business combinations under fasb topic asc 805
using the acquisition method, which requires assets acquired and liabilities assumed to be measured at their acquisition date fair values.
fair value measurements were made for acquired assets and liabilities, and adjustments to those measurements may be made in subsequent periods, up to one year from the acquisition date as we identify new information about facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date to consider.

2021 10-k with the completion of the concho transaction, we acquired proved and unproved properties of approximately
$
11.8
billion and $
6.9
billion, respectively.
we recognized approximately
$
157
million of transaction-related costs, all of which were expensed in the first quarter of 2021.
these non-recurring costs related primarily to fees paid to advisors and the settlement of share-
based awards for certain concho employees based on the terms of the merger agreement.
in the first quarter of 2021, we commenced a company-wide restructuring program, the scope of which included combining the operations of the two companies as well as other global restructuring activities.
we recognized non-recurring restructuring costs mainly for employee severance and related incremental pension benefit costs.

oil and gas properties were valued using a discounted cash flow approach incorporating market participant and internally generated price assumptions ,
production profiles, and operating and development cost assumptions.
the fair values determined for accounts receivable, accounts payable, and most other current assets and current liabilities were equivalent to the carrying value due to their short-term nature.
the total consideration of $
8.7
billion was allocated to the identifiable assets and liabilities based on their fair values at the acquisition date.

the unaudited pro forma financial information for the twelve-month period ending december 31, 2020
is a result of combining the consolidated income statement of conocophillips with the results of concho and the assets acquired from shell.

the pro forma results include adjustments from concho's historical results to reverse impairment expense of $
10.5
billion and $
1.9
billion related to oil and gas properties and goodwill, respectively.
other adjustments made relate primarily to dd&a, which is based on the unit-of-production method, resulting from the purchase price allocated to properties, plants and equipment.

aplng aplng is a joint venture focused on producing cbm from the bowen and surat basins in queensland, australia.
natural gas is sold to domestic customers and lng is processed and exported to asia pacific markets.
our investment in aplng gives us access to cbm resources in australia and enhances our lng position.
the majority of aplng lng is sold under two long-term sales and purchase agreements, supplemented with sales of additional lng spot cargoes targeting the asia pacific markets.
origin energy, an integrated australian energy company, is the operator of aplng's production and pipeline system, while we operate the lng facility.
aplng executed project financing agreements for an $
8.5
billion project finance facility in 2012.
all amounts were drawn from the facility.
aplng achieved financial completion on its original
$
8.5
billion project finance facility during the third quarter of 2017, resulting in the facility being nonrecourse.
the project financing facility has been refinanced over time and at december 31, 2021, this facility was composed of a financing agreement with the export-import bank of the united states, a commercial bank facility and two united states private placement note facilities.
aplng made its first principal and interest repayment in march 2017 and is scheduled to make bi-annual payments until september 2030.
at december 31, 2021, a balance of $
5.7
billion was outstanding on the facilities.
see note 10
.
during the fourth quarter of 2021, origin energy limited agreed to the sale of
10
percent of their interest in aplng for $
1.645
billion, before customary adjustments.
conocophillips announced in december 2021 that we were exercising our preemption right under the aplng shareholders agreement to purchase an additional
10
percent shareholding interest in aplng, subject to government approvals.
the sales price associated with this preemption right was determined to reflect a relevant observable market participant view of aplng's fair value which was below the carrying value of our existing investment in aplng.
based on a review of the facts and circumstances surrounding this decline in fair value, we concluded in the fourth quarter of 2021 the impairment was other than temporary under the guidance of fasb asc topic 323, and the recognition of an impairment of our existing investment was necessary.
accordingly, we recorded a noncash $
688
million, before-tax and after-tax impairment in the fourth quarter of 2021.
the impairment, which is included in the "impairments" line on our consolidated income statement, had the effect of reducing the carrying value of our existing investment to $
5,574
million as of december 31, 2021.
this carrying value is included in the "investments and long-term receivables" line on our consolidated balance sheet.

2021 10-k the historical cost basis of our
37.5
percent share of net assets on the books of aplng was $
5,523
million, resulting in a basis difference of $
51
million on our books.
the basis difference, which is substantially all associated with pp&e and subject to amortization, has been allocated on a relative fair value basis to individual production license areas owned by aplng.
any future additional payments are expected to be allocated in a similar manner.
as the joint venture produces natural gas from each license, we amortize the basis difference allocated to that license using the unit-of-production method.
included in net income (loss) attributable to conocophillips for 2021, 2020 and 2019 was after-tax expense of $
39
million, $
41
million and $
36
million, respectively, representing the amortization of this basis difference on currently producing licenses.
qg3
qg3 is a joint venture that owns an integrated large-scale lng project located in qatar.
we provided project financing, with a current outstanding balance of $
114
million as described below under "loans."
at december 31,
2021, the book value of our equity method investment in qg3, excluding the project financing, was
$
736
million.
we have terminal and pipeline use agreements with golden pass lng terminal and affiliated golden pass pipeline near sabine pass, texas, intended to provide us with terminal and pipeline capacity for the receipt, storage and regasification of lng purchased from qg3.
we previously held a
12.4
percent interest in golden pass lng terminal and golden pass pipeline, but we sold those interests in the second quarter of 2019 while retaining the basic use agreements.
currently, the lng from qg3 is being sold to markets outside of the u.s.
see note 3
.
loans as part of our normal ongoing business operations and consistent with industry practice, we enter into numerous agreements with other parties to pursue business opportunities.
included in such activity are loans to certain affiliated and non-affiliated companies.
at december 31, 2021, significant loans to affiliated companies include $
114
million in project financing to qg3
which is recorded within the "accounts and notes receivable-related parties" line on our consolidated balance sheet.

2021 10-k asset retirement obligations we record the fair value of a liability for an aro when it is incurred (typically when the asset is installed at the production location).
when the liability is initially recorded, we capitalize the associated asset retirement cost by increasing the carrying amount of the related pp&e.
if, in subsequent periods, our estimate of this liability changes, we will record an adjustment to both the liability and pp&e.
over time, the liability increases for the change in its present value, while the capitalized cost depreciates over the useful life of the related asset.
reductions to estimated liabilities for assets that are no longer producing are recorded as a credit to impairment, if the asset had been previously impaired, or as a credit to dd&a, if the asset had not been previously impaired
.
we have numerous aros we are required to perform under law or contract once an asset is permanently taken out of service.
most of these obligations are not expected to be paid until several years, or decades, in the future and will be funded from general company resources at the time of removal.
our largest individual obligations involve plugging and abandonment of wells and removal and disposal of offshore oil and gas platforms around the world, as well as oil and gas production facilities and pipelines in alaska.

2021 10-k on january 15, 2021, we completed the acquisition of concho in an all-stock transaction.
in the acquisition, we assumed concho's publicly traded debt, with an outstanding principal balance of $
3.9
billion, which was recorded at fair value of $
4.7
billion on the acquisition date.
the adjustment to fair value of the senior notes of approximately $
0.8
billion on the acquisition date will be amortized as an adjustment to interest expense over the remaining contractual terms of the senior notes.
in the first quarter of 2021, we completed a debt exchange offer related to the debt assumed from concho.
of the approximately $
3.9
billion in aggregate principal amount of concho's senior notes offered in the exchange,
98
percent, or approximately
$
3.8
billion, was tendered and accepted.
the new debt issued by conocophillips had the same interest rates and maturity dates as the concho senior notes.
the portion not exchanged, approximately
$
67
million, remained outstanding across five series of senior notes issued by concho.
the debt exchange was treated as a debt modification for accounting purposes resulting in a portion of the unamortized fair value adjustment of the concho senior notes allocated to the new debt issued by conocophillips on the settlement date of the exchange.
the new debt issued in the exchange is fully and unconditionally guaranteed by conocophillips company.
see note 3.
we have a revolving credit facility totaling $
6.0
billion with an expiration date of may 2023.
our revolving credit facility may be used for direct bank borrowings, the issuance of letters of credit totaling up to $
500
million, or as support for our commercial paper program.
the revolving credit facility is broadly syndicated among financial institutions and does not contain any material adverse change provisions or any covenants requiring maintenance of specified financial ratios or credit ratings.
the facility agreement contains a cross-default provision relating to the failure to pay principal or interest on other debt obligations of $
200
million or more by conocophillips, or any of its consolidated subsidiaries.
the amount of the facility is not subject to redetermination prior to its expiration date.
credit facility borrowings may bear interest at a margin above rates offered by certain designated banks in the london interbank market or at a margin above the overnight federal funds rate or prime rates offered by certain designated banks in the u.s.
the facility agreement calls for commitment fees on available, but unused, amounts.
the agreement also contains early termination rights if our current directors or their approved successors cease to be a majority of the board of directors.
the revolving credit facility supports our ability to issue up to $
6.0
billion of commercial paper, which is primarily a funding source for short-term working capital needs.
commercial paper maturities are generally limited to
90
days
.
with no commercial paper outstanding and no direct borrowings or letters of credit, we had access to
$
6.0
billion in available borrowing capacity under our revolving credit facility at december 31, 2021.
we had no direct borrowings, letters of credit, and $
300
million of commercial paper outstanding as of december 31, 2020.
for information on finance leases, see note 15
.
the current credit ratings on our long-term debt are:
●
fitch: "a" with a "stable" outlook
.
●
s&p: "a-" with a "stable" outlook
.
●
moody's: "a3" with a "positive" outlook
.
we do not have any ratings triggers on any of our corporate debt that would cause an automatic default, and thereby impact our access to liquidity, upon downgrade of our credit ratings.
if our credit ratings are downgraded from their current levels, it could increase the cost of corporate debt available to us and restrict our access to the commercial paper markets.
if our credit rating were to deteriorate to a level prohibiting us from accessing the commercial paper market, we would still be able to access funds under our revolving credit facility.
at both december 31, 2021 and 2020, we had $
283
million of certain variable rate demand bonds (vrdbs)
outstanding with maturities ranging through 2035.
the vrdbs are redeemable at the option of the bondholders on any business day.
if they are ever redeemed, we have the ability and intent to refinance on a long-term basis, therefore, the vrdbs are included in the "long-term debt" line on our consolidated balance sheet.

note 10-guarantees at december 31, 2021, we were liable for certain contingent obligations under various contractual arrangements as described below.
we recognize a liability, at inception, for the fair value of our obligation as a guarantor for newly issued or modified guarantees.
unless the carrying amount of the liability is noted below, we have not recognized a liability because the fair value of the obligation is immaterial.
in addition, unless otherwise stated, we are not currently performing with any significance under the guarantee and expect future performance to be either immaterial or have only a remote chance of occurrence.
aplng guarantees at december 31, 2021, we had outstanding multiple guarantees in connection with our
37.5
percent ownership interest in aplng.
the following is a description of the guarantees with values calculated utilizing december 2021
exchange rates:
●
during the third quarter of 2016, we issued a guarantee to facilitate the withdrawal of our pro-rata portion of the funds in a project finance reserve account.
we estimate the remaining term of this guarantee to be
9
years.
our maximum exposure under this guarantee is approximately $
170
million and may become payable if an enforcement action is commenced by the project finance lenders against aplng.
at december 31, 2021, the carrying value of this guarantee is approximately
$
14
million.
●
in conjunction with our original purchase of an ownership interest in aplng from origin energy in october 2008, we agreed to reimburse origin energy for our share of the existing contingent liability arising under guarantees of an existing obligation of aplng to deliver natural gas under several sales agreements.
the final guarantee expires in the fourth quarter of 2041.
our maximum potential liability for future payments, or cost of volume delivery, under these guarantees is estimated to be $
660
million
($
1.2
billion in the event of intentional or reckless breach) and would become payable if aplng fails to meet its obligations under these agreements and the obligations cannot otherwise be mitigated.
future payments are considered unlikely, as the payments, or cost of volume delivery, would only be triggered if aplng does not have enough natural gas to meet these sales commitments and if the co-ventures do not make necessary equity contributions into aplng.
●
we have guaranteed the performance of aplng with regard to certain other contracts executed in connection with the project's continued development.
the guarantees have remaining terms of
15 to 24
years or the life of the venture.
our maximum potential amount of future payments related to these guarantees is approximately
$
180
million and would become payable if aplng does not perform.
at december 31, 2021, the carrying value of these guarantees was approximately $
11
million.
other guarantees we have other guarantees with maximum future potential payment amounts totaling approximately
$
720
million, which consist primarily of guarantees of the residual value of leased office buildings, guarantees of the residual value of corporate aircraft, and a guarantee for our portion of a joint venture's project finance reserve accounts.
these guarantees have remaining terms of one to five years and would become payable if certain asset values are lower than guaranteed amounts at the end of the lease or contract term, business conditions decline at guaranteed entities, or as a result of nonperformance of contractual terms by guaranteed parties.
at december 31, 2021, the carrying value of these guarantees was approximately $
8
million.
indemnifications over the years, we have entered into agreements to sell ownership interests in certain legal entities, joint ventures and assets that gave rise to qualifying indemnifications.
these agreements include indemnifications for taxes and environmental liabilities.
the carrying amount recorded for these indemnifications at december 31, 2021, was approximately $
20
million.
those related to environmental issues have terms that are generally indefinite and the maximum amounts of future payments are generally unlimited.
although it is reasonably possible future payments may exceed amounts recorded, due to the nature of the indemnifications, it is not possible to make a reasonable estimate of the maximum potential amount of future payments.
see note 11
for additional information about environmental liabilities.

2021 10-k note 11-contingencies and commitments a number of lawsuits involving a variety of claims arising in the ordinary course of business have been filed against conocophillips.
we also may be required to remove or mitigate the effects on the environment of the placement, storage, disposal or release of certain chemical, mineral and petroleum substances at various active and inactive sites.
we regularly assess the need for accounting recognition or disclosure of these contingencies.
in the case of all known contingencies (other than those related to income taxes), we accrue a liability when the loss is probable and the amount is reasonably estimable.
if a range of amounts can be reasonably estimated and no amount within the range is a better estimate than any other amount, then the low end of the range is accrued.
we do not reduce these liabilities for potential insurance or third-party recoveries.
we accrue receivables for insurance or other third-party recoveries when applicable.
with respect to income tax-related contingencies, we use a cumulative probability-weighted loss accrual in cases where sustaining a tax position is less than certain.
see note 17
, for additional information about income tax
-related contingencies.
based on currently available information, we believe it is remote that future costs related to known contingent liability exposures will exceed current accruals by an amount that would have a material adverse impact on our consolidated financial statements.
as we learn new facts concerning contingencies, we reassess our position both with respect to accrued liabilities and other potential exposures.
estimates particularly sensitive to future changes include contingent liabilities recorded for environmental remediation, tax and legal matters.
estimated future environmental remediation costs are subject to change due to such factors as the uncertain magnitude of cleanup costs, the unknown time and extent of such remedial actions that may be required, and the determination of our liability in proportion to that of other responsible parties.
estimated future costs related to tax and legal matters are subject to change as events evolve and as additional information becomes available during the administrative and litigation processes.
environmental we are subject to international, federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations and record accruals for environmental liabilities based on management's best estimates
.
these estimates are based on currently available facts, existing technology, and presently enacted laws and regulations, taking into account stakeholder and business considerations.
when measuring environmental liabilities, we also consider our prior experience in remediation of contaminated sites, other companies' cleanup experience, and data released by the u.s. epa or other organizations.
we consider unasserted claims in our determination of environmental liabilities, and we accrue them in the period they are both probable and reasonably estimable.
although liability of those potentially responsible for environmental remediation costs is generally joint and several for federal sites and frequently so for other sites, we are usually only one of many companies cited at a particular site.
due to the joint and several liabilities, we could be responsible for all cleanup costs related to any site at which we have been designated as a potentially responsible party.
we have been successful to date in sharing cleanup costs with other financially sound companies.
many of the sites at which we are potentially responsible are still under investigation by the epa or the agency concerned.
prior to actual cleanup, those potentially responsible normally assess the site conditions, apportion responsibility and determine the appropriate remediation.
in some instances, we may have no liability or may attain a settlement of liability.
where it appears that other potentially responsible parties may be financially unable to bear their proportional share, we consider this inability in estimating our potential liability, and we adjust our accruals accordingly.
as a result of various acquisitions in the past, we assumed certain environmental obligations.
some of these environmental obligations are mitigated by indemnifications made by others for our benefit, and some of the indemnifications are subject to dollar limits and time limits.
we are currently participating in environmental assessments and cleanups at numerous federal superfund and comparable state and international sites.
after an assessment of environmental exposures for cleanup and other costs, we make accruals on an undiscounted basis (except those acquired in a purchase business combination, which we record on a discounted basis) for planned investigation and remediation activities for sites where it is probable future costs will be incurred and these costs can be reasonably estimated.
we have not reduced these accruals for possible insurance recoveries.
in the future, we may be involved in additional environmental assessments, cleanups and proceedings.
see note 8
, for a summary of our accrued environmental liabilities.

litigation and other contingencies we are subject to various lawsuits and claims including but not limited to matters involving oil and gas royalty and severance tax payments, gas measurement and valuation methods, contract disputes, environmental damages, climate change, personal injury, and property damage.
our primary exposures for such matters relate to alleged royalty and tax underpayments on certain federal, state and privately owned properties, claims of alleged environmental contamination and damages from historic operations ,
and climate change.
we will continue to defend ourselves vigorously in these matters.
our legal organization applies its knowledge, experience and professional judgment to the specific characteristics of our cases, employing a litigation management process to manage and monitor the legal proceedings against us.
our process facilitates the early evaluation and quantification of potential exposures in individual cases.
this process also enables us to track those cases that have been scheduled for trial and/or mediation.
based on professional judgment and experience in using these litigation management tools and available information about current developments in all our cases, our legal organization regularly assesses the adequacy of current accruals and determines if adjustment of existing accruals, or establishment of new accruals, is required.
we have contingent liabilities resulting from throughput agreements with pipeline and processing companies not associated with financing arrangements.
under these agreements, we may be required to provide any such company with additional funds through advances and penalties for fees related to throughput capacity not utilized.
in addition, at december 31, 2021, we had performance obligations secured by letters of credit of $
337
million (issued as direct bank letters of credit)
related to various purchase commitments for materials, supplies, commercial activities and services incident to the ordinary conduct of business.
in 2007, conocophillips was unable to reach agreement with respect to the empresa mixta structure mandated by the venezuelan government's nationalization decree.
as a result, venezuela's national oil company, petróleos de venezuela, s.a. (pdvsa), or its affiliates, directly assumed control over conocophillips' interests in the petrozuata and hamaca heavy oil ventures and the offshore corocoro development project.
in response to this expropriation, conocophillips initiated international arbitration on november 2, 2007, with the icsid.
on september 3, 2013, an icsid arbitration tribunal held that venezuela unlawfully expropriated conocophillips'
significant oil investments in june 2007.
on january 17, 2017, the tribunal reconfirmed the decision that the expropriation was unlawful.
in march 2019, the tribunal unanimously ordered the government of venezuela to pay conocophillips approximately
$
8.7
billion in compensation for the government's unlawful expropriation of the company's investments in venezuela in 2007.
on august 29, 2019, the icsid tribunal issued a decision rectifying the award and reducing it by approximately $
227
million.
the award now stands at
$
8.5
billion plus interest.
the government of venezuela sought annulment of the award, which automatically stayed enforcement of the award.
on september 29, 2021, the icsid annulment committee lifted the stay of enforcement of the award.
the annulment proceedings have been suspended as a result of venezuela's non-payment of advances to cover the costs of these proceedings.
in 2014, conocophillips filed a separate and independent arbitration under the rules of the icc against pdvsa under the contracts that had established the petrozuata and hamaca projects.
the icc tribunal issued an award in april 2018, finding that pdvsa owed conocophillips approximately $
2
billion under their agreements in connection with the expropriation of the projects and other pre-expropriation fiscal measures.
in august 2018, conocophillips entered into a settlement with pdvsa to recover the full amount of this icc award, plus interest through the payment period, including initial payments totaling approximately $500 million within a period of 90 days from the time of signing of the settlement agreement. the balance of the settlement is to be paid quarterly over a period of four and a half years.
per the settlement, pdvsa recognized the icc award as a judgment in various jurisdictions, and conocophillips agreed to suspend its legal enforcement actions.
conocophillips sent notices of default to pdvsa on october 14 and november 12, 2019, and to date pdvsa has failed to cure its breach.
as a result, conocophillips has resumed legal enforcement actions.
to date, conocophillips has received approximately
$
768
million in connection with the icc award.
conocophillips has ensured that the settlement and any actions taken in enforcement thereof meet all appropriate u.s. regulatory requirements, including those related to any applicable sanctions imposed by the u.s. against venezuela.

on august 2, 2019, the icc tribunal awarded conocophillips approximately
$
33
million plus interest under the corocoro contracts.
conocophillips is seeking recognition and enforcement of the award in various jurisdictions.
conocophillips has ensured that all the actions related to the award meet all appropriate u.s. regulatory requirements, including those related to any applicable sanctions imposed by the u.s. against venezuela.
the office of natural resources revenue (onrr) has conducted audits of conocophillips' payment of royalties on federal lands and has issued multiple orders to pay additional royalties to the federal government.
conocophillips and the onrr entered into a settlement agreement on march 23, 2021, to resolve the dispute.
all orders and associated appeals have been withdrawn with prejudice.
beginning in 2017, governmental and other entities in several states in the u.s. have filed lawsuits against oil and gas companies, including conocophillips, seeking compensatory damages and equitable relief to abate alleged climate change impacts.
additional lawsuits with similar allegations are expected to be filed.
the amounts claimed by plaintiffs are unspecified and the legal and factual issues involved in these cases are unprecedented.
conocophillips believes these lawsuits are factually and legally meritless and are an inappropriate vehicle to address the challenges associated with climate change and will vigorously defend against such lawsuits.
several louisiana parishes and the state of louisiana have filed
43
lawsuits under louisiana's state and local coastal resources management act (slcrma) against oil and gas companies, including conocophillips, seeking compensatory damages for contamination and erosion of the louisiana coastline allegedly caused by historical oil and gas operations.
conocophillips entities are defendants in
22
of the lawsuits and will vigorously defend against them.
because plaintiffs' slcrma theories are unprecedented, there is uncertainty about these claims (both as to scope and damages) and we continue to evaluate our exposure in these lawsuits
.
in october 2020, the bureau of safety and environmental enforcement
(bsee) ordered the prior owners of outer continental shelf (ocs) lease p-0166, including conocophillips, to decommission the lease facilities, including two offshore platforms located near carpinteria, california.
this order was sent after the current owner of ocs lease p-0166 relinquished the lease and abandoned the lease platforms and facilities.
bsee's order to conocophillips is premised on its connection to phillips petroleum company, a legacy company of conocophillips, which held a historical
25
percent interest in this lease and operated these facilities, but sold its interest approximately
30
years ago.
conocophillips continues to evaluate our exposure in these lawsuits.
on may 10, 2021, conocophillips filed arbitration under the rules of the singapore international arbitration centre
(siac) against santos kotn pty ltd. and santos limited for their failure to timely pay the $
200
million bonus due upon fid of the barossa development project under the sale and purchase agreement.
santos kotn pty ltd. and santos limited have filed a response and counterclaim, and the arbitration is underway.
in july 2021, a federal securities class action was filed against concho, certain of concho's officers, and conocophillips as concho's successor in the united states district court for the southern district of texas.
on october 21, 2021, the court issued an order appointing utah retirement systems and the construction laborers pension trust for southern california as lead plaintiffs
(lead plaintiffs).
on january 7, 2022, the lead plaintiffs filed their consolidated complaint alleging that concho made materially false and misleading statements regarding its business and operations in violation of the federal securities laws and seeking unspecified damages, attorneys'
fees, costs, equitable/injunctive relief, and such other relief that may be deemed appropriate.
we believe the allegations in the action are without merit, and we intend to vigorously defend this litigation.
long-term throughput agreements and take
-or-pay agreements we have certain throughput agreements and take-or-pay agreements in support of financing arrangements.
the agreements typically provide for natural gas or crude oil transportation to be used in the ordinary course of business.

note 12-derivative and financial instruments we use futures, forwards, swaps and options in various markets to meet our customer needs, capture market opportunities, and manage foreign exchange currency risk.
commodity derivative instruments our commodity business primarily consists of natural gas, crude oil, bitumen, lng and ngls.
commodity derivative instruments are held at fair value on our consolidated balance sheet.
where these balances have the right of setoff, they are presented on a net basis.
related cash flows are recorded as operating activities on our consolidated statement of cash flows.
on our consolidated income statement, gains and losses are recognized either on a gross basis if directly related to our physical business or a net basis if held for trading.

credit risk financial instruments potentially exposed to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash equivalents, short-term investments, long-term investments in debt securities, otc derivative contracts and trade receivables.
our cash equivalents and short-term investments are placed in high-quality commercial paper, government money market funds, u.s. government and government agency obligations, time deposits with major international banks and financial institutions, high-quality corporate bonds, foreign government obligations and asset-backed securities.
our long-term investments in debt securities are placed in high-quality corporate bonds, asset-backed securities, u.s. government and government agency obligations, foreign government obligations, and time deposits with major international banks and financial institutions.
the credit risk from our otc derivative contracts, such as forwards, swaps and options, derives from the counterparty to the transaction.
individual counterparty exposure is managed within predetermined credit limits and includes the use of cash-call margins when appropriate, thereby reducing the risk of significant nonperformance.
we also use futures, swaps and option contracts that have a negligible credit risk because these trades are cleared primarily with an exchange clearinghouse and subject to mandatory margin requirements until settled; however, we are exposed to the credit risk of those exchange brokers for receivables arising from daily margin cash calls, as well as for cash deposited to meet initial margin requirements.
our trade receivables result primarily from our petroleum operations and reflect a broad national and international customer base, which limits our exposure to concentrations of credit risk.
the majority of these receivables have payment terms of
30 days or less , and we continually monitor this exposure and the creditworthiness of the counterparties.
we may require collateral to limit the exposure to loss including, letters of credit, prepayments and surety bonds, as well as master netting arrangements to mitigate credit risk with counterparties that both buy from and sell to us, as these agreements permit the amounts owed by us or owed to others to be offset against amounts due to us.
certain of our derivative instruments contain provisions that require us to post collateral if the derivative exposure exceeds a threshold amount. we have contracts with fixed threshold amounts and other contracts with variable threshold amounts that are contingent on our credit rating. the variable threshold amounts typically decline for lower credit ratings, while both the variable and fixed threshold amounts typically revert to zero if we fall below investment grade. cash is the primary collateral in all contracts; however, many also permit us to post letters of credit as collateral, such as transactions administered through the new york mercantile exchange.
the aggregate fair value of all derivative instruments with such credit risk-related contingent features that were in a liability position on december 31, 2021 and december 31, 2020, was $
281
million and $
25
million, respectively.
for these instruments, no collateral was posted as of december 31, 2021 or december 31, 2020.
if our credit rating had been downgraded below investment grade on december 31, 2021, we would have been required to post $
252
million of additional collateral, either with cash or letters of credit.
note 13-fair value measurement we carry a portion of our assets and liabilities at fair value that are measured at the reporting date using an exit price (i.e., the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability) and disclosed according to the quality of valuation inputs under the fair value hierarchy.
the classification of an asset or liability is based on the lowest level of input significant to its fair value.
those that are initially classified as level 3 are subsequently reported as level 2 when the fair value derived from unobservable inputs is inconsequential to the overall fair value, or if corroborated market data becomes available.
assets and liabilities initially reported as level 2 are subsequently reported as level 3 if corroborated market data is no longer available.
there were no material transfers into or out of level 3 during 2021 or 2020.

-traded futures and options that are valued using unadjusted prices available from the underlying exchange.
level 1 also includes our investment in common shares of cve, which is valued using quotes for shares on the nyse, and our investments in u.s.
government obligations classified as available for sale debt securities, which are valued using exchange prices.
●
level 2 derivative assets and liabilities primarily represent otc swaps, options and forward purchase and sale contracts that are valued using adjusted exchange prices, prices provided by brokers or pricing service companies that are all corroborated by market data.
level 2 also includes our investments in debt securities classified as available for sale including investments in corporate bonds, commercial paper, asset-backed securities, u.s. government agency obligations and foreign government obligations that are valued using pricing provided by brokers or pricing service companies that are corroborated with market data.
●
level 3 derivative assets and liabilities consist of otc swaps, options and forward purchase and sale contracts where a significant portion of fair value is calculated from underlying market data that is not readily available.
the derived value uses industry standard methodologies that may consider the historical relationships among various commodities, modeled market prices, time value, volatility factors and other relevant economic measures.
the use of these inputs results in management's best estimate of fair value.

conocophillips announced in december 2021 that we were exercising our preemption right under the aplng shareholders agreement to purchase an additional 10 percent shareholding interest in aplng, subject to government approvals.
the sales price associated with this preemption right was determined to reflect a relevant observable market participant view of aplng's fair value which was below the carrying value of our existing investment in aplng.
as such, our investment in aplng was written down to its fair value of $

reported fair values of financial instruments we used the following methods and assumptions to estimate the fair value of financial instruments:
●
cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments:
the carrying amount reported on the balance sheet approximates fair value.
for those investments classified as available for sale debt securities, the carrying amount reported on the balance sheet is fair value.
●
accounts and notes receivable (including long-term and related parties): the carrying amount reported on the balance sheet approximates fair value.
the valuation technique and methods used to estimate the fair value of the current portion of fixed
-rate related party loans is consistent with loans and advances-
related parties.
●

for a discussion of the carrying value and fair value of our investment in cve common shares.
●
investments in debt securities classified as available for sale: the fair value of investments in debt securities categorized as level
1 in the fair value hierarchy is measured using exchange prices.
the fair value of investments in debt securities categorized as level 2 in the fair value hierarchy is measured using pricing provided by brokers or pricing service companies that are corroborate d
with market data.
see note

.
●
loans and advances-related parties: the carrying amount of floating-rate loans approximates fair value.
the fair value of fixed-rate loan activity is measured using market observable data and is categorized as level 2 in the fair value hierarchy.

.
●
accounts payable (including related parties) and floating-rate debt:
the carrying amount of accounts payable and floating-rate debt reported on the balance sheet approximates fair value.
●
fixed-rate debt: the estimated fair value of fixed-rate debt is measured using prices available from a
pricing service that is corroborated by market data; therefore, these liabilities are categorized as level 2 in the fair value hierarchy.
●
commercial paper: the carrying amount of our commercial paper instruments approximates fair value and is reported on the balance sheet as short-term debt

note 15-non-mineral leases the company primarily leases office buildings and drilling equipment, as well as ocean transport vessels, tugboats, corporate aircraft, and other facilities and equipment.
certain leases include escalation clauses for adjusting rental payments to reflect changes in price indices and other leases include payment provisions that vary based on the nature of usage of the leased asset.
additionally, the company has executed certain leases that provide it with the option to extend or renew the term of the lease, terminate the lease prior to the end of the lease term, or purchase the leased asset as of the end of the lease term.
in other cases, the company has executed lease agreements that require it to guarantee the residual value of certain leased office buildings.
for additional information about guarantees, see note 10
.
there are no significant restrictions imposed on us by the lease agreements with regard to dividends, asset dispositions or borrowing ability.

certain arrangements may contain both lease and non-lease components and we determine if an arrangement is or contains a lease at contract inception.
we adopted the provisions of fasb asu no. 2016-02, "leases" (asc topic 842) and its amendments, beginning january 1, 2019.
this asu superseded the requirements in fasb asc topic 840 "leases"
(asc topic
840).
only the lease components of these contractual arrangements are subject to the provisions of asc topic
842, and any non-lease components are subject to other applicable accounting guidance; however, we have elected to adopt the optional practical expedient not to separate lease components apart from non-lease components for accounting purposes.
this policy election has been adopted for each of the company's leased asset classes existing as of the effective date and subject to the transition provisions of asc topic 842 and will be applied to all new or modified leases executed on or after january 1, 2019.
for contractual arrangements executed in subsequent periods involving a new leased asset class, the company will determine at contract inception whether it will apply the optional practical expedient to the new leased asset class.
leases are evaluated for classification as operating or finance leases at the commencement date of the lease and right-of-use assets and corresponding liabilities are recognized on our consolidated balance sheet based on the present value of future lease payments relating to the use of the underlying asset during the lease term.
future lease payments include variable lease payments that depend upon an index or rate using the index or rate at the commencement date and probable amounts owed under residual value guarantees.
the amount of future lease payments may be increased to include additional payments related to lease extension, termination, and/or purchase options when the company has determined, at or subsequent to lease commencement, generally due to limited asset availability or operating commitments, it is reasonably certain of exercising such options.
we use our incremental borrowing rate as the discount rate in determining the present value of future lease payments, unless the interest rate implicit in the lease arrangement is readily determinable.
lease payments that vary subsequent to the commencement date based on future usage levels, the nature of leased asset activities, or certain other contingencies are not included in the measurement of lease right-of-use assets and corresponding liabilities.
we have elected not to record assets and liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet for lease arrangements with terms of 12 months or less.
we often enter into leasing arrangements acting in the capacity as operator for and/or on behalf of certain oil and gas joint ventures of undivided interests.
if the lease arrangement can be legally enforced only against us as operator and there is no separate arrangement to sublease the underlying leased asset to our coventurers, we recognize at lease commencement a right-of-use asset and corresponding lease liability on our consolidated balance sheet on a gross basis.
while we record lease costs on a gross basis in our consolidated income statement and statement of cash flows, such costs are offset by the reimbursement we receive from our coventurers for their share of the lease cost as the underlying leased asset is utilized in joint venture activities.
as a result, lease cost is presented in our consolidated income statement and statement of cash flows on a proportional basis.
if we are a nonoperating coventurer, we recognize a right-of-use asset and corresponding lease liability only if we were a specified contractual party to the lease arrangement and the arrangement could be legally enforced against us.
in this circumstance, we would recogni ze both the right-of-use asset and corresponding lease liability on our consolidated balance sheet on a proportional basis consistent with our undivided interest ownership in the related joint venture.
the company has historically recorded certain finance leases executed by investee companies accounted for under the proportionate consolidation method of accounting on its consolidated balance sheet on a proportional basis consistent with its ownership interest in the investee company.
in addition, the company has historically recorded finance lease assets and liabilities associated with certain oil and gas joint ventures on a proportional basis pursuant to accounting guidance applicable prior to january 1, 2019.
in accordance with the transition provisions of asc topic 842, and since we have elected to adopt the package of optional transition-related practical expedients, the historical accounting treatment for these leases has been carried forward and is subject to reconsideration upon the modification or other required reassessment of the arrangements prior to lease term expiration.

for both u.s. and international pension plans, the overall expected long-term rate of return is developed from the expected future return of each asset class, weighted by the expected allocation of pension assets to that asset class.
we rely on a variety of independent market forecasts in developing the expected rate of return for each class of assets.
during 2021, the actuarial gains related to the benefit obligations for u.s. and international plans were primarily related to an increase in the discount rates.
during 2020 and 2019, the actuarial losses related to the benefit obligations for u.s. and international plans were primarily related to a decrease in the discount rates.

the components of net periodic benefit cost, other than the service cost component, are included in the "other expenses" line item on our consolidated income statement.
we recognized pension settlement losses of $
102
million in 2021, $
43
million in 2020, and $
62
million in 2019 as lump-sum benefit payments from certain u.s. and international pension plans exceeded the sum of service and interest costs for those plans and led to recognition of settlement losses.
in determining net pension and other postretirement benefit costs, we amortize prior service costs on a straight-
line basis over the average remaining service period of employees expected to receive benefits under the plan.
for net actuarial gains and losses, we amortize
10
percent of the unamortized balance each year.
we have multiple non-pension postretirement benefit plans for health and life insurance.
the health care plans are contributory and subject to various cost sharing features, with participant and company contributions adjusted annually; the life insurance plans are noncontributory.
the measurement of the u.s. pre-65 retiree medical accumulated postretirement benefit obligation assumes a health care cost trend rate of
6.5
percent in 2022 that declines to
5
percent by 2028.
the measurement of the u.s. post-65
retiree medical accumulated postretirement benefit obligation assumes a health care cost trend rate of
4.25
percent in 2022 that increases to
5
percent by
2028.

2021 10-k plan assets we follow a policy of broadly diversifying pension plan assets across asset classes and individual holdings.
as a result, our plan assets have no significant concentrations of credit risk.
asset classes that are considered appropriate include u.s. equities, non-u.s. equities, u.s. fixed income, non-u.s. fixed income, real estate and private equity investments.
plan fiduciaries may consider and add other asset classes to the investment program from time to time.
the target allocations for plan assets are
22
percent equity securities,
74
percent debt securities,
3
percent real estate and
1
percent other.
generally, the plan investments are publicly traded, therefore minimizing liquidity risk in the portfolio.
the following is a description of the valuation methodologies used for the pension plan assets.
there have been no changes in the methodologies used at december 31, 2021 and
2020.
●
fair values of equity securities and government debt securities categorized in level
1 are primarily based on quoted market prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities.
●
fair values of corporate debt securities, agency and mortgage-backed securities and government debt securities categorized in level
2 are estimated using recently executed transactions and quoted market prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets and for identical assets and liabilities in markets that are not active.
if there have been no market transactions in a particular fixed income security, its fair value is calculated by pricing models that benchmark the security against other securities with actual market prices.
when observable quoted market prices are not available, fair value is based on pricing models that use something other than actual market prices (e.g., observable inputs such as benchmark yields, reported trades and issuer spreads for similar securities), and these securities are categorized in level 3 of the fair value hierarchy.
●
fair values of investments in common/collective trusts are determined by the issuer of each fund based on the fair value of the underlying assets.
●
fair values of mutual funds are based on quoted market prices, which represent the net asset value of shares held.
●
time deposits are valued at cost, which approximates fair value.
●
cash is valued at cost, which approximates fair value.
fair values of international cash equivalents categorized in level 2 are valued using observable yield curves, discounting and interest rates.
u.s. cash balances held in the form of short-term fund units that are redeemable at the measurement date are categorized as level 2.
●
fair values of exchange
-traded derivatives classified in level 1 are based on quoted market prices.
for other derivatives classified in level 2, the values are generally calculated from pricing models with market input parameters from third
-party sources.
●
fair values of insurance contracts are valued at the present value of the future benefit payments owed by the insurance company to the plans' participants.
●
fair values of real estate investments are valued using real estate valuation techniques and other methods that include reference to third-party sources and sales comparables where available.
●
a portion of u.s. pension plan assets is held as a participating interest in an insurance annuity contract, which is calculated as the market value of investments held under this contract, less the accumulated benefit obligation covered by the contract.
the participating interest is classified as level 3 in the fair value hierarchy as the fair value is determined via a combination of quoted market prices, recently executed transactions, and an actuarial present value computation for contract obligations.
at december 31, 2021, the participating interest in the annuity contract was valued at $
83
million and consisted of $
206
million in debt securities, less $
123
million for the accumulated benefit obligation covered by the contract.
at december 31, 2020, the participating interest in the annuity contract was valued at $
94
million and consisted of $
233
million in debt securities, less $
139
million for the accumulated benefit obligation covered by the contract.
the participating interest is not available for meeting general pension benefit obligations in the near term.
no future company contributions are required and no new benefits are being accrued under this insurance annuity contract.

share-based compensation plans the 2014 omnibus stock and performance incentive plan of conocophillips (the plan) was approved by shareholders in may 2014, replacing similar prior plans and providing that no new awards shall be granted under the prior plans.
over its
10
-year life, the plan allows the issuance of up to
79
million shares of our common stock for compensation to our employees and directors; however, as of the effective date of the plan, (i) any shares of common stock available for future awards under the prior plans and (ii) any shares of common stock represented by awards granted under the plan or the prior plans that are forfeited, expire or are cancelled without delivery of shares of common stock or which result in the forfeiture of shares of common stock back to the company shall be available for awards under the plan.
of the
79
million shares available for issuance under the plan, no more than
40
million shares of common stock are available for incentive stock options.

conocophillips
2021 10-k stock units and performance share units to employees and non-employee directors who contribute to the company's continued success and profitability.
total share-based compensation expense is measured using the grant date fair value for our equity-classified awards and the settlement date fair value for our liability-classified awards.
we recognize share
-based compensation expense over the shorter of the service period (i.e., the stated period of time required to earn the award); or the period beginning at the start of the service period and ending when an employee first becomes eligible for retirement, but not less than six months, as this is the minimum period of time required for an award to not be subject to forfeiture.
our share-based compensation programs generally provide accelerated vesting (i.e., a waiver of the remaining period of service required to earn an award) for awards held by employees at the time of their retirement.
some of our share-based awards vest ratably (i.e., portions of the award vest at different times)
while some of our awards cliff vest
(i.e., all of the award vests at the same time).
we recognize expense on a straight-line basis over the service period for the entire award, whether the award was granted with ratable or cliff vesting.

stock options
-stock options granted under the provisions of the plan and prior plans permit purchase of our common stock at exercise prices equivalent to the average fair market value of conocophillips common stock on the date the options were granted.
the options have terms of 10 years and generally vest ratably, with one-third of the options awarded vesting and becoming exercisable on each anniversary date following the date of grant.
options awarded to certain employees already eligible for retirement vest within six months of the grant date, but those options do not become exercisable until the end of the normal vesting period.
beginning in 2018, stock option grants were discontinued and replaced with three-year, time-vested restricted stock units which generally will be cash-settled for 2018 and 2019 awards and stock-settled beginning with 2020 awards.

stock unit program-
generally, restricted stock units are granted annually under the provisions of the plan and vest in an aggregate installment on the third anniversary of the grant date.
in addition, restricted stock units granted under the plan for a variable long-term incentive program vest ratably in three equal annual installments beginning on the first anniversary of the grant date.
restricted stock units are also granted ad hoc to attract or retain key personnel, and the terms and conditions under which these restricted stock units vest vary by award.
stock-settled upon vesting, these restricted stock units are settled by issuing one share of conocophillips common stock per unit.
units awarded to retirement eligible employees vest six months from the grant date; however, those units are not issued as common stock until the earlier of separation from the company or the end of the regularly scheduled vesting period.
until issued as stock, most recipients of the restricted stock units receive a cash payment of a dividend equivalent or an accrued reinvested dividend equivalent that is charged to retained earnings.
the grant date fair market value of these restricted stock units is deemed equal to the average conocophillips stock price on the grant date.
the grant date fair market value of units that do not receive a dividend equivalent while unvested is deemed equal to the average conocophillips stock price on the grant date, less the net present value of the dividends that will not be received.

performance share program
-under the plan, we also annually grant restricted performance share units (psus) to senior management.
these psus are authorized three years prior to their effective grant date (the performance period).
compensation expense is initially measured using the average fair market value of conocophillips common stock and is subsequently adjusted, based on changes in the conocophillips stock price through the end of each subsequent reporting period, through the grant date for stock
-settled awards and the settlement date for cash-settled awards.
stock-settled for performance periods beginning before
2009, psus do not vest until the employee becomes eligible for retirement by reaching age 55
with five years of service, and restrictions do not lapse until the employee separates from the company.
with respect to awards for performance periods beginning in 2009 through 2012, psus do not vest until the earlier of the date the employee becomes eligible for retirement by reaching age 55 with five years of service or five years after the grant date of the award, and restrictions do not lapse until the earlier of the employee's separation from the company or five years after the grant date (although recipients can elect to defer the lapsing of restrictions until separation).
we recognize compensation expense for these awards beginning on the grant date and ending on the date the psus are scheduled to vest.
since these awards are authorized three years prior to the effective grant date, for employees eligible for retirement by or shortly after the grant date, we recognize compensation expense over the period beginning on the date of authorization and ending on the date of grant.
until issued as stock, recipients of the psus receive a quarterly cash payment of a dividend equivalent that is charged to retained earnings.
beginning in 2013, psus authorized for future grants will vest, absent employee election to defer, upon settlement following the conclusion of the three-year performance period.
we recognize compensation expense over the period beginning on the date of authorization and ending on the conclusion of the performance period.
psus are settled by issuing one share of conocophillips common stock per unit.

for employees eligible for retirement by or shortly after the grant date, we recognize compensation expense over the period beginning on the date of authorization and ending on the date of grant.
otherwise, we recognize compensation expense beginning on the grant date and ending on the date the psus are scheduled to vest.
these psus are settled in cash equal to the fair market value of a share of conocophillips common stock per unit on the settlement date and thus are classified as liabilities on the balance sheet.

*represents changes due to originating deferred tax asset that have no impact to our effective tax rate, acquisitions/dispositions/revisions and the effect of translating foreign financial statements.
valuation allowances have been established to reduce deferred tax assets to an amount that will, more likely than not, be realized.
at december 31, 2021, we have maintained a valuation allowance with respect to substantially all u.s. foreign tax credit carryforwards as well as certain net operating loss carryforwards for various jurisdictions.
during 2021, the valuation allowance movement charged to earnings primarily relates to the fair value measurement of our cve common shares that are not expected to be realized, and the expected realization of certain u.s. tax attributes associated with our planned disposition of our indonesia assets.
this is partially offset by australian tax benefits associated with our impairment of aplng that we do not expect to be realized.
other movements are primarily related to valuation allowances on expiring tax attributes.
based on our historical taxable income, expectations for the future, and available tax-planning strategies, management expects deferred tax assets, net of valuation allowances, will primarily be realized as offsets to reversing deferred tax liabilities.
for more information on our pending indonesia disposition see note 3
.
during 2020, the valuation allowance movement charged to earnings primarily related to capital losses in australia and to the fair value measurement of our cve common shares that are not expected to be realized.
other movements are primarily related to valuation allowances on expiring tax attributes.
on december 2, 2019, the internal revenue service finalized foreign tax credit regulations related to the 2017 tax cuts and jobs act.
due to the finalization of these regulations, in the fourth quarter of 2019 we recognized
$
151
million of net deferred tax assets.
correspondingly, we recorded $
6,642
million of existing foreign tax credit carryovers where recognition was previously considered to be remote.
present legislation still makes their realization unlikely and therefore these credits have been offset with a full valuation allowance.
at december 31, 2021, unremitted income considered to be permanently reinvested in certain foreign subsidiaries and foreign corporate joint ventures totaled approximately $
4,384
million.
deferred income taxes have not been provided on this amount, as we do not plan to initiate any action that would require the payment of income taxes.
the estimated amount of additional tax, primarily local withholding tax, that would be payable on this income if distributed is approximately
$
219
million.

47
million, $
46
million and $
42
million, respectively, net of accrued income taxes.
interest and penalties resulted in a reduction to earnings of $
1
million in 2021, a reduction of $
4
million in 2020, and benefit to earnings of $
3
million in 2019.
we file tax returns in the u.s. federal jurisdiction and in many foreign and state jurisdictions.
audits in major jurisdictions are generally complete as follows: canada (2016), u.s. (2017)
and norway (2020).
issues in dispute for audited years and audits for subsequent years are ongoing and in various stages of completion in the many jurisdictions in which we operate around the world.
consequently, the balance in unrecognized tax benefits can be expected to fluctuate from period to period.
within the next twelve months, we may have audit periods close that could significantly impact our total unrecognized tax benefits.
it is reasonably possible such changes could be significant when compared with our total unrecognized tax benefits, but the amount of change is not estimable.
in january 2022, the irs closed the 2017 audit of our u.s. federal income tax return.
as a result, in the first quarter of 2022, we will recognize a previously unrecognized $
475
million federal tax benefit related to the recovery of outside tax basis previously offset by a full reserve.

our effective tax rate for 2021 was driven by our jurisdictional tax rates for this profit mix with net favorable impacts from routine tax credits and valuation allowance adjustments.
the valuation allowance adjustment is primarily related to the fair value measurement and disposition of our cve common shares of $
218
million and the ability to utilize the u.s. foreign tax credit and capital loss carryforward due to our anticipated disposition of our indonesia entities of $
29
million. this was partially offset by an increase to our valuation allowance related to the tax impact of the impairment of our aplng investment of $
206
million for which we do not expect to receive a tax benefit.
our effective tax rate for 2020 was impacted by the disposition of our australia-west assets as well as the valuation allowance related to the fair value measurement of our cve common shares.
the australia-west disposition generated a before-tax gain of $
587
million with an associated tax benefit of $
10
million and resulted in the de-recognition of deferred tax assets resulting in $
92
million of tax expense.
the disposition also generated an australia capital loss tax benefit of $
313
million which has been fully offset by a valuation allowance.
due to changes in the fair market value of cve common shares, the valuation allowance was increased by $
178
million to offset the expected capital loss.
our effective tax rate for 2019 was favorably impacted by the sale of two of our u.k. subsidiaries. the disposition generated a before-tax gain of more than $
1.7
billion with an associated tax benefit of $
335
million. the disposition generated a u.s.
capital loss of approximately
$
2.1
billion which has generated a u.s.
tax benefit of approximately $
285
million. the remaining u.s. capital loss has been recorded as a deferred tax asset fully offset with a valuation allowance.
see note 3.
during 2019, we received final partner approval in malaysia block g to claim certain deepwater tax credits.
as a result, we recorded an income tax benefit of $
164
million.

practical expedients typically, our commodity sales contracts are less than 12 months in duration; however, in certain specific cases may extend longer, which may be out to the end of field life.
we have long-term commodity sales contracts which use prevailing market prices at the time of delivery, and under these contracts, the market-based variable consideration for each performance obligation (i.e., delivery of commodity) is allocated to each wholly unsatisfied performance obligation within the contract.
accordingly, we have applied the practical expedient allowed in asc topic 606 and do not disclose the aggregate amount of the transaction price allocated to performance obligations or when we expect to recognize revenues that are unsatisfied (or partially unsatisfied) as of the end of the reporting period.
receivables and contract liabilities receivables from contracts with customers at december 31, 2021, the "accounts and notes receivable" line on our consolidated balance sheet included trade receivables of $
5,268
million compared with $
1,827
million at december 31, 2020, and included both contracts with customers within the scope of asc topic
606 and those that are outside the scope of asc topic
606.
we typically receive payment within 30 days or less (depending on the terms of the invoice) once delivery is made.
revenues that are outside the scope of asc topic 606 relate primarily to physical gas sales contracts at market prices for which we do not elect npns and are therefore accounted for as a derivative under asc topic
815.
there is little distinction in the nature of the customer or credit quality of trade receivables associated with gas sold under contracts for which npns has not been elected compared with trade receivables where npns has been elected.
contract liabilities from contracts with customers we have entered into contractual arrangements where we license proprietary technology to customers related to the optimization process for operating lng plants. the agreements typically provide for negotiated payments to be made at stated milestones. the payments are not directly related to our performance under the contract and are recorded as deferred revenue to be recognized as revenue when the customer can utilize and benefit from their right to use the license. payments are received in installments over the construction period.

2021 10-k note 23-segment disclosures and related information we explore for, produce, transport and market crude oil, bitumen, natural gas, lng and ngls on a worldwide basis.
we manage our operations through six operating segments, which are primarily defined by geographic region: alaska; lower 48; canada; europe, middle east and north africa; asia pacific; and other international.
corporate and other represents income and costs not directly associated with an operating segment, such as most interest expense, premiums on early retirement of debt, corporate overhead and certain technology activities, including licensing revenues.
corporate assets include all cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments.
we evaluate performance and allocate resources based on net income (loss) attributable to conocophillips.
segment accounting policies are the same as those in note 1
.
intersegment sales are at prices that approximate market.
in 2021, we completed our acquisition of concho, an independent oil and gas exploration and production company with operations across new mexico and west texas as well as our acquisition of shell's permian assets in the texas delaware basin.
the accounting close date of the shell transaction ,
used for reporting purposes, was december
31, 2021.
results of operations for concho and assets acquired from shell are included in our lower 48 segment.
certain transaction and restructuring costs associated with these acquisitions are included in our corporate and other segment.

2021 10-k oil and gas operations
(unaudited)
in accordance with fasb asc topic
932, "extractive activities-oil and gas,"
and regulations of the sec, we are making certain supplemental disclosures about our oil and gas exploration and production operations.
these disclosures include information about our consolidated oil and gas activities and our proportionate share of our equity affiliates' oil and gas activities in our operating segments.
as a result, amounts reported as equity affiliates in oil and gas operations may differ from those shown in the individual segment disclosures reported elsewhere in this report.
our disclosures by geographic area include the u.s., canada, europe, asia pacific/middle east (inclusive of equity affiliates)
, and africa.
as required by current authoritative guidelines, the estimated future date when an asset will be permanently shut down for economic reasons is based on historical 12-month first-of-month average prices and current costs.
this estimated date when production will end affects the amount of estimated reserves.
therefore, as prices and cost levels change from year to year, the estimate of proved reserves also changes.
generally, our proved reserves decrease as prices decline and increase as prices rise.
our proved reserves include estimated quantities related to pscs, which are reported under the "economic interest" method, as well as variable-royalty regimes, and are subject to fluctuations in commodity prices, recoverable operating expenses and capital costs.
if costs remain stable, reserve quantities attributable to recovery of costs will change inversely to changes in commodity prices.
for example, if prices increase, then our applicable reserve quantities would decline.
at december 31, 2021, approximately
4 percent of our total proved reserves were under pscs, located in our asia pacific/middle east geographic reporting area, and 5 percent of our total proved reserves were under a variable-royalty regime, located in our canada geographic reporting area.
reserves governance the recording and reporting of proved reserves are governed by criteria established by regulations of the sec and fasb.
proved reserves are those quantities of oil and gas, which, by analysis of geoscience and engineering data, can be estimated with reasonable certainty to be economically producible-from a given date forward, from known reservoirs, and under existing economic conditions, operating methods, and government regulations-prior to the time at which contracts providing the right to operate expire, unless evidence indicates renewal is reasonably certain, regardless of whether deterministic or probabilistic methods are used for the estimation.
the project to extract the hydrocarbons must have commenced or the operator must be reasonably certain it will commence the project within a reasonable time.
proved reserves are further classified as either developed or undeveloped.
proved developed reserves are proved reserves that can be expected to be recovered through existing wells with existing equipment and operating methods, or in which the cost of the required equipment is relatively minor compared with the cost of a new well, and through installed extraction equipment and infrastructure operational at the time of the reserves estimate if the extraction is by means not involving a well.
proved undeveloped reserves are proved reserves expected to be recovered from new wells on undrilled acreage, or from existing wells where a relatively major expenditure is required for recompletion. reserves on undrilled acreage are limited to those directly offsetting development spacing areas that are reasonably certain of production when drilled, unless evidence provided by reliable technologies exists that establishes reasonable certainty of economic producibility at greater distances.
as defined by sec regulations, reliable technologies may be used in reserve estimation when they have been demonstrated in the field to provide reasonably certain results with consistency and repeatability in the formation being evaluated or in an analogous formation. the technologies and data used in the estimation of our proved reserves include, but are not limited to, performance-based methods, volumetric
-based methods, geologic maps, seismic interpretation, well logs, well test data, core data, analogy and statistical analysis.

we have a company
-wide, comprehensive, sec-compliant internal policy that governs the determination and reporting of proved reserves.
this policy is applied by the geoscientists and reservoir engineers in our business units around the world.
as part of our internal control process, each business unit's reserves processes and controls are reviewed annually by an internal team which is headed by the company's manager of reserves compliance and reporting.
this team, composed of internal reservoir engineers, geoscientists, finance personnel and a senior representative from degolyer and macnaughton (d&m), a third
-party petroleum engineering consulting firm, reviews the business units' reserves for adherence to sec guidelines and company policy through on-site visits, teleconferences and review of documentation.
in addition to providing independent reviews, this internal team also ensures reserves are calculated using consistent and appropriate standards and procedures.
this team is independent of business unit line management and is responsible for reporting its findings to senior management.
the team is responsible for communicating our reserves policy and procedures and is available for internal peer reviews and consultation on major projects or technical issues throughout the year.
all of our proved reserves held by consolidated companies and our share of equity affiliates have been estimated by conocophillips.
during 2021, our processes and controls used to assess over 90 percent of proved reserves as of december 31,
2021, were reviewed by d&m.
the purpose of their review was to assess whether the adequacy and effectiveness of our internal processes and controls used to determine estimates of proved reserves are in accordance with sec regulations.
in such review, conocophillips' technical staff presented d&m with an overview of the reserves data, as well as the methods and assumptions used in estimating reserves.
the data presented included pertinent seismic information, geologic maps, well logs, production tests, material balance calculations, reservoir simulation models, well performance data, operating procedures and relevant economic criteria.
management's intent in retaining d&m to review its processes and controls was to provide objective third-party input on these processes and controls.
d&m's opinion was the general processes and controls employed by conocophillips in estimating its december 31, 2021, proved reserves for the properties reviewed are in accordance with the sec reserves definitions.
d&m's report is included as exhibit 99 of this annual report on form 10-k.
the technical person primarily responsible for overseeing the processes and internal controls used in the preparation of the company's reserves estimates is the manager of reserves compliance and reporting.
this individual holds a master's degree in petroleum engineering.
he is a member of the society of petroleum engineers with over 25 years of oil and gas industry experience and has held positions of increasing responsibility in reservoir engineering, subsurface and asset management in the u.s. and several international field locations.
engineering estimates of the quantities of proved reserves are inherently imprecise.
see the "critical accounting estimates" section of management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations for additional discussion of the sensitivities surrounding these estimates.

notable changes in proved crude oil reserves in the three years ended december 31, 2021, included:
●
revisions
: in 2021, alaska upward revisions were primarily driven by higher prices.
downward revisions in lower 48 were due to development timing for specific well locations from unconventional plays of 203 million barrels and technical revisions of 35 million barrels, partially offset by upward revisions due to higher prices of 115 million barrels and additional infill drilling in the unconventional plays of 71 million barrels.
upward revisions in europe were primarily due to higher prices. in asia pacific/middle east, increases were due to higher prices of 21 million barrels and technical revisions of 16
million barrels.
in 2020, alaska downward revisions were primarily driven by lower prices of 243 million barrels and development plan changes of 54 million barrels.
downward revisions in lower
48 were due to lower prices of 89 million barrels and development timing for specific well locations from unconventional plays of 82 million barrels, partially offset by upward technical revisions and additional infill drilling in the unconventional plays of 45 million barrels.
in 2019, alaska upward revisions were due to cost and technical revisions of 74 million barrels, partially offset by downward price revisions of 34 million barrels.
upward revisions in europe and africa were primarily due to infill drilling and technical revisions.
downward revisions in lower 48 were due to changes in development timing for specific well locations from the unconventional plays of 71 million barrels and price revisions of 22 million barrels, partially offset by upward revisions related to infill drilling and improved well performance of 57 million barrels.

natural gas production in the reserves table may differ from gas production (delivered for sale) in our statistics disclosure, primarily because the quantities above include gas consumed in production operations.
quantities consumed in production operations are not significant in the periods presented.
the value of net production consumed in operations is not reflected in net revenues and production expenses, nor do the volumes impact the respective per unit metrics.
reserve volumes include natural gas to be consumed in operations of 2,748 bcf,
2,286 bcf and 3,141 bcf, as of december 31, 2021,
2020 and 2019, respectively.
these volumes are not included in the calculation of our standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows relating to proved oil and gas reserve quantities.
natural gas reserves are computed at 14.65 pounds per square inch absolute and 60 degrees fahrenheit.
notable changes in proved natural gas reserves in the three years ended december 31, 2021, included:
●
revisions
: in 2021, upward revisions in alaska were due to higher prices of 587 bcf and technical revisions of 128 bcf.
in lower 48, upward revisions of 614 bcf were due to higher prices, additional infill drilling in the unconventional plays of 277
bcf and technical revisions of 60 bcf, partially offset by downward revisions due to development timing for specific well locations from unconventional plays of 498 bcf and conversion of previously acquired permian two-stream contracted volumes to a three-stream (crude oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids) basis of 412 bcf.
upward revisions in canada were due to higher prices of 29 bcf, partially offset by downward revisions due to technical revisions of 14 bcf.
in europe, upward revisions were primarily due to higher prices.
upward revisions in our consolidated operations in asia pacific/middle east were due to technical revisions of 76 bcf, partially offset by price revisions of 16 bcf.
in our equity affiliates in asia pacific/middle east, upward revisions were due to higher prices of 124 bcf and technical and cost revisions of 123 bcf.
in 2020, downward revisions in alaska were primarily due to lower prices.
in lower 48, downward revisions of 372 bcf were due to lower prices and 154 bcf were due to development timing for specific well locations from unconventional plays, partially offset by technical revisions of 87 bcf.
downward revisions in our equity affiliates in asia pacific/middle east were supplementary data conocophillips
2021 10-k
158
due to lower prices of 426 bcf, partially offset by performance revisions of 44 bcf.
upward revisions in our consolidated operations in asia pacific/middle east were due to technical revisions of 88 bcf and price revisions of 15 bcf.
in 2019, upward revisions in europe were due to technical and cost revisions.
in asia pacific/middle east upward revisions were primarily due to the indonesia corridor psc term extension.
downward revisions in lower 48 were due to changes in development timing for specific well locations from the unconventional plays of 207 bcf and price revisions of 125 bcf, partially offset by upward revisions related to infill drilling and improved well performance of 219 bcf.
●
purchases
: in 2021, lower 48 purchases were due to the concho and shell permian acquisitions.
in 2020, canada purchases were due to the acquisition of additional montney acreage.
●
extensions and discoveries
: in 2021, extensions and discoveries in lower
48 were due to planned development to add specific well locations from the unconventional plays which more than offset the decreases resulting from development plan timing in the revisions category.
extensions and discoveries in canada were primarily driven by ongoing drilling successes in montney.
in 2020, extensions and discoveries in lower
48 were due to planned development to add specific well locations from the unconventional plays which more than offset the decreases resulting from development plan timing in the revisions category.
extensions and discoveries in canada were primarily driven by ongoing drilling successes in montney.
in 2019, extensions and discoveries in lower
48 were due to planned development to add specific well locations from the unconventional plays which more than offset the decreases in the revisions category.
extensions and discoveries in our equity affiliates were due to ongoing development in aplng.
●
sales
: in 2021, lower 48 sales represent the disposition of noncore assets.
in 2020, asia pacific/middle east sales represent the disposition of the australia
-west assets.
in 2019, europe sales represent the disposition of the u.k. assets.

notable changes in proved bitumen reserves in the three years ended december 31, 2021, included:
●
revisions
: in 2021, downward revisions of 64 million barrels were driven by changes in carbon tax costs and 39 million barrels due to changes in development timing for specific pad locations from the surmont development program, partially offset by upward revisions from price of 53 million barrels.
in 2020, downward revisions in canada were due to changes in development timing for specific pad locations from the surmont development program of 12 million barrels with the remaining revisions primarily related to lower prices.
in 2019, upward revisions in canada were due to technical revisions in surmont of 70 million barrels, partially offset by downward revisions due to changes in development timing for specific pad locations from the surmont development program of 31 million barrels.
●
extensions and discoveries
: in 2020, extensions and discoveries in canada were primarily due to planned development to add specific pad locations from the surmont development program, which more than offset the decrease in the revisions category.
in 2019, extensions and discoveries in canada were due to planned development to add specific pad locations from the surmont development program, which offset the decrease in the revisions category of

downward revisions were driven by changes in development timing of 389 mmboe primarily in north america and negative bitumen revisions in canada due to changes in carbon tax costs of 65 mmboe, partially offset by upward revisions for lower 48 infill drilling of 162 mmboe and higher prices of 125 mmboe.
purchases were driven by lower 48 due to the concho acquisition.
supplementary data
163
conocophillips
2021 10-k extensions and discoveries were largely driven by an addition of 399 mmboe in lower 48 for the continued development of unconventional plays.
the remaining extensions and discoveries were driven by the continued development planned in the other geographic regions.
transfers to proved developed reserves were driven by the ongoing development of our assets. approximately
65 percent of the transfers were from the development of our lower 48 unconventional plays. the remainder of transfers were from development across the other geographic regions.
at december 31, 2021, our puds represented
24 percent of total proved reserves, compared with 29 percent at december 31, 2020.
costs incurred for the year ended december 31, 2021, relating to the development of puds were $3.8 billion.
a portion of our costs incurred each year relates to development projects where the puds will be converted to proved developed reserves in future years.
at the end of 2021, approximately
93 percent of total puds were under development or scheduled for development within five years of initial disclosure, including all of our lower
48 puds. the remaining puds are in major development areas which are currently producing and within our canada and asia pacific/middle east geographic areas.
results of operations the company's results of operations from oil and gas activities for the years 2021, 2020 and 2019 are shown in the following tables.
non-oil and gas activities, such as pipeline and marine operations, lng operations, crude oil and gas marketing activities, and the profit element of transportation operations in which we have an ownership interest are excluded.
additional information about selected line items within the results of operations tables is shown below:
●
sales include sales to unaffiliated entities attributable primarily to the company's net working interests and royalty interests.
sales are net of fees to transport our produced hydrocarbons beyond the production function to a final delivery point using transportation operations which are not consolidated.
●
transportation costs reflect fees to transport our produced hydrocarbons beyond the production function to a final delivery point using transportatio n
operations which are consolidated.
●
other revenues include gains and losses from asset sales, certain amounts resulting from the purchase and sale of hydrocarbons, and other miscellaneous income.
●
production costs include costs incurred to operate and maintain wells, related equipment and facilities used in the production of petroleum liquids and natural gas.
●
taxes other than income taxes include production, property and other non-income taxes.
●
depreciation of support equipment is reclassified as applicable.
●
other related expenses include inventory fluctuations, foreign currency transaction gains and losses and other miscellaneous expenses.

*average sales prices for alaska crude oil and asia pacific natural gas above reflect a reduction for transportation costs in which we have an ownership interest that are incurred subsequent to the terminal point of the production function.
accordingly, the average sales prices differ from those discussed in item 7 of management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations.
**average sales prices include unutilized transportation costs.

development and exploration activities the following two tables summarize our net interest in productive and dry exploratory and development wells in the years ended december 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019.
a "development well"
is a well drilled within the proved area of a reservoir to the depth of a stratigraphic horizon known to be productive.
an "exploratory well" is a well drilled to find and produce crude oil or natural gas in an unknown field or a new reservoir within a proven field.
exploratory wells also include wells drilled in areas near or offsetting current production, or in areas where well density or production history have not achieved statistical certainty of results.
excluded from the exploratory well count are stratigraphic
-type exploratory wells, primarily relating to oil sands delineation wells located in canada and cbm test wells located in asia pacific/middle east.

standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows relatin g
to proved oil and gas reserve quantities in accordance with sec and fasb requirements, amounts were computed using 12-month average prices (adjusted only for existing contractual terms) and end-of-year costs, appropriate statutory tax rates and a prescri bed 10 percent discount factor.
twelve-
month average prices are calculated as the unweighted arithmetic average of the first-day-of-the-month price for each month within the 12-month period prior to the end of the reporting period.
for all years, continuation of year
-end economic conditions was assumed.
the calculations were based on estimates of proved reserves, which are revised over time as new data becomes available.
probable or possible reserves, which may become proved in the future, were not considered.
the calculations also require assumptions as to the timing of future production of proved reserves and the timing and amount of future development costs, including dismantlement, and future production costs, including taxes other than income taxes.
while due care was taken in its preparation, we do not represent that this data is the fair value of our oil and gas properties, or a fair estimate of the present value of cash flows to be obtained from their development and production.

*undiscounted future net cash flows related to the proved oil and gas reserves disclosed for canada for the year ending december 31, 2020, are negative due to the inclusion of asset retirement costs and certain indirect costs in the calculation of the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows. these costs are not required to be included in the economic limit test for proved developed reserves as defined in regulation s-x rule 4-10.
future net cash flows for canada were also impacted by lower 12-month average pricing for bitumen and crude oil in 2020.
commodity prices have since improved in the current environment.

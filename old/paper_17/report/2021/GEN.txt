item 1a. risk factors covid-19 risks the covid-19 pandemic has affected how we are operating our business, and the duration and extent to which this will impact our future results of operations and overall financial performance remains uncertain.
the covid-19 pandemic is having widespread, rapidly evolving, and unpredictable impacts on global society, economies, financial markets, and business practices. to protect the health and well-being of our employees, partners and third-party service providers, we have implemented a near company-wide work-from-home requirement for most employees until further notice, made substantial modifications to employee travel policies, and cancelled or shifted our conferences and other marketing events to virtual-only for the foreseeable future. we continue to monitor the situation and will adjust our current policies as recommendations and public health guidance changes. to date, we have not seen any meaningful negative impact on our customer success efforts, sales and marketing efforts, or employee productivity. nevertheless, as employees, partners or third-party services providers return to work during the covid-19 pandemic, the risk of inadvertent transmission of covid-19 through human contact could still occur and result in litigation.
the u.s. and global economies have experienced a recession due to the economic impacts of the covid-19 pandemic. although we did not experience a material increase in cancellations by customers or a material reduction in our retention rate in 2021, we may experience such an increase or reduction in the future, especially in the event of a prolonged recession as a result of the covid-19 pandemic. a prolonged recession could adversely affect demand for our offerings, retention rates and harm our business and results of operations, particularly in light of the fact that our solutions are discretionary purchases and thus may be more susceptible to macroeconomic pressures, as well impact the value of our common stock, ability to refinance our debt, and our access to capital.
the duration and extent of the impact from the covid-19 pandemic depends on future developments that cannot be accurately forecasted at this time, such as the severity and transmission rate of new variants of the disease, the extent, effectiveness and acceptance of containment actions, such as vaccination programs, and the impact of these and other factors on our employees, customers, partners and third-party service providers. if we are not able to respond to and manage the impact of such events effectively and if the macroeconomic conditions of the general economy or the industries in which we operate do not improve, or deteriorate further, our business, operating results, financial condition and cash flows could be adversely affected.
risks related to our business strategy and industry if we are unable to develop new and enhanced solutions, or if we are unable to continually improve the performance, features, and reliability of our existing solutions, our business and operating results could be adversely affected.
our future success depends on our ability to effectively respond to evolving threats to consumers, as well as competitive technological developments and industry changes, by developing or introducing new and enhanced solutions on a timely basis. we have in the past incurred, and will continue to incur, significant research and development expenses as we focus on organic growth through internal innovation. we believe that we also must continue to dedicate a significant amount of resources to our research and development efforts to decrease our reliance on third parties. if we do not achieve the benefits anticipated from these investments, or if the achievement of these benefits is delayed, our operating results may be adversely affected. additionally, we must continually address the challenges of dynamic and accelerating market trends and competitive developments. customers may require features and capabilities that our current solutions do not have. our failure to develop table of contents new solutions and improve our existing solutions to satisfy customer preferences and effectively compete with other market offerings in a timely and cost-effective manner may harm our ability to retain our customers and attract new customers. a loss of customers would adversely impact our business and operating results.
the development and introduction of new solutions involve a significant commitment of time and resources and are subject to a number of risks and challenges including but not limited to:
•lengthy development cycles;
•evolving industry and regulatory standards and technological developments by our competitors and customers;
•rapidly changing customer preferences;
•evolving platforms, operating systems, and hardware products, such as mobile devices;
•product and service interoperability challenges with customer's technology and third-party vendors;
•entering into new or unproven markets; and
•executing new product and service strategies.
in addition, third parties, including operating systems and internet browser companies, may take steps to limit the interoperability of our solutions with their own products and services, in some cases to promote their own offerings. this could delay the development of our solutions or our solutions may be unable to operate effectively. this could also result in decreased demand for our solutions, decreased revenue, and harm to our reputation, and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.
if we are not successful in managing these risks and challenges, or if our new or improved solutions are not technologically competitive or do not achieve market acceptance, our business and operating results could be adversely affected.
we operate in a highly competitive environment, and our competitors may gain market share in the markets for our solutions.
we operate in intensely competitive markets that experience frequent technological developments, changes in industry and regulatory standards, changes in customer requirements and preferences, and frequent new product introductions and improvements. if we are unable to anticipate or react to these continually evolving conditions, we could lose market share and experience a decline in our revenues. to compete successfully, we must maintain an innovative research and development effort to develop new solutions and enhance our existing solutions, effectively adapt to changes in the technology or product rights held by our competitors as well as the ways our information is accessed, used and stored by our customers, and appropriately respond to competitive strategies.
our competitors include software vendors and operating system providers that offer solutions that directly compete with our offerings. we face growing competition from other technology companies, as well as from companies in the identity threat protection space such as credit bureaus. many of our competitors are increasingly developing and incorporating into their products data protection software and other competing products, often free of charge, that compete at some level with our offerings. our competitive position could be adversely affected to the extent that our customers perceive the functionality incorporated into these products as replacing the need for our solutions. we face additional risks that these products could limit the operability of our solutions for our customers. some of our competitors have greater financial, technical, marketing, or other resources than we do and consequently, may have the ability to influence customers to purchase their products instead of ours, including through investing more in internal innovation than we can. further consolidation within our industry or other changes in the competitive environment, such as greater vertical integration from key computing and operating system suppliers could result in larger competitors that compete more directly with us. we also face competition from many smaller companies that specialize in particular segments of the market in which we compete.
in addition to competing with these vendors directly for sales to end-users of our solutions, we compete with them for the opportunity to have our solutions bundled with the offerings of our strategic partners, such as computer hardware original equipment manufacturers (oems) and internet service providers (isps) and operating systems. our competitors could gain market share from us if any of these strategic partners replace our solutions with those of our competitors or if these partners more actively promote our competitors' solutions than our own. in addition, software vendors who have bundled our solutions with theirs may choose to bundle their solutions with their own or other vendors' solutions or may limit our access to standard interfaces and inhibit our ability to develop solutions for their platform. in the future, further product development by these vendors could cause our solutions to become redundant, which could significantly impact our sales and operating results.
we may need to change our pricing models to compete successfully.
the intense competition we face, in addition to general and economic business conditions, can put pressure on us to change our prices. if our competitors offer deep discounts on certain solutions or provide offerings, or offer free introductory products (freemium products) that compete with ours, we may need to lower prices or offer similar freemium products in order to compete successfully. similarly, if external factors require us to raise our prices, our ability to acquire new customers and retain existing customers may be diminished. any such changes may reduce revenue and margins and could adversely affect our financial results.
additionally, our business may be affected by changes in the macroeconomic environment. our solutions are discretionary purchases, and customers may reduce or eliminate their discretionary spending on our solutions during a difficult table of contents macroeconomic environment. although we did not experience a material increase in cancellations by customers or a material reduction in our retention rate in fiscal 2021, we may experience such an increase or reduction in the future, especially in the event of a prolonged recession or a worsening of current conditions as a result of the covid-19 pandemic. in addition, during a recession, consumers may experience a decline in their credit or disposable income, which may result in less demand for our solutions. as a result, we may have to lower our prices or make other changes to our pricing model to address these dynamics, any of which could adversely affect our business and financial results.
in addition, in january 2021, we acquired germany-based avira. many of avira's users are freemium subscribers, meaning they do not pay for its basic services. much of our anticipated growth in connection with the avira acquisition is attributable to converting avira's freemium users to a paid subscription option. numerous factors, however, may impede our ability to retain and convert these users into paying customers.
if we fail to manage our sales and distribution channels effectively, or if our partners choose not to market and sell our solutions to their customers, our operating results could be adversely affected.
a portion of our revenues is derived from sales through indirect channels, including, but not limited to, distributors that sell our products to end-users and other resellers, and oem partners that incorporate our products into, or bundle our products with, their products. these channels involve a number of risks, including:
•our resellers, distributors and oems are generally not subject to minimum sales requirements or any obligation to market our solutions to their customers;
•our reseller and distributor agreements are generally nonexclusive and may be terminated at any time without cause and our oem partners may terminate or renegotiate their arrangements with us and new terms may be less favorable due to competitive conditions in our markets and other factors;
•our resellers, distributors and oems may encounter issues or have violations of applicable law or regulatory requirements or otherwise cause damage to our reputation through their actions;
•our resellers and distributors frequently market and distribute competing solutions and may, from time to time, place greater emphasis on the sale of these competing solutions due to pricing, promotions, and other terms offered by our competitors;
•any consolidation of electronics retailers can increase their negotiating power with respect to software providers such as us and any decline in the number of physical retailers could decrease the channels of distribution for us;
•the continued consolidation of online sales through a small number of larger channels has been increasing, which could reduce the channels available for online distribution of our solutions; and
•sales through our partners are subject to changes in general economic conditions, strategic direction, competitive risks, and other issues that could result in a reduction of sales, or cause our partners to suffer financial difficulty which could delay payments to us, affecting our operating results.
if we fail to manage our sales and distribution channels successfully, these channels may conflict with one another or otherwise fail to perform as we anticipate, which could reduce our sales and increase our expenses as well as weaken our competitive position.
our revenue and operating results depend significantly on our ability to retain our existing customers, convert existing non-paying customers to paying customers, and add new customers.
we generally sell our solutions to our customers on a monthly or annual subscription basis. customers may choose not to renew their membership with us at any time. renewing customers may require additional incentives to renew, may not renew for the same contract period, or may change their subscriptions. we therefore may be unable to retain our existing customers on the same or on more profitable terms, if at all. in addition, we may not be able to accurately predict or anticipate future trends in customer retention or effectively respond to such trends.
our customer retention rates may decline or fluctuate due to a variety of factors, including the following:
•our customers' levels of satisfaction or dissatisfaction with our solutions and the value they place on our solutions;
•the quality, breadth, and prices of our solutions;
•our general reputation and events impacting that reputation;
•the services and related pricing offered by our competitors;
•disruption by new services or changes in law or regulations that impact the need for efficacy or of our products and services;
•changes in autorenewal regulations;
•our customer service and responsiveness to the needs of our customers; and
•changes in our target customers' spending levels as a result of general economic conditions or other factors.
declining customer retention rates could cause our revenue to may grow more slowly than expected or decline; and our operating results, gross margins and business will be harmed.
our acquisitions and divestitures create special risks and challenges that could adversely affect our financial results.
table of contents as part of our business strategy, we may acquire or divest businesses or assets. for example, in 2019, we completed the sale of certain of our enterprise security assets to broadcom inc. (the "broadcom sale") and in january 2021, we completed the acquisition of avira. these activities can involve a number of risks and challenges, including:
•complexity, time, and costs associated with managing these transactions, including the integration of acquired and the winding down of divested business operations, workforce, products, it systems, and technologies;
•challenges in retaining customers of acquired businesses, or providing the same level of service to existing customers with reduced resources;
•diversion of management time and attention;
•loss or termination of employees, including costs associated with the termination or replacement of those employees;
•assumption of liabilities of the acquired and divested business or assets, including pending or future litigation, investigations or claims related to the acquired business or assets;
•the addition of acquisition-related debt;
•difficulty in entering into or expanding in new markets or geographies;
•increased or unexpected costs and working capital requirements;
•dilution of stock ownership of existing stockholders;
•unanticipated delays or failure to meet contractual obligations;
•substantial accounting charges for acquisition-related costs, asset impairments, amortization of intangible assets, and higher levels of stock-based compensation expense; and
•difficulty in realizing potential benefits, including cost savings and operational efficiencies, synergies and growth prospects from integrating acquired businesses.
moreover, to be successful, large complex acquisitions depend on large-scale product, technology, and sales force integrations that are difficult to complete on a timely basis or at all and may be more susceptible to the special risks and challenges described above. any of the foregoing, and other factors, could harm our ability to achieve anticipated levels of profitability or other financial benefits from our acquired or divested businesses, product lines or assets or to realize other anticipated benefits of divestitures or acquisitions.
changes in industry structure and market conditions could lead to charges related to discontinuance of certain of our products or businesses and asset impairments.
in response to changes in industry structure and market conditions, we may be required to strategically reallocate our resources and consider restructuring, disposing of, or otherwise exiting certain businesses. any decision to limit investment in or dispose of or otherwise exit businesses may result in the recording of special charges, such as technology-related write-offs, workforce reduction costs, charges relating to consolidation of excess facilities, or claims from third parties who were resellers or users of discontinued products. our estimates with respect to the useful life or ultimate recoverability of our carrying basis of assets, including purchased intangible assets, could change as a result of such assessments and decisions. although in certain instances our vendor agreements allow us the option to cancel, reschedule, and adjust our requirements based on our business needs, our loss contingencies may include liabilities for contracts that we cannot cancel, reschedule or adjust with suppliers.
further, our estimates relating to the liabilities for excess facilities are affected by changes in real estate market conditions. additionally, we are required to evaluate goodwill impairment on an annual basis and between annual evaluations in certain circumstances, and future goodwill impairment evaluations may result in a charge to earnings.
risks related to our operations we are dependent upon broadcom for certain engineering and threat response services, which are critical to our products and business.
our endpoint security solution has historically relied upon certain threat analytics software engines and other software (the engine-related services) that have been developed and provided by engineering teams that have transferred to broadcom as part of the broadcom sale. the technology, including source code, at issue is shared, and pursuant to the terms of the broadcom sale, we retain rights to use, modify, enhance and create derivative works from such technology. broadcom has committed to provide these engine-related services substantially to the same extent and in substantially the same manner, as has been historically provided under a license agreement with a limited term.
as a result, we are dependent on broadcom for services and technology that are critical to our norton business, and if broadcom fails to deliver these engine-related services it would result in significant business disruption, and our business and operating results and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected. furthermore, if our current sources become unavailable, and if we are unable to develop or obtain alternatives to integrate or deploy them in time, our ability to compete effectively could be impacted and have a material adverse effect on our business. additionally, in connection with the broadcom sale, we lost other capabilities, including certain threat intelligence data which were historically provided by our former enterprise security business, the lack of which could have a negative impact on our business and products.
our future success depends on our ability to attract and retain personnel in a competitive marketplace.
table of contents our future success depends upon our ability to recruit and retain key management, technical (including cyber security experts), sales, marketing, e-commerce, finance, and other personnel. our officers and other key personnel are "at will" employees and we generally do not have employment or non-compete agreements with our employees. competition for people with the specific skills that we require is significant. while we continue to monitor the competitive environment, it is possible that the covid-19 pandemic may affect the productivity of our employees and our ability to attract and retain key talent. as a result of the pandemic, in march 2020, we transitioned to a remote working environment for the substantial majority of our employees. while our employees have transitioned effectively to working from home, over time such remote operations may decrease the cohesiveness of our employees and our ability to maintain our culture, both of which are integral to our success. additionally, a remote working environment may impede our ability to undertake new business projects, to foster a creative environment, to hire new employees and to retain existing employees.
in order to attract and retain personnel in a competitive marketplace, we must provide competitive pay packages, including cash and equity-based compensation. additionally, changes in immigration laws could impair our ability to attract and retain highly qualified employees. if we fail to attract, retain and motivate new or existing personnel, our business, results of operations and future growth prospects could suffer. the volatility in our stock price may from time to time adversely affect our ability to recruit or retain employees. in addition, we may not have an adequate number of shares reserved under our equity compensation plans, forcing us to reduce awards of equity-based compensation, which could impair our efforts to attract, retain and motivate necessary personnel. if we are unable to hire and retain qualified employees, or conversely, if we fail to manage employee performance or reduce staffing levels when required by market conditions, our business and operating results could be adversely affected.
effective succession planning is also important to our long-term success. failure to ensure effective transfer of knowledge and smooth transitions involving key employees could hinder our strategic planning and execution. from time to time, key personnel leave our company and the frequency and number of such departures have widely varied and have, in the past, resulted in significant changes to our executive leadership team. the loss of any key employee could result in significant disruptions to our operations, including adversely affecting the timeliness of product releases, the successful implementation and completion of company initiatives, our internal control over financial reporting, and our results of operations. in addition, hiring, training, and successfully integrating replacement personnel can be time consuming and expensive, may cause additional disruptions to our operations, and may be unsuccessful, which could negatively impact future financial results.
our inability to successfully recover from a disaster or other business continuity event could impair our ability to deliver our products and services and harm our business.
we are heavily reliant on our technology and infrastructure to provide our products and services to our customers. for example, we host many of our products using third-party data center facilities, and while we require them to maintain formal service level agreements around availability, we do not control the operation of these facilities. these facilities are vulnerable to damage, interruption, or performance problems from earthquakes, hurricanes, floods, fires, power loss, telecommunications failures, pandemics and similar events. they are also subject to break-ins, computer viruses, sabotage, intentional acts of vandalism, and other misconduct. the occurrence of a natural disaster, an act of terrorism, a pandemic, and similar events could result in a decision to close the facilities without adequate notice or other unanticipated problems, which in turn, could result in lengthy interruptions in the delivery of our products and services, which could negatively impact our sales and operating results.
furthermore, our business administration, human resources, compliance efforts, and finance services depend on the proper functioning of our computer, telecommunication, and other related systems and operations. a disruption or failure of these systems or operations because of a disaster, cyber-attack or other business continuity event, such as the covid-19 pandemic, could cause data to be lost or otherwise delay our ability to complete sales and provide the highest level of service to our customers. in addition, we could have difficulty producing accurate financial statements on a timely basis, and deficiencies may arise in our internal control over financial reporting, which may impact our ability to certify our financial results, all of which could adversely affect the trading value of our stock. although we endeavor to ensure there is redundancy in these systems and that they are regularly backed-up, there are no assurances that data recovery in the event of a disaster would be effective or occur in an efficient manner.  if these systems or their functionality do not operate as we expect them to, we may be required to expend significant resources to make corrections or find alternative sources for performing these functions.
if we fail to offer high-quality customer support, our customer satisfaction may suffer and have a negative impact our business and reputation.
many of our customers rely on our customer support services to resolve issues, including technical support, billing and subscription issues, that may arise. if demand increases, or our resources decrease, we may be unable to offer the level of support our customers expect. any failure by us to maintain the expected level of support could reduce customer satisfaction and negatively impact our customer retention and our business.
our international operations involve risks that could increase our expenses, adversely affect our operating results, and require increased time and attention of our management.
we derive a portion of our revenues from customers located outside of the u.s., and we have significant operations outside of the u.s., including engineering, finance, sales and customer support. our international operations are subject to risks in addition to those faced by our domestic operations, including:
•potential loss of proprietary information due to misappropriation or laws that may be less protective of our intellectual property rights than u.s. laws or that may not be adequately enforced;

•requirements of foreign laws and other governmental controls, including tariffs, trade barriers and labor restrictions, and related laws that reduce the flexibility of our business operations;
•potential changes in trade relations arising from policy initiatives or other political factors;
•regulations or restrictions on the use, import, or export of encryption technologies that could delay or prevent the acceptance and use of encryption products and public networks for secure communications;
•local business and cultural factors that differ from our normal standards and practices, including business practices that we are prohibited from engaging in by the foreign corrupt practices act and other anti-corruption laws and regulations;
•central bank and other restrictions on our ability to repatriate cash from our international subsidiaries or to exchange cash in international subsidiaries into cash available for use in the u.s.;
•fluctuations in currency exchange rates, economic instability, and inflationary conditions could make our solutions more expensive or could increase our costs of doing business in certain countries;
•limitations on future growth or inability to maintain current levels of revenues from international sales if we do not invest sufficiently in our international operations;
•difficulties in staffing, managing, and operating our international operations;
•difficulties in coordinating the activities of our geographically dispersed and culturally diverse operations;
•costs and delays associated with developing software and providing support in multiple languages; and
•political unrest, war, or terrorism, or regional natural disasters, particularly in areas in which we have facilities.
risks related to our solutions our solutions, systems, websites and the data on these sources may be subject to intentional disruption that could materially harm to our reputation and future sales.
despite our precautions and significant ongoing investments to protect against security risks, data protection breaches, cyber-attacks, and other intentional disruptions of our solutions, we expect to be an ongoing target of attacks specifically designed to impede the performance and availability of our offerings and harm our reputation as a leading cyber security company. similarly, experienced computer programmers or other sophisticated individuals or entities, including malicious hackers, state-sponsored organizations, and insider threats including actions by employees and third-party service providers, may attempt to penetrate our network security or the security of our systems and websites and misappropriate proprietary information or cause interruptions of our products and services. such attempts are increasing in number and in technical sophistication, and if successful could expose us and the affected parties, to risk of loss or misuse of proprietary or confidential information or disruptions of our business operations.
while we engage in a number of measures aimed to protect against security breaches and to minimize the impact if a data breach were to occur, our information technology systems and infrastructure may be vulnerable to damage, compromise, disruption, and shutdown due to attacks or breaches by hackers or other circumstances, such as error or malfeasance by employees or third party service providers or technology malfunction. the occurrence of any of these events, as well as a failure to promptly remedy these events should they occur, could compromise our systems, and the information stored in our systems could be accessed, publicly disclosed, lost, stolen, or damaged. any such circumstance could adversely affect our ability to attract and maintain customers as well as strategic partners, cause us to suffer negative publicity or damage to our brand, and subject us to legal claims and liabilities or regulatory penalties. in addition, unauthorized parties might alter information in our databases, which would adversely affect both the reliability of that information and our ability to market and perform our services as well as undermine our ability to remain compliant with relevant laws and regulations. techniques used to obtain unauthorized access or to sabotage systems change frequently, are constantly evolving and generally are difficult to recognize and react to effectively. we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventive or reactive measures. several recent, highly publicized data security breaches, including a large-scale attack on solarwinds customers by a foreign nation state actor and a significant uptick in ransomware/extortion attacks at other companies have heightened consumer awareness of this issue and may embolden individuals or groups to target our systems or those of our strategic partners or enterprise customers.
our solutions are complex and operate in a wide variety of environments, systems and configurations, which could result in failures of our solutions to function as designed.
because we offer very complex solutions, errors, defects, disruptions, or other performance problems with our solutions may and have occurred. for example, we may experience disruptions, outages, and other performance problems due to a variety of factors, including infrastructure changes, human or software errors, capacity constraints due to an overwhelming number of users accessing our websites simultaneously, fraud, or security attacks. in some instances, we may not be able to identify the cause or causes of these performance problems within an acceptable period of time. interruptions in our solutions could impact our revenues or cause customers to cease doing business with us. our operations are dependent upon our ability to protect our technology infrastructure against damage from business continuity events that could have a significant disruptive effect on our operations. we could potentially lose customer data or experience material adverse interruptions to our operations or delivery of solutions to our clients in a disaster recovery scenario.
negative publicity regarding our brand, solutions and business could harm our competitive position.
table of contents our brand recognition and reputation as a trusted service provider are critical aspects of our business and key to retaining existing customers and attracting new customers. our business could be harmed due to errors, defects, disruptions or other performance problems with our solutions causing our customers and potential customers to believe our solutions are unreliable. furthermore, negative publicity, whether or not justified, including intentional brand misappropriation, relating to events or activities attributed to us, our employees, our strategic partners, our affiliates, or others associated with any of these parties, may tarnish our reputation and reduce the value of our brands. in addition, the rapid rise and use of social media has the potential to harm our brand and reputation. we may be unable to timely respond to and resolve negative and inaccurate social media posts regarding our company, solutions and business in an appropriate manner. damage to our reputation and loss of brand equity may reduce demand for our solutions and have an adverse effect on our business, operating results, and financial condition. moreover, any attempts to rebuild our reputation and restore the value of our brands may be costly and time consuming, and such efforts may not ultimately be successful.
we collect, use, disclose, store, or otherwise process personal information, which subjects us to privacy and data security laws and contractual commitments.
we collect, use, process, store, transmit or disclose (collectively, process) an increasingly large amount of confidential information, including personally identifiable information, credit card information and other critical data from employees and customers, in connection with the operation of our business, particularly in relation to our identity and information protection offerings.
the personal information we process is subject to an increasing number of federal, state, local, and foreign laws regarding privacy and data security, as well as contractual commitments. any failure or perceived failure by us to comply with such obligations may result in governmental enforcement actions, fines, litigation, or public statements against us by consumer advocacy groups or others and could cause our customers to lose trust in us, which could have an adverse effect on our reputation and business.
additionally, changes to applicable privacy or data security laws could impact how we process personal information and therefore limit the effectiveness of our solutions or our ability to develop new solutions. for example, the european union general data protection regulation imposes more stringent data protection requirements and provides for greater penalties for noncompliance of up to the greater of €20 million or four percent of our worldwide annual revenues.
data protection legislation is also becoming increasingly common in the u.s. at both the federal and state level. for example, the california consumer privacy act of 2018 (the ccpa) requires, among other things, covered companies to provide new disclosures to california consumers regarding the use of personal information, gives california residents expanded rights to access their personal information that has been collected and allows such consumers new abilities to opt-out of certain sales of personal information. further, the new california privacy rights act (the cpra) significantly modifies the ccpa. these modifications may result in additional uncertainty and require us to incur additional costs and expenses in our effort to comply. additionally, the federal trade commission and many state attorneys general are interpreting federal and state consumer protection laws to impose standards for the online collection, use, dissemination, and security of data. the burdens imposed by the ccpa, cpra and other similar laws that may be enacted at the federal and state level may require us to modify our data processing practices and policies, adapt our goods and services and incur substantial expenditures in order to comply.
global privacy and data protection legislation, enforcement, and policy activity are rapidly expanding and evolving, and may be inconsistent from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. we may be or become subject to data localization laws mandating that data collected in a foreign country be processed and stored only within that country. if any country in which we have customers were to adopt a data localization law, we could be required to expand our data storage facilities there or build new ones in order to comply. the expenditure this would require, as well as costs of compliance generally, could harm our financial condition.
additionally, third parties with whom we work, such as vendors or developers, may violate applicable laws or our policies and such violations can place personal information of our customers at risk. in addition, our customers may also accidentally disclose their passwords or store them on a device that is lost or stolen, creating the perception that our systems are not secure against third-party access. this could have an adverse effect on our reputation and business. in addition, such third parties could expose us to compromised data or technology, or be the target of cyberattack and other data breaches which could impact our systems or our customers' records. further, we could be the target of a cyberattack or other action that impacts our systems and results in a data breach of our customers' records. this could have an adverse effect on our reputation and business.
legal and compliance risks matters relating to or arising from our completed audit committee investigation, including regulatory investigations and proceedings, litigation matters, and potential additional expenses, may adversely affect our business and results of operations.
as previously disclosed in our public filings, the audit committee completed its internal investigation in september 2018. in connection with the audit committee investigation, we voluntarily self-reported to the sec. the sec commenced a formal investigation, and we continue to cooperate with that investigation. the outcome of such an investigation is difficult to predict. if the sec commences legal action, we could be required to pay significant penalties and become subject to injunctions, a cease and desist order, and other equitable remedies. we can provide no assurances as to the outcome of any governmental investigation.
we have incurred, and may continue to incur, significant expenses related to legal and other professional services in connection with the ongoing sec investigation, which may continue to adversely affect our business and financial condition. in table of contents addition, securities class actions and other lawsuits have been filed against us, certain current and former directors, and former officers. the outcome of the securities class actions and other litigation and regulatory proceedings or government enforcement actions is difficult to predict, and the cost to defend, settle, or otherwise resolve these matters may be significant. plaintiffs or regulatory agencies or authorities in these matters may seek recovery of very large or indeterminate amounts or seek to impose sanctions, including significant monetary penalties. the monetary and other impact of these litigations, proceedings, or actions may remain unknown for substantial periods of time. further, an unfavorable resolution of litigations, proceedings or actions could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations and cash flows. any future investigations or additional lawsuits may also adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.
our solutions are highly regulated, which could impede our ability to market and provide our solutions or adversely affect our business, financial position, and results of operations.
our solutions are subject to a high degree of regulation, including a wide variety of federal, state, and local laws and regulations, such as the fair credit reporting act, the gramm-leach-bliley act, the federal trade commission act (ftc act), and comparable state laws that are patterned after the ftc act. lifelock has previously entered into consent decrees and similar arrangements with the ftc and the attorney generals of 35 states as well as a settlement with the ftc relating to allegations that certain of lifelock's advertising, marketing and security practices constituted deceptive acts or practices in violation of the ftc act, which impose additional restrictions on our business, including prohibitions against making any misrepresentation of "the means, methods, procedures, effects, effectiveness, coverage, or scope of" our solutions. any of the laws and regulations that apply to our business are subject to revision or new or changed interpretations, and we cannot predict the impact of such changes on our business.
additionally, the nature of our identity and information protection products subjects us to the broad regulatory, supervisory, and enforcement powers of the consumer financial protection bureau which may exercise authority with respect to our services, or the marketing and servicing of those services, through the oversight of our financial institution or credit reporting agency customers and suppliers, or by otherwise exercising its supervisory, regulatory, or enforcement authority over consumer financial products and services.
if we do not protect our proprietary information and prevent third parties from making unauthorized use of our products and technology, our financial results could be harmed.
much of our software and underlying technology is proprietary. we seek to protect our proprietary rights through a combination of confidentiality agreements and procedures and through copyright, patent, trademark, and trade secret laws. however, these measures afford only limited protection and may be challenged, invalidated, or circumvented by third parties. third parties may copy all or portions of our products or otherwise obtain, use, distribute, and sell our proprietary information without authorization.
third parties may also develop similar or superior technology independently by designing around our patents. our consumer agreements do not require a signature and therefore may be unenforceable under the laws of some jurisdictions. furthermore, the laws of some foreign countries do not offer the same level of protection of our proprietary rights as the laws of the u.s., and we may be subject to the unauthorized use of our products in those countries. the unauthorized copying or use of our products or proprietary information could result in reduced sales of our products. any legal action to protect proprietary information that we may bring or be engaged in with a strategic partner or vendor could adversely affect our ability to access software, operating system, and hardware platforms of such partner or vendor, or cause such partner or vendor to choose not to offer our products to their customers. in addition, any legal action to protect proprietary information that we may bring or be engaged in, could be costly, may distract management from day-to-day operations, and may lead to additional claims against us, which could adversely affect our operating results.
from time to time we are a party to lawsuits and investigations, which typically require significant management time and attention and result in significant legal expenses.
we have initiated and been named as a party to lawsuits, including patent litigation, class actions, and governmental claims, and we may be named in additional litigation. the expense of initiating and defending, and in some cases settling, such litigation may be costly and divert management's attention from the day-to-day operations of our business, which could have a materially adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and cash flows. in addition, an unfavorable outcome in such litigation could result in significant fines, settlements, monetary damages, or injunctive relief that could negatively and materially impact our ability to conduct our business, results of operations, and cash flows.
for example, in december 2018 the united kingdom's competition and markets authority (cma) launched an investigation into auto-renewal practices in the antivirus sector and recently announced that nortonlifelock was one of the companies it was investigating. we continue to cooperate with the cma in the course of its investigation and believe our business practices are fair and compliant with u.k. consumer law; however, we have been expending management time and resources on this matter and an unfavorable outcome of this investigation and any resulting litigation could impact our marketing practices to consumers, and potentially damage our reputation and otherwise harm our business and financial results.
third parties claiming that we infringe their proprietary rights could cause us to incur significant legal expenses and prevent us from selling our products.
from time to time, third parties may claim that we have infringed their intellectual property rights, including claims regarding patents, copyrights, and trademarks. because of constant technological change in the segments in which we compete, the table of contents extensive patent coverage of existing technologies, and the rapid rate of issuance of new patents, it is possible that the number of these claims may grow. in addition, former employers of our former, current, or future employees may assert claims that such employees have improperly disclosed to us confidential or proprietary information of these former employers. any such claim, with or without merit, could result in costly litigation and distract management from day-to-day operations. if we are not successful in defending such claims, we could be required to stop selling, delay shipments of, or redesign our solutions, pay monetary amounts as damages, enter into royalty or licensing arrangements, or satisfy indemnification obligations that we have with some of our partners. we cannot assure you that any royalty or licensing arrangements that we may seek in such circumstances will be available to us on commercially reasonable terms or at all. we have made and expect to continue making significant expenditures to investigate, defend, and settle claims related to the use of technology and intellectual property rights as part of our strategy to manage this risk.
in addition, we license and use software from third parties in our business. these third-party software licenses may not continue to be available to us on acceptable terms or at all and may expose us to additional liability. this liability, or our inability to use any of this third-party software, could result in delivery delays or other disruptions in our business that could materially and adversely affect our operating results.
some of our products contain "open source" software, and any failure to comply with the terms of one or more of these open source licenses could negatively affect our business.
certain of our products are distributed with software licensed by its authors or other third parties under so-called "open source" licenses. some of these licenses contain requirements that we make available source code for modifications or derivative works we create based upon the open source software and that we license such modifications or derivative works under the terms of a particular open source license or other license granting third parties certain rights of further use. by the terms of certain open source licenses, we could be required to release the source code of our proprietary software if we combine our proprietary software with open source software in a certain manner. in addition to risks related to license requirements, usage of open source software can lead to greater risks than use of third-party commercial software, as open source licensors generally do not provide warranties or controls on origin of the software. we have established processes to help alleviate these risks, including a review process for screening requests from our development organizations for the use of open source, but we cannot be sure that all open source is submitted for approval prior to use in our products. in addition, many of the risks associated with usage of open source may not or cannot be eliminated and could, if not properly addressed, negatively affect our business.
risks related to our liquidity and indebtedness there are risks associated with our outstanding and future indebtedness that could adversely affect our financial condition.
as of april 2, 2021, we had an aggregate of $3,620 million of outstanding indebtedness that will mature in calendar years 2022 through 2030, and $1,000 million available for borrowing under our revolving credit facility. see note 10 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10-k for further information on our outstanding debt. our ability to meet expenses, remain in compliance with the covenants under our debt instruments, pay interest, and repay principal for our substantial level of indebtedness depends on, among other things, our operating performance, competitive developments, and financial market conditions, all of which are significantly affected by financial, business, economic, and other factors. we are not able to control many of these factors. accordingly, our cash flow may not be sufficient to allow us to pay principal and interest on our debt, including the notes, and meet our other obligations. our level of indebtedness could have other important consequences, including the following:
•we must use a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to pay interest and principal on the term loans and revolving credit facility, our existing senior notes, and other indebtedness, which reduces funds available to us for other purposes such as working capital, capital expenditures, other general corporate purposes, and potential acquisitions;
•we may be unable to refinance our indebtedness or to obtain additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, or general corporate purposes;
•we are exposed to fluctuations in interest rates because borrowings under our senior secured credit facilities bear interest at variable rates;
•our leverage may be greater than that of some of our competitors, which may put us at a competitive disadvantage and reduce our flexibility in responding to current and changing industry and financial market conditions;
•we may be more vulnerable to an economic downturn or recession and adverse developments in our business;
•we may be unable to comply with financial and other covenants in our debt agreements, which could result in an event of default that, if not cured or waived, may result in acceleration of certain of our debt and would have an adverse effect on our business and prospects and could force us into bankruptcy or liquidation;
•changes by any rating agency to our outlook or credit rating could negatively affect the value of our debt and/or our common stock, adversely affect our access to debt markets, and increase the interest we pay on outstanding or future debt; and
•conversion of our convertible note could result in significant dilution of our common stock, which could result in significant dilution to our existing stockholders and cause the market price of our common stock to decline.
table of contents there can be no assurance that we will be able to manage any of these risks successfully. in addition, we conduct a significant portion of our operations through our subsidiaries. accordingly, repayment of our indebtedness will be dependent in part on the generation of cash flow by our subsidiaries and their ability to make such cash available to us by dividend, debt repayment, or otherwise, which may not always be possible. in the event that we do not receive distributions from our subsidiaries, we may be unable to make the required principal and interest payments on our indebtedness.
the elimination of libor after june 2023 may affect our financial results.
on march 5, 2021, the united kingdom financial conduct authority, which regulates libor, announced that all libor tenors relevant to us will cease to be published or will no longer be representative after june 30, 2023. this means that any of our libor-based borrowings that extend beyond june 30, 2023 will need to be converted to a replacement rate. in the u.s., the alternative reference rates committee, or arrc, a committee of private sector entities with ex-officio official sector members convened by the federal reserve board and the federal reserve bank of new york, has recommended the secured overnight financing rate ("sofr") plus a recommended spread adjustment as libor's replacement. there are significant differences between libor and sofr, such as libor being an unsecured lending rate while sofr is a secured lending rate, and sofr is an overnight rate while libor reflects term rates at different maturities. if our libor-based borrowings are converted to sofr, the differences between libor and sofr, plus the recommended spread adjustment, could result in interest costs that are higher than if libor remained available, which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results. although sofr is the arrc's recommended replacement rate, it is also possible that lenders may instead choose alternative replacement rates that may differ from libor in ways similar to sofr or in other ways that would result in higher interest costs for us. it is not yet possible to predict the magnitude of libor's end on our borrowing costs given the remaining uncertainty about which rates will replace libor.
our term loan and revolving credit facility agreement impose operating and financial restrictions on us.
our term loan and revolving credit facility agreement contain covenants that limit our ability and the ability of our restricted subsidiaries to:
•incur additional debt;
•create liens on certain assets to secure debt;
•enter into certain sale and leaseback transactions;
•pay dividends on or make other distributions in respect of our capital stock or make other restricted payments; and
•consolidate, merge, sell or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of our assets.
all of these covenants may adversely affect our ability to finance our operations, meet or otherwise address our capital needs, pursue business opportunities, react to market conditions, or otherwise restrict activities or business plans. a breach of any of these covenants could result in a default in respect of the related indebtedness. if a default occurs, the relevant lenders could elect to declare the indebtedness, together with accrued interest and other fees, to be immediately due and payable and, to the extent such indebtedness is secured in the future, proceed against any collateral securing that indebtedness.
general risks fluctuations in our quarterly financial results have affected the trading price of our outstanding securities in the past and could affect the trading price of our outstanding securities in the future.
our quarterly financial results have fluctuated in the past and are likely to vary in the future due to a number of factors, many of which are outside of our control. if our quarterly financial results or our predictions of future financial results fail to meet our expectations or the expectations of securities analysts and investors, the trading price of our outstanding securities could be negatively affected. volatility in our quarterly financial results may make it more difficult for us to raise capital in the future or pursue acquisitions.
factors associated with our industry, the operation of our business, and the markets for our solutions may cause our quarterly financial results to fluctuate, including but not limited to:
•fluctuations in demand for our solutions;
•disruptions in our business operations or target markets caused by, among other things, terrorism or other intentional acts, outbreaks of disease, such as the covid-19 pandemic, or earthquakes, floods, or other natural disasters;
•entry of new competition into our markets;
•our ability to achieve targeted operating income and margins and revenues;
•competitive pricing pressure or free offerings that compete with one or more of our solutions;
•our ability to timely complete the release of new or enhanced versions of our solutions;
•the amount and timing of commencement and termination of major marketing campaigns;
•the number, severity, and timing of threat outbreaks and cyber security incidents;
•loss of customers or strategic partners;
•changes in the mix or type of solutions and subscriptions sold and changes in consumer retention rates;

•the rate of adoption of new technologies and new releases of operating systems, and new business processes;
•consumer confidence and spending changes;
•the impact of litigation, regulatory inquiries, or investigations;
•the impact of acquisitions and divestitures and our ability to achieve expected synergies or attendant cost savings;
•fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates;
•the publication of unfavorable or inaccurate research reports about our business by cybersecurity industry analysts;
•the success of our corporate responsibility initiatives;
•changes in tax laws, rules, and regulations; and
•changes in consumer protection laws and regulations.
any of the foregoing factors could cause the trading price of our outstanding securities to fluctuate significantly.
changes to our effective tax rate could increase our income tax expense and reduce (increase) our net income (loss), cash flows and working capital.
our effective tax rate could be adversely affected by several factors, many of which are outside of our control, including:
•changes to the u.s. federal income tax laws, including the potential for corporate tax increases under the new biden administration;
•changes to other tax laws, regulations, and interpretations in multiple jurisdictions in which we operate, including actions resulting from the organisation for economic co-operation and development's base erosion and profit shifting project, proposed actions by international bodies such as digital services taxation, as well as the requirements of certain tax rulings;
•changes in the relative proportions of revenues and income before taxes in the various jurisdictions in which we operate that have differing statutory tax rates;
•the tax effects of significant infrequently occurring events that may cause fluctuations between reporting periods;
•tax assessments, or any related tax interest or penalties, that could significantly affect our income tax expense for the period in which the settlements take place; and
•taxes arising in connection to changes in our workforce, corporate entity structure or operations as they relate to tax incentives and tax rates.
from time to time, we receive notices that a tax authority in a particular jurisdiction believes that we owe a greater amount of tax than we have reported to such authority. we are regularly engaged in discussions and sometimes disputes with these tax authorities. if the ultimate determination of our taxes owed in any of these jurisdictions is for an amount in excess of the tax provision we have recorded or reserved for, our operating results, cash flows, and financial condition could be adversely affected.
item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations please read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations together with our consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto included under item 15 of this annual report on form 10-k.
overview nortonlifelock inc. has the largest consumer cyber safety platform in the world, empowering nearly 80 million users in more than 150 countries. we are the trusted and number one top of mind brand in consumer cyber safety, according to the 2020 nortonlifelock brand tracking study. we help prevent, detect, and restore potential damages caused by many cyber criminals.
we have utilized and expect to continue to utilize acquisitions to contribute to our long-term growth objectives. during fiscal year 2021, we completed the acquisition of avira, which provides a consumer-focused portfolio of cybersecurity and privacy solutions primarily in europe and key emerging markets. we believe this acquisition will help accelerate our international growth.
fiscal year highlights
•in may 2020, we settled the $625 million principal and conversion rights of our 2.0% convertible notes for $1,176 million in cash. the repayments resulted in an adjustment to stockholders' equity of $578 million and a gain on extinguishment of $20 million.
•in july 2020, we completed the sale of our culver city property for cash consideration of $118 million, net of selling costs, and recognized a gain on sale of $35 million.
•in september 2020, we borrowed $750 million under the delayed draw term loan, maturing in 2024, and used the entire amount of the proceeds to repay in full the principal and accrued interest under our 4.2% senior notes due september 2020. the first amendment to our credit agreement, executed in may 2021, extends the maturity date from november 2024 to may 2026 for this tranche. see note 10 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10-k.

•net revenues increased $61 million, primarily due to increased sales of our consumer security products and our identity and protection products, partially offset by the divestiture of our id analytics solutions and the additional week of revenue recognized during fiscal 2020.
•operating income increased $541 million, primarily due to lower compensation expense, outside services expense, and facility and it costs that were driven by our cost reduction programs, partially offset by a legal accrual relating to an ongoing civil lawsuit involving a government contract with the u.s. general services administration (gsa).
•income from continuing operations increased $118 million, primarily due to higher operating income, gain on sale of our culver city and certain mountain view properties, gain on extinguishment of debt, and lower income tax expense, partially offset by the absence of the $379 million gain on sale of our equity method investment in digicert and the $250 million gain on the sale of our id analytics solutions, which were divested in fiscal 2020.
•we incurred a loss from discontinued operations, net of tax, compared to a gain during the corresponding period in fiscal 2020, primarily due to the absence of gain on the sale of certain of our enterprise security assets and certain liabilities to broadcom inc. (the "broadcom sale"), the absence of operating income as a result of the broadcom sale, and a settlement with broadcom in the second quarter of fiscal 2021 of all outstanding payments and certain claims related to the broadcom sale.
•net income and net income per share decreased, primarily due to the loss from discontinued operations for the reasons discussed above, partially offset by higher income from continuing operations.
•cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments decreased by $1,312 million compared to april 3, 2020, primarily due to repayment of debt, net of borrowings, and to a lesser extent, payments for dividends and dividend equivalents, and payment for acquisitions. the payments were partially offset by net cash provided by operating activities and proceeds from the sale of our culver city and certain mountain view properties. in may 2020, we settled the principal and conversion rights of $625 million of our 2.0% convertible notes for $1,176 million in cash.
•contract liabilities increased $189 million compared to april 3, 2020, primarily due to higher billings than recognized revenue and the acquisition of avira.
covid-19 update the covid-19 pandemic is having widespread, rapidly evolving, and unpredictable impacts on global society, economies, financial markets, and business practices. to protect the health and well-being of our employees, partners and third-party service providers, we implemented a near company-wide work-from-home requirement for most employees, made substantial modifications to employee travel policies, and cancelled or shifted our conferences and other marketing events to virtual-only. we continue to monitor the situation and plan to adjust our current policies as recommendations and public health guidance is changing. to date, we have not seen any meaningful negative impact on our customer success efforts, sales and marketing efforts, or employee productivity. nevertheless, as employees, partners or third-party services providers return to work during the covid-19 pandemic, the risk of inadvertent transmission of covid-19 through human contact could still occur and result in litigation.
the u.s. and global economies have experienced a recession due to the economic impacts of the covid-19 pandemic. although we did not experience a material increase in cancellations by customers or a material reduction in our retention rate in table of contents
2021, we may experience such an increase or reduction in the future, especially in the event of a prolonged recession as a result of the covid-19 pandemic. a prolonged recession could adversely affect demand for our offerings, retention rates and harm our business and results of operations, particularly in light of the fact that our solutions are discretionary purchases and thus may be more susceptible to macroeconomic pressures, as well impact the value of our common stock, ability to refinance our debt, and our access to capital.
the duration and extent of the impact from the covid-19 pandemic depends on future developments that cannot be accurately forecasted at this time, such as the severity and transmission rate of new variants of the disease, the extent, effectiveness and acceptance of containment actions, such as vaccination programs, and the impact of these and other factors on our employees, customers, partners and third-party service providers. for more information on the risks associated with the covid-19 pandemic, please see "risk factors" in item 1a.
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of our consolidated financial statements and related notes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the u.s. (gaap) requires us to make estimates, including judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. we have based our estimates on historical experience and on various assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. we evaluate our estimates on a regular basis and make changes accordingly. management believes that the accounting estimates employed, and the resulting amounts are reasonable; however, actual results may differ from these estimates. making estimates and judgments about future events is inherently unpredictable and is subject to significant uncertainties, some of which are beyond our control. should any of these estimates and assumptions change or prove to have been incorrect, it could have a material impact on our results of operations, financial position, and cash flows.
a summary of our significant accounting policies is included in note 1 of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10-k. an accounting policy is deemed to be critical if it requires an accounting estimate to be made based on assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the estimate is made, if different estimates reasonably could have been used, or if changes in the estimate that are reasonably possible could materially impact the financial statements. management believes the following critical accounting policies reflect the significant estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements.
business combinations we allocate the purchase price of acquired businesses to the tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values on the acquisition date. any residual purchase price is recorded as goodwill. the allocation of purchase price requires management to make significant estimates and assumptions in determining the fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed especially with respect to intangible assets.
critical estimates in valuing intangible assets include, but are not limited to, future expected cash flows from customer relationships, developed technology, trade names, and acquired patents, and discount rates. management estimates of fair value are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable, but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable. third-party valuation specialists are also utilized for certain estimates. unanticipated events and circumstances may occur which may affect the accuracy or validity of such assumptions, estimates, or actual results.
income taxes we are subject to tax in multiple u.s. and foreign tax jurisdictions. we are required to estimate the current tax exposure as well as assess the temporary differences between the accounting and tax treatment of assets and liabilities, including items such as accruals and allowances not currently deductible for tax purposes. we apply judgment in the recognition and measurement of current and deferred income taxes which includes the following critical accounting estimates.
we use a two-step process to recognize liabilities for uncertain tax positions. the first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit, including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes, if any. if we determine that the tax position will more likely than not be sustained on audit, the second step requires us to estimate and measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than 50% likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement. it is inherently difficult and subjective to estimate such amounts, as this requires us to determine the probability of various outcomes. we re-evaluate these uncertain tax positions on a quarterly basis. this evaluation is based on factors including, but not limited to, changes in facts or circumstances, changes in tax law, effectively settled issues under audit, and new audit activity. such a change in recognition or measurement would result in the recognition of a tax benefit or an additional charge to the tax provision in the period.
loss contingencies we are subject to contingencies that expose us to losses, including various legal and regulatory proceedings, asserted and potential claims that arise in the ordinary course of business. an estimated loss from such contingencies is recognized as a charge to income if it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. judgment is required in both the determination of probability and the determination as to whether a loss is reasonably estimable. we review the status of each significant matter quarterly, and we may revise our estimates. until the final resolution of such matters, there may be an exposure to loss in excess of the amount recorded, and such amounts could be material. should any of our estimates and assumptions change or prove to have been incorrect, it could have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements for that reporting period.

fiscal 2021 compared to fiscal 2020
net revenues increased $61 million primarily due to a $91 million increase in sales of our consumer security products and a $60 million increase in sales of our identity and protection products. this was driven by the increase in our direct customer count year-over-year, and stable annual retention rate and average revenue per user (arpu) in fiscal 2021. the increase was partially offset by a $46 million decrease as a result of the divestiture of our id analytics solutions in january 2020 and $44 million of revenue recognized during an additional week in fiscal 2020.
fiscal 2020 compared to fiscal 2019
net revenues increased $34 million primarily due to approximately $44 million of revenues from the additional week in fiscal 2020.
performance metrics we regularly monitor a number of metrics in order to measure our current performance and estimate our future performance. our metrics may be calculated in a manner different than similar metrics used by other companies.
the following table summarizes supplemental key performance metrics for our solutions:

(1) direct customer revenues in fiscal 2021 excludes a $5 million reduction of revenue from a contract liability purchase accounting adjustment recognized during the last quarter due to the acquisition of avira. direct customer revenues in fiscal 2020 and 2019 excludes $46 million and $48 million, respectively, of revenue from id analytics solutions, which were divested in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020.
(2) average direct customer count for fiscal 2021 is calculated as an average of the fiscal quarters. the average direct customer count for the fourth fiscal quarter was pro-rated to include 1.6 million customers from the avira acquisition.
(3) arpu in fiscal 2020 was normalized to exclude the impact of the extra week on direct revenue, which we estimate to be approximately $41 million of direct customer revenue. excluding this adjustment, arpu would have been $9.07 in fiscal 2020.
we define direct customer revenues as revenues from sales of our consumer solutions to direct customers, which we define as active paid users who have a direct billing relationship with us at the end of the reported period. users with multiple products or entitlements are counted for based on which solutions they are subscribed. we exclude users on free trials and promotions and users who have indirectly purchased our product or services through partners unless such users convert or renew their subscriptions directly with us.
from time to time, we update our methodology due to changes in the business. in fiscal 2021, the average direct customer count calculation has been refined primarily to pro-rate for acquisitions that happen during a quarter, such as avira, which was acquired in january 2021. the full year average direct customer count is calculated as an average across the quarters. this change in methodology had an immaterial impact to historical amounts presented.
arpu is calculated as estimated direct customer revenues for the period divided by the average direct customer count for the same period, expressed as a monthly figure. we monitor arpu because it helps us understand the rate at which we are monetizing our consumer customer base.
annual retention rate is defined as the number of direct customers who have more than a one-year tenure as of the end of the most recently completed fiscal period divided by the total number of direct customers as of the end of the period from one year ago. we monitor annual retention rate to evaluate the effectiveness of our strategies to improve renewals of subscriptions.

fiscal 2020 compared to fiscal 2019
non-operating income, net of expense, increased $729 million primarily due to a $379 million gain on the sale of the digicert equity method investment and a $250 million gain on the sale of our id analytics solutions in fiscal 2020. in addition, our loss from equity interest that was divested in fiscal 2020 decreased $70 million and our interest income increased $38 million as a result of higher investments in money market funds purchased with proceeds from the broadcom sale.
provision for income taxes we are a u.s.-based multinational company subject to tax in multiple u.s. and international tax jurisdictions. our results of operations would be adversely affected to the extent that our geographical mix of income becomes more weighted toward jurisdictions with higher tax rates and would be favorably affected to the extent the relative geographic mix shifts to lower tax jurisdictions. any change in our mix of earnings is dependent upon many factors and is therefore difficult to predict.

fiscal 2021 compared to fiscal 2020
we incurred a loss from discontinued operations in fiscal 2021, compared to a gain during the corresponding period in fiscal 2020, primarily due to the absence of gain on the broadcom sale, the absence of operating income as a result of the broadcom sale, and a $200 million settlement with broadcom in the second quarter of fiscal 2021 of all outstanding payments and certain claims related to the broadcom sale.
fiscal 2020 compared to fiscal 2019
income from discontinued operations in fiscal 2020 reflects a $5,434 million gain on the broadcom sale and $2,122 million income tax expense primarily related to the gain. in addition, we recognized $261 million restructuring, transition and other costs in fiscal 2020, compared to $20 million in fiscal 2019.
liquidity, capital resources and cash requirements liquidity we have historically relied on cash generated from operations, borrowings under credit facilities, issuances of debt, and proceeds from divestitures for our liquidity needs.
as of april 2, 2021, we had cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments of approximately $1.0 billion, of which $0.4 billion was held by our foreign subsidiaries. our cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments are managed with the objective to preserve principal, maintain liquidity, and generate investment returns. the participation exemption system under current u.s. federal tax regulations generally allows us to make distributions of non-u.s. earnings to the u.s. without incurring additional u.s. federal tax; however, these distributions may be subject to applicable state or non-u.s. taxes. we have recognized deferred income taxes for local country income and withholding taxes that could be incurred on distributions of certain non-u.s. earnings or for outside basis differences in our subsidiaries.
we also have an undrawn revolving credit facility of $1 billion. the first amendment to our credit agreement, executed in may 2021, extends the maturity date from november 2024 to may 2026. for additional discussion on the amendment, see note 10 of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10-k.
our principal cash requirements are primarily to meet our working capital needs and support on-going business activities, including payment of taxes and cash dividends, funding capital expenditures, servicing existing debt, repurchasing our common stock, and investing in business acquisitions.
our capital allocation strategy is to balance driving stockholder returns, managing financial risk, and preserving our flexibility to pursue strategic options, including acquisitions. historically, this has included a quarterly cash dividend, the repayment of debt, and the repurchase of our common stock.
divestiture of enterprise security business in fiscal 2020, we completed the sale of certain assets and the assumption of certain liabilities of our enterprise security business to broadcom. during fiscal 2021, we paid approximately $70 million of u.s. and foreign income taxes as a result of the transaction.
on october 1, 2020, we entered into multiple agreements with broadcom and paid an aggregate amount of $200 million. we licensed broadcom's enterprise software, multiple security engines and related telemetry for 5.6 years. in addition, we resolved all outstanding payments and certain claims related to the asset purchase and transition services agreements.
table of contents debt in may 2020, we settled the $625 million principal and conversion rights of our 2.0% convertible notes for $1,176 million in cash. in september 2020, we borrowed $750 million under the delayed draw term loan, maturing in november 2024, and used the entire amount of the proceeds to repay in full the principal and accrued interest under our 4.2% senior notes due september 2020. in march 2021, we made a $6 million quarterly principal payment on our initial term loan (the initial term loan) and a $9 million quarterly principal payment on the delayed draw term loan. on may 7, 2021, we entered into the first amendment to our credit agreement, which provides an additional five year term loan (the first amendment additional term loan), and extends the maturity date of the initial term loan, the delayed draw term loan, and revolving credit facility from november 2024 to may 2026. for additional discussion on the amendment, see note 10 of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10-k.
in may 2021, we entered into a convertible notes purchase agreement (the "agreement") under which we agreed to repurchase $250 million in aggregate principal amount of our new 2.50% convertible senior notes due 2022. under the terms of the agreement, we paid an aggregate of $365 million on may 20, 2021, representing $24.40 per underlying share into which the notes are convertible, accrued and unpaid interest through the date of settlement, and a portion of the cash dividend that we declared on may 10, 2021 . for additional discussion on the agreement, see note 19 of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10-k sale of certain assets on july 27, 2020, we completed the sale of our culver city property for cash consideration of $118 million, net of selling costs.
on april 1, 2021, we completed the sale of certain land and buildings in mountain view for cash consideration of $100 million, net of selling costs.
acquisition of avira on january 8, 2021, we completed our acquisition of avira for total aggregate cash consideration of $344 million, net of $32 million cash acquired.
share repurchase program during fiscal 2021, we executed repurchases of 15 million shares of our common stock under our existing share repurchase program for an aggregate amount of $304 million.

contract liabilities decreased $121 million, primarily due to seasonally higher recognized revenue from our enterprise security solutions than billings during the period prior to the broadcom sale.
accrued compensation and benefits decreased $117 million, primarily due to a decrease in headcount as a result of the broadcom sale and our restructuring activities.

debt covenant compliance - the credit agreement we entered into in november 2019, which was amended and extended through may 2026 on may 7, 2021, contains customary representations and warranties, non-financial covenants for financial reporting, affirmative and negative covenants, including a covenant that we maintain a consolidated leverage ratio of not more than 5.25 to 1.0, or 5.75 to 1.0 if we acquire assets or business in an aggregate amount greater than $250 million, and restrictions on indebtedness, liens, investments, stock repurchases, and dividends (with exceptions permitting our regular quarterly dividend and other specific capital returns). as of april 2, 2021, we were in compliance with all debt covenants.

(1)interest payments were calculated based on the contractual terms of the related senior notes, convertible senior notes, and credit facility. interest on variable rate debt was calculated using the interest rate in effect as of april 2, 2021. see note 10 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10-k for further information on the senior notes, convertible senior notes, and term loans.
(2)these amounts are associated with agreements for purchases of goods or services generally including agreements that are enforceable and legally binding and that specify all significant terms, including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed, minimum, or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction. the table above also includes agreements to purchase goods or services that have cancellation provisions requiring little or no payment. the amounts under such contracts are included in the table above because management believes that cancellation of these contracts is unlikely, and we expect to make future cash payments according to the contract terms or in similar amounts for similar materials.
(3)these amounts represent the transition tax on previously untaxed foreign earnings of foreign subsidiaries under the tax cuts and jobs act which may be paid through july 2025.
(4)we have entered into various non-cancelable operating lease agreements that expire on various dates through fiscal 2028. the amounts in the table above exclude expected sublease income. see note 9 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10-k for further information on leases.
due to the uncertainty with respect to the timing of future cash flows associated with our unrecognized tax benefits and other long-term taxes as of april 2, 2021, we are unable to make reasonably reliable estimates of the period of cash settlement with the respective taxing authorities. therefore, $525 million in long-term income taxes payable has been excluded from the contractual obligations table. see note 13 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10-k for further information.
indemnifications in the ordinary course of business, we may provide indemnifications of varying scope and terms to customers, vendors, lessors, business partners, subsidiaries, and other parties with respect to certain matters, including, but not limited to, losses arising out of our breach of agreements or representations and warranties made by us. in connection with the sale of veritas and the sale of our enterprise security business to broadcom, we assigned several leases to veritas technologies llc or broadcom and/or their related subsidiaries. in addition, our bylaws contain indemnification obligations to our directors, officers, employees, and agents, and we have entered into indemnification agreements with our directors and certain of our officers to give such directors and officers additional contractual assurances regarding the scope of the indemnification set forth in our bylaws and to provide additional procedural protections. we maintain director and officer insurance, which may cover certain liabilities arising from our obligation to indemnify our directors and officers. refer to note 18 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10-k for further information on our indemnifications.

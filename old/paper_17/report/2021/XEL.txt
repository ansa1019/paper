item 1a - risk factors xcel energy is subject to a variety of risks, many of which are beyond our control. risks that may adversely affect the business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows are described below. although the risks are organized by heading, and each risk is described separately, many of the risks are interrelated. these risks should be carefully considered together with the other information set forth in this report and future reports that we file with the sec. you should not interpret the disclosure of any risk factor to imply that the risk has not already materialized.
while we believe we have identified and discussed below the key risk factors affecting our business, there may be additional risks and uncertainties that are not presently known or that are not currently believed to be significant that may adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows in the future.
oversight of risk and related processes the board of directors is responsible for the oversight of material risk and maintaining an effective risk monitoring process. management and the board of directors' committees have responsibility for overseeing the identification and mitigation of key risks and reporting its assessments and activities to the full board of directors.
xcel energy maintains a robust compliance program and promotes a culture of compliance beginning with the tone at the top. the risk mitigation process includes adherence to our code of conduct and compliance policies, operation of formal risk management structures and overall business management. xcel energy further mitigates inherent risks through formal risk committees and corporate functions such as internal audit, and internal controls over financial reporting and legal.
management identifies and analyzes risks to determine materiality and other attributes such as timing, probability and controllability. identification and risk analysis occurs formally through risk assessment conducted by senior management, the financial disclosure process, hazard risk procedures, internal audit and compliance with financial and operational controls.
management also identifies and analyzes risk through the business planning process, development of goals and establishment of key performance indicators, including identification of barriers to implementing xcel energy's strategy. the business planning process also identifies likelihood and mitigating factors to prevent the assumption of inappropriate risk to meet goals.
management communicates regularly with the board of directors and key stakeholders regarding risk. senior management presents and communicates a periodic risk assessment to the board of directors, providing information on the risks that management believes are material, including financial impact, timing, likelihood and mitigating factors. the board of directors regularly reviews management's key risk assessments, which includes areas of existing and future macroeconomic, financial, operational, policy, environmental and security risks.
the oversight, management and mitigation of risk is an integral and continuous part of the board of directors' governance of xcel energy. the board of directors assigns oversight of critical risks to each of its four committees to ensure these risks are well understood and given appropriate focus.
the audit committee is responsible for reviewing the adequacy of the committee's risk oversight and affirming appropriate aggregate oversight occurs. committees regularly report on their oversight activities and certain risk issues may be brought to the full board of directors for consideration when deemed appropriate.
new risks are considered and assigned as appropriate during the annual board of directors and committee evaluation process, resulting in updates to the committee charters and annual work plans. additionally, the board of directors conducts an annual strategy session where xcel energy's future plans and initiatives are reviewed.
operational risks our natural gas and electric generation/transmission and distribution operations involve numerous risks that may result in accidents and other operating risks and costs.
our natural gas transmission and distribution activities include inherent hazards and operating risks, such as leaks, explosions, outages and mechanical problems. our electric generation, transmission and distribution activities include inherent hazards and operating risks such as contact, fire and outages.
these risks could result in loss of life, significant property damage, environmental pollution, impairment of our operations and substantial financial losses to employees, third-party contractors, customers or the public. we maintain insurance against most, but not all, of these risks and losses.
the occurrence of these events, if not fully covered by insurance, could have a material effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows as well as potential loss of reputation.
other uncertainties and risks inherent in operating and maintaining xcel energy's facilities include, but are not limited to:
•risks associated with facility start-up operations, such as whether the facility will achieve projected operating performance on schedule and otherwise as planned.
•failures in the availability, acquisition or transportation of fuel or other necessary supplies.
•the impact of unusual or adverse weather conditions and natural disasters, including, but not limited to, tornadoes, icing events, floods and droughts.
•performance below expected or contracted levels of output or efficiency (e.g., performance guarantees).
•availability of replacement equipment.
•availability of adequate water resources and ability to satisfy water intake and discharge requirements.
•inability to identify, manage properly or mitigate equipment defects.
•use of new or unproven technology.
•risks associated with dependence on a specific type of fuel or fuel source, such as commodity price risk, availability of adequate fuel supply and transportation and lack of available alternative fuel sources.
•increased competition due to, among other factors, new facilities, excess supply, shifting demand and regulatory changes.
additionally, compliance with existing and potential new regulations related to the operation and maintenance of our natural gas infrastructure could result in significant costs. the phmsa is responsible for administering the dot's national regulatory program to assure the safe transportation of natural gas, petroleum and other hazardous materials by pipelines. the phmsa continues to develop regulations and other approaches to risk management to assure safety in design, construction, testing, operation, maintenance and emergency response of natural gas pipeline infrastructure. we have programs in place to comply with these regulations and systematically monitor and renew infrastructure over time, however, a significant incident or material finding of non-compliance could result in penalties and higher costs of operations.
our natural gas and electric transmission and distribution operations are dependent upon complex information technology systems and network infrastructure, the failure of which could disrupt our normal business operations, which could have a material adverse effect on our ability to process transactions and provide services.
our utility operations are subject to long-term planning and project risks.
most electric utility investments are planned to be used for decades. transmission and generation investments typically have long lead times and are planned well in advance of in-service dates and typically subject to long-term resource plans. these plans are based on numerous assumptions such as: sales growth, customer usage, commodity prices, economic activity, costs, regulatory mechanisms, customer behavior, available technology and public policy. xcel energy's long-term resource plan is dependent on our ability to obtain required approvals, develop necessary technical expertise, allocate and coordinate sufficient resources and adhere to budgets and timelines.
in addition, the long-term nature of both our planning and our asset lives are subject to risk. the electric utility sector is undergoing significant change (e.g., increases in energy efficiency, wider adoption of distributed generation and shifts away from fossil fuel generation to renewable generation). customer adoption of these technologies and increased energy efficiency could result in excess transmission and generation resources, downward pressure on sales growth, and potentially stranded costs if we are not able to fully recover costs and investments.
the magnitude and timing of resource additions and changes in customer demand may not coincide with evolving customer preference for generation resources and end-uses, which introduces further uncertainty into long-term planning. efforts to electrify the transportation and building sectors to reduce ghg emissions may result in higher electric demand and lower natural gas demand over time. higher electric demand may require us to adopt new technologies and make significant transmission and distribution investments including advanced grid infrastructure, which increases exposure to overall grid instability and technology obsolescence. evolving stakeholder preference for lower emissions from generation sources and end-uses, like heating, may impact our resource mix and put pressure on our ability to recover capital investments in natural gas generation and delivery. multiple states may not agree as to the appropriate resource mix, which may lead to costs to comply with one jurisdiction that are not recoverable across all jurisdictions served by the same assets.
we are subject to longer-term availability of inputs such as coal, natural gas, uranium and water to cool our facilities. lack of availability of these resources could jeopardize long-term operations of our facilities or make them uneconomic to operate.
our utilities are highly dependent on suppliers to deliver components in accordance with short and long-term project schedules.
our products contain components that are globally sourced from suppliers who, in turn, source components from their suppliers. a shortage of key components in which an alternative supplier is not identified could significantly impact project plans. such impacts could include timing of projects, including potential for project cancellation. failure to adhere to project budgets and timelines could adversely impact our results of operations, financial condition or cash flows.
we are subject to commodity risks and other risks associated with energy markets and energy production.
in the event fuel costs increase, customer demand could decline and bad debt expense may rise, which may have a material impact on our results of operations. despite existing fuel recovery mechanisms in most of our states, higher fuel costs could significantly impact our results of operations if costs are not recovered. delays in the timing of the collection of fuel cost recoveries could impact our cash flows and liquidity.
a significant disruption in supply could cause us to seek alternative supply services at potentially higher costs and supply shortages may not be fully resolved, which could cause disruptions in our ability to provide services to our customers. failure to provide service due to disruptions may also result in fines, penalties or cost disallowances through the regulatory process. also, significantly higher energy or fuel costs relative to sales commitments could negatively impact our cash flows and results of operations.
we also engage in wholesale sales and purchases of electric capacity, energy and energy-related products as well as natural gas. in many markets, emission allowances and/or recs are also needed to comply with various statutes and commission rulings. as a result, we are subject to market supply and commodity price risk.
commodity price changes can affect the value of our commodity trading derivatives. we mark certain derivatives to estimated fair market value on a daily basis. settlements can vary significantly from estimated fair values recorded and significant changes from the assumptions underlying our fair value estimates could cause earnings variability. the management of risks associated with hedging and trading is based, in part, on programs and procedures which utilize historical prices and trends.
due to the inherent uncertainty involved in price movements and potential deviation from historical pricing, xcel energy is unable to fully assure that its risk management programs and procedures would be effective to protect against all significant adverse market deviations.
in addition, xcel energy cannot fully assure that its controls will be effective against all potential risks, including, without limitation, employee misconduct. if such programs and procedures are not effective, xcel energy's results of operations, financial condition or cash flows could be materially impacted.
failure to attract and retain a qualified workforce could have an adverse effect on operations.
in 2021, the competition for talent has become increasingly intense as a result of the ongoing "great resignation", and we may experience increased employee turnover due to this tightening labor market. in addition, specialized knowledge is required of our technical employees for construction and operation of transmission, generation and distribution assets, which may pose additional difficulty for us as we work to recruit, retain and motivate employees in this climate. failure to hire and adequately train replacement employees, including the transfer of significant internal historical knowledge and expertise to new employees or future availability and cost of contract labor may adversely affect the ability to manage and operate our business. inability to attract and retain these employees could adversely impact our results of operations, financial condition or cash flows.
our operations use third-party contractors in addition to employees to perform periodic and ongoing work.
we rely on third-party contractors to perform operations, maintenance and construction work. our contractual arrangements with these contractors typically include performance standards, progress payments, insurance requirements and security for performance. poor vendor performance or contractor unavailability could impact ongoing operations, restoration operations, our reputation and could introduce financial risk or risks of fines.
our employees, directors, third-party contractors, or suppliers may violate or be perceived to violate our codes of conduct, which could have an adverse effect on our reputation.
we are exposed to risk of employee or third-party contractor fraud or other misconduct. all employees and members of the board of directors are subject to comply with our code of conduct and are required to participate in annual training. additionally, suppliers are subject to comply with our supplier code of conduct.
xcel energy does not tolerate discrimination, violations of our code of conduct or other unacceptable behaviors. however, it is not always possible to identify and deter misconduct by employees and other third-parties, which may result in governmental investigations, other actions or lawsuits. if such actions are taken against us we may suffer loss of reputation and such actions could have a material effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
our subsidiary, nsp-minnesota, is subject to the risks of nuclear generation.
nsp-minnesota has two nuclear generation plants, pi and monticello. risks of nuclear generation include:
•hazards associated with the use of radioactive material in energy production, including management, handling, storage and disposal.
•limitations on insurance available to cover losses that may arise in connection with nuclear operations, as well as obligations to contribute to an insurance pool in the event of damages at a covered u.s. reactor.
•technological and financial uncertainties related to the costs of decommissioning nuclear plants may cause our funding obligations to change.
the nrc has authority to impose licensing and safety-related requirements for the operation of nuclear generation facilities, including the ability to impose fines and/or shut down a unit until compliance is achieved. nrc safety requirements could necessitate substantial capital expenditures or an increase in operating expenses. in addition, the inpo reviews nsp-minnesota's nuclear operations. compliance with the inpo's recommendations could result in substantial capital expenditures or a substantial increase in operating expenses.
if a nuclear incident did occur, it could have a material impact on our results of operations, financial condition or cash flows. furthermore, non-compliance or the occurrence of a serious incident at other nuclear facilities could result in increased industry regulation, which may increase nsp-minnesota's compliance costs.
financial risks our profitability depends on the ability of our utility subsidiaries to recover their costs and changes in regulation may impair the ability of our utility subsidiaries to recover costs from their customers.
we are subject to comprehensive regulation by federal and state utility regulatory agencies, including siting and construction of facilities, customer service and the rates that we can charge customers.
the profitability of our utility operations is dependent on our ability to recover the costs of providing energy and utility services and earning a return on capital investment. our rates are generally regulated and are based on an analysis of the utility's costs incurred in a test year. the utility subsidiaries are subject to both future and historical test years depending upon the regulatory jurisdiction. thus, the rates a utility is allowed to charge may or may not match its costs at any given time. rate regulation is premised on providing an opportunity to earn a reasonable rate of return on invested capital.
there can also be no assurance that our regulatory commissions will judge all the costs of our utility subsidiaries to be prudent, which could result in disallowances, or that the regulatory process will always result in rates that will produce full recovery.
overall, management believes prudently incurred costs are recoverable given the existing regulatory framework. however, there may be changes in the regulatory environment that could impair the ability of our utility subsidiaries to recover costs historically collected from customers, or these subsidiaries could exceed caps on capital costs required by commissions and result in less than full recovery.
changes in the long-term cost-effectiveness or to the operating conditions of our assets may result in early retirements of utility facilities. while regulation typically provides cost recovery relief for these types of changes, there is no assurance that regulators would allow full recovery of all remaining costs.
higher than expected inflation or tariffs may increase costs of construction and operations. also, rising fuel costs could increase the risk that our utility subsidiaries will not be able to fully recover their fuel costs from their customers.
adverse regulatory rulings or the imposition of additional regulations could have an adverse impact on our results of operations and materially affect our ability to meet our financial obligations, including debt payments and the payment of dividends on common stock.
any reductions in our credit ratings could increase our financing costs and the cost of maintaining certain contractual relationships.
we cannot be assured that our current credit ratings or our subsidiaries' ratings will remain in effect, or that a rating will not be lowered or withdrawn by a rating agency. significant events including disallowance of costs, use of historic test years, elimination of riders or interim rates, increasing depreciation lives, lower returns on equity, changes to equity ratios and impacts of tax policy may impact our cash flows and credit metrics, potentially resulting in a change in our credit ratings. in addition, our credit ratings may change as a result of the differing methodologies or change in the methodologies used by the various rating agencies.
any credit ratings downgrade could lead to higher borrowing costs or lower proceeds from equity issuances. it could also impact our ability to access capital markets. also, our utility subsidiaries may enter into contracts that require posting of collateral or settlement if credit ratings fall below investment grade.
we are subject to capital market and interest rate risks.
utility operations require significant capital investment. as a result, we frequently need to access capital markets. any disruption in capital markets could have a material impact on our ability to fund our operations. capital market disruption and financial market distress could prevent us from issuing short-term commercial paper, issuing new securities or cause us to issue securities with unfavorable terms and conditions, such as higher interest rates or lower proceeds from equity issuances. higher interest rates on short-term borrowings with variable interest rates could also have an adverse effect on our operating results.
the performance of capital markets impacts the value of assets held in trusts to satisfy future obligations to decommission nsp-minnesota's nuclear plants and satisfy our defined benefit pension and postretirement benefit plan obligations. these assets are subject to market fluctuations and yield uncertain returns, which may fall below expected returns. a decline in the market value of these assets may increase funding requirements. additionally, the fair value of the debt securities held in the nuclear decommissioning and/or pension trusts may be impacted by changes in interest rates.
we are subject to credit risks.
credit risk includes the risk that our customers will not pay their bills, which may lead to a reduction in liquidity and an increase in bad debt expense. credit risk is comprised of numerous factors including the price of products and services provided, the economy and unemployment rates.
credit risk also includes the risk that counterparties that owe us money or product will become insolvent and may breach their obligations. should the counterparties fail to perform, we may be forced to enter into alternative arrangements. in that event, our financial results could be adversely affected and incur losses.
xcel energy may have direct credit exposure in our short-term wholesale and commodity trading activity to financial institutions trading for their own accounts or issuing collateral support on behalf of other counterparties. we may also have some indirect credit exposure due to participation in organized markets, (e.g., california independent system operator, spp, pjm interconnection, llc, miso and electric reliability council of texas), in which any credit losses are socialized to all market participants.
we have additional indirect credit exposure to financial institutions from letters of credit provided as security by power suppliers under various purchased power contracts. if any of the credit ratings of the letter of credit issuers were to drop below investment grade, the supplier would need to replace that security with an acceptable substitute. if the security were not replaced, the party could be in default under the contract.
increasing costs of our defined benefit retirement plans and employee benefits may adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition or cash flows.
we have defined benefit pension and postretirement plans that cover most of our employees. assumptions related to future costs, return on investments, interest rates and other actuarial assumptions have a significant impact on our funding requirements of these plans. estimates and assumptions may change. in addition, the pension protection act sets the minimum funding requirements for defined benefit pension plans. therefore, our funding requirements and contributions may change in the future. also, the payout of a significant percentage of pension plan liabilities in a single year, due to high numbers of retirements or employees leaving, would trigger settlement accounting and could require xcel energy to recognize incremental pension expense related to unrecognized plan losses in the year liabilities are paid. changes in industry standards utilized in key assumptions (e.g., mortality tables) could have a significant impact on future obligations and benefit costs.
increasing costs associated with health care plans may adversely affect our results of operations.
increasing levels of large individual health care claims and overall health care claims could have an adverse impact on our results of operations, financial condition or cash flows. health care legislation could also significantly impact our benefit programs and costs.
we must rely on cash from our subsidiaries to make dividend payments.
investments in our subsidiaries are our primary assets. substantially all of our operations are conducted by our subsidiaries. consequently, our operating cash flow and ability to service our debt and pay dividends depends upon the operating cash flows of our subsidiaries and their payment of dividends.
our subsidiaries are separate legal entities that have no obligation to pay any amounts due pursuant to our obligations or to make any funds available for dividends on our common stock. in addition, each subsidiary's ability to pay dividends depends on statutory and/or contractual restrictions which may include requirements to maintain minimum levels of equity ratios, working capital or assets.
if the utility subsidiaries were to cease making dividend payments, our ability to pay dividends on our common stock or otherwise meet our financial obligations could be adversely affected. our utility subsidiaries are regulated by state utility commissions, which possess broad powers to ensure that the needs of the utility customers are met. we may be negatively impacted by the actions of state commissions that limit the payment of dividends by our utility subsidiaries.
federal tax law may significantly impact our business.
our utility subsidiaries collect estimated federal, state and local tax payments through their regulated rates. changes to federal tax law may benefit or adversely affect our earnings and customer costs. tax depreciable lives and the value/availability of various tax credits or the timeliness of their utilization may impact the economics or selection of resources. if tax rates are increased, there could be timing delays before regulated rates provide for recovery of such tax increases in revenues. in addition, certain irs tax policies, such as tax normalization, may impact our ability to economically deliver certain types of resources relative to market prices.
macroeconomic risks economic conditions impact our business.
xcel energy's operations are affected by local, national and worldwide economic conditions, which correlates to customers/sales growth (decline). economic conditions may be impacted by insufficient financial sector liquidity leading to potential increased unemployment, which may impact customers' ability to pay their bills, which could lead to additional bad debt expense.
our utility subsidiaries face competitive factors, which could have an adverse impact on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. further, worldwide economic activity impacts the demand for basic commodities necessary for utility infrastructure, which may inhibit our ability to acquire sufficient supplies. we operate in a capital-intensive industry and federal trade policy could significantly impact the cost of materials we use. there may be delays before these additional material costs can be recovered in rates.
we face risks related to health epidemics and other outbreaks, which may have a material effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
the global outbreak of covid-19 continues to impact countries, communities, supply chains and markets. a high degree of uncertainty continues to exist regarding the pandemic; the duration and magnitude of business restrictions (domestically and globally); the potential shortages of employees and third-party contractors due to quarantine policies, vaccination requirements or government restrictions; re-shutdowns, if any, and the level and pace of economic recovery.
xcel energy has experienced and may continue to experience sales volatility and shifts between residential and c&i sales as a result of covid-19. xcel energy has a decoupling mechanism in colorado for residential and non-demand small c&i electric customer classes. in minnesota, xcel energy has historically had a sales true-up mechanism for all electric customer classes which has ended in 2021. we are requesting implementation of a new sales true-up mechanism for 2022 - 2024. these mechanisms mitigate the impact of changes to sales levels as compared to a baseline.
although the financial impact of the pandemic on our financial results has largely been mitigated, we cannot ultimately predict whether it will have a material impact on our future liquidity, financial condition or results of operations. nor can we predict the impact of the virus on the health of our employees, our supply chain or our ability to recover higher costs associated with managing through the pandemic. the impact of covid-19 may exacerbate other risks discussed herein, which could have a material effect on us. the situation is evolving and additional impacts may arise.
operations could be impacted by war, terrorism or other events.
our generation plants, fuel storage facilities, transmission and distribution facilities and information and control systems may be targets of terrorist activities. any disruption could impact operations or result in a decrease in revenues and additional costs to repair and insure our assets. these disruptions could have a material impact on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.
the potential for terrorism has subjected our operations to increased risks and could have a material effect on our business. we have already incurred increased costs for security and capital expenditures in response to these risks. the insurance industry has also been affected by these events and the availability of insurance may decrease. in addition, insurance may have higher deductibles, higher premiums and more restrictive policy terms.
a disruption of the regional electric transmission grid, interstate natural gas pipeline infrastructure or other fuel sources, could negatively impact our business, brand and reputation. because our facilities are part of an interconnected system, we face the risk of possible loss of business due to a disruption caused by the actions of a neighboring utility.
we also face the risks of possible loss of business due to significant events such as severe storms, severe temperature extremes, wildfires (particularly in colorado), widespread pandemic, generator or transmission facility outage, pipeline rupture, railroad disruption, operator error, sudden and significant increase or decrease in wind generation or a workforce disruption.
in addition, major catastrophic events throughout the world may disrupt our business. xcel energy participates in a global supply chain, which includes materials and components that are globally sourced. a prolonged disruption could result in the delay of equipment and materials that may impact our ability to reliably serve our customers.
a major disruption could result in a significant decrease in revenues and additional costs to repair assets, which could have a material impact on our results of operations, financial condition or cash flows.
xcel energy participates in gridex, which is the largest grid security exercise in north america. these efforts, led by the nerc, test and further develop the coordination, threat sharing and interaction between utilities and various government agencies relative to potential cyber and physical threats against the nation's electric grid.
a cyber incident or security breach could have a material effect on our business.
we operate in an industry that requires the continued operation of sophisticated information technology, control systems and network infrastructure. in addition, we use our systems and infrastructure to create, collect, use, disclose, store, dispose of and otherwise process sensitive information, including company data, customer energy usage data, and personal information regarding customers, employees and their dependents, contractors, shareholders and other individuals.
xcel energy's generation, transmission, distribution and fuel storage facilities, information technology systems and other infrastructure or physical assets as well as information processed in our systems (e.g., information regarding our customers, employees, operations, infrastructure and assets) could be affected by cyber security incidents, including those caused by human error.
the utility industry has been the target of several attacks on operational systems and has seen an increased volume and sophistication of cyber security incidents from international activist organizations, nation states and individuals. during the normal course of business, we have experienced and expect to continue to experience attempts to compromise our information technology and control systems, network infrastructure and other assets. to date, no cybersecurity incident or attack has had a material impact on our business or results of operation.
cyber security incidents could harm our businesses by limiting our generating, transmitting and distributing capabilities, delaying our development and construction of new facilities or capital improvement projects to existing facilities, disrupting our customer operations or causing the release of customer information, all of which would likely receive state and federal regulatory scrutiny and could expose us to liability.
xcel energy's generation, transmission systems and natural gas pipelines are part of an interconnected system. therefore, a disruption caused by the impact of a cyber security incident of the regional electric transmission grid, natural gas pipeline infrastructure or other fuel sources of our third-party service providers' operations, could also negatively impact our business.
our supply chain for procurement of digital equipment and services may expose software or hardware to these risks and could result in a breach or significant costs of remediation. we are unable to quantify the potential impact of cyber security threats or subsequent related actions. cyber security incidents and regulatory action could result in a material decrease in revenues and may cause significant additional costs (e.g., penalties, third-party claims, repairs, insurance or compliance) and potentially disrupt our supply and markets for natural gas, oil and other fuels.
we maintain security measures to protect our information technology and control systems, network infrastructure and other assets. however, these assets and the information they process may be vulnerable to cyber security incidents, including asset failure or unauthorized access to assets or information.
a failure or breach of our technology systems or those of our third-party service providers could disrupt critical business functions and may negatively impact our business, our brand, and our reputation. the cyber security threat is dynamic and evolves continually, and our efforts to prioritize network protection may not be effective given the constant changes to threat vulnerability.
our operating results may fluctuate on a seasonal and quarterly basis and can be adversely affected by milder weather.
our electric and natural gas utility businesses are seasonal and weather patterns can have a material impact on our operating performance. demand for electricity is often greater in the summer and winter months associated with cooling and heating. because natural gas is heavily used for residential and commercial heating, the demand depends heavily upon weather patterns. a significant amount of natural gas revenues are recognized in the first and fourth quarters related to the heating season. accordingly, our operations have historically generated less revenues and income when weather conditions are milder in the winter and cooler in the summer. unusually mild winters and summers could have an adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.
public policy risks we may be subject to legislative and regulatory responses to climate change, with which compliance could be difficult and costly.
legislative and regulatory responses related to climate change may create financial risk as our facilities may be subject to additional regulation at either the state or federal level in the future. international agreements could additionally lead to future federal or state regulations.
in 2015, the united nations framework convention on climate change reached consensus among 190 nations on an agreement (the paris agreement) that establishes a framework for ghg mitigation actions by all countries, with a goal of holding the increase in global average temperature to below 2o celsius above pre-industrial levels and an aspiration to limit the increase to 1.5o celsius.
in april 2021, ahead of the united nations climate change conference in glasgow, the biden administration committed the u.s. to a nationally determined contribution of 50-52% net ghg emissions reduction economy-wide from 2005 levels. this commitment and other agreements made in glasgow could result in future additional ghg reductions in the united states. in addition, the biden administration has announced plans to implement new climate change programs, including potential regulation of ghg emissions targeting the utility industry.
many states and localities continue to pursue their own climate policies. the steps xcel energy has taken to date to reduce ghg emissions, including energy efficiency measures, adding renewable generation or retiring or converting coal plants to natural gas, occurred under state-endorsed resource plans, renewable energy standards and other state policies.
we may be subject to climate change lawsuits. an adverse outcome could require substantial capital expenditures and possibly require payment of substantial penalties or damages. defense costs associated with such litigation can also be significant and could affect results of operations, financial condition or cash flows if such costs are not recovered through regulated rates.
if our regulators do not allow us to recover all or a part of the cost of capital investment or the o&m costs incurred to comply with the mandates, it could have a material effect on our results of operations, financial condition or cash flows.
increased risks of regulatory penalties could negatively impact our business.
the energy act increased civil penalty authority for violation of ferc statutes, rules and orders. the ferc can impose penalties of up to $1.3 million per violation per day, particularly as it relates to energy trading activities for both electricity and natural gas. in addition, nerc electric reliability standards and critical infrastructure protection requirements are mandatory and subject to potential financial penalties. also, the phmsa, occupational safety and health administration and other federal agencies have the authority to assess penalties.
in the event of serious incidents, these agencies may pursue penalties. in addition, certain states have the authority to impose substantial penalties. if a serious reliability, cyber or safety incident did occur, it could have a material effect on our results of operations, financial condition or cash flows.
the continued use of natural gas for both power generation and gas distribution have increasingly become a public policy advocacy target. these efforts may result in a limitation of natural gas as an energy source for both power generation and heating, which could impact our ability to reliably and affordably serve our customers.
in recent years, there have been various local and state agency proposals within and outside our service territories that would attempt to restrict the use and availability of natural gas. if such policies were to prevail, we may be forced to make new resource investment decisions which could potentially result in stranded costs if we are not able to fully recover costs and investments and impact the overall reliability of our service.
environmental risks we are subject to environmental laws and regulations, with which compliance could be difficult and costly.
we are subject to environmental laws and regulations that affect many aspects of our operations, including air emissions, water quality, wastewater discharges and the generation, transport and disposal of solid wastes and hazardous substances. laws and regulations require us to obtain permits, licenses, and approvals and to comply with a variety of environmental requirements.
environmental laws and regulations can also require us to restrict or limit the output of facilities or the use of certain fuels, shift generation to lower-emitting facilities, install pollution control equipment, clean up spills and other contamination and correct environmental hazards. failure to meet requirements of environmental mandates may result in fines or penalties. we may be required to pay all or a portion of the cost to remediate sites where our past activities, or the activities of other parties, caused environmental contamination.
changes in environmental policies and regulations or regulatory decisions may result in early retirements of our generation facilities. while regulation typically provides relief for these types of changes, there is no assurance that regulators would allow full recovery of all remaining costs.
we are subject to mandates to provide customers with clean energy, renewable energy and energy conservation offerings. it could have a material effect on our results of operations, financial condition or cash flows if our regulators do not allow us to recover the cost of capital investment or o&m costs incurred to comply with the requirements.
in addition, existing environmental laws or regulations may be revised and new laws or regulations may be adopted. we may also incur additional unanticipated obligations or liabilities under existing environmental laws and regulations.
we are subject to physical and financial risks associated with climate change and other weather, natural disaster and resource depletion impacts.
climate change can create physical and financial risk. physical risks include changes in weather conditions and extreme weather events. our customers' energy needs vary with weather. to the extent weather conditions are affected by climate change, customers' energy use could increase or decrease. increased energy use due to weather changes may require us to invest in generating assets, transmission and infrastructure. decreased energy use due to weather changes may result in decreased revenues.
climate change may impact the economy, which could impact our sales and revenues. the price of energy has an impact on the economic health of our communities. the cost of additional regulatory requirements, such as regulation of ghg, could impact the availability of goods and prices charged by our suppliers which would normally be borne by consumers through higher prices for energy and purchased goods.
to the extent financial markets view climate change and emissions of ghgs as a financial risk, this could negatively affect our ability to access capital markets or cause us to receive less than ideal terms and conditions.
we have committed to a number of long-term climate change goals, which in part are dependent on future technologies not currently in existence. given the long-term nature of these goals, there is an inherent uncertainty due to internal and external factors regarding our ability to achieve our stated climate change goals. to the extent climate change goals are not met, this could negatively impact our reputation and potentially result in financial risk.
severe weather impacts our service territories, primarily when thunderstorms, flooding, tornadoes, wildfires and snow or ice storms occur. extreme weather conditions in general require system backup and can contribute to increased system stress, including service interruptions. extreme weather conditions creating high energy demand may raise electricity prices, increasing the cost of energy we provide to our customers.
to the extent the frequency of extreme weather events increases, this could increase our cost of providing service. periods of extreme temperatures could impact our ability to meet demand. changes in precipitation resulting in droughts or water shortages could adversely affect our operations. drought conditions also contribute to the increase in wildfire risk from our electric generation facilities.
while we carry liability insurance, given an extreme event, if xcel energy was found to be liable for wildfire damages, amounts that potentially exceed our coverage could negatively impact our results of operations, financial condition or cash flows.
drought or water depletion could adversely impact our ability to provide electricity to customers, cause early retirement of power plants and increase the cost for energy. adverse events may result in increased insurance costs and/or decreased insurance availability. we may not recover all costs related to mitigating these physical and financial risks.
item 7 - management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations non-gaap financial measures the following discussion includes financial information prepared in accordance with gaap, as well as certain non-gaap financial measures such as ongoing roe, ongoing earnings and ongoing diluted eps. generally, a non-gaap financial measure is a measure of a company's financial performance, financial position or cash flows that excludes (or includes) amounts that are adjusted from measures calculated and presented in accordance with gaap.
xcel energy's management uses non-gaap measures for financial planning and analysis, for reporting of results to the board of directors, in determining performance-based compensation and communicating its earnings outlook to analysts and investors. non-gaap financial measures are intended to supplement investors' understanding of our performance and should not be considered alternatives for financial measures presented in accordance with gaap. these measures are discussed in more detail below and may not be comparable to other companies' similarly titled non-gaap financial measures.
ongoing roe ongoing roe is calculated by dividing the net income or loss of xcel energy or each subsidiary, adjusted for certain nonrecurring items, by each entity's average stockholder's equity. we use these non-gaap financial measures to evaluate and provide details of earnings results.
earnings adjusted for certain items (ongoing earnings and ongoing diluted eps)
gaap diluted eps reflects the potential dilution that could occur if securities or other agreements to issue common stock (i.e., common stock equivalents) were settled. the weighted average number of potentially dilutive shares outstanding used to calculate xcel energy inc.'s diluted eps is calculated using the treasury stock method. ongoing earnings reflect adjustments to gaap earnings (net income) for certain items. ongoing diluted eps is calculated by dividing the net income or loss of each subsidiary, adjusted for certain items, by the weighted average fully diluted xcel energy inc. common shares outstanding for the period. ongoing diluted eps for each subsidiary is calculated by dividing the net income or loss of such subsidiary, adjusted for certain items, by the weighted average fully diluted xcel energy inc. common shares outstanding for the period.
we use these non-gaap financial measures to evaluate and provide details of xcel energy's core earnings and underlying performance. we believe these measurements are useful to investors to evaluate the actual and projected financial performance and contribution of our subsidiaries. for the years ended dec. 31, 2021 and 2020, there were no such adjustments to gaap earnings and therefore gaap earnings equal ongoing earnings.

xcel energy's management believes that ongoing earnings reflects management's performance in operating xcel energy and provides a meaningful representation of the performance of xcel energy's core business. in addition, xcel energy's management uses ongoing earnings internally for financial planning and analysis, reporting results to the board of directors and when communicating its earnings outlook to analysts and investors.
2021 comparison with 2020
xcel energy - gaap and ongoing earnings increased $0.17 per share for 2021. the increase was driven by capital investment recovery and other regulatory outcomes, partially offset by increases in depreciation and lower afudc. fluctuations in electric and natural gas revenues associated with changes in fuel and purchased power and/or natural gas sold and transported generally do not significantly impact earnings (changes in revenues are offset by the related variation in costs).
psco - earnings increased $0.11 per share for 2021, driven by capital investment recovery and other regulatory outcomes. higher revenues were partially offset by increased depreciation, o&m expenses and other taxes (other than income taxes).
nsp-minnesota - earnings were flat for 2021 compared to 2020, reflecting capital investment recovery offset by additional depreciation and interest charges.
sps - earnings increased $0.03 per share for 2021, largely related to capital investment recovery, other regulatory outcomes and higher sales and demand, partially offset by decreased afudc.
nsp-wisconsin - earnings were flat for 2021 compared to 2020.
xcel energy inc. and other - primarily includes financing costs at the holding company, offset by earnings from eip investments.

statement of income analysis the following summarizes the items that affected the individual revenue and expense items reported in the consolidated statements of income.
estimated impact of temperature changes on regulated earnings - unusually hot summers or cold winters increase electric and natural gas sales, while mild weather reduces electric and natural gas sales. the estimated impact of weather on earnings is based on the number of customers, temperature variances, the amount of natural gas or electricity historically used per degree of temperature and excludes any incremental related operating expenses that could result due to storm activity or vegetation management requirements. as a result, weather deviations from normal levels can affect xcel energy's financial performance. however, sales true-up and decoupling mechanisms in minnesota and colorado predominately mitigate the positive and adverse impacts of weather.
degree-day or thi data is used to estimate amounts of energy required to maintain comfortable indoor temperature levels based on each day's average temperature and humidity. hdd is the measure of the variation in the weather based on the extent to which the average daily temperature falls below 65° fahrenheit. cdd is the measure of the variation in the weather based on the extent to which the average daily temperature rises above 65° fahrenheit. each degree of temperature above 65° fahrenheit is counted as one cdd, and each degree of temperature below 65° fahrenheit is counted as one hdd. in xcel energy's more humid service territories, a thi is used in place of cdd, which adds a humidity factor to cdd. hdd, cdd and thi are most likely to impact the usage of xcel energy's residential and commercial customers. industrial customers are less sensitive to weather.
normal weather conditions are defined as either the 10, 20 or 30-year average of actual historical weather conditions. the historical period of time used in the calculation of normal weather differs by jurisdiction, based on regulatory practice. to calculate the impact of weather on demand, a demand factor is applied to the weather impact on sales. extreme weather variations, windchill and cloud cover may not be reflected in weather-normalized estimates.

electric margin electric margin is presented as electric revenues less electric fuel and purchased power expenses. expenses incurred for electric fuel and purchased power are generally recovered through various regulatory recovery mechanisms. as a result, changes in these expenses are generally offset in operating revenues.
electric revenues and fuel and purchased power expenses are impacted by fluctuations in the price of natural gas, coal and uranium. however, these price fluctuations generally have minimal impact on earnings impact due to fuel recovery mechanisms. in addition, electric customers receive a credit for ptcs generated, which reduce electric revenue and income taxes.

natural gas margin natural gas margin is presented as natural gas revenues less the cost of natural gas sold and transported. expenses incurred for the cost of natural gas sold are generally recovered through various regulatory recovery mechanisms. as a result, changes in these expenses are generally offset in operating revenues.
natural gas expense varies with changing sales and the cost of natural gas. however, fluctuations in the cost of natural gas generally have minimal earnings impact due to cost recovery mechanisms.

non-fuel operating expenses and other items o&m expenses - o&m expenses decreased $3 million year-to-date. increases for distribution, wind farm maintenance and technology costs were offset by a decrease in employee benefits expense (e.g., long term incentives), additional texas 2021 rate case deferrals and the year-over-year impact of amounts associated with the texas 2019 rate case surcharge.
depreciation and amortization - depreciation and amortization increased $173 million year-to-date. the increase was primarily driven by several wind farms going into service, normal system expansion and the implementation of new depreciation rates in various states.
other income (expense) - other income (expense) increased $11 million year-to-date. the change was largely related to gains associated with rabbi trust performance (offset in o&m expenses).
afudc, equity and debt - afudc decreased $58 million year-to-date. the decrease was driven by completion of various wind projects throughout 2020 and 2021.
interest charges - interest charges increased $2 million year-to-date. the increase was largely due to higher debt levels to fund capital investments, partially offset by lower long-term and short-term interest rates.
earnings from equity method investments - earnings from equity method investments increased $22 million year-to-date. the year-to-date change was largely attributable to the performance of the eip funds, which invest in energy technology companies.
income taxes - income tax benefit increased $64 million year-to-date. the change was driven by an increase in wind ptcs due to additional wind facilities going into service. impact of ptcs was partially offset by an increase in pretax earnings, lower plant regulatory differences and lower non-plant accumulated deferred income tax amortization.

•deferral of advanced grid intelligence and security initiative capital and o&m expenses.
•an earnings cap mechanism, which would return to customers 100% of earnings equal to or in excess of 9.75% roe, effective until the next rate case.
minnesota relief and recovery - in 2020, the mpuc opened a docket and invited utilities in the state to submit potential projects that would create jobs and help jump start the economy to offset the impacts of covid-19.
the status of the various proposals is listed below:
•in january 2021, the mpuc approved nsp-minnesota's request for the repowering of 651 mw of owned wind projects and 20 mw of wind projects under ppas. these projects are estimated to save customers approximately $160 million over the next 25 years.
•in april 2021, nsp-minnesota proposed to add 460 mw of solar facilities at the sherco site with an incremental investment of approximately $575 million. an mpuc decision is expected by the third quarter of 2022.
•in june 2021, the mpuc approved nsp-minnesota's proposal to acquire a repowered wind farm from allete, inc.
•the mpuc is also considering nsp-minnesota's revised proposal to provide $40 million of incremental electric vehicle rebates.
minnesota resource plan - in july 2019, nsp-minnesota filed its minnesota resource plan, which runs through 2034.
on feb. 8, 2022, the mpuc approved the following:
•10-year extension for the monticello nuclear facility.
•retirement of the a.s. king plant in 2028 and sherco 3 in 2030.
•nsp-minnesota ownership of sherco and a.s. king gen-tie lines plus additional renewable resources on the lines up to its current interconnection rights (2,000 mw for sherco and 600 mw for a.s. king).
•the need for 2,150 mw of new wind and 2,500 mw of new solar by 2032, as well as additional renewable generation of 1,100 mw beyond 2032.
•recognition of the need for 800 mw of additional firm dispatchable resources between 2027 and 2029. the dispatchable generation will need to be approved through a con process.
the next minnesota resource plan is due on feb. 1, 2024.
2022 res electric rider - in november 2021, nsp-minnesota filed the res rider. the requested amount of $264 million includes a true-up (2020 and 2021 riders) of $154 million and the 2022 requested amount of $110 million. the filing included a roe of 9.06%. an mpuc decision is pending.
2021 res electric rider - in november 2020, nsp-minnesota filed the res rider. the requested amount of $189 million includes a true-up (2019 and 2020 riders) of $96 million and the 2021 requested amount of $93 million. the filing included a roe of 9.06%. an mpuc decision is pending.
2022 guic natural gas rider - in october 2021, nsp-minnesota filed the guic rider for an amount of $27 million based on a roe of 9.04%. an mpuc decision is pending.
2021 guic natural gas rider - in october 2020, nsp-minnesota filed the guic rider for an amount of $27 million based on a roe of 9.04%. an mpuc decision is pending.
2022 tcr electric rider - in november 2021, nsp-minnesota filed the tcr rider for an amount of $105 million based on a roe of 9.06%. an mpuc decision is pending.
2020 tcr electric rider - in november 2019, nsp-minnesota filed the tcr rider for an amount of $82 million based on a roe of 9.06%, which was approved by the mpuc in december 2021.
ferc nopr on roe incentive adders - in april 2021, the ferc issued a nopr proposing to limit collection of roe incentive adders for rto membership to the first three years after an entity begins participation in an rto. if adopted as a final rule, nsp-minnesota (as well as nsp-wisconsin and sps) would prospectively discontinue charging their current 50 basis point roe incentive adders. amounts related to a discontinuance of the adder would ultimately be offset by an increase in retail rates, subject to future rate cases.
purchased power arrangements and transmission service provider nsp-minnesota expects to use power plants, power purchases, cip/dsm options, new generation facilities and expansion of power plants to meet its system capacity requirements.
purchased power - nsp-minnesota has contracts to purchase power from other utilities and ipps. long-term purchased power contracts for dispatchable resources typically require a capacity and an energy charge.
nsp-minnesota makes short-term purchases to meet system requirements, replace company owned generation, meet operating reserve obligations or obtain energy at a lower cost.
purchased transmission services - nsp-minnesota and nsp-wisconsin have contracts with miso and other regional transmission service providers to deliver power and energy to their customers.
nuclear power operations nuclear power plant operations produce gaseous, liquid and solid radioactive wastes, which are covered by federal regulation. high-level radioactive wastes primarily include used nuclear fuel. low-level waste consists primarily of demineralizer resins, paper, protective clothing, rags, tools and equipment contaminated through use.
nrc regulation - the nrc regulates nuclear operations. costs of complying with nrc requirements can affect both operating expenses and capital investments of the plants. nsp-minnesota has obtained recovery of these compliance costs and expects to recover future compliance costs.
low-level waste disposal - low level waste disposal from monticello and pi is disposed at the clive facility located in utah and the waste control specialists facility in texas. nsp-minnesota has storage capacity available on-site at pi and monticello which would allow both plants to continue to operate until the end of their current licensed lives if off-site low-level waste disposal facilities become unavailable.
high-level radioactive waste disposal - the federal government has responsibility to permanently dispose domestic spent nuclear fuel and other high-level radioactive wastes. the nuclear waste policy act requires the doe to implement a program for nuclear high-level waste management. this includes the siting, licensing, construction and operation of a repository for spent nuclear fuel from civilian nuclear power reactors and other high-level radioactive wastes at a permanent federal storage or disposal facility. currently, there are no definitive plans for a permanent federal storage facility site.
nuclear spent fuel storage - nsp-minnesota has interim on-site storage for spent nuclear fuel at its monticello and pi nuclear generating plants. authorized storage capacity is sufficient to allow nsp-minnesota to operate until the end of the operating licenses in 2030 for monticello, 2033 for pi unit 1, and 2034 for pi unit 2. authorizations for additional spent fuel storage capacity may be required at each site to support either continued operation or decommissioning if the federal government does not commence storage operations.

•psco will refund electric customers $41 million (previously deferred) related to the 2020 electric decoupling pilot program.
•psco agreed to forego recovery of $14 million for replacement power costs due to an extended outage at comanche unit 3 during 2020 (approved by the cpuc in february 2022 as part of the 2020 eca settlement agreement).
•psco also agreed to not seek recovery of covid-19 related bad debt expense, previously deferred as a regulatory asset, and recorded an additional $11 million of incremental bad debt expense for the period ended dec. 31, 2021.
decoupling filing - psco's 2019 electric rate case included a decoupling program, effective april 1, 2020 through dec. 31, 2023. the program applies to residential and metered small c&i customers who do not pay a demand charge. the program includes a refund and surcharge cap not to exceed 3% of forecasted base rate revenue for a specified period.
in april 2021, psco made its annual filing for 2020, and the revised tariff went into effect by operation of law on june 1, 2021. in the annual filing review, the cpuc indicated they may pursue reopening the case in order to revisit the cap. as of dec. 31, 2021, psco has recognized a refund for residential customers and a surcharge for c&i customers based on 2020 and 2021 results.
in october 2021, a settlement was reached on winter storm uri costs and also addressed certain components of decoupling. see partial settlement disclosure above for further discussion.
comanche unit 3 - psco is part owner and operator of comanche unit 3, a 750 mw, coal-fueled electric generating unit. in january 2020, the unit experienced a turbine failure causing the unit to be taken offline for repairs, which were completed in june 2020. during start-up, the unit experienced a loss of turbine oil, which damaged the unit. comanche unit 3 recommenced operations in january 2021. replacement and repair of damaged systems in excess of a $2 million deductible are expected to be recovered through insurance policies. psco incurred replacement power costs of approximately $16 million during the outage.
in october 2020, the cpuc initiated a review of comanche unit 3's performance. in march 2021, the cpuc staff issued a report, which noted higher-than average outages and included criticisms of psco's operations of comanche unit 3 over the last ten years. the report recommended thorough explanation of the future of comanche unit 3 operations in the next resource plan, performance standards for all company-owned generation and a review of outage and repair costs in upcoming eca proceedings.
in october 2021, a comprehensive settlement was reached, which addressed treatment of 2020 comanche unit 3 replacement power costs. see partial settlement disclosure above for further discussion.
2019 electric rate case appeal - in august 2020, psco filed an appeal with the denver district court seeking a review of cpuc decisions on gains and losses on sales of assets, oil and gas royalty revenues, board of directors equity compensation and a true-up surcharge to collect the difference between rates from february through august 2020 based on the cpuc's decision on the company's application for reconsideration, rehearing or reargument and rates that were actually in place. in january 2022, the denver district court issued its decision that the cpuc's approach to gains and losses on certain sales of assets was legally erroneous and confiscatory to psco and set aside and remanded the issue for further consideration. the district court affirmed the cpuc with respect to the remaining decisions.
gca nopr - in june 2021, the cpuc issued a nopr addressing the recovery of costs through the gca. the proposed rule would establish an annual forecast of gca costs for each utility and allow each utility to recover only 90%-95% of any costs in excess of the forecasted amount. the proposed rule would allow utilities to earn an incentive equal to an undefined portion of any savings relative to forecasted costs. comments were filed and requested that the cpuc delay the rule making process until after the 2021 - 2022 heating season; in part because utilities have already proceeded with purchasing gas for the upcoming heating season in accordance with prior cpuc decisions. the cpuc has reopened the gca nopr matter and the parties will submit follow-up comments during the first quarter of 2022.
purchased power and transmission service providers psco expects to meet its system capacity requirements through electric generating stations, power purchases, new generation facilities, dsm options and expansion of generation plants.

wholesale and commodity marketing operations sps conducts various wholesale marketing operations, including the purchase and sale of electric capacity, energy, ancillary services and energy related products. sps uses physical and financial instruments to minimize commodity price and credit risk and to hedge sales and purchases.
other public utility matters comanche unit 3 outage in january 2022, psco experienced an incident at the comanche unit 3 plant (750 mw, coal-fueled electric generating unit) resulting in damage and an outage that is expected to last approximately two months. psco has notified the cpuc and informed them that it will not seek recovery of any replacement power costs above the expected costs if comanche 3 had been in service. the estimated incremental replacement power costs could be approximately $10 million, assuming a two month outage, normal weather and current market pricing.
marshall wildfire in december 2021, a wildfire ignited in boulder county, colorado (the "marshall fire"), which burned over 6,000 acres and destroyed or damaged over 1,000 structures. while there were no downed power lines in the ignition area, the determination of the cause of the marshall fire is pending.
in colorado, the standard of review governing liability differs from the "inverse condemnation" or strict liability standard utilized in california. in colorado, courts look to whether electric power companies have operated their system with a heightened duty of care consistent with the practical conduct of its business, and liability does not extend to occurrences that cannot be reasonably anticipated. in addition, psco has been operating under a commission approved wildfire mitigation plan and carries wildfire liability insurance.
however, in the unlikely event we were found liable, the damages awarded could exceed our coverage and negatively impact our results of operations, financial conditions or cash flows.
winter storm uri in february 2021, the united states experienced winter storm uri. extreme cold temperatures impacted certain operational assets as well as the availability of renewable generation. the cold weather also affected the country's supply and demand for natural gas. these factors contributed to extremely high market prices for natural gas and electricity. as a result of the extremely high market prices, xcel energy incurred net natural gas, fuel and purchased energy costs of approximately $1 billion (largely deferred as regulatory assets).
regulatory overview - xcel energy has natural gas, fuel and purchased energy mechanisms in each jurisdiction for recovering incurred costs. however, the utility subsidiaries have deferred february 2021 cost increases for future recovery and sought recovery of the cost increases over a period of up to 63 months to mitigate the impact to customer bills. additionally, we did not request recovery of financing costs in order to further limit the impact to our customers.
proceedings initiated:
utility subsidiary         jurisdiction         regulatory status nsp-minnesota              minnesota            nsp-minnesota filed with the mpuc seeking recovery of $215 million in incremental costs from natural gas customers. in august 2021, the mpuc allowed recovery of $179 million of costs deemed to be extraordinary beginning in september 2021 over 27 months (no financing charge) and $36 million of ordinary costs over 12 months through the monthly purchased gas adjustment. the $179 million in extraordinary cost recovery is subject to refund pending the outcome of a contested case before an alj.
in december 2021, the mpuc approved extending recovery of winter storm uri costs for the residential class (approximately $97 million) from a 27-month recovery period to a 63-month recovery period. new residential winter storm uri rates were effective jan. 1, 2022.
in december 2021, direct testimony was received from intervenors. the doc recommended a $127 million disallowance based on allegations including peaking plant usage, load forecasting, natural gas supply/storage and related purchases. alternatively, the doc recommended a $42 million disallowance if nsp-minnesota proves it prudently managed its peaking plants. the oag recommended a disallowance of $179 million based on allegations that nsp-minnesota could have fully hedged its exposure to spot market prices. alternatively, the oag recommended a $25 million disallowance based on allegations related to specific hedges allegedly available in the market during february 2021. the cub recommended a $69 million disallowance based on allegations related to the unavailability of nsp-minnesota's peaking plants, inaccuracy of load forecasting and inadequate curtailment of interruptible customers.
xcel energy strongly disagrees with the recommendations of the doc, oag and cub and believes that it acted prudently and according to mpuc approved procedures for the best interest of its customers and stakeholders. nsp-minnesota filed rebuttal testimony in january 2022. a hearing before the aljs assigned to the matter is scheduled for feb. 17-23, 2022. an mpuc decision is expected in the summer of 2022.

psco                       colorado             in may, psco filed a request with the cpuc to recover $263 million in weather-related electric costs, $287 million in incremental natural gas costs and $4 million in incremental steam costs over 24 months with no financing charge.
in september, intervenors filed testimony. the cpuc staff recommended disallowances of approximately $99 million (electric) and $105 million (natural gas). additionally, they proposed to net approximately $50 million of regulatory liabilities (decoupling related) from electric costs. the utility consumer advocate recommended disallowances of approximately $131 million. the coeo recommended disallowances of approximately $46 million for not utilizing demand response programs during the event.
in october, a partial settlement was reached with the cpuc staff and the coeo, allowing full recovery of winter storm uri deferred net natural gas, fuel and purchased energy costs of $263 million (electric utility) and $287 million (natural gas utility) over a 24-month and 30-month period, respectively, with no carrying charges through a rider mechanism.
a decision is expected in the first quarter of 2022. in addition, the cpuc is considering prospective changes in fuel cost recovery.
sps                        texas                as part of the texas fuel surcharge filing, sps filed for recovery of $76 million, over 24 months, in under-collected purchased power and fuel costs through march 2021, subject to revision due to re-settlements. of this amount, $62 million was attributed to winter storm uri.
in the third quarter, sps filed a supplemental application and testimony to recover an additional $26 million in under-collected purchased power and fuel costs through june 2021 resulting primarily from spp resettlements and continued increases in natural gas prices.
in november 2021, the alj abated the hearing schedule to allow the parties to continue settlement negotiations.
in december 2021, sps filed its triennial fuel reconciliation, under which the puct will consider prudence of sps' fuel costs for the period july 2018 - june 2021, including winter storm uri.
in january 2022, sps and other parties filed a stipulation/motion for interim rates. the filing covers all fuel under-collections occurring between january 2020 and august 2021, totaling $121 million. the settlement does not address the prudence of winter storm uri costs nor the retention of $11 million related to market sales during the event. these items will be reviewed through the triennial fuel reconciliation proceeding and are subject to a final puct decision. interim rates, designed to collect up to $110 million over a period of 30 months, will begin on feb. 1, 2022.
new mexico           in march 2021, the nmprc approved sps' request to recover $26 million of fuel costs over 24 months with no financing charge, subject to nmprc review.
potential tax reform the u.s. congress is currently discussing potential proposals that may impact federal tax law. at this time, it is unknown what, if any, changes may ultimately occur. based on provisions passed by the u.s. house of representatives in november 2021, known as the build back better act, if any of such provisions were to be enacted into law, we would not expect the impact of such changes to have a material impact on our earnings.
critical accounting policies and estimates preparation of the consolidated financial statements requires the application of accounting rules and guidance, as well as the use of estimates. application of these policies involves judgments regarding future events, including the likelihood of success of particular projects, legal and regulatory challenges and anticipated recovery of costs. these judgments could materially impact the consolidated financial statements, based on varying assumptions. in addition, the financial and operating environment also may have a significant effect on the operation of the business and results reported.
accounting policies and estimates that are most significant to xcel energy's results of operations, financial condition or cash flows, and require management's most difficult, subjective or complex judgments are outlined below. each of these has a higher likelihood of resulting in materially different reported amounts under different conditions or using different assumptions. each critical accounting policy has been reviewed and discussed with the audit committee of xcel energy inc.'s board of directors on a quarterly basis.
regulatory accounting xcel energy is subject to the accounting for regulated operations, which provides that rate-regulated entities report assets and liabilities consistent with the recovery of those incurred costs in rates, if it is probable that such rates will be charged and collected. our rates are derived through the ratemaking process, which results in the recording of regulatory assets and liabilities based on the probability of future cash flows.
regulatory assets generally represent incurred or accrued costs that have been deferred because future recovery from customers is probable. regulatory liabilities generally represent amounts that are expected to be refunded to customers in future rates or amounts collected in current rates for future costs. in other businesses or industries, regulatory assets and regulatory liabilities would generally be charged to net income or other comprehensive income.
each reporting period we assess the probability of future recoveries and obligations associated with regulatory assets and liabilities. factors such as the current regulatory environment, recently issued rate orders and historical precedents are considered. decisions made by regulatory agencies can directly impact the amount and timing of cost recovery as well as the rate of return on invested capital, and may materially impact our results of operations, financial condition or cash flows.
as of dec. 31, 2021 and 2020, xcel energy had regulatory assets of $3.8 billion and $3.4 billion, respectively and regulatory liabilities of $5.7 billion and $5.6 billion, respectively. each subsidiary is subject to regulation that varies from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. if future recovery of costs in any such jurisdiction is no longer probable, xcel energy would be required to charge these assets to current net income or other comprehensive income.
at dec. 31, 2021, in assessing the probability of recovery of recognized regulatory assets, unless otherwise disclosed, xcel energy noted no current or anticipated proposals or changes in the regulatory environment that it expects will materially impact the recovery of the assets.
see notes 4 and 12 to the consolidated financial statements for further information.
income tax accruals judgment, uncertainty and estimates are a significant aspect of the income tax accrual process that accounts for the effects of current and deferred income taxes. uncertainty associated with the application of tax statutes and regulations and outcomes of tax audits and appeals require that judgment and estimates be made in the accrual process and in the calculation of the etr.
changes in tax laws and rates may affect recorded deferred tax assets and liabilities and our future etr. etr calculations are revised every quarter based on best available year-end tax assumptions, adjusted in the following year after returns are filed. tax accrual estimates are trued-up to the actual amounts claimed on the tax returns and further adjusted after examinations by taxing authorities, as needed.
in accordance with the interim period reporting guidance, income tax expense for the first three quarters in a year is based on the forecasted annual etr. the forecasted etr reflects a number of estimates, including forecasted annual income, permanent tax adjustments and tax credits.
valuation allowances are applied to deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not that at least a portion may not be realized based on an evaluation of expected future taxable income. accounting for income taxes also requires that only tax benefits that meet the more likely than not recognition threshold can be recognized or continue to be recognized. we may adjust our unrecognized tax benefits and interest accruals as disputes with the irs and state tax authorities are resolved, and as new developments occur. these adjustments may increase or decrease earnings.
see note 7 to the consolidated financial statements for further information.
employee benefits we sponsor several noncontributory, defined benefit pension plans and other postretirement benefit plans that cover almost all employees and certain retirees. projected benefit costs are based on historical information and actuarial calculations that include key assumptions (annual return level on pension and postretirement health care investment assets, discount rates, mortality rates and health care cost trend rates, etc.). in addition, the pension cost calculation uses a methodology to reduce the volatility of investment performance over time. pension assumptions are continually reviewed.
at dec. 31, 2021, xcel energy set the rate of return on assets used to measure pension costs at 6.49%, which is consistent with the rate set in 2020. the rate of return used to measure postretirement health care costs is 4.10% at dec. 31, 2021, which is consistent with the rate set in 2020.
xcel energy's pension investment strategy is based on plan-specific investments that seek to minimize investment and interest rate risk as a plan's funded status increases over time. this strategy results in a greater percentage of interest rate sensitive securities being allocated to plans with higher funded status ratios and a greater percentage of growth assets being allocated to plans having lower funded status ratios.
xcel energy set the discount rates used to value the pension obligations at 3.08% and postretirement health care obligations at 3.09% at dec. 31, 2021. this represents a 37 basis point and 44 basis point decrease, respectively, from 2020. xcel energy uses a bond matching study as its primary basis for determining the discount rate used to value pension and postretirement health care obligations. the bond matching study utilizes a portfolio of high grade (aa or higher) bonds that matches the expected cash flows of xcel energy's benefit plans in amount and duration.
the effective yield on this cash flow matched bond portfolio determines the discount rate for the individual plans. the bond matching study is validated for reasonableness against the merrill lynch corporate 15+ bond index. in addition, xcel energy reviews general actuarial survey data to assess the reasonableness of the discount rate selected.
if xcel energy were to use alternative assumptions, a 1% change would result in the following impact on 2021 pension costs:
pension costs
(millions of dollars)         +1%                             -1%
rate of return                $(13)                       $23
discount rate (a)             $1                          $15
(a)these costs include the effects of regulation.
mortality rates are developed from actual and projected plan experience for pension plan and postretirement benefits. xcel energy's actuary conducts an experience study periodically to determine an estimate of mortality. xcel energy considers standard mortality tables, improvement factors and the plans actual experience when selecting a best estimate.
as of dec. 31, 2021, the initial medical trend cost claim assumptions for pre-65 was 5.3% and post-65 was 4.9%. the ultimate trend assumption remained at 4.5% for both pre-65 and post-65 claims costs. xcel energy bases its medical trend assumption on the long-term cost inflation expected in the health care market, considering the levels projected and recommended by industry experts, as well as recent actual medical cost experienced by xcel energy's retiree medical plan.
funding contributions in 2021 were $131 million and are expected to decline in the following years. investment returns exceeded assumed levels in 2021, 2020 and 2019.
the pension cost calculation uses a market-related valuation of pension assets. xcel energy uses a calculated value method to determine the market-related value of the plan assets. the market-related value is determined by adjusting the fair market value of assets at the beginning of the year to reflect the investment gains and losses (the difference between the actual investment return and the expected investment return on the market-related value) during each of the previous five years at the rate of 20% per year. as differences between actual and expected investment returns are incorporated into the market-related value, amounts are recognized in pension cost over the expected average remaining years of service for active employees (approximately 13 years in 2021).
xcel energy currently projects the pension costs recognized for financial reporting purposes will be $77 million in 2022 and $60 million in 2023, while the actual pension costs were $121 million in 2021 and $117 million in 2020. the expected decrease in 2022 and future year costs is primarily due to the reductions in loss amortizations.
pension funding contributions across all four of xcel energy's pension plans, both voluntary and required, for 2019 - 2022:
•$50 million in january 2022.
•$131 million in 2021.
•$150 million in 2020.
•$154 million in 2019.
future amounts may change based on actual market performance, changes in interest rates and any changes in governmental regulations. therefore, additional contributions could be required in the future.
xcel energy contributed $15 million, $11 million and $15 million during 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively, to the postretirement health care plans. xcel energy expects to contribute approximately $9 million during 2022. xcel energy recovers employee benefits costs in its utility operations consistent with accounting guidance with the exception of the areas noted below.
•nsp-minnesota recognizes pension expense in all regulatory jurisdictions using the aggregate normal cost actuarial method. differences between aggregate normal cost and expense as calculated by pension accounting standards are deferred as a regulatory liability.
•in 2021, the pscw approved nsp-wisconsin's request for deferred accounting treatment of the 2021 pension settlement accounting expense. in addition, the commission order approved escrow accounting treatment for pension and other post-employment benefit expenses.
•regulatory commissions in colorado, texas, new mexico and ferc jurisdictions allow the recovery of other postretirement benefit costs only to the extent that recognized expense is matched by cash contributions to an irrevocable trust. xcel energy has consistently funded at a level to allow full recovery of costs in these jurisdictions.
•psco and sps recognize pension expense in all regulatory jurisdictions based on gaap. the texas and colorado electric retail jurisdictions and the colorado gas retail jurisdiction, each record the difference between annual recognized pension expense and the annual amount of pension expense approved in their last respective general rate case as a deferral to a regulatory asset.
•in 2018, psco was required to create a regulatory liability to adjust postretirement health care costs to zero in order to match the amounts collected in rates in the colorado gas retail jurisdiction. in 2020, this requirement was extended to the colorado electric retail jurisdiction.
see note 11 to the consolidated financial statements for further information.
nuclear decommissioning xcel energy recognizes liabilities for the expected cost of retiring tangible long-lived assets for which a legal obligation exists. these aros are recognized at fair value as incurred and are capitalized as part of the cost of the related long-lived assets. in the absence of quoted market prices, xcel energy estimates the fair value of its aros using present value techniques, in which it makes assumptions including estimates of the amounts and timing of future cash flows associated with retirement activities, credit-adjusted risk free rates and cost escalation rates. when xcel energy revises any assumptions, it adjusts the carrying amount of both the aro liability and related long-lived asset. aro liabilities are accreted to reflect the passage of time using the interest method.
a significant portion of xcel energy's aros relates to the future decommissioning of nsp-minnesota's nuclear facilities. the nuclear decommissioning obligation is funded by the external decommissioning trust fund. difference between regulatory funding (including depreciation expense less returns from the external trust fund) and expense recognized is deferred as a regulatory asset. the amounts recorded for aros related to future nuclear decommissioning were $2.1 billion in 2021 and $2.0 billion in 2020.
nsp-minnesota obtains periodic independent cost studies in order to estimate the cost and timing of planned nuclear decommissioning activities. estimates of future cash flows are highly uncertain and may vary significantly from actual results. nsp-minnesota is required to file a nuclear decommissioning filing every three years. the filing covers all expenses for the decommissioning of the nuclear plants, including decontamination and removal of radioactive material.
the currently approved triennial filing was ordered by the mpuc in january 2019. this approval did not result in a change to the aro liability. in december 2020, the mpuc ordered xcel energy to maintain the current accrual through 2021 to align with the approved one year stay out of the previously filed multi-year electric rate case. also, in december 2020, xcel energy filed an accrual proposal with the mpuc to be effective in 2022 based on an updated independent cost study. in december 2021, xcel energy submitted its petition for approval of the 2022-2024 nsp-minnesota's nuclear decommission study and assumptions. xcel energy anticipates the mpuc to deliberate on this filing in february 2022.
the following assumptions have a significant effect on the estimated nuclear obligation:
timing - decommissioning cost estimates are impacted by each facility's retirement date and timing of the actual decommissioning activities. estimated retirement dates coincide with the expiration of each unit's operating license with the nrc (i.e., 2030 for monticello and 2033 and 2034 for pi's unit 1 and 2, respectively). the estimated timing of the decommissioning activities is based upon the decon method (required by the mpuc), which assumes prompt removal and dismantlement. decommissioning activities are expected to begin at the end of the license date and be completed for both facilities by 2091.
technology and regulation - there is limited experience with actual decommissioning of large nuclear facilities. changes in technology, experience and regulations could cause cost estimates to change significantly.
escalation rates - escalation rates represent projected cost increases due to general inflation and increases in the cost of decommissioning activities. nsp-minnesota used an escalation rate of 3.2% in calculating the aro for nuclear decommissioning of its nuclear facilities, based on weighted averages of labor and non-labor escalation factors calculated by goldman sachs asset management.
discount rates - changes in timing or estimated cash flows that result in upward revisions to the aro are calculated using the then-current credit-adjusted risk-free interest rate. the credit-adjusted risk-free rate in effect when the change occurs is used to discount the revised estimate of the incremental expected cash flows of the retirement activity.
if the change in timing or estimated expected cash flows results in a downward revision of the aro, the undiscounted revised estimate of expected cash flows is discounted using the credit-adjusted risk-free rate in effect at the date of initial measurement and recognition of the original aro. discount rates ranging from approximately 3% to 7% have been used to calculate the net present value of the expected future cash flows over time.
significant uncertainties exist in estimating future costs including the method to be utilized, ultimate costs to decommission and planned method of disposing spent fuel. if different cost estimates, life assumptions or cost escalation rates were utilized, the aros could change materially.
however, changes in estimates have minimal impact on results of operations as nsp-minnesota expects to continue to recover all costs in future rates.
xcel energy continually makes judgments and estimates related to these critical accounting policy areas, based on an evaluation of the assumptions and uncertainties for each area. the information and assumptions of these judgments and estimates will be affected by events beyond the control of xcel energy, or otherwise change over time. this may require adjustments to recorded results to better reflect updated information that becomes available. the accompanying financial statements reflect management's best estimates and judgments of the impact of these factors as of dec. 31, 2021.

derivatives, risk management and market risk we are exposed to a variety of market risks in the normal course of business. market risk is the potential loss that may occur as a result of adverse changes in the market or fair value of a particular instrument or commodity. all financial and commodity-related instruments, including derivatives, are subject to market risk.
xcel energy is exposed to the impact of adverse changes in price for energy and energy-related products, which is partially mitigated by the use of commodity derivatives. in addition to ongoing monitoring and maintaining credit policies intended to minimize overall credit risk, management takes steps to mitigate changes in credit and concentration risks associated with its derivatives and other contracts, including parental guarantees and requests of collateral. while we expect that the counterparties will perform under the contracts underlying its derivatives, the contracts expose us to some credit and non-performance risk.
distress in the financial markets may impact counterparty risk, the fair value of the securities in the nuclear decommissioning fund and pension fund and xcel energy's ability to earn a return on short-term investments.
commodity price risk - we are exposed to commodity price risk in our electric and natural gas operations. commodity price risk is managed by entering into long- and short-term physical purchase and sales contracts for electric capacity, energy and energy-related products and fuels used in generation and distribution activities. commodity price risk is also managed through the use of financial derivative instruments. our risk management policy allows us to manage commodity price risk within each rate-regulated operation per commission approved hedge plans.
wholesale and commodity trading risk - xcel energy conducts various wholesale and commodity trading activities, including the purchase and sale of electric capacity, energy, energy-related instruments and natural gas-related instruments, including derivatives. our risk management policy allows management to conduct these activities within guidelines and limitations as approved by our risk management committee.

at dec. 31, 2021, a 10% increase in market prices for commodity trading contracts through the forward curve would increase pretax income from continuing operations by approximately $13 million, whereas a 10% decrease would decrease pretax income from continuing operations by approximately $13 million. at dec. 31, 2020, a 10% increase in market prices for commodity trading contracts would increase pretax income from continuing operations by approximately $13 million, whereas a 10% decrease would decrease pretax income from continuing operations by approximately $13 million. market price movements can exceed 10% under abnormal circumstances.
the utility subsidiaries' commodity trading operations measure the outstanding risk exposure to price changes on contracts and obligations that have been entered into, but not closed, using an industry standard methodology known as var. var expresses the potential change in fair value on the outstanding contracts and obligations over a particular period of time under normal market conditions.
the vars for the nsp-minnesota and psco commodity trading operations, excluding both non-derivative transactions and derivative transactions designated as normal purchase and normal sales, calculated on a consolidated basis using a monte carlo simulation with a 95% confidence level and a one-day holding period, were as follows:

a short-term increase in var occurred during the week of feb. 12, 2021 through feb. 18, 2021. on feb. 17, 2021, the portfolio var reached a high of $52 million. this increase in var was driven by the unprecedented market conditions during winter storm uri. prior to this widespread weather event, var was $1 million and returned to $1 million by feb. 19, 2021.
nuclear fuel supply - nsp-minnesota has contracted for approximately 78% of its 2022 enriched nuclear material requirements from sources that could be impacted by sanctions against entities doing business with iran. those sanctions may impact the supply of enriched nuclear material supplied from russia. long-term, through 2030, nsp-minnesota is scheduled to take delivery of approximately 30% of its average enriched nuclear material requirements from these sources. nsp-minnesota is able to manage nuclear fuel supply with alternate potential sources. nsp-minnesota periodically assesses if further actions are required to assure a secure supply of enriched nuclear material.
interest rate risk - xcel energy is subject to interest rate risk. our risk management policy allows interest rate risk to be managed through the use of fixed rate debt, floating rate debt and interest rate derivatives such as swaps, caps, collars and put or call options.
a 100 basis point change in the benchmark rate on xcel energy's variable rate debt would impact pretax interest expense annually by approximately $11 million and $6 million in 2021 and 2020, respectively.
nsp-minnesota maintains a nuclear decommissioning fund, as required by the nrc. the nuclear decommissioning fund is subject to interest rate risk and equity price risk. the fund is invested in a diversified portfolio of cash equivalents, debt securities, equity securities and other investments. these investments may be used only for the purpose of decommissioning nsp-minnesota's nuclear generating plants.
realized and unrealized gains on the decommissioning fund investments are deferred as an offset of nsp-minnesota's regulatory asset for nuclear decommissioning costs. fluctuations in equity prices or interest rates affecting the nuclear decommissioning fund do not have a direct impact on earnings due to the application of regulatory accounting.
changes in discount rates and expected return on plan assets impact the value of pension and postretirement plan assets and/or benefit costs.
credit risk - xcel energy is also exposed to credit risk. credit risk relates to the risk of loss resulting from counterparties' nonperformance on their contractual obligations. xcel energy maintains credit policies intended to minimize overall credit risk and actively monitors these policies to reflect changes and scope of operations.
at dec. 31, 2021, a 10% increase in commodity prices would have resulted in an increase in credit exposure of $36 million, while a decrease in prices of 10% would have resulted in a decrease in credit exposure of $26 million. at dec. 31, 2020, a 10% increase in commodity prices would have resulted in an increase in credit exposure of $11 million, while a decrease in prices of 10% would have resulted in an immaterial increase in credit exposure.
xcel energy conducts credit reviews for all counterparties and employs credit risk controls, such as letters of credit, parental guarantees, master netting agreements and termination provisions. credit exposure is monitored, and when necessary, the activity with a specific counterparty is limited until credit enhancement is provided. distress in the financial markets could increase our credit risk.
fair value measurements xcel energy uses derivative contracts such as futures, forwards, interest rate swaps, options and ftrs to manage commodity price and interest rate risk. derivative contracts, with the exception of those designated as normal purchase and normal sale contracts, are reported at fair value.
xcel energy's investments held in the nuclear decommissioning fund, rabbi trusts, pension and other postretirement funds are also subject to fair value accounting.
commodity derivatives - xcel energy monitors the creditworthiness of the counterparties to its commodity derivative contracts and assesses each counterparty's ability to perform on the transactions. the impact of discounting commodity derivative assets for counterparty credit risk was not material to the fair value of commodity derivative assets at dec. 31, 2021.
adjustments to fair value for credit risk of commodity trading instruments are recorded in electric revenues. credit risk adjustments for other commodity derivative instruments are recorded as other comprehensive income or deferred as regulatory assets and liabilities. classification as a regulatory asset or liability is based on commission approved regulatory recovery mechanisms. the impact of discounting commodity derivative liabilities for credit risk was immaterial at dec. 31, 2021.

(b) working capital includes accounts receivable, accrued unbilled revenues, inventories, accounts payable, other current assets and other current liabilities.
net cash provided by operating activities decreased by $659 million for 2021 as compared to 2020. the decrease was primarily due to the deferral of net natural gas, fuel and purchased energy costs related to winter storm uri in the first quarter.

net cash provided by financing activities increased by $362 million for 2021 as compared to 2020. the increase was primarily attributable to the amount/timing of debt issuances and repayments, changes in capital investment and incremental financing due to the lag in recovery costs associated with winter storm uri.

capital requirements xcel energy has contractual obligations and other commitments that will need to be funded in the future. the company expects to have adequate amounts of cash from operating and/or financing activities to meet both its short-term and long-term cash requirements. xcel energy's financing requirements are dependent on both existing contractual obligations and other commitments, as well as projected capital forecasts. xcel energy expects to meet future financing requirements by periodically issuing short-term debt, long-term debt, common stock, hybrid and other securities to maintain desired capitalization ratios. projected future financing requirements can be impacted by various factors including constraints to supply chain and labor, as well as inflation.
recovery of the effects of inflation through higher customer rates is dependent upon receiving adequate and timely rate increases. rate increases may not be retroactive and often lag increases in costs caused by inflation. on occasion, the company may enter into rate settlement agreements, which require us to wait for a period of time to file the next base rate increase request. these agreements may result in regulatory lag whereby the impact of inflation may not yet be reflected in rates, or a delay may occur between capital project completion and the start of rate recovery. xcel energy attempts to mitigate the potential impact of inflation through the use of fuel, energy and other cost adjustment clauses and bill riders, by employing prudent risk management and hedging strategies and by considering, among other areas, its impact on purchases of energy, operating expenses, materials and equipment costs, contract negotiations, future capital spending programs and long-term debt issuances.

(a) other category includes intercompany transfers for safe harbor wind turbines.
the five-year capital forecast includes the proposed colorado pathway transmission expansion (approximately $1.7 billion) and the proposed 460 mw sherco solar facility (approximately $600 million).
additional capital investment in renewable generation and transmission may be needed in the five-year forecast pending approval of regulatory filings in minnesota and colorado. the approval of the proposed resource plans could result in up to 2,000 mw of renewable generation being needed between 2024 - 2026, resulting in potential capital expenditures estimated between $1.0 to $1.5 billion (assuming xcel energy were to own ~50% of the renewables). additionally, the associated $0.5 billion to $1.0 billion of network upgrades, voltage support and interconnection work related to the colorado power pathway could also be needed during this five-year forecast depending on resource mix, location and timing. any additional capital investment would likely be funded with approximately 50% equity and 50% debt.
xcel energy's capital expenditure forecast is subject to continuing review and modification. actual capital expenditures may vary from estimates due to changes in electric and natural gas projected load growth, safety and reliability needs, regulatory decisions, legislative initiatives (e.g., federal clean energy and tax policy), reserve requirements, availability of purchased power, alternative plans for meeting long-term energy needs, environmental initiatives and regulation, and merger, acquisition and divestiture opportunities.
financing for capital expenditures through 2026 - xcel energy issues debt and equity securities to refinance retiring maturities, reduce short-term debt, fund capital programs, infuse equity in subsidiaries, fund asset acquisitions and for other general corporate purposes.

earnings guidance and long-term eps and dividend growth rate objectives xcel energy 2022 earnings guidance - xcel energy's 2022 gaap and ongoing earnings guidance is a range of $3.10 to $3.20 per share.(a)
key assumptions as compared with 2021 levels unless noted:
•constructive outcomes in all rate case and regulatory proceedings.
•normal weather patterns for the year.
•weather-normalized retail electric sales are projected to increase ~1%.
•weather-normalized retail firm natural gas sales are projected to be 0% to 1%.
•capital rider revenue is projected to increase $35 million to $45 million (net of ptcs). ptcs are credited to customers, through capital riders and reductions to other regulatory mechanisms.
•o&m expenses are projected to increase approximately 1% to 2%.
•depreciation expense is projected to increase approximately $255 million to $265 million.
•property taxes are projected to increase approximately $40 million to $50 million.
•interest expense (net of afudc - debt) is projected to increase $55 million to $65 million.
•afudc - equity is projected to be relatively flat.
•etr is projected to be ~(3%) to (5%). the etr reflects benefits of ptcs which are credited to customers through electric margin and will not have a material impact on net income.
(a) ongoing earnings is calculated using net income and adjusting for certain nonrecurring or infrequent items that are, in management's view, not reflective of ongoing operations. ongoing earnings could differ from those prepared in accordance with gaap for unplanned and/or unknown adjustments. xcel energy is unable to forecast if any of these items will occur or provide a quantitative reconciliation of the guidance for ongoing eps to corresponding gaap eps.
long-term eps and dividend growth rate objectives - xcel energy expects to deliver an attractive total return to our shareholders through a combination of earnings growth and dividend yield, based on the following long-term objectives:
• deliver long-term annual eps growth of 5% to 7% based off of a 2021 base of $2.96 per share, which represents the mid-point of the revised 2021 guidance range of $2.94 to $2.98 per share.
•    deliver annual dividend increases of 5% to 7%.
• target a dividend payout ratio of 60% to 70%.
• maintain senior secured debt credit ratings in the a range.

item 1a.   risk factors

prospective investors should consider carefully the risk factors set forth below before making an investment in the company's securities.
risks related to macroeconomic conditions, our business and our industry the covid-19 pandemic and other widespread health emergencies or pandemics could materially adversely affect the company's business, financial condition or results of operations.
the covid-19 pandemic has resulted in widespread and continuing negative impacts on the macroeconomic environment and disruption to the company's business. weak economic conditions and increased volatility and disruption in the financial markets pose risks to the company and its business partners, including advertisers whose expenditures tend to reflect overall economic conditions. although the covid-19 pandemic did not cause a significant reduction in the company's advertisers' spending in fiscal 2021, future declines in the economic prospects of advertisers or the economy in general could negatively impact their advertising expenditures further. to date, the company has not experienced meaningful subscriber declines due to the pandemic. however, there could be industry-wide changes in consumer behavior due to the pandemic, such as increasing numbers of consumers canceling or foregoing subscriptions to mvpd services, that could adversely affect the company's affiliate fee and advertising revenues.
the company's business depends on the volume and popularity of the content it distributes, particularly sports content. as a result of the covid-19 pandemic, there have been cancellations or postponements of live sports events to which the company has broadcast rights and suspensions of the production of certain entertainment content. these content disruptions have adversely affected the company's advertising and affiliate revenues and there could be additional adverse impacts on its advertising or affiliate fee revenues in the future. to the extent the covid-19 or other pandemic further negatively impacts the timing of or the company's ability to air sports events, particularly mlb, nfl or college sports, it could result in a significantly greater adverse effect on the company's business, financial condition or results of operations than the company has experienced thus far.
if there is a significant decline in the company's estimated revenues or the expected popularity of its programming, it could lead to a downward revision in the value of, among other things, the company's reporting units, indefinite-lived intangible assets, programming rights and long-lived assets and result in a non-cash impairment charge that is material to the company's reported net earnings.
more information about these risks is presented below, as well as information about other risks the pandemic may exacerbate, such as those relating to data privacy and security, legal and regulatory changes, damage to the company's brands and reputation, and the ability to realize the strategic goals of the company's investments. the covid-19 pandemic also poses risks related to the company's workforce and operations and those of its business partners. for example, where possible, company employees began working remotely in march 2020. the company expects a portion of its employees will continue to work in a "hybrid" manner on-site and at home which, despite the company's continuing investment in secure technologies and processes, may subject the company to increased data security risks. as and when employees return to their places of work, it poses various risks to the company, including compliance and litigation risks. these workplace changes have subjected the company to increased operating costs and the company expects to incur additional such costs in the future.
the magnitude of the impact of the covid-19 pandemic on the company remains uncertain and subject to change and will depend on evolving factors the company may not be able to control or accurately predict. these include the duration and scope of the pandemic (including the extent of future surges, mutations or strains of the disease and the efficacy of vaccination and other efforts to contain the virus or treat its impact); the duration and extent of the pandemic's impact on global and regional economies and economic activity, the pace of economic recovery and the economic and operating conditions facing the company and others in the pandemic's aftermath; the effect of governmental actions that have been and may continue to be imposed in response to the pandemic; the impact of the pandemic on the health, well-being and productivity of the company's employees and the company's ability to conduct its operations; and potential changes in consumer behavior. the covid-19 pandemic and other widespread health emergencies or pandemics could have a material adverse effect on the company's business, financial condition or results of operations.
19
changes in consumer behavior and evolving technologies and distribution platforms may adversely affect the company's business, financial condition and results of operations.
the ways in which consumers view content and technology and business models in our industry continue to rapidly evolve and new distribution platforms and increased competition from new entrants and emerging technologies have added to the complexity of maintaining predictable revenue streams. technological advancements have driven changes in consumer behavior as consumers seek more control over when, where and how they consume content and have affected advertisers' options for reaching their target audiences. consumer preferences have evolved towards digital services and other subscription services and there has been a substantial increase in the availability of programming with reduced advertising or without advertising at all. examples include the convergence of television telecasts and digital delivery of programming to televisions and other devices, video-on-demand platforms, user-generated content sites, and simultaneous streaming of telecast content that allows viewers to consume content on demand and in remote locations while avoiding traditional advertisements or subscription payments. as consumers switch to digital consumption of video content, there is still to be developed a consistent, broadly accepted measure of multiplatform audiences across the industry. in addition, consumers are increasingly using time-shifting and advertising-blocking technologies that enable them to fast-forward or circumvent advertisements. substantial use of these technologies could impact the attractiveness of the company's programming to advertisers and adversely affect our advertising revenues.
changes in consumer behavior and technology have also had an adverse impact on traditional mvpds that deliver the company's broadcast and cable networks to consumers. consumers are increasingly turning to alternative offerings, including svod and avod services and mobile and social media platforms, which has contributed to industry-wide declines in subscribers to traditional mvpd services over the last several years. these declines are expected to continue and possibly accelerate in the future. if consumers increasingly favor alternative offerings over traditional mvpd subscriptions, the company may continue to experience a decline in viewership and ultimately demand for the programming on its traditional linear networks, which could lead to lower affiliate fee and advertising revenues. changing distribution models may also negatively impact the company's ability to negotiate affiliation agreements on favorable terms, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. our affiliate fee and advertising revenues also may be adversely affected by consumers' use of antennas (and their integration with set-top boxes or other consumer devices) to access broadcast signals to avoid subscriptions.
to remain competitive in this evolving environment, the company must effectively anticipate and adapt to new market changes. the company continues to focus on expanding its digital distribution offerings and direct engagement with consumers, including tubi, fox nation and other offerings. however, if the company fails to protect and exploit the value of its content while responding to, and developing new technology and business models to take advantage of, technological developments and consumer preferences, it could have a significant adverse effect on the company's business, financial condition and results of operations.
declines in advertising expenditures could cause the company's revenues and operating results to decline significantly in any given period or in specific markets.
the company derives substantial revenues from the sale of advertising, and its ability to generate advertising revenues depends on a number of factors. the strength of the advertising market can fluctuate in response to the economic prospects of specific advertisers or industries, advertisers' spending priorities and the economy in general or the economy of an individual geographic market. in addition, pandemics, natural and other disasters, acts of terrorism, and political uncertainties or hostilities can also lead to a reduction in advertising expenditures as a result of economic uncertainty, disrupted programming and services or reduced advertising spots due to pre-emptions. as described above, the covid-19 pandemic caused some of the company's advertisers to reduce their spending in fiscal 2021, which had a negative impact on the company's advertising revenues.
major sports events, such as the nfl's super bowl and the fifa world cup and the state, congressional and presidential elections cycles also may cause the company's advertising revenues to vary substantially from year to year. political advertising expenditures are impacted by the ability and willingness of candidates and political action campaigns to raise and spend funds on advertising and the competitive nature of the elections affecting viewers in markets featuring our programming.
advertising expenditures may also be affected by changes in consumer behavior and evolving technologies and platforms. there is increasing competition for the leisure time of audiences and demand for the company's programming as measured by ratings points is a key factor in determining the advertising rates as well as the affiliate rates the company receives. in addition, as described above, newer technologies and platforms are increasing the number of
20
media and entertainment choices available to audiences. some of these technologies and platforms allow users to view programming from a remote location or on a time-delayed basis and provide users the ability to fast-forward, rewind, pause and skip programming and advertisements, which could negatively affect the attractiveness of the company's offerings to advertisers. the pricing and volume of advertising may also be affected by shifts in spending toward digital and mobile offerings, which can deliver targeted advertising more promptly, from traditional media, or toward newer ways of purchasing advertising such as through automated purchasing, dynamic advertising insertion, third parties selling local advertising spots and advertising exchanges, some or all of which may not be as beneficial to the company as traditional advertising methods. the company also generates advertising revenues through its tubi avod service. the market for avod advertising campaigns is relatively new and evolving and if this market develops slower or differently than we expect, it could adversely affect our advertising revenues. declines in advertising revenues may also be caused by regulatory intervention or other third party action that impacts where and when advertising may be placed.
advertising sales also largely depend on audience measurement and could be negatively affected if measurement methodologies do no not accurately reflect actual viewership levels. although nielsen's statistical sampling method is the primary measurement methodology used for our linear television advertising sales, we measure and monetize our digital platforms based on a combination of internal and third-party data, including demographic composite estimates. a consistent, broadly accepted measure of multiplatform audiences across the industry remains to be developed. although we expect multiplatform measurement innovation and standards to benefit us as the video advertising market continues to evolve, we are still partially dependent on third parties to provide these solutions.
a decrease in advertising expenditures, reduced demand for the company's programming or the inability to obtain market ratings that adequately measure demand for the company's content on all platforms could lead to a reduction in pricing and advertising spending, which could have a material adverse effect on the company's business, financial condition or results of operations.
because the company derives a significant portion of its revenues from a limited number of distributors, the failure to enter into or renew affiliation and carriage agreements on favorable terms, or at all, could have a material adverse effect on the company's business, financial condition or results of operations.
the company depends on affiliation and carriage arrangements that enable it to reach a large percentage of households through mvpds and third party-owned television stations. the inability to enter into or renew mvpd arrangements on favorable terms, or at all, or the loss of carriage on mvpds' basic programming tiers could reduce the distribution of the company's owned and operated television stations and broadcast and cable networks, which could adversely affect the company's revenues from affiliate fees and its ability to sell national and local advertising time. the loss of favorable mvpd packaging, positioning, pricing or other marketing opportunities could also negatively impact the company's revenues from affiliate fees. these risks are exacerbated by consolidation among traditional mvpds, their increased vertical integration into the cable or broadcast network business and their use of alternative technologies to offer their subscribers access to local broadcast network programming, which have provided traditional mvpds with greater negotiating leverage. in addition, if the company and an mvpd reach an impasse in contract renewal negotiations, the company's networks and owned and operated television stations could become unavailable to the mvpd's subscribers (i.e., "go dark"), which, depending on the length of time and the size of the mvpd, could have a negative impact on the company's revenues from affiliate fees and advertising.
the company also depends on the maintenance of affiliation agreements and license agreements with third party-owned television stations to distribute the fox network and mynetworktv in markets where the company does not own television stations. consolidation among television station group owners could increase their negotiating leverage and reduce the number of available distribution partners. there can be no assurance that these affiliation and license agreements will be renewed in the future on terms favorable to the company. the inability to enter into affiliation or licensing arrangements with third-party owned television stations on favorable terms could reduce distribution of the fox network and mynetworktv and the inability to enter into such affiliation or licensing arrangements for the fox network on favorable terms could adversely affect the company's affiliate fee revenues and its ability to sell national advertising time.
in addition, the company has arrangements through which it makes its content available for viewing through third-party online video platforms. if these arrangements are not renewed on favorable or commercially reasonable terms or at all, it could adversely affect the company's revenues and operating results.
21
if the number of subscribers to mvpd services continues to decline or such declines accelerate, the company's affiliate fee and advertising revenues could be negatively affected.
as described above, changes in technology and consumer behavior have contributed to industry-wide declines in the number of subscribers to mvpd services, which have had a negative impact on the number of subscribers to the company's networks. these industry-wide subscriber declines are expected to continue and possibly accelerate in the future. the majority of the company's affiliation agreements with mvpds are multi-year contracts that provide for payments to the company that are based in part on the number of mvpd subscribers covered by the agreement. if declines in the number of mvpd subscribers are not fully offset by affiliate rate increases, the company's affiliate fee revenues will be negatively affected. because mvpd subscriber losses could also decrease the potential audience for the company's networks, which is a critical factor affecting both the pricing and volume of advertising, future mvpd subscriber declines could also adversely impact the company's advertising revenues.
the company is exposed to risks associated with weak economic conditions and increased volatility and disruption in the financial markets.
the u.s. economy has experienced a period of weakness due to the covid-19 pandemic, which has had and may continue to have an adverse impact on the company's business, financial condition and results of operations. factors that affect economic conditions include the rate of unemployment, the level of consumer confidence, changes in consumer spending habits, political and sociopolitical uncertainties and potential changes in trade relationships between the u.s. and other countries. the company also faces risks associated with the impact of weak economic conditions on advertisers, affiliates, suppliers, wholesale distributors, retailers, insurers and others with which it does business.
increased volatility and disruptions in the financial markets could make it more difficult and more expensive for the company to refinance outstanding indebtedness and obtain new financing. the financial markets can experience high levels of volatility and access to capital can be constrained for extended periods of time, and we cannot guarantee that the company will be able to refinance outstanding indebtedness or obtain financing on terms that are acceptable to the company or at all. in addition, the company's access to and cost of borrowing can be affected by the company's short-term and long-term debt ratings assigned by ratings agencies. if we are not successful in obtaining financing or incur significantly higher borrowing costs than contemplated, it may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.
disruptions in the financial markets can also adversely affect the company's lenders, insurers, customers and counterparties, including vendors, retailers and other partners. for instance, the inability of the company's counterparties to obtain capital on acceptable terms could impair their ability to perform under their agreements with the company and lead to negative effects on the company, including business disruptions, decreased revenues and increases in bad debt expenses.
the company's businesses operate in a highly competitive industry.
the company competes with other companies for high-quality content to reach large audiences and to generate advertising revenue. the company also competes for distribution on mvpds and other third-party digital platforms. the company's ability to attract viewers and advertisers and obtain favorable distribution depends in part on its ability to provide popular programming and adapt to new technologies and distribution platforms, which are increasing the number of content choices available to audiences. the consolidation of advertising agencies, distributors and television service providers also has increased their negotiating leverage and made competition for audiences, advertising revenue, and distribution more intense. competition for audiences and/or advertising comes from a variety of sources, including broadcast television networks; cable television systems and networks; internet-delivered platforms such as live streaming, svod and avod services and mobile, gaming and social media platforms; audio programming; and print and other media. other television stations or cable networks may change their formats or programming, a new station or new network may adopt a format to compete directly with the company's stations or networks, or stations or networks might engage in aggressive promotional campaigns. increased competition in the acquisition of programming may also affect the scope of rights we are able to acquire and the cost of such rights, and the future value of the rights we acquire or retain cannot be predicted with certainty. entering into or renewing contracts for programming rights or acquiring additional rights may result in increased costs to the company. with respect to long-term contracts for sports programming rights, our results of operations and cash flows over the term of a contract depend on a number of factors, including the strength of the advertising market, our audience size, the ability to secure distribution from and impose surcharges or obtain carriage on mvpds for the content, and the timing and amount of our rights payments. there can be no assurance that revenue from acquired rights contracts will exceed our costs for the rights, as well as the other costs of
22
producing and distributing the programming. there can be no assurance that the company will be able to compete successfully in the future against existing or potential competitors or that competition or consolidation in the marketplace will not have a material adverse effect on its business, financial condition or results of operations.
our business is dependent on the popularity of special sports events and the continued popularity of the sports leagues and teams for which we have programming rights.
our sports business depends on the popularity and success of the sports franchises, leagues and teams for which we have acquired broadcast and cable network programming rights. if a sports league declines in popularity or fails to generate fan enthusiasm, this may negatively impact viewership and advertising and affiliate fee revenues received in connection with our sports programming. our operating results may be impacted in part by special events, such as the nfl's super bowl, which is broadcast on the fox network on a rotating basis with other networks, the mlb's world series and the fifa world cup, which occurs every four years (for each of women and men), and other regular and post-season sports events delivered to consumers on our broadcast television and cable networks. our advertising and affiliate fee revenues are subject to fluctuations based on the dates of sports events and their availability for viewing through our broadcast television and cable networks and the popularity of the competing teams. for example, any decrease in the number of post-season games played in a sports league for which we have acquired broadcast programming rights, or the participation of a smaller-market sports franchise in post-season competition could result in lower advertising revenues for the company. there can be no assurance that any sports league will continue to generate fan enthusiasm or provide the expected number of regular and post-season games for advertisers and customers, and the failure to do so could result in a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. additionally, increased competition for the sale of sports event advertising time with other television networks, stations and other advertising platforms, such as digital media, audio and print, may adversely affect the company's revenues and operating results. a shortfall in the expected popularity of the sports events for which the company has acquired rights, or in the volume of sports programming the company expects to distribute, could adversely affect the company's advertising revenues in the near term and, over a longer period of time, adversely affect affiliate fee revenues.
the inability to renew programming rights, particularly sports programming rights, on sufficiently favorable terms, or at all, could cause the company's advertising and affiliate fee revenues to decline significantly in any given period or in specific markets.
we enter into long-term contracts for both the acquisition and the distribution of media programming and products, including contracts for the acquisition of programming rights for sports events and other programs, and contracts for the distribution of our programming to content distributors. programming rights agreements, retransmission consent agreements, carriage contracts and affiliation agreements have varying durations and renewal terms that are subject to negotiation with other parties, the outcome of which is unpredictable. in addition, competition for popular programming rights, and sports programming rights in particular, that are licensed from third parties is intense, and the licenses have varying duration and renewal terms. moreover, the value of these agreements may also be affected by various league decisions and/or league agreements that we may not be able to control, including a decision to alter the number, frequency and timing of regular and post-season games played during a season. as these contracts expire, we may seek renewals on favorable terms; however, third parties may outbid us for the rights contracts. the loss of rights or renewal on less favorable terms could impact the quality or quantity of the company's programs, in particular the sports coverage offered by the company, its cable networks, broadcast stations and affiliates to the fox network, and could adversely affect the company's advertising and affiliate fee revenues. upon renewal, the company's results could be adversely affected if escalations in programming rights costs are unmatched by increases in advertising and affiliate fee revenues. in addition, if the company does not obtain exclusive rights to the programming it distributes, it could negatively impact the company's advertising and affiliate fee revenues.
acceptance of the company's content by the public is difficult to predict, which could lead to fluctuations in revenues.
television distribution is a speculative business since the revenues derived from the distribution of content depends primarily upon its acceptance by the public, which is difficult to predict. low public acceptance of the company's content will adversely affect the company's results of operations. the commercial success of our programming also depends upon the quality and acceptance of other competing programming, the growing number of alternative forms of entertainment and leisure activities, general economic conditions and their effects on consumer spending and other tangible and intangible factors, all of which can change and cannot be predicted with certainty. moreover, we must often invest substantial amounts in programming and the acquisition of sports rights before we learn the extent to which the content will earn consumer acceptance. competition for popular content, particularly sports and entertainment
23
programming, is intense, and the company may need to increase the price it pays for popular content rights. the company's failure to obtain or retain rights to popular content, or a decline in the ratings or popularity of the company's news, sports or entertainment television programming, which could be a result of the loss of talent or rights to certain programming, could adversely affect advertising revenues in the near term and, over a longer period of time, adversely affect affiliate fee revenues.
damage to our brands, particularly the fox brand, or our reputation could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
our brands, particularly the fox brand, are among our most valuable assets. we believe that our brand image, awareness and reputation strengthen our relationship with consumers and contribute significantly to the success of our business. maintaining, further enhancing and extending our brands may require us to make significant investments in marketing, programming or new products, services or events. these investments may not be successful. we may introduce new programming that is not popular with our consumers and advertisers, which may negatively affect our brands. to the extent our content, in particular our live news and sports programming and primetime entertainment programming, is not compelling to consumers, our ability to maintain a positive reputation may be adversely impacted. governmental scrutiny and fines and significant negative claims or publicity regarding the company or its operations, content, products, management, employees, practices, advertisers, business partners and culture, including individuals associated with content we create or license, may damage the company's reputation and brands, even if such claims are untrue. furthermore, to the extent our marketing, customer service and public relations efforts are not effective or result in negative consumer reaction, our ability to maintain a positive reputation may likewise be adversely impacted. if we are not successful in maintaining or enhancing the image or awareness of our brands, or if our reputation is harmed for any reason, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
our investments in new businesses, products, services and technologies through acquisitions and other strategic investments present many risks, and we may not realize the financial and strategic goals we had contemplated, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
we have acquired and invested in, and expect to continue acquiring and investing in, new businesses, products, services and technologies that complement, enhance or expand our current businesses or otherwise offer us growth opportunities. such acquisitions and strategic investments may involve significant risks and uncertainties, including insufficient revenues from an investment to offset any new liabilities assumed and expenses associated with the investment; a failure of the investment or acquired business to perform as expected, meet financial projections or achieve strategic goals; a failure to further develop an acquired business, product, service or technology; unidentified issues not discovered in our due diligence that could cause us to not realize anticipated benefits or to incur unanticipated liabilities; difficulties in integrating the operations, personnel, technologies and systems of acquired businesses; the potential loss of key employees or customers of acquired businesses; the diversion of management attention from current operations; and compliance with new regulatory regimes. because acquisitions and investments are inherently risky and their anticipated benefits or value may not materialize, our acquisitions and investments may adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
the loss of key personnel, including talent, could disrupt the management or operations of the company's business and adversely affect its revenues.
the company's business depends upon the continued efforts, abilities and expertise of its chairman k. rupert murdoch and executive chairman and chief executive officer lachlan k. murdoch, and other key employees and news, sports and entertainment personalities. the company believes that the unique combination of skills and experience possessed by its executive officers would be difficult to replace and that the loss of its executive officers could have a material adverse effect on the company, including the impairment of the company's ability to execute successfully its business strategy. additionally, the company employs or independently contracts with several news, sports and entertainment personalities with significant, loyal audiences. news, sports and entertainment personalities are sometimes significantly responsible for the ranking of programming on a television station or cable network and, therefore, a significant influence on the ability of the station or network to sell advertising. the company's broadcast television stations and cable networks deliver programming with highly regarded on-air talent who are important to attracting and retaining audiences for the distributed news, sports and entertainment content. there can be no assurance that these news, sports and entertainment personalities will remain with us or retain their current appeal, or that the costs associated with retaining this and new talent will be favorable or acceptable to us. if the company fails to retain or attract these personalities and talent or they lose their current audiences or advertising partners, the company's business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.
24
labor disputes involving our own employees or those at businesses we depend on may disrupt our operations and adversely affect the company's business, financial condition and results of operations.
in a variety of the company's businesses, the company and its partners engage the services of trade employees and others who are subject to collective bargaining agreements. if the company or its partners are unable to renew expiring collective bargaining agreements, the affected unions could take action in the form of strikes or work stoppages. such actions, as well as higher costs in connection with these collective bargaining agreements or a significant labor dispute, could have an adverse effect on the company's business by causing delays in production or reducing profit margins. moreover, the company has certain collective bargaining agreements, which are industry-wide agreements, and the company may lack practical control over the negotiations and terms of the agreements in dispute.
in addition, our broadcast television and cable networks have programming rights agreements of varying scope and duration with various sports leagues to broadcast and produce sports events, including certain college football and basketball, nfl and mlb games. any labor disputes that occur in any sports league for which we have the rights to broadcast live games or events may preclude us from airing or otherwise distributing scheduled games or events, resulting in decreased revenues, which could adversely affect our business, revenue and results of operations.
the company could suffer losses due to asset impairment charges for goodwill, intangible assets and programming.
the company performs an annual impairment assessment of its recorded goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets, including fcc licenses. the company also continually evaluates whether current factors or indicators, such as the prevailing conditions in the capital markets, require the performance of an interim impairment assessment of those assets, as well as other investments and other long-lived assets. any significant shortfall, now or in the future, in advertising revenue and/or the expected popularity of our programming could lead to a downward revision in the fair value of certain reporting units. a downward revision in the fair value of a reporting unit, indefinite-lived intangible assets, programming rights, investments or long-lived assets could result in a non-cash impairment charge. any such charge could be material to the company's reported net earnings.
risks relating to cybersecurity, piracy, privacy and data protection the degradation, failure or misuse of the company's network and information systems and other technology could cause a disruption of services or improper disclosure of personal data or other confidential information, resulting in increased costs, liabilities or loss of revenue.
cloud services, content delivery and other networks, information systems and other technologies that we or our vendors or other partners use, including technology systems used in connection with the production and distribution of our content (the "systems"), are critical to our business activities, and shutdowns or disruptions of, and cybersecurity attacks on, the systems pose increasing risks. disruptions to the systems, such as computer hacking and phishing, theft, computer viruses, ransomware, worms or other destructive software, process breakdowns, denial of service attacks or other malicious activities, as well as power outages, natural or other disasters (including extreme weather), terrorist activities or human error, may affect the systems and could result in disruption of our services, misappropriation, misuse, alteration, theft, loss, leakage, falsification, and accidental or premature release or improper disclosure of confidential or other information, including intellectual property and personal data (of third parties, employees and users of our streaming services and other digital properties) contained on the systems. while we continue to develop, implement and maintain security measures seeking to prevent unauthorized access to or misuse of the systems, such efforts are costly, require ongoing monitoring and updating and may not be successful in preventing these events from occurring given that the techniques used to access, disable or degrade service or sabotage systems change frequently and become more sophisticated and targeted. in addition, the company's recovery and business continuity plans may not be adequate to address any cybersecurity incidents that occur. the company's high profile sports and entertainment programming and its extensive news coverage of elections, sociopolitical events and public controversies subject us to heightened cybersecurity risks. although no cybersecurity incident has been material to the company's businesses to date, we expect to continue to be subject to cybersecurity threats and there can be no assurance that we will not experience a material incident. any cybersecurity incidents could result in a disruption of our operations, customer or advertiser dissatisfaction, damage to our reputation or brands, regulatory investigations, claims, lawsuits or loss of customers or revenue, and the company may also be subject to liability under relevant contractual obligations and laws and regulations protecting personal data and may be required to expend significant resources to defend, remedy and/or address any incidents. the company may not have adequate insurance coverage to compensate it for any losses that may occur.
25
technological developments may increase the threat of content piracy and signal theft and limit the company's ability to protect its intellectual property rights.
content piracy and signal theft present a threat to the company's revenues from products and services, including television shows, cable and other programming. the company seeks to limit the threat of content piracy as well as cable and direct broadcast satellite programming signal theft; however, policing unauthorized use of the company's products and services and related intellectual property is often difficult and the steps taken by the company may not in every case prevent infringement. developments in technology, including digital copying, file compression technology, growing penetration of high-bandwidth internet connections, increased availability and speed of mobile data networks, and new devices and applications that enable unauthorized access to content, increase the threat of content piracy by making it easier to access, duplicate, widely distribute and store high-quality pirated material. in addition, developments in software or devices that circumvent encryption technology and the falling prices of devices incorporating such technologies increase the threat of unauthorized use and distribution of direct broadcast satellite programming signals and the proliferation of user-generated content sites and live and stored video streaming sites, which deliver unauthorized copies of copyrighted content, including those emanating from other countries in various languages, may adversely impact the company's businesses. the proliferation of unauthorized distribution and use of the company's content could have an adverse effect on the company's businesses and profitability because it reduces the revenue that the company could potentially receive from the legitimate sale and distribution of its products and services.
the company takes a variety of actions to combat piracy and signal theft, both individually and, in some instances, together with industry associations, but the protection of the company's intellectual property rights depends on the scope and duration of the company's rights as defined by applicable laws in the u.s. and abroad and how those laws are construed. if those laws are interpreted in ways that limit the extent or duration of the company's rights or if existing laws are changed, the company's ability to generate revenue from intellectual property may decrease or the cost of obtaining and enforcing our rights may increase. a change in the laws of one jurisdiction may also have an impact on the company's overall ability to protect its intellectual property rights across other jurisdictions. the company's efforts to enforce its rights and protect its products, services and intellectual property may not be successful in preventing content piracy or signal theft. further, while piracy and the proliferation of piracy-enabling technology tools continue to escalate, if any laws intended to combat piracy and protect intellectual property are repealed, weakened or not adequately enforced, or if the applicable legal systems fail to evolve and adapt to new technologies that facilitate piracy, we may be unable to effectively protect our rights and the value of our intellectual property may be negatively impacted, and our costs of enforcing our rights could increase.
the company is subject to complex laws, regulations, rules, industry standards, and contractual obligations related to privacy and personal data protection, which are evolving, inconsistent and potentially costly.
we are subject to u.s. federal and state laws, as well as laws from other countries, relating to the collection, use, disclosure, and security of personal information. for example, the california consumer privacy act imposes broad obligations on businesses' collection, use, handling, and disclosure of personal information of california residents and imposes fines for noncompliance. the e.u. and other countries also have privacy and data security legislation, with significant penalties for violations, that apply to certain of the company's operations. new privacy and data protection laws continue to be introduced and interpretations of existing privacy laws, some of which may be inconsistent with one another, continue to evolve. although the company expends significant resources to comply with privacy and data protection laws, we may be subject to regulatory or other legal action despite these efforts. any such action could result in damage to our reputation or brands, loss of customers or revenue, and other negative impacts to our operations. the company may also be subject to liability under relevant contractual obligations and may be required to expend significant resources to defend, remedy and/or address any claims. the company may not have adequate insurance coverage to compensate it for any losses that may occur. for more information, see item 1, "government regulation - privacy and information regulation."
risks relating to legal and regulatory matters changes in u.s. communications laws or other regulations may have an adverse effect on the company's business, financial condition and results of operations.
the company is subject to a variety of regulations in the jurisdictions in which its businesses operate. in general, the television broadcasting and traditional mvpd industries in the u.s. are highly regulated by federal laws and regulations issued and administered by various federal agencies, including the fcc. the fcc generally regulates, among other things, the ownership of media, broadcast and multichannel video programming and technical operations of broadcast licensees. for example, the company is required to apply for and operate in compliance with licenses from the fcc to
26
operate a television station, purchase a new television station, or sell an existing television station, with licenses generally subject to an eight-year renewable term. our program services and online properties are subject to a variety of laws and regulations, including those relating to issues such as content regulation, user privacy and data protection, and consumer protection. further, the united states congress, the fcc and state legislatures currently have under consideration, and may in the future adopt, new laws, regulations and policies regarding a wide variety of matters, including technological changes and measures relating to network neutrality, privacy and data security, which could, directly or indirectly, affect the operations and ownership of the company's media properties. any restrictions on political or other advertising may adversely affect the company's advertising revenues. in addition, some policymakers maintain that traditional mvpds should be required to offer a la carte programming to subscribers on a network by network basis or "family friendly" programming tiers. unbundling packages of program services may increase both competition for carriage on distribution platforms and marketing expenses, which could adversely affect the business, financial condition and results of operations of the company's cable networks. the threat of regulatory action or increased scrutiny that deters certain advertisers from advertising or reaching their intended audiences could adversely affect advertising revenue. similarly, new federal or state laws or regulations or changes in interpretations of federal or state law or in regulations imposed by the u.s. government could require changes in the operations or ownership of our business and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.
the company may be subject to investigations or fines from governmental authorities, including under fcc rules and policies, or delays in our renewal and other applications with the fcc.
fcc rules prohibit the broadcast of obscene material at any time and indecent or profane material on television or radio broadcast stations between the hours of 6 a.m. and 10 p.m. the fcc has indicated that, in addition to issuing fines to licensees, it would consider initiating license revocation proceedings for "serious" indecency violations. we air a significant amount of live news reporting and live sports coverage on our broadcast television stations and networks and a portion of our content is under the control of our on-air talent. the company cannot predict whether information delivered by our stations and on-air talent could violate fcc rules related to indecency, which had been found to be unconstitutionally vague by the u.s. supreme court, especially given the spontaneity of live news and sports programming. violation of the fcc's indecency rules could subject us to government investigation, penalties, license revocation, or renewal or qualification proceedings, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
the communications act and fcc regulations limit the ability of non-u.s. citizens and certain other persons to invest in us.
the company owns broadcast station licensees in connection with its ownership and operation of u.s. television stations. under the communications act of 1934, as amended, which we refer to as the communications act, and the fcc rules, without the fcc's prior approval, no broadcast station licensee may be owned by a corporation if more than 25% of its stock is owned or voted by non-u.s. persons, their representatives, or by any other corporation organized under the laws of a foreign country. the company's amended and restated certificate of incorporation authorizes the board of directors to take action to prevent, cure or mitigate the effect of stock ownership above the applicable foreign ownership threshold, including: refusing to permit any transfer of common stock to or ownership of common stock by a non-u.s. stockholder; voiding a transfer of common stock to a non-u.s. stockholder; suspending rights of stock ownership if held by a non-u.s. stockholder; or redeeming common stock held by a non-u.s. stockholder. we are currently in compliance with applicable u.s. law and continue to monitor our foreign ownership based on our assessment of the information reasonably available to us, but we are not able to predict whether we will need to take action pursuant to our amended and restated certificate of incorporation. the fcc could review the company's compliance with applicable u.s. law in connection with its consideration of the company's renewal applications for licenses to operate the broadcast stations the company owns.
the failure or destruction of satellites or transmitter facilities the company depends on to distribute its programming could materially adversely affect its businesses and results of operations, as could changes in fcc regulations governing the availability and use of satellite transmission spectrum.
the company uses satellite systems to transmit its broadcast and cable networks to affiliates. the distribution facilities include uplinks, communications satellites and downlinks. transmissions may be disrupted as a result of local disasters, including extreme weather, that impair on-ground uplinks or downlinks, or as a result of an impairment of a satellite. currently, there are a limited number of communications satellites available for the transmission of programming. if a disruption occurs, failure to secure alternate distribution facilities in a timely manner could have a material adverse effect on the company's businesses and results of operations. each of the company's television stations and cable
27
networks uses studio and transmitter facilities that are subject to damage or destruction. failure to restore such facilities in a timely manner could have a material adverse effect on the company's businesses and results of operations. further, changes in fcc regulations have reduced the availability and use of satellite transmission spectrum. in 2020, the fcc began reallocating and "re-packing" a band of satellite transmission spectrum known as the "c-band" used by the television industry to transmit programming in order to free up spectrum for the next generation of commercial wireless broadband services. this has reduced the availability and use of satellite transmission spectrum for the television industry, and additional changes in fcc regulations could lead to further reductions. the decreased availability of satellite transmission spectrum could diminish the quality of and increase interference to our transmissions, which could significantly hinder the company's ability to deliver its programming to broadcast affiliates and traditional mvpds.
the company could be subject to significant tax liabilities.
we are subject to taxation in u.s. federal, state and local jurisdictions. changes in tax laws, regulations, practices or the interpretations thereof (including changes in legislation currently being considered) could affect the company's results of operations. judgment is required in evaluating and estimating our provision and accruals for taxes. in addition, transactions occur during the ordinary course of business or otherwise for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain.
tax returns are routinely audited, tax-related litigation or settlements may occur, and certain jurisdictions may assess income tax liabilities against us. the final outcomes of tax audits, investigations, and any related litigation could result in materially different tax recognition from our historical tax provisions and accruals. these outcomes could conflict with private letter rulings, opinions of counsel or other interpretations provided to the company. if these matters are adversely resolved, we may be required to recognize additional charges to our tax provisions and pay significant additional amounts with respect to current or prior periods or our taxes in the future could increase, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations.
unfavorable litigation or governmental investigation results could require us to pay significant amounts or lead to onerous operating procedures.
we are subject from time to time to a number of lawsuits, including claims relating to competition, intellectual property rights, employment and labor matters, personal injury and property damage, free speech, customer privacy, regulatory requirements, and advertising, marketing and selling practices. greater constraints on the use of arbitration to resolve certain of these disputes could adversely affect our business. we also spend substantial resources complying with various regulatory and government standards, including any related investigations and litigation. we may incur significant expenses defending any such suit or government charge and may be required to pay amounts or otherwise change our operations in ways that could adversely impact our businesses, results of operations or financial condition.
risks relating to our ownership structure certain of the company's directors and officers may have actual or potential conflicts of interest because of their equity ownership in news corp or because they also serve as officers and/or on the board of directors of news corp.
certain of the company's directors and executive officers own shares of common stock of news corporation, which we refer to as news corp, and the individual holdings may be significant for some of these individuals compared to their total assets. in addition, certain of the company's officers and directors also serve as officers and/or as directors of news corp, including our chairman, k. rupert murdoch, who serves as news corp's executive chairman, and our executive chairman and chief executive officer, lachlan k. murdoch, who serves as news corp's co-chairman. this ownership of or service to both companies may create, or may create the appearance of, conflicts of interest when these directors and officers are faced with decisions that could have different implications for news corp and the company. in addition to any other arrangements that the company and news corp may agree to implement, the company and news corp have agreed that officers and directors who serve at both companies will recuse themselves from decisions where conflicts arise due to their positions at both companies.
our amended and restated by-laws acknowledge that our directors and officers, as well as certain of our stockholders, including k. rupert murdoch, certain members of his family and certain family trusts (so long as such persons continue to own, in the aggregate, 10% or more of the voting stock of each of news corp and the company), each of which we refer to as a covered stockholder, are or may become stockholders, directors, officers, employees or agents of news corp and certain of its affiliates. our amended and restated by-laws provide that any such overlapping
28
person will not be liable to us, or to any of our stockholders, for breach of any fiduciary duty that would otherwise exist because such individual directs a corporate opportunity to news corp instead of us. the provisions in our amended and restated by-laws could result in an overlapping person submitting any corporate opportunities to news corp instead of us.
certain provisions of the company's amended and restated certificate of incorporation, amended and restated by-laws, delaware law, the company's stockholder rights agreement and the ownership of the company's common stock by the murdoch family trust may discourage takeovers and the concentration of ownership will affect the voting results of matters submitted for stockholder approval.
the company's amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated by-laws contain certain anti-takeover provisions that may make more difficult or expensive a tender offer, change in control, or takeover attempt that is opposed by the company's board of directors or certain stockholders holding a significant percentage of the voting power of the company's outstanding voting stock. in particular, the amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated by-laws provide for, among other things:
•   a dual class common equity capital structure, in which holders of fox class a common stock can vote only in very specific, limited circumstances;

•   a prohibition on stockholders taking any action by written consent without a meeting (unless there are three record holders or fewer);

•   special stockholders' meeting to be called only by a majority of the board of directors, the chairman or vice or deputy chairman, or upon the written request of holders of not less than 20% of the voting power of our outstanding voting stock;

•   the requirement that stockholders give the company advance notice to nominate candidates for election to the board of directors or to make stockholder proposals at a stockholders' meeting;

•   the requirement of an affirmative vote of at least 65% of the voting power of the company's outstanding voting stock to amend or repeal our amended and restated by-laws;

•   restrictions on the transfer of the company's shares; and

•   the board of directors to issue, without stockholder approval, preferred stock and series common stock with such terms as the board of directors may determine.

these provisions could discourage potential acquisition proposals and could delay or prevent a change in control of the company, even in the case where a majority of the stockholders may consider such proposals desirable.
further, as a result of his ability to appoint certain members of the board of directors of the corporate trustee of the murdoch family trust, which beneficially owns less than one percent of the outstanding fox class a common stock and 40.6% of fox class b common stock, k. rupert murdoch may be deemed to be a beneficial owner of the shares beneficially owned by the murdoch family trust. k. rupert murdoch, however, disclaims any beneficial ownership of these shares. also, k. rupert murdoch beneficially owns or may be deemed to beneficially own an additional less than one percent of fox class b common stock and 1.5% of fox class a common stock. thus, k. rupert murdoch may be deemed to beneficially own in the aggregate 1.5% of fox class a common stock and 41.2% of fox class b common stock.
this concentration of voting power could discourage third parties from making proposals involving an acquisition of the company. additionally, the ownership concentration of fox class b common stock by the murdoch family trust increases the likelihood that proposals submitted for stockholder approval that are supported by the murdoch family trust will be adopted and proposals that the murdoch family trust does not support will not be adopted, whether or not such proposals to stockholders are also supported by the other holders of fox class b common stock. furthermore, the adoption of the stockholder rights agreement prevents, unless the company's board of directors otherwise determines at the time, other potential stockholders from acquiring a similar ownership position in the company's class b common stock and, accordingly, could prevent a meaningful challenge to the murdoch family trust's influence over matters submitted for stockholder approval.
the company's board of directors has approved a $4 billion stock repurchase program for the fox class a common stock and fox class b common stock, which could increase the percentage of fox class b common stock held by the murdoch family trust. the company has entered into a stockholders agreement with the murdoch family trust pursuant to which the company and the murdoch family trust have agreed not to take actions that would result in the
29
murdoch family trust and murdoch family members together owning more than 44% of the outstanding voting power of the shares of fox class b common stock or would increase the murdoch family trust's voting power by more than 1.75% in any rolling 12-month period. the murdoch family trust would forfeit votes to the extent necessary to ensure that the murdoch family trust and the murdoch family collectively do not exceed 44% of the outstanding voting power of the class b shares, except where a murdoch family member votes their own shares differently from the murdoch family trust on any matter.
risks related to the company's separation from 21cf the company may be unable to achieve some or all of the benefits it expects to achieve as a standalone, publicly traded company.
following the transaction, the company may be more susceptible to market fluctuations and other adverse events than the company would have otherwise been while it was still part of 21cf. as part of 21cf, the company enjoyed certain benefits from 21cf's scale, operating diversity and access to capital, which are no longer available. as a standalone, publicly traded company, we expect to benefit from, among other things, sharpened focus on the financial and operational resources of the company's businesses, which allows management to design and implement a capital structure, corporate strategies and policies that are based primarily on the business characteristics and strategic opportunities of the fox businesses. we believe this will allow us to respond more effectively to industry dynamics and to create effective incentives for management and employees that are more closely tied to fox's business performance. if we fail to achieve some or all of the benefits that we expect to achieve as a standalone, publicly traded company or such benefits are delayed, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected. as a result of the separation, the company is in the process of completing an upgrade to its systems, including information technology. if the company is unable to successfully complete the upgrade to its systems, the company's ability to comply with its financial reporting requirements and other rules applicable to public companies could be impaired and the company's business, financial condition or results of operations could be adversely affected.
the company has a limited operating history as a standalone, publicly traded company, and the company's historical financial information for periods prior to the date of the transaction is not necessarily representative of the results the company would have achieved as a standalone, publicly traded company and may not be a reliable indicator of the company's future results.
the company derived the historical financial information for periods prior to the date of the transaction (the "pre-transaction periods") from 21cf's consolidated financial statements, and this information does not necessarily reflect the results of operations and financial position the company would have achieved as a standalone, publicly traded company during the pre-transaction periods presented, or those that it will achieve in the future. this is primarily because of the following factors:
•   prior to the transaction, the company operated as part of 21cf's broader corporate organization, and 21cf provided various corporate services for the company, including information technology, tax administration, treasury activities, accounting, benefits administration, legal and ethics and compliance program administration. the company's historical financial information for the pre-transaction periods reflects allocations of corporate expenses from 21cf for these and similar services. these allocations may not reflect the costs the company currently incurs, and will incur in the future, resulting from changes associated with the company's establishment as a standalone, publicly traded company, including changes in its cost structure, personnel needs, tax structure, financing and business operations.

•   the company entered into transactions with 21cf that did not exist prior to the transaction, including transition services, which caused the company to incur new costs.

•   in addition, the company may incur increased costs as a result of the loss of synergies the company previously enjoyed by operating as part of 21cf. following the transaction, the company has been responsible for the additional costs associated with being a standalone, publicly traded company, including costs related to corporate governance, investor and public relations and public reporting.

therefore, the company's historical financial statements relating to the pre-transaction periods may not be indicative of the company's performance as a standalone, publicly traded company.
30
the indemnification arrangements the company entered into with 21cf in connection with the transaction may require the company to divert cash to satisfy indemnification obligations to 21cf. the indemnification from 21cf may not be sufficient to insure the company against the full amount of liabilities that have been allocated to 21cf.
pursuant to the agreements the company and 21cf entered into in connection with the transaction, 21cf will indemnify the company for certain liabilities and the company will indemnify 21cf for certain liabilities. payments pursuant to these indemnities may be significant and could negatively impact our business. third parties could also seek to hold the company responsible for any of the liabilities of the businesses that were retained by 21cf in connection with the transaction. 21cf has agreed to indemnify the company for such liabilities, but such indemnity from 21cf may not be sufficient to protect the company against the full amount of such liabilities, and 21cf may not be able to fully satisfy its indemnification obligations. moreover, even if the company ultimately succeeds in recovering from 21cf any amounts for which it is held liable, the company may be temporarily required to bear these losses itself. each of these risks could negatively affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
the company could be liable for income taxes owed by 21cf.
each member of the 21cf consolidated group, which, prior to the transaction, included 21cf, the company and 21cf's other subsidiaries, is jointly and severally liable for the u.s. federal income and, in certain jurisdictions, state tax liabilities of each other member of the consolidated group for periods prior to and including the transaction. consequently, the company could be liable in the event any such liability is incurred, and not discharged, by any other member of what was previously the 21cf consolidated group. the tax matters agreement entered into in connection with the transaction requires 21cf and/or disney to indemnify the company for any such liability. disputes or assessments could arise during future audits by the taxing authorities in amounts that the company cannot quantify.

item 7.   management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations

readers should carefully review this document and the other documents filed by fox corporation ("fox" or the "company") with the securities and exchange commission (the "sec"). this section should be read together with the consolidated and combined financial statements and related notes appearing elsewhere in this annual report on form 10-k. the consolidated and combined financial statements are referred to as the "financial statements" herein.
introduction the distribution on march 19, 2019, the company became a standalone publicly traded company through the pro rata distribution by twenty-first century fox, inc. (now known as tfcf corporation) ("21cf") of all of the issued and outstanding common stock of fox to 21cf stockholders (other than holders that were subsidiaries of 21cf) (the "distribution") in accordance with the amended and restated distribution agreement and plan of merger, dated as of june 20, 2018, by and between 21cf and 21cf distribution merger sub, inc. following the distribution, 354 million and 266 million shares of the company's class a common stock, par value $0.01 per share (the "class a common stock"), and class b common stock, par value $0.01 per share (the "class b common stock" and, together with the class a common stock, the "common stock"), respectively, began trading independently on the nasdaq global select market. in connection with the distribution, the company entered into the separation and distribution agreement, dated as of march 19, 2019 (the "separation agreement"), with 21cf, which effected the internal restructuring (the "separation") whereby 21cf transferred to fox a portfolio of 21cf's news, sports and broadcast businesses, including fox news media (consisting of fox news and fox business), fox entertainment, fox sports, fox television stations, and sports cable networks fs1, fs2, fox deportes and big ten network, and certain other assets, and fox assumed from 21cf the liabilities associated with such businesses and certain other liabilities. the separation and the distribution were effected as part of a series of transactions contemplated by the amended and restated merger agreement and plan of merger, dated as of june 20, 2018 (the "21cf disney merger agreement"), by and among 21cf, the walt disney company ("disney") and certain subsidiaries of disney, pursuant to which, among other things, 21cf became a wholly-owned subsidiary of disney.
pursuant to the 21cf disney merger agreement, immediately prior to the distribution, the company paid to 21cf a dividend in the amount of $8.5 billion (the "dividend"). the final determination of the taxes in respect of the separation and the distribution for which the company is responsible pursuant to the 21cf disney merger agreement and a prepayment of the estimated taxes in respect of divestitures (collectively, the "transaction tax") was $6.5 billion. following the distribution, on march 20, 2019 the company received a cash payment in the amount of $2.0 billion from disney, which had the net effect of reducing the dividend the company paid to 21cf. the transaction tax included a prepayment of the company's share of the estimated tax liabilities resulting from the anticipated divestitures by disney of certain assets, principally the fox sports regional sports networks ("rsns"), which were sold by disney during calendar year 2019. this prepayment was in the amount of approximately $700 million and is subject to adjustment in the future, when the actual amounts of all such tax liabilities are reported on the federal income tax returns of disney or a subsidiary of disney. any such adjustment is not expected to have a material impact on the results of the company. during the first quarter of fiscal 2021, the company and disney reached an agreement to settle the majority of the prepaid divestiture tax and the company received $462 million from disney as reimbursement of the company's prepayment based upon the sales price of the rsns. this reimbursement was recorded in other, net in the statement of operations (see note 21-additional financial information to the accompanying financial statements under the heading "other, net").
as a result of the separation and the distribution, which was a taxable transaction for which the estimated tax liability of $5.8 billion was included in the transaction tax paid by the company, fox obtained a tax basis in its assets equal to their respective fair market values. this resulted in estimated annual tax deductions of approximately $1.5 billion, principally over the next several years related to the amortization of the additional tax basis. this amortization is estimated to reduce the company's annual cash tax liability by $370 million per year at the current combined federal and state applicable tax rate of approximately 25%. such estimates are subject to revisions, which could be material, based upon the occurrence of future events including, among other things, a refund of the prepayment discussed above.
in connection with the separation, the company entered into several agreements that govern certain aspects of the company's relationship with 21cf and disney following the separation. these include the separation agreement, a tax matters agreement, transition services agreements, as well as agreements relating to intellectual property licenses, employee matters, commercial arrangements and the fox studio lot lease. the core transition services agreements will
35
terminate in accordance with their terms by september 2021. see note 1-description of business and basis of presentation to the accompanying financial statements under the heading "the distribution" for additional information.
basis of presentation the company's financial statements as of and for the years ended june 30, 2021 and 2020 are presented on a consolidated basis. the company's consolidated financial statements for the years ended june 30, 2021 and 2020 reflect the company's results of operations and cash flows as a standalone company, and the company's consolidated balance sheets as of june 30, 2021 and 2020 consist of the company's consolidated balances.
prior to the distribution, which occurred on march 19, 2019, the company's combined financial statements were prepared on a standalone basis, derived from the consolidated financial statements and accounting records of 21cf. these financial statements reflect the combined historical results of operations, financial position and cash flows of 21cf's domestic news, national sports and broadcast businesses and certain other assets and liabilities associated with such businesses.
the consolidated and combined statements of operations for the year ended june 30, 2019 include, for the periods prior to march 19, 2019, allocations for certain support functions that were provided on a centralized basis within 21cf prior to the distribution and not recorded at the business unit level, such as certain expenses related to finance, legal, insurance, information technology, compliance and human resources management activities, among others. 21cf did not routinely allocate these costs to any of its business units. these expenses were allocated to fox on the basis of direct usage when identifiable, with the remainder allocated on a pro rata basis of combined revenues, headcount or other relevant measures. management believes the assumptions underlying the financial statements, including the assumptions regarding allocating general corporate expenses from 21cf, are reasonable. nevertheless, the financial statements may not include all of the actual expenses that would have been incurred by fox and may not reflect fox's consolidated results of operations, financial position and cash flows had it been a standalone company during the entirety of the periods presented. actual costs that would have been incurred if fox had been a standalone company would depend on multiple factors, including organizational structure and strategic decisions made in various areas, including information technology and infrastructure.
management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is intended to help provide an understanding of the company's financial condition, changes in financial condition and results of operations. this discussion is organized as follows:
•   overview of the company's business-this section provides a general description of the company's businesses, as well as developments that occurred either during the fiscal year ended june 30, ("fiscal") 2021 or early fiscal 2022 that the company believes are important in understanding its results of operations and financial condition or to disclose known trends.

•   results of operations-this section provides an analysis of the company's results of operations for fiscal 2021, 2020 and 2019. this analysis is presented on both a consolidated/combined and a segment basis. in addition, a brief description is provided of significant transactions and events that impact the comparability of the results being analyzed.

•   liquidity and capital resources-this section provides an analysis of the company's cash flows for fiscal 2021, 2020 and 2019, as well as a discussion of the company's outstanding debt and commitments, both firm and contingent, that existed as of june 30, 2021. included in the discussion of outstanding debt is a discussion of the amount of financial capacity available to fund the company's future commitments and obligations, as well as a discussion of other financing arrangements.

•   critical accounting policies-this section discusses accounting policies considered important to the company's financial condition and results of operations, and which require significant judgment and estimates on the part of management in application. in addition, note 2-summary of significant accounting policies to the accompanying financial statements summarizes the company's significant accounting policies, including the critical accounting policy discussion found in this section.

•   caution concerning forward-looking statements-this section provides a description of the use of forward-looking information appearing in this annual report on form 10-k, including in management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations. such information is based on management's current expectations about future events which are subject to change and to inherent risks and uncertainties. refer to item 1a. "risk factors" in this annual report for a discussion of the risk factors applicable to the company.

overview of the company's business the company is a news, sports and entertainment company, which manages and reports its businesses in the following segments:
•   cable network programming, which principally consists of the production and licensing of news and sports content distributed primarily through traditional cable television systems, direct broadcast satellite operators and telecommunication companies ("traditional mvpds") and online multi-channel video programming distributors ("digital mvpds"), primarily in the u.s.

•   television, which principally consists of the production, acquisition, marketing and distribution of broadcast network programming and free advertising-supported video-on-demand ("avod") services under the fox and tubi brands, respectively, and the operation of 29 full power broadcast television stations, including 11 duopolies, in the u.s. of these stations, 18 are affiliated with the fox network, 10 are affiliated with mynetworktv and one is an independent station.

•   other, corporate and eliminations, which principally consists of the fox studio lot, credible labs inc. ("credible"), corporate overhead costs and intracompany eliminations. the fox studio lot, located in los angeles, california, provides television and film production services along with office space, studio operation services and includes all operations of the facility. credible is a u.s. consumer finance marketplace.

the company's cable network programming and television segments derive the majority of their revenues from affiliate fees for the transmission of content and advertising sales. for fiscal 2021, the company generated revenues of $12.9 billion, of which approximately 50% was generated from affiliate fees, approximately 42% was generated from advertising, and approximately 8% was generated from other operating activities.
affiliate fees primarily include (i) monthly subscriber-based license and retransmission consent fees paid by programming distributors that carry our cable networks and our owned and operated television stations and (ii) fees received from non-owned and operated television stations that are affiliated with the fox network. u.s. law governing retransmission consent provides a mechanism for the television stations owned by the company to seek and obtain payment from traditional mvpds that carry the company's broadcast signals.
the company's revenues are impacted by rate changes, changes in the number of subscribers to the company's content and changes in the expenditures by advertisers. in addition, advertising revenues are subject to seasonality and cyclicality as a result of the impact of state, congressional and presidential elections cycles and special events that air on the company's networks, including the national football league's ("nfl") super bowl, which is broadcast on the fox network on a rotating basis with other networks, and the fédération internationale de football association ("fifa") world cup, which occurs every four years (for each of women and men), and other regular and post-season sports events, including one nfl divisional playoff game that is aired on a rotating annual basis with another network.
the cable network programming and television industries continue to evolve rapidly, with changes in technology leading to alternative methods for the delivery and storage of digital content. these technological advancements have driven changes in consumer behavior as consumers seek more control over when, where and how they consume content. consumer preferences have evolved toward alternative offerings, such as subscription video-on-demand ("svod") services, avod services, mobile and social media platforms. these changes in technologies and consumer behavior have contributed to declines in the number of subscribers to traditional mvpd services, and these declines are expected to continue and possibly accelerate in the future.
at the same time, technological changes have affected advertisers' options for reaching their target audiences. there has been a substantial increase in the availability of programming with reduced advertising or without advertising at all. as consumers switch to digital consumption of video content, there is still to be developed a consistent, broadly accepted measure of multiplatform audiences across the industry. furthermore, the pricing and volume of advertising may be affected by shifts in spending from more traditional media and toward digital and mobile offerings, which can deliver targeted advertising more promptly, or toward newer ways of purchasing advertising.
the company operates in a highly competitive industry and its performance is dependent, to a large extent, on the impact of changes in consumer behavior as a result of new technologies, the sale of advertising, the maintenance, renewal and terms of its carriage, affiliation and content agreements and programming rights, the popularity of its content, general economic conditions (including financial market conditions), the company's ability to manage its businesses effectively, and its relative strength and leverage in the industry. for more information, see item 1. "business" and item 1a. "risk factors" included herein.

impact of covid-19
the coronavirus disease 2019 ("covid-19") pandemic has resulted in widespread and continuing negative impacts on the macroeconomic environment and disruption to the company's business. weak economic conditions and increased volatility and disruption in the financial markets pose risks to the company and its business partners, including advertisers whose expenditures tend to reflect overall economic conditions. although the covid-19 pandemic did not cause a significant reduction in the company's advertisers' spending in fiscal 2021, future declines in the economic prospects of advertisers or the economy in general could negatively impact their advertising expenditures further. to date, the company has not experienced meaningful subscriber declines due to the weak economic environment associated with the pandemic. however, there could be industry-wide changes in consumer behavior that result from the weak economic environment or the resumption of ordinary activities as the economy recovers, such as increasing numbers of consumers canceling or foregoing subscriptions to mvpd services, that could adversely affect the company's affiliate fee and advertising revenues. in addition, the company's business depends on the volume and popularity of the content it distributes, particularly sports content. as a result of the covid-19 pandemic, there have been cancellations or postponements of live sports events to which the company has broadcast rights and suspensions of the production of certain entertainment content. these content disruptions have adversely affected the company's advertising and affiliate fee revenues and there could be additional adverse impacts on its advertising or affiliate fee revenues in the future. to the extent the covid-19 or other pandemic further negatively impacts the timing of or the company's ability to air sports events, particularly major league baseball ("mlb"), nfl or college sports, it could result in a significantly greater adverse effect on the company's business, financial condition or results of operations than the company has experienced thus far.
other business developments in march 2021, the company reached a new and expanded media rights agreement with the nfl that runs through the 2033 season. the 11-year agreement extends fox sports' coverage of premier nfc games, creates new and exclusive holiday games on the fox network, and expands fox's digital rights to enable future direct-to-consumer opportunities as well as nfl programming on fox's avod service tubi.
results of operations results of operations-fiscal 2021 versus fiscal 2020

overview-the company's revenues increased 5% for fiscal 2021, as compared to fiscal 2020, as higher affiliate fee and advertising revenues were partially offset by lower other revenue. the increase in affiliate fee revenue was primarily attributable to higher average rates due to rate increases from affiliate agreement renewals and contractual rate increases on existing affiliate agreements, partially offset by the impact of a lower average number of subscribers and estimated affiliate fee credits provided as a result of cancelled live college football games due to covid-19. the increase in advertising revenue was primarily due to the impact of the consolidation of tubi inc. ("tubi"), which experienced record viewership and record advertising revenue, higher political advertising revenue at the fox television stations related to the 2020 presidential and congressional elections, higher linear and digital advertising revenue from the 2020 presidential election coverage at fox news media, and the rotating broadcast of one additional nfl divisional playoff game, partially offset by the comparative effect of the broadcast of the nfl's super bowl liv in february 2020 (the "super bowl") and lower ratings at the fox network due in part to covid-19-impacted schedules in the current year.
operating expenses increased 3% for fiscal 2021, as compared to fiscal 2020, primarily due to the impact of the consolidation of tubi, partially offset by lower sports programming rights amortization and production costs, including the absence of the broadcast of the super bowl in the current year and the cancellation of live college football games, and lower entertainment programming rights amortization due to fewer hours of original scripted programming as a result of covid-19. partially offsetting lower sports programming rights amortization and production costs were contractual rate increases for nfl, mlb and college football content, the rotating broadcast of one additional nfl divisional playoff game and a higher volume of national association of stock car auto racing ("nascar") races due to fewer races following the covid-19-impacted schedule in the prior year.
selling, general and administrative expenses increased 4% for fiscal 2021, as compared to fiscal 2020, primarily due to higher legal and marketing expenses and the impact of acquisitions that occurred in fiscal 2020 (the "fiscal 2020 acquisitions") (see note 3-acquisitions, disposals and other transactions to the accompanying financial statements), partially offset by lower professional fees, lower bad debt expense and lower marketing costs associated with the absence of the super bowl in the current year.
depreciation and amortization-depreciation and amortization expense increased 16% for fiscal 2021, as compared to fiscal 2020, primarily due to assets placed into service as the company transitioned from service agreements in connection with the separation (as defined in note 1-description of business and basis of presentation to the accompanying financial statements under the heading "the distribution") and the fiscal 2020 acquisitions.
impairment and restructuring charges-see note 4-restructuring programs to the accompanying financial statements.
interest expense-interest expense increased 7% for fiscal 2021 as compared to fiscal 2020, primarily due to the issuance of $1.2 billion of senior notes in april 2020 (see note 9-borrowings to the accompanying financial statements under the heading "public debt - senior notes issued" for additional information).
interest income-interest income decreased for fiscal 2021, as compared to fiscal 2020, primarily due to lower interest rates.
other, net-see note 21-additional financial information to the accompanying financial statements under the heading "other, net."
income tax expense-the company's tax provision and related effective tax rate of 25% for fiscal 2021 was higher than the statutory rate of 21% primarily due to state taxes, partially offset by a benefit from the reduction of uncertain tax positions for state tax audits. the company's tax provision and related effective tax rate of 27% for fiscal 2020 was higher than the statutory rate of 21% primarily due to state taxes and other permanent items. see note 16-income taxes to the accompanying financial statements.
net income-net income increased $1.1 billion for fiscal 2021 as compared to fiscal 2020, primarily due the receipt of the $462 million reimbursement from disney related to the divestiture tax (see note 1-description of business and basis of presentation to the accompanying financial statements), higher segment ebitda (as defined below) at the cable network programming and television segments and higher net gains on investments in equity securities (see note 21-additional financial information to the accompanying financial statements under the heading "other, net"), partially offset by lower restructuring charges due to the contract termination costs related to a programming rights agreement with the united states golf association ("usga") in the prior year (see note 4-restructuring programs to the accompanying financial statements under the heading "fiscal 2020") and higher income tax expense.

overview-the company's revenues increased 8% for fiscal 2020, as compared to fiscal 2019, due to higher affiliate fee, advertising and other revenues. the increase in affiliate fee revenue was primarily due to higher average rates per subscriber and higher fees received from television stations that are affiliated with the fox network, partially offset by the impact of a lower average number of subscribers. the increase in advertising revenue was primarily due to the broadcast of the super bowl, higher pricing and higher digital advertising revenue, including the impact of the consolidation of tubi, partially offset by the impact of covid-19 (including a decline in the local advertising market and the postponement of live sports events), lower political advertising revenue at the fox television stations due to the u.s. midterm elections in november 2018, the effect of fewer broadcasts of fifa world cup events and one less nfl divisional playoff game. the increase in other revenues was primarily due to the impact of the consolidation of bento box entertainment, llc ("bento box") and credible in fiscal 2020 and revenues generated from the operation of the fox studio lot for third parties.
operating expenses increased 7% for fiscal 2020, as compared to fiscal 2019, primarily due to higher sports programming rights amortization and production costs at the television segment, including super bowl costs, the impact of the fiscal 2020 acquisitions, the recognition of a write-down of approximately $95 million related to programming rights as compared to approximately $55 million in the prior year (see note 5-inventories, net to the accompanying financial statements) and higher broadcast costs related to operating as a standalone public company. partially offsetting the increase in operating expenses was the broadcast of fewer sports events as a result of covid-19, fewer broadcasts of fifa world cup events and one less nfl divisional playoff game.
selling, general and administrative expenses increased 23% for fiscal 2020, as compared to fiscal 2019, primarily due to higher costs in fiscal 2020 related to operating as a standalone public company as compared to a partial year of allocated costs in fiscal 2019 (see note 1-description of business and basis of presentation to the accompanying financial statements under the heading "basis of presentation" for additional information), a full year of costs of operating the fox studio lot for third parties, increased bad debt expense and the impact of the consolidation of bento box and credible. also contributing to the increase in selling, general and administrative expenses in fiscal 2020 were incremental equity-based compensation costs of approximately $40 million related to the grant of restricted stock units and stock options in connection with the distribution under the fox corporation 2019 shareholder alignment plan (see note 12-equity-based compensation to the accompanying financial statements).
40
depreciation and amortization-depreciation and amortization expense increased 22% for fiscal 2020, as compared to fiscal 2019, primarily due to higher costs in fiscal 2020 related to operating as a standalone public company following the distribution as compared to a partial year of allocated costs in fiscal 2019 and the impact of the fiscal 2020 acquisitions.
impairment and restructuring charges-see note 4-restructuring programs to the accompanying financial statements.
interest expense-interest expense increased 82% for fiscal 2020, as compared to fiscal 2019, primarily due to the issuance of $6.8 billion of senior notes in january 2019 and $1.2 billion of senior notes in april 2020, partially offset by the effect of the bridge credit agreement commitment letter which was entered into in december 2017, including the write-off of unamortized costs as a result of the termination of the bridge credit agreement in march 2019 (see note 9-borrowings to the accompanying financial statements).
other, net-see note 21-additional financial information to the accompanying financial statements under the heading "other, net."
income tax expense-the company's tax provision and related effective tax rate of 27% for fiscal 2020 was higher than the statutory rate of 21% primarily due to state taxes and other permanent items. the company's tax provision and related effective tax rate of 26% for fiscal 2019 was higher than the statutory rate of 21% primarily due to the impact of state taxes. see note 16-income taxes to the accompanying financial statements.
net income-net income decreased 35% for fiscal 2020, as compared to fiscal 2019, primarily due to restructuring charges at the cable network programming and television segments reflecting contract termination costs related to a programming rights agreement with the usga, higher costs in fiscal 2020 related to operating as a standalone public company, including interest expense, and lower net gains on investments in equity securities (see note 21-additional financial information to the accompanying financial statements under the heading "other, net"). partially offsetting these decreases was higher segment ebitda at the cable network programming segment and lower income tax expense.
segment analysis the company's operating segments have been determined in accordance with the company's internal management structure, which is organized based on operating activities. the company evaluates performance based upon several factors, of which the primary financial measure is segment operating income before depreciation and amortization, or segment ebitda. due to the integrated nature of these operating segments, estimates and judgments are made in allocating certain assets, revenues and expenses.
segment ebitda is defined as revenues less operating expenses and selling, general and administrative expenses. segment ebitda does not include: amortization of cable distribution investments, depreciation and amortization, impairment and restructuring charges, interest expense, interest income, other, net and income tax (expense) benefit. management believes that segment ebitda is an appropriate measure for evaluating the operating performance of the company's business segments because it is the primary measure used by the company's chief operating decision maker to evaluate the performance of and allocate resources to the company's businesses.

revenues at the cable network programming segment increased for fiscal 2021 as compared to fiscal 2020 as the increases in advertising and affiliate fee revenues were partially offset by lower other revenue. the increase in advertising revenue was primarily due to higher linear and digital advertising revenue from the 2020 presidential election coverage at fox news media. the increase in affiliate fee revenue was primarily due to rate increases from affiliate agreement renewals and contractual rate increases on existing affiliate agreements, partially offset by a lower average number of subscribers and estimated affiliate fee credits provided as a result of the cancellation of live college football games due to covid-19. the decrease in the average number of subscribers was due to a reduction in traditional mvpd subscribers, partially offset by an increase in digital mvpd subscribers. the decrease in other revenues was primarily attributable to lower sports sublicensing revenues and lower revenues generated from premier boxing champions ("pbc") pay-per-view events due in part to covid-19.

revenues at the television segment increased for fiscal 2021, as compared to fiscal 2020, due to higher affiliate fee and other revenues partially offset by lower advertising revenue. the increase in affiliate fee revenue was primarily due to higher fees received from television stations that are affiliated with the fox network and higher average rates partially offset by a lower average number of subscribers at the company's owned and operated television stations. the increase in other revenues was primarily due to higher content revenue at bento box and fox entertainment. the decrease in advertising revenue was primarily due to the comparative effect of the broadcast of the super bowl in fiscal 2020 and lower ratings at the fox network due in part to covid-19-impacted schedules partially offset by the impact of the consolidation of tubi, higher political advertising revenue at the fox television stations related to the 2020 presidential and congressional elections and the rotating broadcast of one additional nfl divisional playoff game.

revenues at the cable network programming segment increased for fiscal 2020, as compared to fiscal 2019, due to higher affiliate fee and other revenues, partially offset by lower advertising revenue. the increase in affiliate fee revenue was primarily attributable to higher average rates per subscriber, led by contractual rate increases on existing affiliate agreements and from affiliate agreement renewals, partially offset by the impact of a lower average number of subscribers. the decrease in the average number of subscribers was due to a reduction in subscribers to traditional mvpds, partially offset by an increase in digital mvpd subscribers. the decrease in advertising revenue was primarily due to the broadcast of fewer sports events, including nascar, mlb and major league soccer, and studio shows as a result of covid-19, the effect of fewer broadcasts of fifa world cup events and the absence of ultimate fighting championship ("ufc") content, partially offset by higher digital advertising revenue at fox news media. the increase in other revenues was primarily attributable to higher sports sublicensing revenue and increased revenues generated from pbc pay-per-view events at fox sports and higher revenues at fox news media.

revenues at the television segment increased for fiscal 2020, as compared to fiscal 2019, due to higher advertising, affiliate fee and other revenues. the increase in advertising revenue was primarily due to revenues resulting from the broadcast of the super bowl of approximately $500 million, including the post-game broadcast of the masked singer, higher pricing at the fox network, increased digital advertising revenue, including the impact of the consolidation of tubi, and the broadcast of two additional mlb world series games. partially offsetting the increase in advertising revenue was the impact of covid-19, including a decline in the local advertising market and the postponement of live sports events, lower political advertising revenue at the fox television stations due to the u.s. midterm elections in november 2018, lower ratings at the fox network, fewer broadcasts of fifa world cup events and one less nfl divisional playoff game. the increase in affiliate fee revenue was primarily due to higher fees received from television stations that are affiliated with the fox network and higher average rates per subscriber, partially offset by a lower average number of subscribers at the company's owned and operated television stations. the increase in other revenues was primarily due to the impact of the consolidation of bento box, partially offset by lower digital content licensing revenue at the fox network.

revenues at the other, corporate and eliminations segment increased for fiscal 2020, as compared to fiscal 2019, primarily due to a full year of revenues generated from the operation of the fox studio lot for third parties and the impact of the consolidation of credible. operating expenses increased primarily due to the consolidation of credible and a full year of costs of operating the fox studio lot for third parties. selling, general and administrative expenses increased primarily due to higher costs related to operating as a standalone public company, a full year of costs of operating the fox studio lot for third parties and the consolidation of credible.
non-gaap financial measures adjusted ebitda is defined as revenues less operating expenses and selling, general and administrative expenses. adjusted ebitda does not include: amortization of cable distribution investments, depreciation and amortization, impairment and restructuring charges, interest expense, interest income, other, net and income tax (expense) benefit.
management believes that information about adjusted ebitda assists all users of the company's financial statements by allowing them to evaluate changes in the operating results of the company's portfolio of businesses separate from non-operational factors that affect net income, thus providing insight into both operations and the other factors that affect reported results. adjusted ebitda provides management, investors and equity analysts a measure to analyze the operating performance of the company's business and its enterprise value against historical data and competitors' data, although historical results, including adjusted ebitda, may not be indicative of future results (as operating performance is highly contingent on many factors, including customer tastes and preferences and the impact of covid-19 and other widespread health emergencies or pandemics and measures to contain their spread).
adjusted ebitda is considered a non-gaap financial measure and should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for, net income, cash flow and other measures of financial performance reported in accordance with u.s. generally accepted accounting principles ("gaap"). in addition, this measure does not reflect cash available to fund requirements and excludes items, such as depreciation and amortization and impairment charges, which are significant components in assessing the company's financial performance. adjusted ebitda may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies.

liquidity and capital resources current financial condition the company's principal source of liquidity is internally generated funds which are highly dependent upon the continuation of affiliate agreements and the state of the advertising markets. to date, the company has not experienced meaningful subscriber declines due to the pandemic. however, there could be industry-wide changes in consumer behavior due to the pandemic, such as increasing numbers of consumers canceling or foregoing subscriptions to mvpd services, that could adversely affect the company's affiliate fee and advertising revenues. as a result of the covid-19 pandemic, there have been cancellations or postponements of live sports events to which the company has broadcast rights and suspensions of the production of certain entertainment content. these content disruptions have adversely affected the company's advertising and affiliate fee revenues and there could be additional adverse impacts on its advertising or affiliate fee revenues in the future. to the extent the covid-19 or other pandemic further negatively impacts the timing of or the company's ability to air sports events, particularly mlb, nfl or college sports, it could result in a significantly greater adverse effect on the company's business, financial condition or results of operations than the company has experienced thus far. the magnitude of the impact of the covid-19 pandemic on the company remains uncertain and subject to change and will depend on evolving factors the company may not be able to control or accurately predict. these include the duration and scope of the pandemic (including the extent of future surges, mutations or strains of the disease and the efficacy of vaccination and other efforts to contain the virus or treat its impact); the duration and extent of the pandemic's impact on global and regional economies and economic activity, the pace of economic recovery and the economic and operating conditions facing the company and others in the pandemic's aftermath; the effect of governmental actions that have been and may continue to be imposed in response to the pandemic; the impact of the pandemic on the health, well-being and productivity of the company's employees and the company's ability to conduct its operations; and potential changes in consumer behavior.
the company has approximately $5.9 billion of cash and cash equivalents as of june 30, 2021 and an unused five-year $1.0 billion unsecured revolving credit facility (see note 9-borrowings to the accompanying financial statements). the company also has access to the worldwide capital markets, subject to market conditions which could be impacted by covid-19. as of june 30, 2021, the company was in compliance with all of the covenants under its revolving credit facility, and it does not anticipate any noncompliance with such covenants.
the principal uses of cash that affect the company's liquidity position include the following: the acquisition of rights and related payments for entertainment and sports programming; operational expenditures including production costs; marketing and promotional expenses; expenses related to broadcasting the company's programming along with the continued investment in the company's broadcast technical facilities following the distribution; employee and facility costs; capital expenditures; acquisitions; interest and dividend payments; debt repayments; and stock repurchases.
in addition to the acquisitions, sales and possible acquisitions disclosed elsewhere, the company has evaluated, and expects to continue to evaluate, possible acquisitions and dispositions of certain businesses and assets. such transactions may be material and may involve cash, the company's securities or the assumption of additional indebtedness.

pension and other postretirement benefits and uncertain tax benefits the table above excludes the company's pension, other postretirement benefits ("opeb") obligations and the gross unrecognized tax benefits for uncertain tax positions as the company is unable to reasonably predict the ultimate amount and timing. the company made contributions of $63 million and $30 million to its direct pension plans in fiscal 2021 and 2020, respectively. the majority of these contributions were voluntarily made to improve the funded status of the plans. future plan contributions are dependent upon actual plan asset returns, interest rates and statutory requirements. assuming that actual plan asset returns are consistent with the company's expected plan returns in fiscal 2022 and beyond and that interest rates remain constant, the company would not be required to make any material contributions to its pension plans for the immediate future. required pension plan contributions for the next fiscal year are not expected to be material but the company may make voluntary contributions in future periods. payments due to participants under the company's pension plans are primarily paid out of underlying trusts. payments due under the company's opeb plans are not required to be funded in advance, but are paid as medical costs are incurred by covered retiree populations, and are principally dependent upon the future cost of retiree medical benefits under the company's opeb plans. the company does not expect its net opeb payments to be material in fiscal 2022 (see note 15-pension and other postretirement benefits to the accompanying financial statements for further discussion of the company's pension and opeb plans).
contingencies see note 14-commitments and contingencies to the accompanying financial statements under the heading "contingencies."
critical accounting policies an accounting policy is considered to be critical if it is important to the company's financial condition and results of operations and if it requires significant judgment and estimates on the part of management in its application. the development and selection of these critical accounting policies have been determined by management of the company and the related disclosures have been reviewed with the audit committee of the company's board of directors. for the company's summary of significant accounting policies, see note 2-summary of significant accounting policies to the accompanying financial statements.
use of estimates see note 2-summary of significant accounting policies to the accompanying financial statements under the heading "use of estimates."
revenue recognition revenue is recognized when control of the promised goods or services is transferred to the company's customers in an amount that reflects the consideration the company expects to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or services. the company considers the terms of each arrangement to determine the appropriate accounting treatment.
the company generates advertising revenue from sales of commercial time within the company's network programming to be aired by television networks and cable channels, and from sales of broadcast advertising time on the company's owned and operated television stations and various digital properties. advertising revenue from customers, primarily advertising agencies, is recognized as the commercials are aired. certain of the company's advertising contracts have guarantees of a certain number of targeted audience views, referred to as impressions. revenues for any audience deficiencies are deferred until the guaranteed number of impressions is met, by providing additional advertisements. advertising contracts, which are generally short-term, are billed monthly for the spots aired during the month, with payments due shortly after the invoice date.
the company generates affiliate fee revenue from affiliate agreements with traditional and digital mvpds for cable network programming and for the broadcast of the company's owned and operated television stations. in addition, the company generates affiliate fee revenue from agreements with independently owned television stations that are affiliated with the fox network and receives retransmission consent fees from traditional and digital mvpds for their signals. affiliate fee revenue is recognized at a point in time when the network programming is made available to the customer. for contracts with affiliate fees based on the number of the affiliate's subscribers, revenues are recognized based on the contractual rate multiplied by the estimated number of subscribers each period. for contracts with fixed affiliate fees, revenues are recognized based on the relative standalone selling price of the network programming provided over the
51
contract term, which generally reflects the invoiced amount. affiliate contracts are generally multi-year contracts with payments due monthly.
the company classifies the amortization of cable distribution investments against affiliate fee revenue in accordance with accounting standards codification ("asc") 606-10-32-25 through 27, "revenue recognition-consideration payable to a customer." the company defers the cable distribution investments and amortizes the amounts on a straight-line basis over the contract period.
programming costs incurred in acquiring program rights or producing programs are accounted for in accordance with asc 920, "entertainment-broadcasters." program rights and the related liabilities are recorded at the gross amount of the liabilities when the license period has begun, the cost of the program is determinable and the program is accepted and available for airing. television broadcast network entertainment programming, which includes acquired series, co-produced series, movies and other programs, are amortized primarily on an accelerated basis. management regularly reviews, and revises when necessary, its total revenue estimates on a contract basis, which may result in a change in the rate of amortization and/or a write-down of the asset to fair value.
as a result of the evaluation of the recoverability of the unamortized costs associated with the company's programming rights, the company recognized write-downs of approximately nil, $95 million and $55 million in fiscal 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively, related to sports, entertainment and syndicated programming rights at the cable network programming and television segments, which were recorded in operating expenses in the consolidated statements of operations.
the company has single and multi-year contracts for broadcast rights of programs and sports events. the costs of multi-year national sports contracts at the fox network and the company's sports channels are primarily charged to expense and allocated to segments based on the ratio of each current period's attributable revenue for each contract to the estimated total remaining attributable revenue for each contract. estimates can change and accordingly, are reviewed periodically and amortization is adjusted as necessary. such changes in the future could be material. the recoverability of certain sports rights contracts for content broadcast on the fox network and the company's sports channels is assessed on an aggregate basis.
goodwill and intangible assets the company's intangible assets include goodwill, fcc licenses, mvpd affiliate agreements and relationships and trademarks and other copyrighted products. intangible assets acquired in business combinations are recorded at their estimated fair value at the date of acquisition. goodwill is recorded as the difference between the consideration transferred to acquire entities and the estimated fair values assigned to their tangible and identifiable intangible net assets and is assigned to one or more reporting units for purposes of testing for impairment. the judgments made in determining the estimated fair value assigned to each class of intangible assets acquired, their reporting unit, as well as their useful lives can significantly impact net income.
the company accounts for its business combinations under the acquisition method of accounting. the total cost of acquisitions is allocated to the underlying net assets, based on their respective estimated fair values. the excess of the consideration transferred over the estimated fair values of the tangible net assets acquired is recorded as intangibles, including goodwill. amounts recorded as goodwill are assigned to one or more reporting units. determining the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed requires management's judgment and often involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions, including assumptions with respect to future cash inflows and outflows, discount rates, asset lives and market multiples, among other items. identifying reporting units and assigning goodwill to them requires judgment involving the aggregation of business units with similar economic characteristics and the identification of existing business units that benefit from the acquired goodwill. the company allocates goodwill to disposed businesses using the relative fair value method.
carrying values of goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives are reviewed at least annually for possible impairment in accordance with asc 350 "intangibles-goodwill and other." the company's impairment review is based on, among other methods, a discounted cash flow approach that requires significant management judgment. the company uses its judgment in assessing whether assets may have become impaired between annual valuations. indicators such as unexpected adverse economic factors, unanticipated technological change or competitive activities,
52
loss of key personnel and acts by governments and courts, may signal that an asset has become impaired and require the company to perform an interim impairment test.
the company uses direct valuation methods to value identifiable intangibles for acquisition accounting and impairment testing. the direct valuation method used for fcc licenses requires, among other inputs, the use of published industry data that are based on subjective judgments about future advertising revenues in the markets where the company owns television stations. this method also involves the use of management's judgment in estimating an appropriate discount rate reflecting the risk of a market participant in the u.s. broadcast industry. the resulting fair values for fcc licenses are sensitive to these long-term assumptions and any variations to such assumptions could result in an impairment to existing carrying values in future periods and such impairment could be material.
during fiscal 2021, the company determined that the goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets included in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet as of june 30, 2021, were not impaired. the company determined there are no reporting units with goodwill considered to be at risk and will continue to monitor its goodwill and intangible assets for possible future impairment.
see note 2-summary of significant accounting policies to the accompanying financial statements under the heading "annual impairment review" for further discussion.
income taxes the company is subject to income tax in various domestic jurisdictions. the company computes its annual tax rate based on the statutory tax rates and tax planning opportunities available to it in the various jurisdictions in which it earns income. tax laws are complex and subject to different interpretations by the taxpayer and respective governmental taxing authorities. significant judgment is required in determining the company's tax expense and in evaluating its tax positions, including evaluating uncertainties under asc 740, "income taxes."
the company records valuation allowances to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized. in making this assessment, management analyzes future taxable income, reversing temporary differences and ongoing tax planning strategies. should a change in circumstances lead to a change in judgment about the realizability of deferred tax assets in future years, the company would adjust related valuation allowances in the period that the change in circumstances occurs, along with a corresponding increase or charge to income.
employee costs the measurement and recognition of costs of the company's pension and opeb plans require the use of significant management judgments, including discount rates, expected return on plan assets and other actuarial assumptions.
the company participates in and/or sponsors various pension, savings and postretirement benefit plans. pension plans and postretirement benefit plans are closed to new participants with the exception of a small group covered by collective bargaining agreements. prior to the separation and the distribution, certain of the company's employees participated in defined benefit pension and postretirement plans sponsored by 21cf ("shared plans"), which include participants of other 21cf subsidiaries. shared plans were accounted for as multiemployer benefit plans. therefore, no asset or liability was recorded to recognize the funded status. in contemplation of the separation and the distribution, the pension and other postretirement benefit assets and liabilities of the shared plans allocable to the company's employees were transferred to the company in fiscal 2019 (see note 15-pension and other postretirement benefits to the accompanying financial statements).
for financial reporting purposes, net periodic pension expense is calculated based upon a number of actuarial assumptions, including a discount rate, an expected rate of return on plan assets and mortality. the company considers current market conditions, including changes in investment returns and interest rates, in making these assumptions. the expected long-term rate of return is determined using the current target asset allocation of 40% equity securities, 48% fixed income securities and 12% in other investments, and applying expected future returns for the various asset classes and correlations amongst the asset classes. a portion of the other investments is allocated to cash to pay near-term benefits.
the discount rate reflects the market rate for high-quality fixed income investments on the company's annual measurement date of june 30 and is subject to change each fiscal year. the discount rate assumptions used to account for pension and other postretirement benefit plans reflect the rates at which the benefit obligations could be effectively
53
settled. the rate was determined by matching the company's expected benefit payments for the plans to a hypothetical yield curve developed using a portfolio of several hundred high-quality non-callable corporate bonds.
the key assumptions used in developing the company's fiscal 2021, 2020 and 2019 net periodic pension expense for its plans consist of the following:
2021                  2020                 2019

(in millions, except %)
discount rate for service cost           2.9       %           3.7       %         4.6       %
discount rate for interest cost          2.2       %           3.2       %         4.1       %
assets expected rate of return                  6.5       %           7.0       %         7.0       %
actual return                           $195                   $24                 $50
expected return                           50                    55                  30
actuarial gain (loss)                   $145                  $(31   )             $20
one year actual return                  26.1       %           3.4       %                 n/a discount rates are volatile from year to year because they are determined based upon the prevailing rates as of the measurement date. the company will utilize discount rates of 2.8% and 2.1% in calculating the fiscal 2022 service cost and interest cost, respectively, for its plans. the company will use an expected long-term rate of return of 5.1% for fiscal 2022 based principally on the future return expectation of the plans' asset mix. the accumulated net pre-tax losses on the company's pension and postretirement benefit plans as of june 30, 2021 were $424 million which decreased from $556 million as of june 30, 2020. this decrease of $132 million was primarily due to asset gains and the recognition of deferred losses related to amortization partially offset by the change in discount rate assumption utilized in measuring plan obligations and other changes. the overall accumulated pre-tax net losses as of june 30, 2021 were primarily the result of changes in discount rates. lower discount rates increase present values of benefit obligations and increase the company's deferred losses and also increase subsequent-year pension expense. higher discount rates decrease the present values of benefit obligations and reduces the company's accumulated net loss and also decrease subsequent-year pension expense. these deferred losses are being systematically recognized in future net periodic pension expense in accordance with asc 715, "compensation-retirement benefits." unrecognized losses in excess of 10% of the greater of the market-related value of plan assets or the plans' projected benefit obligation ("pbo") are recognized over the average future service of the plan participants or average future life of the plan participants.
the company made contributions of $63 million, $30 million and $83 million to its pension plans in fiscal 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. the majority of these contributions were voluntarily made to improve the funding status of the plans which were impacted by the economic conditions noted above. future plan contributions are dependent upon actual plan asset returns, statutory requirements and interest rate movements. assuming that actual plan returns are consistent with the company's expected plan returns in fiscal 2022 and beyond and that interest rates remain constant, the company would not be required to make any material statutory contributions to its pension plans for the immediate future. the company will continue to make voluntary contributions as necessary to improve funded status.
changes in net periodic pension expense may occur in the future due to changes in the company's expected rate of return on plan assets and discount rate resulting from economic events. the following table highlights the sensitivity of the company's pension obligations and expense to changes in these assumptions, assuming all other assumptions remain constant:
changes in assumption                            impact on annual       impact on pbo pension expense

0.25 percentage point decrease in discount rate   increase $4 million   increase $44 million
0.25 percentage point increase in discount rate   decrease $4 million   decrease $42 million
0.25 percentage point decrease in expected rate of return on assets   increase $2 million   -
0.25 percentage point increase in expected rate of return on assets   decrease $2 million   -
fiscal 2022 net periodic pension expense for the company's pension plans is expected to decrease to approximately $50 million primarily due to asset gains during fiscal 2021.

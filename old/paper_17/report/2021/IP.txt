item 1a. risk factors the company faces risks in the normal course of business and through global, regional, and local events that could have an adverse impact on its reputation, operations, and financial performance. the board of directors exercises oversight of the company's enterprise risk management program, which includes strategic, operational and financial matters, as well as compliance and legal risks. the audit and finance committee coordinates the risk oversight role exercised by the board's standing committees and management, and it receives updates on the risk management processes twice per year.
in addition to the risks and uncertainties discussed elsewhere in this annual report on form 10-k (particularly in item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations), or in the company's other filings with the securities and exchange commission, the following are some important factors that could cause the company's actual results to differ materially from those projected in any forward-looking statement. if any of the events or circumstances described in any of the following risk factors occurs, our business, results of operations and/or financial condition could be materially and adversely affected, and our actual results may differ materially from those contemplated in any forward-looking statements we make in any public disclosures.
risks related to the covid-19 pandemic the covid-19 pandemic has had an adverse effect on portions of our business, and may have material adverse effects on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows, particularly if public health and/or global economic conditions associated with covid-19 persist or deteriorate.  during 2021, there continued to be a large number of covid-19 cases and deaths in the united states and throughout the world, and restrictive measures, including mask and vaccine requirements, were implemented or reinstituted by various governmental authorities and private businesses. economic recovery in the united states and various other regions of the world has continued but may be threatened by the continued adverse public health impacts of covid-19 and other factors.
most of our manufacturing and converting facilities have remained open and operational during the pandemic, and at the current time our manufacturing and converting facilities are generally operational. while we have been able to manage through the worst of the pandemic to date, there remain many unknowns about the future phases of the pandemic. any significant disruption in operations at one or more of our mills, plants or other facilities as a result of the covid-19 pandemic could have an adverse effect on our business or operations.
our operations have recently experienced and may continue to experience, supply chain constraints and disruptions, higher supply chain costs and a constrained transportation environment due in part to the impacts of covid-19. moreover, due to the competitive labor market, we have experienced and may continue to experience, a shortage of labor for certain positions and increased labor costs.
in addition to these higher costs, other potential negative impacts on our business, include, but are not limited to, the following:
•we rely on a global workforce, and we take measures to protect the health and safety of our employees, customers and others with whom we do business, while continuing to effectively manage our employees and maintain business operations. during the pandemic, we have taken additional measures and incurred additional expenses to protect the health and safety of our employees to comply with applicable government requirements and safety guidance. our business operations may be disrupted if a significant portion of our workforce is unable to work safely and effectively due to illness, quarantines, vaccine or test mandates, government actions, or other restrictions or measures enacted in response to the pandemic.
•a significant number of our employees as well as customers and others with whom we do business, continue to work remotely in response to the covid-19 pandemic. our business operations may be disrupted if a significant portion of our workforce or certain business operations are negatively impacted as a result of remote work arrangements, including due to increased cyber risks or other disruption to our technology infrastructure.
while we are closely monitoring the impact of the pandemic on all aspects of our business, the extent of the impact on our results of operations, cash flow, liquidity, and financial performance, as well as our ability to execute near-term and long-term business strategies and initiatives, will depend on numerous evolving factors and future developments, which are highly uncertain and which we cannot predict or control, and some of which we are not currently aware, including, but not limited to: (a) the duration, severity and scope of the pandemic, including the potential for additional variants (including potential variants that may be more resistant to currently available vaccines), waves, increases and spikes in the number of covid-19 cases in various areas from time to time; (b) governmental and public health directives and/or actions taken by our customers, vendors and other private businesses generally, including vaccine, testing and mask requirements, to contain and combat the outbreak, including the duration, degree and effectiveness of such requirements, as well as the easing, removal and potential reinstitution of such requirements; (c) the availability, acceptance, effectiveness and administration of medical treatments, vaccines and booster shots for covid-19; (d) the extent and duration of the pandemic's impact on economic conditions and social activity, including with respect to inflationary pressures, supply chain shortages and disruptions, consumer confidence, discretionary spending and preferences, labor market conditions, labor and healthcare costs, and unemployment rates, any of which may adversely impact our business; and (e) any temporary reduction in our workforce, closures of our offices and facilities and our ability to adequately staff and maintain our operations.
the pandemic has had, and we expect the pandemic to continue to have, an adverse effect on portions of our business. moreover, the pandemic could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, cash flow, liquidity, or financial condition if public health and/or global economic conditions persist or deteriorate.
risks related to climate and weather we are subject to physical, operational, transitional and financial risks associated with climate change and global, regional and local weather conditions as well as by legal, regulatory, and market responses to climate change. climate change impacts, including rising temperatures and the increasing severity and/or frequency of adverse weather conditions, may result in operational impacts on our facilities, supply chain disruptions and increased raw material and other costs. these adverse weather conditions and other physical impacts which may be exacerbated as the result of climate change include floods, hurricanes, tornadoes, earthquakes, hailstorms, wildfires, snow, ice storms, drought, the spread of disease and insect infestations. climate change may also contribute to the decreased productivity of forests and adverse impacts on the distribution and abundance of species, the spread of disease and insect epidemics, any of which developments could adversely affect timber harvesting. the effects of climate change and global, regional and local weather conditions, including the resulting financial costs, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and business.
there has been an increased focus, including from investors, the general public and u.s. and foreign governmental and nongovernmental authorities, regarding environmental, social and governance (esg) matters, including with respect to climate change, ghg emissions, packaging and waste, sustainable supply chain practices, deforestation, and land, energy and water use. this increased awareness with respect to esg matters, including climate change, may result in more prescriptive reporting requirements with respect to esg metrics, an expectation that such metrics will be voluntarily disclosed by companies such as ours, and increased pressure to make commitments, set targets, or establish goals, and take action to meet them. as the result of this increased focus and our commitment to esg matters, we have voluntarily provided disclosure and established targets and goals with respect to various esg matters, including climate change. for example, we have made public commitments regarding our intended reduction of carbon emissions, including our vision 2030 goal of reducing scope 1, 2 and 3 ghg emissions by 35% and establishing science-based targets to reduce those emissions. meeting these and other esg targets and goals, have increased and may continue to increase our capital and operational costs. further, there can be no assurance regarding the extent to which our climate and other esg targets will be achieved, and the achievement of these targets is subject to various risks and uncertainties, some of which are outside our control. moreover, there is no assurance that investments made in furtherance of achieving such targets and goals will meet investor expectations or any binding or non-binding legal standards regarding sustainability performance. if we are unable to meet these climate and other esg targets and goals, this failure could adversely impact our reputation as well as investor, customer and other stakeholder relationships, which could adversely impact our business and results of operations. moreover, not all of our competitors may seek to establish climate or other esg targets and goals at a comparable level to ours, which could result in lower supply chain or operating costs for competitors.
other climate-related business risks that we face include risks related to the transition to a lower-carbon economy, such as increased prices for fuels; the introduction of a carbon tax; increased regulations; and more stringent and/or complex environmental and other permitting requirements. to the extent that climate-related business risks materialize, particularly if we are unprepared for them, we may incur unexpected costs, and our business may be materially and adversely affected.
risks relating to industry conditions changes in the cost or availability of raw materials, energy and transportation could affect our profitability. we rely heavily on the use of certain raw materials (principally virgin wood fiber, recycled fiber, caustic soda, starch and adhesives), energy sources (principally biomass, natural gas, electricity and fuel oil) and third-party companies that transport our goods. the market price of virgin wood fiber varies based upon availability and source. the global supply and demand for recycled fiber may be affected by factors such as trade policies between countries, individual governments' legislation and regulations, and changes in the global economy. in addition, the increase in demand of products manufactured, in whole or in part, from recycled fiber, on a global basis, may cause significant fluctuations in recycled fiber prices. energy prices, in particular prices for oil and natural gas, have fluctuated dramatically in the past and may continue to fluctuate in the future. the availability of labor and the market price for fuel may affect our costs for third-party transportation. we have recently experienced, and may continue to experience, a significant increase in various costs, including recycled fiber, energy, freight and other supply chain costs. in addition, because our businesses operate in highly competitive industry segments, we may not be able to recoup past or future increases in the costs of any raw materials, energy sources or transportation sources through price increases to our customers. our profitability has been, and will continue to be, affected by changes in the costs and availability of such raw materials, energy sources and transportation sources.
fluctuations in the prices of and the demand for our products due to factors such as economic cyclicality and changes in consumer preferences could materially affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. substantially all of our businesses have experienced, and are likely to continue to experience, cycles relating to industry capacity and general economic conditions. the length and magnitude of these cycles have varied over time and by product. in addition, changes in consumer preferences may increase or decrease the demand for our fiber-based products and non-fiber substitutes. moreover, consumer preferences are constantly changing based on, among other factors, cost, convenience and health, environmental and social concerns and perceptions. these consumer preferences may affect the prices of our products. consequently, our financial results are sensitive to changes in the pricing and demand for our products. in addition, our results may be adversely affected if we fail to anticipate trends that would enable us to offer products that respond to changing customer preferences and technological and regulatory developments.
competition in the united states and internationally could negatively impact our financial results. we operate in a competitive environment, both in the united states and internationally, in all of our operating segments. our products compete with similar products produced by other forest products companies. product innovations, manufacturing and operating efficiencies, additional manufacturing capacity, marketing, distribution and pricing strategies pursued or achieved by competitors, and the entry of new competitors in to the markets we serve could negatively impact our financial results. in addition, our products also compete, in some instances, with companies in other industries that produce substitutes for wood-fiber products, such as plastics and various types of metal, and customer shifts away from wood-fiber products toward such substitute products may adversely affect our business.
risks relating to market and economic factors, adverse developments in general business and economic conditions could have an adverse effect on the demand for our products and our financial condition and results of operations. general economic conditions may adversely affect industrial non-durable goods production, consumer spending, commercial printing and advertising activity, white-collar employment levels and consumer confidence, all of which impact demand for our products, or otherwise adversely affect our business. we may also be adversely affected by catastrophic or other unforeseen events, including future health epidemics or pandemics, natural disasters, geopolitical events, terrorism, political, financial or social instability, or civil or social unrest. moreover, negative economic conditions or other adverse developments with respect to our business have resulted in, and may in the future result in impairment charges which could be material. volatility or uncertainty in the financial, capital and credit markets, which impacts interest rates, currency exchange rates and the availability of credit, could also have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and our results of operations.
changes in international conditions or other risks arising from conducting business internationally could adversely affect our business and results of operations. our operating results and business prospects could be substantially affected by risks related to the countries outside the united states in which we have manufacturing facilities or sell our products. these risks, which can vary substantially by country, may include economic or political instability, geopolitical events (such as increasing tensions between ukraine and russia), corruption, anti-american sentiment, social and ethnic unrest, the regulatory environment (including the risks of operating in developing or emerging markets in which there are significant uncertainties regarding the interpretation and enforceability of legal requirements), fluctuations in the value of local currency versus the u.s. dollar, repatriating cash from foreign countries to the united states, downturns or changes in economic activity (including in relation to commodity inflation), adverse tax consequences or rulings, nationalization or any change in social, political or labor conditions in any of these countries or regions impacting matters such as sustainability, environmental regulations and trade policies and agreements, could negatively affect our financial results. trade protection measures in favor of local producers of competing products, including governmental subsidies, tax benefits and other measures giving local producers a competitive advantage over international paper, may also adversely impact our operating results and business prospects in these countries. likewise, disruption in existing trade agreements or increased trade friction between countries (such as in relation to the trade tensions between the united states and china), which can result in tariffs, could have a negative effect on our business and results of operations by restricting the free flow of goods and services across borders.
in addition, our international operations are subject to regulation under u.s. law and other laws related to operations in foreign jurisdictions. for example, the foreign corrupt practices act prohibits u.s. companies and their representatives from offering, promising, authorizing or making payments to foreign officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business abroad, and the u.s. department of treasury's office of foreign asset control and other non-u.s. government entities maintain economic sanctions targeting various countries, persons and entities. failure to comply with domestic or foreign laws could result in various adverse consequences, including the imposition of civil or criminal sanctions and the prosecution of executives overseeing our international operations.
the level of our indebtedness could adversely affect our financial condition and impair our ability to operate our business. as of december 31, 2021, international paper had approximately $5.6 billion of outstanding indebtedness. the level of our indebtedness could have important consequences to our financial condition, operating results and business, including the following:
•it may limit our ability to obtain additional debt or equity financing for working capital, capital expenditures, product development, dividends, share repurchases, debt service requirements, acquisitions and general corporate or other purposes;
•a portion of our cash flows from operations will be dedicated to payments on indebtedness and will not be available for other purposes, including operations, capital expenditures and future business opportunities;
•the debt service requirements of our indebtedness could make it more difficult for us to satisfy other obligations;
•it may limit our ability to adjust to changing market conditions, including to react to rising interest rates, and place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less debt; and
•it may increase our vulnerability to a downturn in general economic conditions or in our business, and may make us unable to carry out capital spending that is important to our growth.
in addition, we are subject to agreements governing our indebtedness that require us to meet and maintain certain financial ratios and covenants. a significant or prolonged downturn in general business and economic conditions, or other significant adverse developments with respect to our results of operations or financial condition, may affect our ability to comply with these covenants or meet those financial ratios and tests and could require us to take action to reduce our debt or to act in a manner contrary to our current business objectives. moreover, the restrictions associated with these financial ratios and covenants may prevent us from taking actions that we believe would be in the best interest of our business and may make it difficult for us to execute our business strategy successfully or effectively compete with companies that are not similarly restricted. additionally, despite these restrictions, we may be able to incur substantial additional indebtedness in the future, which might subject us to additional restrictive covenants that could affect our financial and operational flexibility and otherwise increase the risks associated with our indebtedness as noted above.
moreover, certain of our variable rate debt uses the london interbank offering rate ("libor") as a benchmark for establishing the interest rate. in march 2021, the u.k. financial conduct authority announced that all libor settings will either cease to be provided by any administrator or no longer be representative immediately after december 31, 2021 for sterling, euro, swiss franc and japanese yen settings, as well as the one-week and two-month u.s. dollar settings, and immediately after june 30, 2023 for the remaining u.s. dollar settings. in instances where we have not yet incorporated libor-replacement provisions into our variable rate debt provisions that use libor as an interest rate benchmark, we will need to do so before june 30, 2023. the discontinuation and replacement of libor or any other benchmark rates may have an unpredictable impact on contractual mechanics in the credit markets or cause disruption to the broader financial markets. additionally, uncertainty as to the nature of such potential discontinuation and replacement, including that any benchmark may not be the economic equivalent of libor or not achieve market acceptance similar to libor, may negatively impact the cost of our variable rate debt.
changes in credit ratings issued by nationally recognized statistical rating organizations could adversely affect our cost of financing and have an adverse effect on the market price of our securities. maintaining an investment-grade credit rating is an important element of our financial strategy, and a downgrade of the company's ratings below investment grade will likely eliminate our ability to access the commercial paper market, may limit our access to the capital markets, have an adverse effect on the market price of our securities, increase our cost of borrowing and require us to post collateral for derivatives in a net liability position. the company's desire to maintain its investment grade rating may cause the company to take certain actions designed to improve its cash flow, including sale of assets, suspension or reduction of our dividend and reductions in capital expenditures and working capital.
under the terms of the agreements governing approximately $1.0 billion of our debt as of december 31, 2021, the applicable interest rate on such debt may increase upon each downgrade in our credit rating below investment grade. as a result, a downgrade in our credit rating below investment grade may lead to an increase in our interest expense. there can be no assurance that such credit ratings will remain in effect for any given period of time or that such ratings will not be lowered, suspended or withdrawn entirely by the rating agencies, if, in each rating agency's judgment, circumstances so warrant. any such downgrade, suspension or withdrawal of our credit ratings could adversely affect our cost of borrowing, limit our access to the capital markets or result in more restrictive covenants in agreements governing the terms of any future indebtedness that we may incur.
downgrades in the credit ratings of banks issuing certain letters of credit will increase our cost of maintaining certain indebtedness and may result in the acceleration of deferred taxes. we are subject to the risk that a bank with currently issued irrevocable letters of credit supporting installment notes, including those delivered to temple-inland in connection with temple-inland's
2007 sales of forestlands, may be downgraded below a required rating. since 2007, certain banks have fallen below the required ratings threshold and were successfully replaced, or waivers were obtained regarding their replacement. as a result of continuing uncertainty in the banking environment, a number of the letter-of-credit banks currently in place remain subject to risk of downgrade and the number of qualified replacement banks remains limited. the downgrade of one or more of these banks may subject the company to additional costs of securing a replacement letter-of-credit bank or could result in an acceleration of payments of up to $487 million in deferred income taxes if replacement banks cannot be obtained. the deferred taxes are currently recorded in the company's consolidated financial statements. see note 15, variable interest entities, on pages 74 through 75, and note 13. income taxes, on pages 68 through 70, in item 8. financial statements and supplementary data for further information.
our pension and health care costs are subject to numerous factors which could cause these costs to change. we have defined benefit pension plans covering substantially all u.s. salaried employees hired prior to july 1, 2004 (or later for certain acquired populations, as described in note 19. retirement plans, on pages 80 through 86, in item 8. financial statements and supplementary data) and substantially all hourly union and non-union employees regardless of hire date. the company froze participation under these plans for u.s. salaried employees, including credited service and compensation on or after january 1, 2019; however, the pension freeze does not affect benefits accrued through december 31, 2018. we provide retiree health care benefits to certain former u.s. employees, as well as financial assistance towards the cost of individual retiree medical coverage for certain former u.s. salaried employees. our pension costs are dependent upon numerous factors resulting from actual plan experience and assumptions of future experience. pension plan assets are primarily made up of equity and fixed income investments. fluctuations in actual market returns on plan assets, changes in general interest rates and changes in the number of retirees may impact pension costs in future periods. likewise, changes in assumptions regarding current discount rates and expected rates of return on plan assets could increase pension costs. however, the impact of market fluctuations has been reduced as a result of investments in our pension plan asset portfolio which partially hedge the impact of changes in interest rates on the plan's funded status. drivers for fluctuating health costs include unit cost changes, health care utilization by participants, and potential changes in legal requirements and government oversight.
our u.s. funded pension plans are currently fully funded on a projected benefit obligation basis; however, the possibility exists that over time we may be required to make cash payments to the plans, reducing the cash available for our business. we record an asset or a liability associated with our pension plans equal to the surplus of the fair value of plan assets above the benefit obligation or the excess of the benefit obligation over the fair value of plan assets. at december 31, 2021, we had an overfunded pension asset balance. the benefit surplus recorded under the provisions of accounting standards codification ("asc") 715, "compensation - retirement benefits," at december 31, 2021 was $242 million. the amount and timing of future contributions, which could be material, will depend upon a number of factors, including the actual earnings and changes in values of plan assets and changes in interest rates.
risks relating to our operations material disruptions at one of our manufacturing facilities could negatively impact our financial results. we operate our facilities in compliance with applicable rules and regulations and take measures to minimize the risks of disruption at our facilities. a material disruption at our corporate headquarters or one of our manufacturing facilities could prevent us from meeting customer demand, reduce our sales and/or negatively impact our financial condition. any of our manufacturing facilities, or any of our machines within an otherwise operational facility, could cease operations unexpectedly due to a number of events, including:
•fires, floods, earthquakes, hurricanes or other catastrophes (including adverse weather conditions which may be intensified by climate change);
•the effect of a drought or reduced rainfall on its water supply;
•the effect of other severe weather conditions on equipment and facilities;
•disruption in the supply of raw materials or other manufacturing inputs;
•terrorism or threats of terrorism;
•information system disruptions or failures due to any number of causes, including cyber-attacks;
•domestic and international laws and regulations applicable to our company and our business partners, including joint venture partners, around the world;
•unscheduled maintenance outages;
•prolonged power failures;
•an equipment failure;
•a chemical spill or release;
•explosion of a boiler or other equipment;
•damage or disruptions caused by third parties operating on or adjacent to one of our manufacturing facilities;
•disruptions in the transportation infrastructure, including roads, bridges, railroad tracks and tunnels;
•a widespread outbreak of an illness or any other communicable disease, such as the outbreak of the covid-19 virus, or any other public health crisis;
•failure of our third party service providers and business partners to satisfactorily fulfill their commitments and responsibilities in a timely manner and in accordance with agreed upon terms;
•labor difficulties; and
•other operational problems.
any such downtime or facility damage could prevent us from meeting customer demand for our products and/or require us to make unplanned expenditures. if one of these machines or facilities were to incur significant downtime, our ability to meet our production targets and satisfy customer requirements could be impaired, resulting in lower sales and having a negative effect on our business and financial results.
certain operations are conducted by joint ventures that we cannot operate solely for our benefit. we have a 50% equity interest in ilim s.a., whose primary operations are in russia. in joint ventures, such as the ilim joint venture, we share ownership and management of a company with one or more parties who may or may not have the same goals, strategies, priorities or resources as we do. in general, joint ventures are intended to be operated for the benefit of all co-owners, rather than for our exclusive benefit. operating a business as a joint venture often requires additional organizational formalities as well as time-consuming procedures for sharing information and making decisions. in joint ventures, we are required to pay more attention to our relationship with our co-owners as well as with the joint venture, and if a co-owner changes, our relationship may be adversely affected. in addition, the benefits from a successful joint venture are shared among the co-owners, so we receive only our portion of those benefits.
we may not achieve the expected benefits from strategic acquisitions, joint ventures, divestitures, spin-offs, capital investments and other corporate transactions that we have pursued or may pursue.  our strategy for long-term growth, productivity and profitability depends, in part, on our ability to accomplish prudent acquisitions, joint ventures, divestitures, spin-offs, capital investments and other corporate transactions that we may pursue and to realize the benefits we expect from such transactions. we are subject to the risk that we may not achieve the expected benefits from such transactions. this failure could require us to record an impairment charge for goodwill or other intangible assets, which could lead to decreased assets and reduced net earnings. among the benefits we expect from potential as well as completed acquisitions and joint ventures are synergies, cost savings, growth opportunities or access to new markets (or a combination thereof), and in the case of divestitures, the realization of proceeds from the sale of businesses and assets to purchasers who place higher strategic value on such businesses and assets than we do.
corporate transactions of this nature which we may pursue involve a number of special risks, including with respect to our inability to realize our business goals with respect to such transactions as noted above, the focus of our management's attention on these transactions and the assimilation of acquired businesses into our operations, the demands on our financial, operational and information technology systems resulting from acquired businesses, and the possibility that we may become responsible for substantial contingent or unanticipated legal liabilities as the result of acquisitions or other corporate transactions.
we believe that the spin-off of sylvamo corporation allows us and sylvamo corporation to pursue distinct strategies appropriate to our respective markets. however, there can be no assurance that we will realize any or all of the expected strategic, financial, operational or other benefits of the spin-off. a failure to realize expected benefits of the spin-off could result in a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.
we cannot guarantee that sylvamo corporation will be successful as a standalone entity. in the event that sylvamo corporation is not successful, it is possible that plaintiffs could assert a variety of claims against us. depending on their nature and number, such claims could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. in addition, we account for certain investments, including our investment in sylvamo corporation, on a mark-to-market basis and, as a result, changes in the fair value of these investments could significantly impact our reported results.
we could be exposed to claims from sylvamo corporation under our agreements with sylvamo corporation or otherwise. we have entered into agreements with sylvamo corporation and its subsidiaries, including among others a separation and distribution agreement, registration rights agreement, transition services agreement, tax matters agreement, supply and offtake agreements, intellectual property agreements and other commercial arrangements. our agreements with sylvamo corporation or its subsidiaries may not reflect terms that would have resulted from negotiations between unaffiliated parties and, in certain instances, may relate to the continuation of certain business arrangements among us and sylvamo corporation in existence prior to the spin-off. such agreements include, among other things, the parties' respective indemnification rights and obligations with respect to certain losses relating to specified liabilities as well as certain losses relating to specified information included in certain securities filings, the allocations of assets and liabilities, payment obligations and other obligations between us and sylvamo corporation. there can be no assurance that any remedies available under these arrangements will be sufficient to compensate us in the event of a dispute or non-performance. in addition, there can be no assurance that the attention we must pay, and resources we must devote, to our obligations under one or more of these agreements, or the results of any failure to perform those obligations, or successful claim by sylvamo corporation that we have failed to perform those obligations or have an indemnification obligation under these agreements, will not have a material impact on our own business performance, results of operations or financial condition.
we will rely on sylvamo corporation to satisfy its performance and payment obligations under these agreements entered into in connection with the spin-off. if sylvamo corporation fails to satisfy such obligations it could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.
in addition, under the tax matters agreement, we could have significant payment obligations in connection with certain brazilian tax matters. under this agreement, we have agreed to pay 60% of the first $300 million of any liability resulting from the resolution of these brazilian tax matters (with sylvamo paying the remaining 40% of any such liability) and 100% of any liability resulting from the brazilian tax matters over $300 million. the assessments for the tax years 2007 - 2015 currently total approximately $106 million in tax and $351 million in interest, penalties and fees as of december 31, 2021 (adjusted for variation in currency exchange rates). see note 14 commitments and contingent liabilities on pages 70 through 74 of item 8. financial statements and supplementary data for further information.
we operate in a challenging market for talent and may fail to attract and retain qualified personnel, including key management personnel. our ability to operate and grow our business depends on our ability to attract and retain employees with the skills necessary to operate and maintain our facilities, produce our products and serve our customers. the market for both hourly workers and professional workers has been, and remains, very competitive, particularly for employees with specialized technical and trade experience. for example, due to labor market constraints, we have recently had to increase overtime while we try to hire additional permanent employees. this, along with the current competitive labor market, has led to higher labor costs, particularly at our converting facilities. moreover, despite our focused efforts to attract and retain employees, including by offering higher levels of compensation in certain instances, we experienced attrition rates within our workforce in 2021 that exceeded historical levels. in addition, we rely on key executive and management personnel to manage our business efficiently and effectively. the loss of key executive and management employees, particularly in a challenging market for attracting and retaining employees, could adversely affect our business.
moreover, changing demographics and labor work force trends, including remote work expectations for many individuals arising from the covid-19 pandemic, may make it difficult for us to replace retiring or departing employees. if we fail to attract and retain qualified personnel, or if we continue to experience excessive turnover, we may continue to experience higher labor costs and labor shortages, and our business may be adversely impacted. moreover, labor shortages may be further exacerbated by covid-19 vaccination and testing requirements.
in addition, a significant number of our employees are represented by unions. we may not be able to successfully negotiate new union contracts once our current contracts with unions expire without work stoppages or labor difficulties, or we may be unable renegotiate such contracts on favorable terms. we have also experienced work stoppages in the past and may experience them in the future. moreover, labor organizations may attempt to organize groups of additional employees from time to time, and potential changes in labor laws could make it easier for them to do so. if we experience any extended interruption of operations at any of our facilities as a result of strikes or other work stoppages or if unions are able to organize additional groups of our employees, our operating costs increase and our operational flexibility could be reduced.
we are subject to cybersecurity and information technology risks related to breaches of security pertaining to sensitive company, customer, employee and vendor information as well as breaches in the technology used to manage operations and other business processes. our business operations rely upon securely managed information technology systems for data capture, processing, storage and reporting. we have invested in information technology security initiatives and information technology risk management, as well as business continuity and disaster recovery plans. the development and maintenance of these measures is costly and requires ongoing monitoring, testing and updating as technologies and processes change, and efforts to overcome security measures become increasingly sophisticated.
the current cyber threat environment presents increased risk for all companies, including those in our industry. like other global companies, our systems are subject to recurring attempts by third parties to access information, manipulate data or disrupt our operations, and we have experienced cyber threats and incidents, although none have been material or had a material adverse effect on our business. despite careful security and controls design, implementation, updating and independent third party verification, our information technology systems, and those of our third party providers or joint venture partners, could become subject to employee error or malfeasance, cyber-attacks, such as ransomware and data theft, by common hackers, criminal groups or nation-state organizations or social activist ("hacktivist") organizations, geopolitical events, natural disasters, failures or impairments of telecommunications networks or other catastrophic events. in addition, the cybersecurity-related threats that we face may remain undetected for an extended period of time. network, system, application and data breaches, and other cybersecurity incidents, could result in operational disruptions, data loss or manipulation, or information misappropriation including, but not limited to, interruption to systems availability, denial of access to and misuse of applications required by our customers to conduct business with the company. access to applications required to plan our operations, source materials, manufacture and ship finished goods and account for orders could be denied or misused. theft of intellectual property or trade secrets, and loss or inappropriate disclosure of confidential company, employee, customer or vendor information, could stem from such incidents. while we have significant security processes and initiatives in place, we may be unable to detect or prevent a breach or disruption. any significant cybersecurity incident or operational disruptions and/or misappropriation of information could result in lost sales, business delays, negative publicity, cause us to incur legal liability and increased costs to address such events and related security concerns, and have a material effect on our business. additionally, while we have insurance coverage designed to address certain aspects of cyber risks in place, such insurance coverage may be insufficient to cover all losses or all types of claims that may arise in connection with such incidents.
risks relating to legal proceedings and compliance costs we are subject to a wide variety of laws, regulations and other government requirements that may change in significant ways, and the cost of compliance with such requirements could impact our business and results of operations. our operations are subject to regulation under a wide variety of u.s. federal and state and non-u.s. laws, regulations and other government requirements -- including, among others, those relating to the environment, health and safety, labor and employment, data privacy, tax, trade and health care. there can be no assurance that laws, regulations and government requirements will not be changed, applied or interpreted in ways that will require us to modify our operations and objectives or affect our returns on investments by restricting existing activities and products, or subjecting us to increased costs.
for example, as part of our business, we are subject to increasingly stringent federal, state, local and international laws governing the protection of the environment. we have incurred significant capital, operating and other expenditures complying with applicable environmental laws and regulations. in addition, new environmental laws, regulations or other requirements, including with respect to ghg emissions or climate change, may cause us to incur increased and unexpected compliance costs. moreover, there has historically been a lack of consistent climate legislation, which has created and continues to create economic and regulatory uncertainty. our environmental expenditures include, among other areas, those related to air and water quality, waste disposal and the cleanup of contaminated soil and groundwater, including situations where we have been identified as a potentially responsible party. moreover, we may be directly impacted by, and are working to manage, the risks and costs to us, our customers and our vendors of the effects of climate change, ghgs, and the availability of energy and water resources. these risks include the potentially adverse impact on forestlands, which are a key resource in the production of our products, increased product costs and a change in the types of products that customers purchase. there can be no assurance that future remediation requirements and compliance with existing and new laws and requirements will not require significant expenditures, or that existing reserves for specific matters will be adequate to cover future costs. we could also incur substantial fines or sanctions, enforcement actions (including orders limiting our operations or requiring corrective measures), natural resource damages claims, cleanup and closure costs, third-party claims for property damage and personal injury and reputational harm as a result of violations of, or liabilities under, environmental laws, regulations, codes and common law. the amount and timing of environmental expenditures is difficult to predict, and, in some cases, liability may be imposed without regard to contribution or to whether we knew of, or caused, the release of hazardous substances.
our global operations subject us to complex and evolving u.s and international data privacy laws and regulations, such as european's union general data protection regulation ("gdpr"), the california consumer privacy act of 2018 ("ccpa") and the california privacy rights act ("cpra"), and china's personal information protection law ("pipl") which came into effect as of november 1, 2021. these laws require the company to comply with a range of compliance obligations regarding the handling of personal data. there are significant penalties for non-compliance including monetary fines, disruption of operations and reputational harm. moreover, other states and governmental authorities around the world have introduced or passed, or are consider enacting, similar legislation which may impose varying standards and requirements on our data collection, use and processing activities.
this increasingly restrictive and evolving regulatory environment at the international, federal and state level related to data privacy and data protection may require changes to our business practices and give rise to significantly expanded compliance burdens, costs and enforcement risks. moreover, many of these laws and regulations are subject to uncertain application, interpretation or enforcement standards that could result in claims, changes to our business practices, data processing and security systems, penalties, increased operating costs or other impacts on our businesses. these laws often provide for civil penalties for violations, as well as private rights of action for data breaches that may increase data breach litigation. the company proactively uses internal and external resources to monitor compliance with relevant legislation and continually evaluates and, where necessary, modifies its data processing practices and policies in order to comply with evolving privacy laws. nevertheless, relevant regulatory authorities could determine that our data handling practices fail to address all the requirements of certain new laws, which could subject us to penalties and/or litigation. in addition, there is no assurance that our security controls over personal data, the training of employees and vendors on data privacy and data security, and the policies, procedures and practices we implemented or may implement in the future will prevent the improper handling of, disclosure of or access to personal data. improper handling and disclosure of or access to personal data in violation of the gdpr, pipl, the ccpa and/or of other data privacy and protection laws could harm our reputation, cause loss of consumer confidence, subject us to government enforcement actions (including fines), or result in private litigation against us, which could result in loss of revenue, increased costs, liability for monetary damages, fines and/or criminal prosecution, all of which could negatively affect our business and operating results.
we are subject to taxes in the u.s. and various foreign jurisdictions, and changes in laws, regulation or interpretation of existing laws and regulations in the u.s. and other jurisdictions where we are subject to taxation, could increase our taxes and have an adverse effect on our financial results. in addition, the application of tax law is subject to interpretation and is subject to audit by taxing authorities. additionally, administrative guidance can be incomplete or vary from legislative intent, and therefore the application of the tax law is uncertain. while we believe the positions reported by the company comply with relevant tax laws and regulations, taxing authorities could interpret our application of certain laws and regulations differently.
we are currently subject to tax audits in the u.s. and other taxing jurisdictions around the world. in some cases, we have appealed and may continue to appeal, assessments by taxing authorities in the court system. as such, tax controversy matters may result in previously unrecorded tax expenses, accelerated cash tax payments, higher future tax expenses, or the assessment of interest and penalties. for example, the 2015 timber monetization restructuring is currently under internal revenue service examination. an unfavorable resolution in such current examination, future administrative procedures, or future tax litigation could result in material, accelerated cash tax payments as a result of all or a portion of the remaining $813 million deferred tax liability relating to the timber monetization becoming payable. see note 15 variable interest entities for more detail on the timber monetization and the 2015 restructuring.
as such, tax controversy matters may result in previously unrecorded tax expenses, higher future tax expenses or the assessment of interest and penalties.
results of legal proceedings could have a material effect on our consolidated financial results. we are a party to various legal, regulatory and governmental proceedings and other related matters, including with respect to environmental matters. in addition, we are and may become subject to other loss contingencies, both known and unknown, which may relate to past, present and future facts, events, circumstances and occurrences. should an unfavorable outcome occur in connection with our legal, regulatory or governmental proceedings or other loss contingencies, or if we become subject to any such loss contingencies in the future, there could be a material adverse impact on our financial results. see note 14 commitments and contingent liabilities on pages 70 through 74 of item 8. financial statements and supplementary data for further information.
if the spin-off of sylvamo corporation were to fail to qualify for non-recognition treatment for u.s. federal income tax purposes, then international paper and our shareholders may be subject to significant u.s. federal income taxes.  the company received an opinion of tax counsel and a private letter ruling from the u.s. internal revenue service (the "irs") regarding the qualification of the spin-off of sylvamo corporation and certain related transactions as a transaction that is generally tax-free to sylvamo corporation, the company and the shareholders of the company for u.s. federal income tax purposes. a tax opinion is not binding on the irs or the courts, and there can be no assurance that the irs or a court will not take a contrary position. in addition, the company's tax counsel and the irs relied on certain representations and covenants delivered by the company and sylvamo corporation in rendering such opinion and private letter ruling. if any of the representations or covenants relied upon for the tax opinion or private letter ruling become inaccurate, incomplete or not complied with by the company, sylvamo corporation or any of their respective subsidiaries, the tax opinion may be invalid and the conclusions reached therein could be jeopardized.
if the irs ultimately determines that the spin-off is taxable, then the spin-off could be treated as a taxable dividend or capital gain to the company's shareholders for u.s. federal income tax purposes, and the company could incur significant u.s. federal income tax liabilities. these income tax liabilities may be indemnifiable by sylvamo corporation pursuant to a tax matters agreement between the company and sylvamo. however, there can be no assurance that sylvamo would have the resources or liquidity required to indemnify the company for any such tax liability.
even if the spin-off otherwise qualifies for non-recognition of gain or loss under section 355 of the code, the spin-off may be taxable to the company (but not the shareholders of the company) pursuant to section 355(e) of the code if there is a 50% or more (by vote or value) change in ownership of either the company or sylvamo corporation, directly or indirectly, as part of a plan or series of related transactions that include the spin-off. for this purpose, any acquisitions of the company's or sylvamo corporation's common stock within two years before or after the spin-off are presumed to be part of such a plan, although the company or sylvamo corporation may be able to rebut that presumption based on either applicable facts and circumstances or a "safe harbor" described in the u.s. tax regulations.
item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes included in "financial statements and supplementary data" of this annual report on form 10-k. in addition to historical consolidated financial information, the following discussion contains forward-looking statements that reflect our plans, estimates, and beliefs that involve significant risks and uncertainties. our actual results could differ materially from those discussed in the forward-looking statements. factors that could cause or contribute to those differences include those discussed below and elsewhere in this annual report on form 10-k, particularly in "risk factors" and "forward-looking statements."
the following generally discusses 2021 and 2020 items and year-to-year comparisons between 2021 and 2020. discussion of historical items in 2019, and year-to-year comparisons between 2020 and 2019, can be found in our annual report on form 10-k for the fiscal year ended december 31, 2020, filed with the sec on february 19, 2021, under part ii, item 7, management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations.
executive summary full-year 2021 net earnings attributable to shareholders were $1.8 billion ($4.47 per diluted share) compared with $482 million ($1.22 per diluted share) for full-year 2020.
during 2021, international paper grew revenue and earnings while managing through significant operational and supply chain constraints. we serviced strong customer demand in a highly challenging operating environment due to continued uncertainties associated with covid-19. for much of 2021, we operated with a sub-optimized system, which limited our ability to capture the full opportunity that comes with a strong demand backdrop. we made strong progress on price realization from prior increases to mitigate the impact of substantial cost pressure from inputs and distribution. we generated full-year cash from operations of $2.0 billion and free cash flow of $1.5 billion which included approximately $500 million of tax payments associated with various asset monetization transactions completed in 2021, as well as payment of deferred payroll taxes under the 2020 cares act. in 2021, we further strengthened our balance sheet, reducing debt by $2.5 billion. additionally, our u.s. qualified pension plan has a 105% funded status with a surplus of $600 million as of december 31, 2021. lastly, we returned $1.6 billion to shareowners, including about $810 million in share repurchases.
in 2021, we announced the company's building a better ip initiative to drive value creation by streamlining and simplifying the company, increasing efficiency and reducing costs and accelerating profitable growth. to that end, in 2021 we further focused our portfolio around corrugated packaging with the spin-off of the printing papers business as a stand-alone public company, sylvamo corporation, and we initiated meaningful actions to materially lower our cost structure and accelerate profitable growth, with a commitment to deliver $350 to $430 million of incremental earnings in 2024.
comparing our 2021 results to 2020, price and mix improved, with strong price realization across all of our business segments and channels. mix was also favorable, driven by solid growth in higher-margin, u.s. packaging channels and lower containerboard exports. volume was essentially flat versus the prior year as significant operational and supply chain constraints limited our ability to capture the full benefits of a solid demand backdrop. this was particularly the case in the fourth quarter 2021, as volume improved less than we anticipated, primarily due to significant covid-19 omicron variant related labor and supply chain constraints late in the quarter, especially in our u.s. box system. our north american industrial packaging business operated with depleted inventories throughout much of 2021, which increased costs across our system. across the company, supply chain operating costs increased significantly versus 2020, representing more than half of the increase in operations and costs in 2021. the second half of 2021 was especially challenging due to slow supply chain velocity and poor logistics reliability, putting additional cost pressure on our manufacturing systems. maintenance outage costs increased as planned, following deferrals we chose to make in 2020. input costs rose sharply across most categories, with costs increasing throughout 2021, resulting in significantly elevated input cost levels exiting 2021. interest expense was substantially lower in 2021, benefiting from significant debt reduction in 2020 and 2021. although corporate expenses were lower, there was some offset in the fourth quarter 2021 related to expected dis-synergies, following the spin-off of the printing papers business. equity earnings improved on strong performance from our ilim joint venture, partially offset by reduced earnings from graphic packaging following the final monetization of our investment in the first half of 2021.
looking ahead to the first quarter 2022, as compared to the fourth quarter 2021, in our industrial packaging business, we expect to realize gains related to the august 2021 published price movement. volume is expected to be lower in the first quarter 2022 on decreased seasonal demand and the impact of the covid-19 omicron variant on labor availability and supply chains, although we do expect improvement as the first quarter progresses. operations and costs are expected to decrease earnings, including additional costs related to the prattville mill recovery and start-up costs, following the failure of the high-density storage tank in the fourth quarter 2021 maintenance outage expense is expected to be significantly higher as the first quarter will be our highest outage quarter this year, representing about 40% of total planned outage costs in 2022. input costs are expected to improve on lower recovered fiber and energy costs. in global cellulose fibers we expect our price and mix combined to be stable. we expect volume to decrease moderately due to on-going vessel delays. operations and costs are expected to increase related to higher seasonal costs and the non-repeat of a favorable lifo benefit in the fourth quarter 2021. maintenance outage expense is expected to increase as the first quarter 2022 will also be global cellulose fibers highest maintenance outage quarter in 2022. input costs are expected to be slightly higher due mostly to higher energy costs. lastly, equity earnings from the ilim joint venture are expected to improve.
looking to full-year 2022, year, we expect a solid demand environment for corrugated packaging and pulp, with demand growth normalizing as we recover from the near-term covid-19 omicron constraints. we also expect to make good progress on our building a better ip initiatives, which will ramp up as the year progresses. we are well positioned to optimize our containerboard mill and corrugated box system following various disruptions in 2021, which will further improve our operating and distributions costs. with respect to our capital allocation, we are targeting capital expenditures of $1.1 billion. the planned increase is driven primarily by investments in our packaging business to build out capabilities and capacity in our box system to drive profitable growth. additionally, we are committed to a competitive and sustainable dividend with a payout of 40 to 50% of free cash flow, which we will continue to review annually as earnings and cash flow grow. with regard to share repurchases, as of the end of 2021 we had $2.9 billion of available authorizations. we will continue to execute on these authorizations in a manner that balances the investment needs of the business and maximizes value for our shareowners.
on march 11, 2020 the world health organization (who) declared the novel strain of coronavirus (covid-19) a global pandemic and recommended containment and mitigation measures worldwide. during 2021, there continued to be a large number of covid-19 cases and deaths in the united states and throughout the world, and restrictive measures, including masks and vaccine requirements were implemented or reinstituted by various governmental authorities and private businesses. economic recovery in the united states and various other regions of the world has continued but may be threatened by the continued adverse effects of covid-19 and other factors. most of our manufacturing and converting facilities have remained open and operational during the pandemic and at the current time our manufacturing and converting facilities are generally operational. the health and safety of our employees and contractors is our most important responsibility as we manage through the covid-19 pandemic. we have implemented work-systems across the company to maintain the health and safety of our employees including social distancing, site cleaning, contract tracing and other measures as recommended by the cdc and who.
the pandemic has not had a material impact on demand for our products. however, all of our operations continue to experience higher supply chain costs and a constrained transportation environment due in part to the impacts of covid-19. moreover, due to the competitive labor market, we have experienced and may continue to experience, a shortage of labor for certain positions and increased labor costs.
there continue to be significant uncertainties associated with the covid-19 pandemic, as detailed under risks related to the covid-19 pandemic on page 8 to 19 of item 1a. risk factors. the impacts of the pandemic had an adverse effect on our operations in 2021, and could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows if public health and/or global economic conditions deteriorate.
adjusted operating earnings and adjusted operating earnings per share are non-gaap measures and are defined as net earnings (loss) attributable to international paper (a gaap measure) excluding discontinued operations, net special items and non-operating pension expense (income). net earnings (loss) and diluted earnings (loss) per share attributable to common shareholders are the most directly comparable gaap measures. the company calculates adjusted operating earnings by excluding the after-tax effect of discontinued operations, non-operating pension expense (income) and items considered by management to be unusual (net special items) from net earnings (loss) attributable to shareholders reported under gaap. adjusted operating earnings per share is calculated by dividing adjusted operating earnings by diluted average shares of common stock outstanding. management uses this measure to focus on on-going operations, and believes that it is useful to investors because it enables them to perform meaningful comparisons of past and present consolidated operating results from continuing operations. the company believes that using this information, along with the most direct comparable gaap measure, provides for a more complete analysis of the results of operations.
the following are reconciliations of earnings (loss) attributable to common shareholders to adjusted operating earnings (loss) attributable to common shareholders on a total and per share basis. additional detail is provided later in this form 10-k regarding the net special items referenced in the charts below:

cash provided by operations, including discontinued operations, totaled $2.0 billion and $3.1 billion for 2021 and 2020, respectively. the company generated free cash flow of approximately $1.5 billion in 2021 and $2.3 billion in 2020, respectively. free cash flow is a non-gaap measure and the most directly comparable gaap measure is cash provided by operations. management utilizes this measure in connection with managing our business and believes that free cash flow is useful to investors as a liquidity measure because it measures the amount of cash generated that is available, after reinvesting in the business, to maintain a strong balance sheet, pay dividends, repurchase stock, service debt and make

investments for future growth. it should not be inferred that the entire free cash flow amount is available for discretionary expenditures. by adjusting for certain items that are not indicative of the company's ongoing underlying operational performance, we believe that free cash flow also enables investors to perform meaningful comparisons between past and present periods.
the following are reconciliations of free cash flow to cash provided by operations:

the non-gaap financial measures presented in this form 10-k as referenced above have limitations as analytical tools and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for an analysis of our results calculated in accordance with gaap. in addition, because not all companies utilize identical calculations, the company's presentation of non-gaap measures in this form 10-k may not be comparable to similarly titled measures disclosed by other companies, including companies in the same industry as the company.
results of operations business segment operating profits are used by international paper's management to measure the earnings performance of its businesses. management uses this measure to focus on on-going operations and believes that it is useful to investors because it enables them to perform meaningful comparisons of past and present operating results. international paper believes that using this information, along with net earnings, provides a more complete analysis of the results of operations by year. business segment operating profits are defined as earnings (loss) before income taxes and equity earnings, but including the impact of noncontrolling interests, and excluding interest expense, net, corporate expenses, net, corporate net special items, business net special items and non-operating pension expense. business segment operating profits is a measure reported to our management for purposes of making decisions about allocating resources to our business segments and assessing the performance of our business segments and is presented in our financial statement footnotes in accordance with asc 280.
international paper operates in two segments: industrial packaging and global cellulose fibers. during 2021, as a result of the spin-off of our printing papers business along with certain mixed-use coated paperboard and pulp businesses and the associated reclassification of these businesses to discontinued operations, we no longer have a printing paper segment and the remaining sales and operating profits previously reported in the printing papers business have been reclassified for segment reporting for all periods presented.

business segment operating profit in 2021 was $96 million higher than in 2020 as the benefits from higher average sales price realizations and mix ($1.6 billion) and higher sales volumes ($8 million) were partially offset by higher operating costs ($350 million), higher input costs ($981 million) and higher maintenance outage costs ($177 million).
the principal changes in operating profit by business segment were as follows:
•industrial packaging's operating profit of $1.6 billion was $119 million lower than in 2020 as the benefits of higher average sales price, favorable mix and higher sales volumes were more than offset by higher operating costs, higher input costs and higher maintenance outage costs.
•global cellulose fibers' operating loss improved $215 million to $3 million compared with 2020 as the benefits of higher average sales price, favorable mix and higher sales volumes were more than offset by higher operating costs, higher input costs and higher maintenance outage costs.
liquidity and capital resources including discontinued operations, international paper generated $2.0 billion of cash flow from operations for the year ended december 31, 2021, compared with $3.1 billion in 2020. capital spending for 2021 totaled $549 million, or 45% of depreciation and amortization expense. our liquidity position remains strong, supported by approximately $2.1 billion of credit facilities.
results of operations while the operating results for international paper's various business segments are driven by a number of business-specific factors, changes in international paper's operating results are closely tied to changes in general economic conditions in north america, europe, latin america, north africa and the middle east.
factors that impact the demand for our products include industrial non-durable goods production, consumer preferences, consumer spending and movements in currency exchange rates.
product prices are affected by a variety of factors including general economic trends, inventory levels, currency exchange rate movements and worldwide capacity utilization. in addition to these revenue-related factors, net earnings are impacted by various cost drivers, the more significant of which include changes in raw material costs, principally wood, recovered fiber and chemical costs; energy costs; freight costs; mill outage costs; salary and benefits costs, including pensions; and manufacturing conversion costs.
the following is a discussion of international paper's consolidated results of operations for the year ended december 31, 2021, and the major factors affecting these results compared to 2020.
for the year ended december 31, 2021, international paper reported net sales of $19.4 billion, compared with $17.6 billion in 2020. international net sales (based on the location of the seller and including u.s. exports) totaled $5.2 billion or 27% of total sales in 2021. this compares with international net sales of $4.8 billion in 2020.
full year 2021 net earnings attributable to international paper company totaled $1.8 billion ($4.47 per diluted share), compared with net earnings of $482 million ($1.22 per diluted share) in 2020. amounts in all periods include the results of discontinued operations.

(b)includes $649 million of net special items charges and $31 million of non-operating pension income.
compared with 2020, the benefits from higher average sales price and a favorable mix ($1.2 billion), higher sales volumes ($6 million), lower net interest expense ($82 million), and lower tax expense ($69 million) were partially offset by higher operating costs ($262 million), higher input costs ($734 million), higher maintenance outage costs ($133 million) and higher corporate and other costs ($51 million). in addition, 2021 results included higher equity earnings, net of taxes, relating to the company's investment in ilim and other investments, partially offset by lower equity earnings relating to the company's investment gpip.
see business segment results on pages 29 through 31 of item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations for a discussion of the impact of these factors by segment.
discontinued operations on october 1, 2021, the company completed the previously announced spin-off of its printing papers business along with certain mixed-use coated paperboard and pulp businesses in north america, france and russia into a standalone, publicly-traded company, sylvamo corporation. on august 6, 2021, the company completed the sale of its kwidzyn, poland mill which included the pulp and paper mill in kwidzyn and supporting functions. as a result of the sylvamo corporation spin-off and sale of kwidzyn, the company no longer has a printing papers business segment, and all current and historical results have been adjusted to reflect the kwidzyn and the printing papers business and other businesses conveyed to sylvamo corporation as discontinued operations. see note 8 on pages 61 through 63 of item 8. financial statements and supplementary data for further discussion.

driven by logistics issues and congestion at the chinese border, sales volumes for the joint venture decreased by 3% in 2021, primarily for softwood pulp and hardwood pulp shipments to china, partially offset by higher shipments of softwood pulp and hardwood pulp to russia and higher shipments of containerboard to china and other export markets. average sales margins were significantly higher for sales of softwood pulp, hardwood pulp and containerboard reflecting higher average sales prices. input costs were higher, primarily for wood, fuel and chemicals. distribution costs were negatively impacted by transportation tariffs and inflation. maintenance and repair expenses were higher. due to escalating regulations, an environmental reserve was recorded in 2021 for the siberian mill sites. the company received cash dividends from the joint venture of $154 million in 2021 and $141 million in 2020.
entering the first quarter of 2022, sales volumes are expected to be higher than in the fourth quarter of 2021, as distribution constraints at the chinese border are anticipated to be resolved. based on results to date in the current quarter, average sales margins are expected to decrease for softwood pulp and hardwood pulp shipped to china. average sales margins are expected to increase for shipments of containerboard to china. input costs for wood are projected to be higher due to seasonality. distribution costs will increase.
equity earnings - gpip international paper recorded equity earnings of $4 million in 2021 and $40 million in 2020 on its ownership position in gpip. the company received cash dividends from the investment of $5 million in 2021 and $20 million in 2020. the company no longer has an ownership interest in gpip - see description of business segments on pages 28 and 29 for further detail regarding our ownership interest.
liquidity and capital resources overview a major factor in international paper's liquidity and capital resource planning is its generation of operating cash flow, which is highly sensitive to changes in the pricing and demand for our major products. while changes in key operating cash costs, such as raw material, energy, mill outage and distribution, do have an effect on operating cash generation, we believe that our focus on commercial and operational excellence, as well as our ability to tightly manage costs and working capital has improved our cash flow generation over an operating cycle.
use of cash during 2021 was primarily focused on working capital requirements, capital spending, debt reduction and returning cash to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases under the company's share repurchase program.
cash provided by operating activities cash provided by operations, including discontinued operations, totaled $2.0 billion in 2021, compared with $3.1 billion for 2020. cash used by working capital components (accounts receivable, contract assets and inventory less accounts payable and accrued liabilities, interest payable and other) totaled $426 million in 2021, compared with cash provided by working capital components of $324 million in 2020.
cash dividends received from equity investments were $159 million in 2021, compared with $162 million in 2020.
investment activities including discontinued operations, investment activities in 2021 increased from 2020, as 2021 included proceeds from the sale of the kwidzyn, poland mill and the sale of our ownership interest in olmuksan international paper for $827 million, net of cash divested, proceeds from the monetization of our investment in graphic packaging international partners, llc (gpip) for $908 million (see note 11 equity method investments on pages 65 and 66 of item 8. financial statements and supplementary data) and proceeds of $4.85 billion from the settlement of the 2015 financing entities timber notes (see note 15 variable interest entities on pages 74 and 75 of item 8. financial statements and supplementary data). capital spending was $549 million in 2021, or 45% of depreciation and amortization, compared with $751 million in 2020, or 58% of depreciation and amortization. capital spending as a percentage of depreciation and amortization was 31% for global cellulose fibers and 46% for industrial packaging in 2021.
the following table shows capital spending by business segment for the years ended december 31, 2021 and 2020, excluding amounts related to discontinued operations of $69 million in 2021 and $88 million in 2020.

(a)reductions related to notes with interest rates ranging from 3.00% to 7.50% with original maturities from 2021 to 2048 for the years ended december 31, 2021 and 2020.
(b)amounts are included in restructuring and other charges in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations.
the company's early debt reductions in 2021 included debt tenders of $500 million with interest rates ranging from 4.80% to 5.15% and maturity dates ranging from 2035 to 2046, $200 million with an interest rate of 3.55% due in 2029, and $558 million with interest rates ranging from 4.35% to 4.40% and maturity dates ranging from 2047 to 2048. in addition to these debt tenders, the company had make whole calls of $517 million related to debt with an interest rate 3.80% due in 2026 and $268 million related to debt with an interest rate of 3.00% due in 2027. finally, the company had $429 million in open market repurchases related to debt with interest rates ranging from 3.00% to 5.38% and maturity dates ranging from 2027 to 2048. in addition to the early debt reductions, the company had debt reductions of $37 million in 2021 related primarily to capital leases, debt maturities, and international debt.
the company had debt issuances in 2021 of $1.5 billion related primarily to sylvamo debt issuances. in the fourth quarter of 2021, sylvamo made a $1.4 billion net cash distribution to the company as part of the spin-off.
other financing activities during 2021 included the net issuance of approximately 1.9 million shares of treasury stock. repurchases of common stock and payments of restricted stock withholding taxes totaled $838.6 million, including $810.9 million related to shares repurchased under the company's share repurchase program. the company has repurchased 85.1 million shares at an average price of $47.93, for a total of approximately $4.1 billion, since the repurchase program began in september 2013 through december 31, 2021. the company paid cash dividends totaling $780 million during 2021.
other financing activities during 2020 included the net issuance of approximately one million shares of treasury stock. repurchases of common stock and payments of restricted stock withholding taxes totaled $42 million, including $14 million related to shares repurchased under the company's share repurchase program. the company paid cash dividends totaling $806 million during 2020.
interest rate swaps our policy is to manage interest cost using a mixture of fixed-rate and variable-rate debt. to manage this risk, international paper utilizes interest rate swaps to change the mix of fixed and variable rate debt. during 2020, international paper terminated its interest rate swaps with a notional amount of $700 million and maturities ranging from 2024 to 2026 with an approximate fair value of $85 million. subsequent to the termination of the interest rate swaps, the fair value basis adjustment is amortized to earnings as interest income over the same period as a debt premium on the previously hedged debt. the company had no outstanding interest rate swaps for the years ended december 31, 2021 and 2020 (see note 17 derivatives and hedging activities on pages 76 through 79 of item 8. financial statements and supplementary data).
variable interest entities information concerning variable interest entities is set forth in note 15 variable interest entities on pages 74 through 75 of item 8. financial statements and supplementary data. in connection with the 2006 international paper installment sale of forestlands, we received $4.8 billion of installment notes. these installment notes were used by variable interest entities as collateral for borrowings from third-party lenders. these variable interest entities were restructured in 2015 when the installment notes and third-party loans were extended. the restructured variable interest entities held installment notes of $4.8 billion and third-party loans of $4.2 billion which both matured in august 2021. we settled the third-party loans at their maturity with the proceeds from the installment notes. this resulted in cash proceeds of approximately $630 million representing our equity in the variable interest entities. maturity of the installment notes and termination of the monetization structure also resulted in a $72 million tax liability that was paid in the fourth quarter of 2021. as of december 31, 2021, the company's remaining deferred tax liability associated with the 2015 financing entities was $813 million. the nature and timing of the income tax due related to these transactions is currently under review by the internal revenue service.
liquidity and capital resources outlook for 2022
we expect another year of solid cash generation in 2022. furthermore, we intend to continue to make choices for the use of cash that are consistent with our capital allocation framework to drive long-term value creation. these include maintaining a strong balance sheet and investment grade credit rating, returning meaningful cash to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases and making organic investments to maintain our world-class system and strengthen our packaging business.
our share repurchase program most recently approved by our board of directors on october 12, 2021, which does not have an expiration date, has approximately $2.9 billion aggregate amount of shares of common stock remaining authorized for purchase as of december 31, 2021. we may continue to repurchase shares under such authorization in open market transactions (including block trades), privately negotiated transactions or otherwise, subject to prevailing market conditions, our liquidity requirements, restrictions in our debt documents, applicable securities laws requirements and other factors. in addition, we pay regular quarterly cash dividends and expect to continue to pay regular quarterly cash dividends in the foreseeable future. each quarterly dividend is subject to review and approval by our board of directors, and is subject to restrictions in our debt documents.
capital expenditures and long-term debt capital spending for 2022 is planned at approximately $1.1 billion, or about 96% of depreciation and amortization.
at december 31, 2021, international paper's credit agreements totaled $2.1 billion, which is comprised of the $1.5 billion contractually committed bank credit agreement and up to $550 million under the receivables securitization program. management believes these credit agreements are adequate to cover expected operating cash flow variability during the current economic cycle. the credit agreements generally provide for interest rates at a floating rate index plus a pre-determined margin dependent upon international paper's credit rating. at december 31, 2021, the company had no borrowings outstanding under the $1.5 billion credit agreement or the $550 million receivables securitization program. the company's credit agreements are not subject to any restrictive covenants other than the financial covenants as disclosed on pages 75 and 76 in note 16 - debt and lines of credit of item 8. financial statements and supplementary data, and the borrowings under the receivables securitization program being limited by eligible receivables. the company was in compliance with all its debt covenants at december 31, 2021 and was well below the thresholds stipulated under the covenants as defined in the credit agreements. further the financial covenants do not restrict any borrowings under the credit agreements.
international paper also has a commercial paper program with a borrowing capacity up to $1.0 billion supported by its $1.5 billion credit agreement. under the terms of the program, individual maturities on borrowings may vary, but not exceed one year from the date of issue. interest bearing notes may be issued either as fixed or floating rate notes. the company had no borrowings outstanding as of december 31, 2021 under this program.
international paper expects to be able to meet projected capital expenditures, service existing debt, meet working capital and dividend requirements and make common stock and/or debt repurchases for the next 12 months and for the foreseeable future thereafter with current cash balances and cash from operations, supplemented as required by its existing credit facilities. the company will continue to rely on debt and capital markets for the majority of any necessary long-term funding not provided by operating cash flows. funding decisions will be guided by our capital structure planning objectives. the primary goals of the company's capital structure planning are to maximize financial flexibility and maintain appropriate levels of liquidity to meet our needs while managing balance sheet debt and interest expense, and we have repurchased, and may continue to repurchase, our common stock (under our existing share repurchase program) and debt (including in open market purchases) to the extent consistent with this capital structure planning. the majority of international paper's debt is accessed through global public capital markets where we have a wide base of investors. during 2020, management took various actions to further strengthen the company's liquidity position in response to the covid-19 pandemic. this included the company deferring the payment of our payroll taxes as allowed under cares act. the cares act allows for the deferral of the payment of the employer portion of social security taxes accrued between march 27, 2020 and december 31, 2020. under the cares act 50% of the deferred payroll taxes was paid in 2021 and the remainder will be paid by december 31, 2022. we believe that our credit agreements and commercial paper program provide us with sufficient liquidity to operate in the current environment; however, an extended period of economic disruption could impact our access to additional sources of liquidity.
maintaining an investment grade credit rating is an important element of international paper's financing strategy. at december 31, 2021, the company held long-term credit ratings of bbb (stable outlook) and baa2 (stable outlook) by s&p and moody's, respectively.
contractual obligations for future payments under existing debt and lease commitments and purchase obligations at december 31, 2021, were as follows:
in millions                                  2022          2023          2024          2025          2026        thereafter debt maturities (a)                      $196          $358          $149          $206           $73          $4,597

(a)includes financing lease obligations.
(b)includes $798 million relating to fiber supply agreements entered into at the time of the 2006 transformation plan forestland sales and in conjunction with the 2008 acquisition of weyerhaeuser company's containerboard, packaging and recycling business. also includes $979 million relating to fiber supply agreements assumed in conjunction with the 2016 acquisition of weyerhaeuser's pulp business.
(c)not included in the above table due to the uncertainty of the amount and timing of the payment are unrecognized tax benefits of approximately $160 million. also not included in the above table is $106 million of deemed repatriation transition tax associated with the 2017 tax cuts and jobs act which will be settled from 2022 - 2026.
we consider the undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries as of december 31, 2021, to be permanently reinvested and, accordingly, no u.s. income taxes have been provided thereon (see note 13 income taxes on pages 68 through 70 of item 8. financial statements and supplementary data). we do not anticipate the need to repatriate funds to the united states to satisfy domestic liquidity needs arising in the ordinary course of business, including liquidity needs associated with our domestic debt service requirements.
pension obligations and funding at december 31, 2021, the projected benefit obligation for the company's u.s. defined benefit plans determined under u.s. gaap was approximately $242 million lower than the fair value of plan assets, excluding non-u.s. plans. approximately $595 million of this amount relates to plans that are subject to minimum funding requirements. under current irs funding rules, the calculation of minimum funding requirements differs from the calculation of the present value of plan benefits (the "projected benefit obligation") for accounting purposes. in december 2008, the worker, retiree and employer recovery act of 2008 ("wera") was passed by the u.s. congress which provided for pension funding relief and technical corrections. funding contributions depend on the funding method selected by the company, and the timing of its implementation, as well as on actual demographic data and the targeted funding level. the company continually reassesses the amount and timing of any discretionary contributions and elected not to make any voluntary contributions in 2019, 2020 or 2021. at this time, we do not expect to have any required contributions to our plans in 2022, although the company may elect to make future voluntary contributions. the timing and amount of future contributions, which could be material, will depend on a number of factors, including the actual earnings and changes in values of plan assets and changes in interest rates.
ilim shareholders' agreement in october 2007, in connection with the formation of the ilim joint venture, international paper entered into a shareholders' agreement with an initial 15-year term expiring in october 2022 that automatically renews for successive five-year terms, unless terminated by either party. the shareholders' agreement also includes provisions relating to the reconciliation of disputes among the partners. this agreement provides that either the company or its partners may commence procedures specified under the deadlock provisions. if these or any other deadlock procedures under the shareholders' agreement are commenced, although it is not obligated to do so, the company may in certain situations choose to purchase its partners' 50% interest in ilim. any such transaction would be subject to review and approval by russian and other relevant antitrust authorities. based on the provisions of the agreement, the company estimates that the current purchase price for its partners' 50% interests would be approximately $2.3 billion, excluding the impact of ilim debt at december 31, 2021, which could be satisfied by payment of cash or international paper common stock, or some combination of the two, at the company's option. the purchase by the company of its partners' 50% interest in ilim would result in the consolidation of ilim's financial position and results of operations in all subsequent periods.
critical accounting policies and significant accounting estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires international paper to establish accounting policies and to make estimates that affect both the amounts and timing of the recording of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. some of these estimates require subjective judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain.
accounting policies whose application has had or is reasonably likely to have a material impact on the reported results of operations and financial position of international paper, and that can require a significant level of estimation or uncertainty by management that affect their application, include the accounting for contingencies, impairment or disposal of long-lived assets and goodwill, pensions and income taxes. the company has discussed the selection of critical accounting policies and the effect of significant estimates with the audit and finance committee of the company's board of directors and with its independent registered public accounting firm.
while we have taken into account certain impacts arising from covid-19 in connection with the accounting estimates reflected in this annual report on form 10-k, the full impact of covid-19 is unknown and cannot be reasonably estimated. however, we have made appropriate accounting estimates based on the facts and circumstances available as of the reporting date. to the extent there are differences between these estimates and actual results, our consolidated financial statements may be affected.
contingent liabilities accruals for contingent liabilities, including personal injury, product liability, environmental, asbestos and other legal matters, are recorded when it is probable that a liability has been incurred or an asset impaired and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. liabilities accrued for legal matters require judgments regarding projected outcomes and range of loss based on historical litigation and settlement experience and recommendations of legal counsel and, if applicable, other experts. liabilities for environmental matters require evaluations of relevant environmental regulations and estimates of future remediation alternatives and costs. liabilities for asbestos-related matters require reviews of recent and historical claims data. the company utilizes its in-house legal and environmental experts to develop estimates of its legal, environmental and asbestos obligations, supplemented as needed by third-party specialists to analyze its most complex contingent liabilities.
we calculate our workers' compensation reserves based on estimated actuarially calculated development factors. the workers' compensation reserves are reviewed at least quarterly to determine the adequacy of the accruals and related financial statement disclosure. while we believe that our assumptions are appropriate, the ultimate settlement of workers' compensation reserves may differ significantly from amounts we have accrued in our consolidated financial statements.
brazil goodwill tax matter: the brazilian federal revenue service has challenged the deductibility of goodwill amortization generated in a 2007 acquisition by sylvamo do brasil ltda., a wholly-owned subsidiary of the company until the october 1, 2021 spin-off of the printing papers business. the company received assessments for the tax years
2007-2015 totaling approximately $106 million in tax, and $351 million in interest, penalties, and fees as of december 31, 2021 (adjusted for variation in currency exchange rates). after a previous favorable ruling challenging the basis for these assessments, we received other subsequent unfavorable decisions from the brazilian administrative council of tax appeals. the company has appealed and intends to further appeal these and any future unfavorable administrative judgments to the brazilian federal courts; however, this tax litigation matter may take many years to resolve. the company believes that it has appropriately evaluated the transaction underlying these assessments, and has concluded based on brazilian tax law, that its tax position would be sustained.
the company intends to vigorously defend its position against the current assessments and any similar assessments that may be issued for tax years subsequent to 2015. this assessment pertains to a business that was conveyed to sylvamo corporation as of october 1, 2021, as part of our spin-off transaction. pursuant to the terms of the tax matters agreement entered into between the company and sylvamo corporation, the company will pay 60% and sylvamo will pay 40%, on up to $300 million of any tax assessment related to the matter, and the company will pay all amounts of the assessment over $300 million. the brazilian government may enact a tax amnesty program that would allow sylvamo do brasil ltda. to resolve this dispute for less than the assessed amount. in addition, all decisions concerning the conduct of the litigation related to this matter, including strategy, settlement, pursuit and abandonment, continue to be made by the company. sylvamo corporation thus has no control over any decision related to this ongoing litigation. as of october 1, 2021, in connection with the recording of the distribution of assets and liabilities resulting from the spin-off transaction, the company has established a liability representing the initial fair value of the contingent liability under the tax matter agreement. the contingent liability was determined in accordance with asc 460 "guarantees" based on the probability weighting of various possible outcomes. the initial fair value estimate and recorded liability as of december 31, 2021 is $48 million. this liability will not be adjusted in subsequent periods unless facts and circumstances change such that an amount greater than the initial recognized liability becomes probable and estimable.
impairment of long-lived assets and goodwill an impairment of a long-lived asset exists when the asset's carrying amount exceeds its fair value, and is recorded when the carrying amount is not recoverable through undiscounted cash flows from future operations or disposals. a goodwill impairment exists when the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its fair value. assessments of possible impairments of long-lived assets and goodwill are made when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable through future operations. additionally, evaluation for possible impairment of goodwill is required annually. the amount and timing of any impairment charges based on these assessments may require the estimation of future cash flows or the fair market value of the related assets based on management's best estimates of certain key factors, including future selling prices and volumes, operating, raw material, energy and freight costs, various other projected operating economic factors and other intended uses of the assets. as these key factors change in future periods, the company will update its impairment analysis to reflect its latest estimates and projections.
asu 2011-08, "intangibles - goodwill and other," allows entities testing goodwill for impairment the option of performing a qualitative assessment before performing the quantitative goodwill impairment test. if a qualitative assessment is performed, an entity is not required to perform the quantitative goodwill impairment test unless the entity determines that, based on that qualitative assessment, it is more likely than not that its fair value is less than its carrying value.
the company performed its annual testing of its reporting units for possible goodwill impairments by applying the qualitative assessment to its north america industrial packaging reporting unit and the quantitative goodwill impairment test to its emea industrial packaging reporting unit as of october 1, 2021.
for the current year evaluation, the company assessed various assumptions, events and circumstances that would have affected the estimated fair value of the north america industrial packaging reporting unit under the qualitative assessment and the results of the qualitative assessments indicated that it was not more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit was less than its carrying value.
the company also performed the quantitative goodwill impairment test which included comparing the carrying amount of the emea industrial packaging reporting unit to its estimated fair value. the company performed the quantitative goodwill impairment test for emea industrial packaging due to the changes in the reporting unit's asset base as a result of acquisitions and divestitures since the previous quantitative goodwill impairment test. the company calculated the estimated fair value of the reporting unit using a weighted approach based on discounted future cash flows, market multiples and transaction multiples. the determination of fair value using the discounted cash flow approach requires management to make significant estimates and assumptions related to forecasts of future revenues, operating profit margins, and discount rates. the determination of fair value using market multiples and transaction multiples requires management to make significant assumptions related to revenue multiples and adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization ("ebitda") multiples. the results of our annual impairment test indicated that the carrying amount did not exceed the estimated fair value of the emea industrial packaging reporting unit.
in addition, the company considered whether there were any events or circumstances outside of the annual evaluation that would reduce the fair value of its reporting units below their carrying amounts and necessitate a goodwill impairment evaluation. in consideration of all relevant factors, there were no indicators that would require goodwill impairment subsequent to october 1, 2021.
pension benefit obligations the charges recorded for pension benefit obligations are determined annually in conjunction with international paper's consulting actuary, and are dependent upon various assumptions including the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets, discount rates, projected future compensation increases and mortality rates.
the calculations of pension obligations and expenses require decisions about a number of key assumptions that can significantly affect liability and expense amounts, including the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets and the discount rate used to calculate plan liabilities.
in advance of the spin-off of the printing papers segment into a standalone, publicly traded company, sylvamo, a legally separate sylvamo pension plan was established to transfer both pension liabilities and qualified pension assets for the approximately 900 active qualified pension participants who transitioned to sylvamo. effective september 1, 2021, the retirement plan of international paper and the sylvamo pension plan were legally separated and remeasured as of that date.
benefit obligations and fair values of plan assets as of december 31, 2021, for international paper's pension plan were as follows:
in millions                              benefit   fair value of obligation   plan assets u.s. qualified pension             $11,480         $12,075
u.s. nonqualified pension              353         -
non-u.s. pension                        65                  19
the table below shows the discount rate used by international paper to calculate u.s. pension obligations for the years shown:
2021                                      2020          2019
discount rate           2.90   %      2.60   %      3.40   %
international paper determines these actuarial assumptions, after consultation with our actuaries, on december 31 of each year or more frequently if required, to calculate liability information as of that date and pension expense for the following year. the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets is based on projected rates of return for current asset classes in the plan's investment portfolio. the discount rate assumption was determined based on a hypothetical settlement portfolio selected from a universe of high quality corporate bonds.
the weighted average expected long-term rate of return on u.s. pension plan assets used to determine net periodic cost for the year ended december 31, 2021 was 6.40%.
increasing (decreasing) the expected long-term rate of return on u.s. plan assets by an additional 0.25% would decrease (increase) 2022 pension expense by approximately $27 million, while a (decrease) increase of 0.25% in the discount rate would (increase) decrease pension expense by approximately $19 million.
actual rates of return earned on u.s. pension plan assets for each of the last 10 years were:
year         return        year         return
2021       7.7    %        2016       7.1    %
2020      24.7    %        2015       1.3    %
2019      23.9    %        2014       6.4    %
2018     (3.0)    %        2013      14.1    %
2017      19.3    %        2012      14.1    %
the 2012, 2013 and 2014 returns above represent weighted averages of international paper and temple-inland asset returns. international paper and temple-inland assets were combined in october 2014. the annualized time-weighted rate of return
37
earned on u.s. pension plan assets was 14.0% and 11.3% for the past five and ten years, respectively.
asc 715, "compensation - retirement benefits," provides for delayed recognition of actuarial gains and losses, including amounts arising from changes in the estimated projected plan benefit obligation due to changes in the assumed discount rate, differences between the actual and expected return on plan assets, and other assumption changes. these net gains and losses are recognized in pension expense prospectively over a period that approximates the average remaining service period of active employees expected to receive benefits under the plans to the extent that they are not offset by gains and losses in subsequent years.
net periodic pension plan expenses, calculated for all of international paper's plans, were as follows:
in millions                      2021                 2020        2019          2018          2017
pension (income) expense u.s. plans                       $(112)            $32         $93          $632          $717
non-u.s. plans                   4                   5           6             4             5
net (income) expense             $(108)            $37         $99          $636          $722
the decrease in 2021 pension expense primarily reflects a higher asset returns, lower interest cost due to a lower discount rate and lower actuarial loss due to a higher amortization period slightly offset by higher service cost.
assuming that discount rates, expected long-term returns on plan assets and rates of future compensation increases remain the same as of december 31, 2021, projected future net periodic pension plan expense (income) would be as follows:
in millions                      2023            2022
pension expense (income)
u.s. plans                       $(165)          $(114)
non-u.s. plans                   5                       5
net (income) expense             $(160)          $(109)
the company estimates that it will record net pension income of approximately $114 million for its u.s. defined benefit plans in 2022, compared to income of $112 million in 2021.
the market value of plan assets for international paper's u.s. qualified pension plan at december 31, 2021 totaled approximately $12.1 billion, consisting of approximately 18% equity securities, 68% debt securities, 8% real estate funds and 6% other assets. the company's funding policy for its qualified pension plans is to contribute amounts sufficient to meet legal funding requirements, plus any additional amounts that the company may determine to be appropriate considering the funded status of the plan, tax deductibility, the cash flows generated by the company, and other factors. the company continually reassesses the amount and timing of any discretionary contributions and could elect to make voluntary contributions in the future. there were no required contributions to the u.s. qualified plan in 2021. the nonqualified defined benefit plans are funded to the extent of benefit payments, which totaled $21 million for the year ended december 31, 2021.
income taxes international paper records its global tax provision based on the respective tax rules and regulations for the jurisdictions in which it operates. where the company believes that a tax position is supportable for income tax purposes, the item is included in its income tax returns. where treatment of a position is uncertain, liabilities are recorded based upon the company's evaluation of the "more likely than not" outcome considering technical merits of the position based on specific tax regulations and facts of each matter. changes to recorded liabilities are only made when an identifiable event occurs that changes the likely outcome, such as settlement with the relevant tax authority, the expiration of statutes of limitation for the subject tax year, change in tax laws, or recent court cases that are relevant to the matter.
valuation allowances are recorded to reduce deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will not be realized. significant judgment is required in evaluating the need for and magnitude of appropriate valuation allowances against deferred tax assets. the realization of these assets is dependent on generating future taxable income, as well as successful implementation of various tax planning strategies.
while international paper believes that these judgments and estimates are appropriate and reasonable under the circumstances, actual resolution of these matters may differ from recorded estimated amounts.
legal proceedings information concerning the company's environmental and legal proceedings is set forth in note 14 commitments and contingent liabilities on pages 70 through 74 of item  8. financial statements and supplementary data.
recent accounting developments see note 2 recent accounting developments on page 56 of item 8. financial statements and supplementary data for a discussion of new accounting pronouncements.
effect of inflation while inflationary increases in certain input costs, such as energy, wood fiber and chemical costs, have an impact on the company's operating results, changes in general inflation have had minimal impact on our operating results in 2019 and 2020. the effects of inflation in the current year have been more significant than prior years as the pandemic has had an impact on economic conditions, including labor market conditions, economic activity, consumer behavior, supply shortages and disruptions and inflationary pressures. sales prices and volumes are primarily influenced by economic supply and demand factors in specific markets and by exchange rate fluctuations but are also currently being impacted by the current inflationary environment.
foreign currency effects international paper has operations in a number of countries. its operations in those countries also export to, and compete with, imports from other regions. as such, currency movements can have a number of direct and indirect impacts on the company's financial statements. direct impacts include the translation of international operations' local currency financial statements into u.s. dollars and the remeasurement impact associated with non-functional currency financial assets and liabilities. indirect impacts include the change in competitiveness of imports into, and exports out of, the united states (and the impact on local currency pricing of products that are traded internationally). in general, a weaker u.s. dollar and stronger local currency is beneficial to international paper. the currency that has the most impact is the euro.
market risk we use financial instruments, including fixed and variable rate debt, to finance operations, for capital spending programs and for general corporate purposes. additionally, financial instruments, including various derivative contracts, are used to hedge exposures to interest rate, commodity and foreign currency risks. we do not use financial instruments for trading purposes. information related to international paper's debt obligations is included in note 16 debt and lines of credit on pages 75 and 76 of item 8. financial statements and supplementary data. a discussion of derivatives and hedging activities is included in note 17 derivatives and hedging activities on pages 76 through 79 of item 8. financial statements and supplementary data.
the fair value of our debt and financial instruments varies due to changes in market interest and foreign currency rates and commodity prices since the inception of the related instruments. we assess this market risk utilizing a sensitivity analysis. the sensitivity analysis measures the potential loss in earnings, fair values and cash flows based on a hypothetical 10% change (increase and decrease) in interest and currency rates and commodity prices.
interest rate risk our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to short- and long-term debt obligations and investments in marketable securities. we invest in investment-grade securities of financial institutions and money market mutual funds with a minimum rating of aaa and limit exposure to any one issuer or fund. our investments in marketable securities at december 31, 2021 and 2020 are stated at cost, which approximates market due to their short-term nature. our interest rate risk exposure related to these investments was not material.
we issue fixed and floating rate debt in a proportion that management deems appropriate based on current and projected market conditions. derivative instruments, such as, interest rate swaps, may be used to execute this strategy. at december 31, 2021 and 2020, the fair value of the net liability of financial instruments with exposure to interest rate risk was approximately $6.7 billion and $9.3 billion, respectively. the potential increase in fair value resulting from a 10% adverse shift in quoted interest rates would have been approximately $304 million and $443 million at december 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.
commodity price risk the objective of our commodity exposure management is to minimize volatility in earnings due to large fluctuations in the price of commodities. commodity swap or forward purchase contracts may be used to manage risks associated with market fluctuations in energy prices. at december 31, 2021 and 2020, the net fair value of these contracts was immaterial and the potential loss in fair value from a 10% adverse change in quoted commodity prices for these contracts was also immaterial.
foreign currency risk international paper transacts business in many currencies and is also subject to currency exchange rate risk through investments and businesses owned and operated in foreign countries. our objective in managing the associated foreign currency risks is to minimize the effect of adverse exchange rate fluctuations on our after-tax cash flows. we address these risks on a limited basis by entering into cross-currency interest rate swaps, or foreign exchange contracts. at december 31, 2021 and 2020, the net fair value of financial instruments with exposure to foreign currency risk was immaterial. the potential loss in fair value for such financial instruments from a 10% adverse change in quoted foreign currency exchange rates was also immaterial.

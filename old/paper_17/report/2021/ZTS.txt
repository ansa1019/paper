|
•our r&d relies on evaluations in animals, which may become subject to bans or additional restrictive regulations.
risks related to manufacturing
•manufacturing problems and capacity imbalances may cause product launch delays, inventory shortages, recalls or unanticipated costs.
•we rely on third parties to provide us with materials and services, and are subject to increased labor and material costs and potential disruptions in supply.
•there may be delays and additional costs due to changes to our existing manufacturing facilities and the construction of new manufacturing plants.
risks related to legal matters and regulation
•our business is subject to substantial regulation.
•the misuse or off-label use of our products may harm our reputation or result in financial or other damages.
•laws and regulations governing global trade compliance could adversely impact our business.
•our operations and reputation may be impacted if we do not comply with continually changing laws and regulations regarding data privacy.
risks related to operating in foreign jurisdictions
•a significant portion of our operations are conducted in foreign jurisdictions, including jurisdictions presenting a high risk of bribery and corruption, and are subject to the economic, political, legal and business environments of the countries in which we do business.
•we may not be able to realize the expected benefits of our investments in emerging markets and are subject to certain risks due to our presence in emerging markets, including political or economic instability and failure to adequately comply with legal and regulatory requirements.

risks related to our relationship with pfizer
•certain of our directors may have actual or potential conflicts of interest because of their positions with pfizer.
•pfizer's rights as licensor under the patent and know-how license could limit our ability to develop and commercialize certain products.
•we are dependent on pfizer to prosecute, maintain and enforce certain intellectual property.
•if there is a later determination that the exchange offer or certain related transactions are taxable for u.s. federal income tax purposes because the facts, assumptions, representations or undertakings underlying the irs private letter ruling and/or any tax opinion are incorrect or for any other reason, we could incur significant liabilities.
risks related to our business and industry the covid-19 pandemic has negatively affected the global economy; has disrupted our and our customers', suppliers', and vendors' operations; has negatively affected certain elements of our business and operations; and may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and/or cash flows.
our global operations expose us to risks associated with public health crises, including epidemics and pandemics such as the novel coronavirus (covid-19). the global spread of covid-19 has had, and may continue to have, an adverse impact on our operations, sales and delivery and supply chains. the spread of covid-19 has resulted in authorities in various jurisdictions in which we operate implementing numerous measures since late 2019 to try to contain the virus, such as travel bans and restrictions, quarantines, shelter in place orders and shutdowns of non-essential businesses. there is no certainty that measures taken by governmental authorities will be sufficient to mitigate the risks posed by the virus, and our ability to continue to perform critical functions could be harmed.
the covid-19 pandemic has and may continue to impact our supply chain as we experience disruptions or delays in shipments of certain materials or components of our products. any prolonged component shortages or supply chain disruption may result in manufacturing or r&d delays and could limit our ability to meet customer demand or otherwise adversely impact our revenue, and may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and/or cash flows.
the covid-19 pandemic also has and may continue to reduce demand for some of our products as a result of the negative impact it has had and may continue to have on our customers. in particular, our livestock customers have been and may continue to be challenged by voluntary or mandatory facility closures, reduced packing plant capacity, travel bans and quarantines inhibiting consumption of protein and transportation of live animals, and labor shortages negatively impacting their operations. for example, a number of significant meat processing plants were
|
closed temporarily in 2020 after employees tested positive for covid-19, and plants continue to experience periodic disruptions. the resulting reduction in demand for some of our products has negatively impacted our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows and may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and/or cash flows, if such demand reduction accelerates or is prolonged.
additionally, many of our workforce continue to work remotely as a result of the pandemic. remote working arrangements could result in additional complexity or inefficiency or increase operational risks, including, but not limited to, risks associated with information technology and systems which could have a material adverse effect on our business.
additionally, on september 9, 2021, u.s. president biden issued an executive order requiring federal employees and covered contractors to be vaccinated against covid-19. on november 4, 2021, the u.s. department of labor's occupational safety and health administration (osha) issued a covid-19 vaccination and testing emergency temporary standard requiring all employers with 100 or more employees to ensure that their employees are fully vaccinated or tested for covid-19 on at least a weekly basis, the u.s. supreme court recently stayed implementation of this osha standard and we cannot predict the eventual outcome or impact on us, our suppliers or our customers. additional vaccine and testing mandates may be announced in other jurisdictions in which we operate our business. while it is not currently possible to predict with any certainty the exact impact the new regulations would have on us, our suppliers and our customers, the implementation of such government mandated vaccination or testing mandates may impact our ability to retain current employees and attract new employees and result in labor disruptions. further, implementation could also have similar consequences for our subcontractors, which may impact their ability to deliver the goods and services we need from them, and for our customers, which may impact their business processes and as a result their demand for our products.
we cannot at this time predict the full impact of the covid-19 pandemic, but we anticipate that the covid-19 pandemic is likely to continue to impact our business, financial condition, results of operations and/or cash flows in 2022. weak global economic conditions also may exacerbate the ongoing impact of the pandemic. the impact of the covid-19 pandemic may also exacerbate the other risks discussed in this risk factors section, any of which could have a material effect on us. this situation continues to change rapidly, especially as new variants of the virus are identified and additional impacts may arise that we are not aware of currently.
our products are subject to unanticipated safety, quality or efficacy concerns.
unanticipated safety, quality or efficacy concerns can arise with respect to our products, whether or not scientifically or clinically supported, which can lead to product recalls, withdrawals or suspended or declining sales, as well as product liability and other claims.
regulatory actions based on these types of safety, quality or efficacy concerns could impact all or a significant portion of a product's sales and could, depending on the circumstances, materially adversely affect our operating results.
in addition, since we depend on positive perceptions of the safety, quality and efficacy of our products, and animal health products generally, by our customers, veterinarians and end-users, any concerns as to the safety, quality or efficacy of our products, whether actual or perceived, may harm our reputation or materially adversely affect our operating results and financial condition, regardless of whether such concerns are accurate.
our results of operations are dependent upon the success of our top-selling products.
if any of our top-selling products experience issues, such as loss of patent protection, material product liability litigation, new or unexpected side effects, manufacturing disruptions, regulatory proceedings, labeling changes, negative publicity, changes to veterinarian or customer preferences, and/or disruptive innovations or the introduction of more effective products, our revenues could be negatively impacted, perhaps significantly. our five top-selling products, apoquel, simparica/simparica trio, revolution/revolution plus/stronghold, cytopoint and the ceftiofur product line, contributed approximately 33% of our revenue in 2021. any issues with these top-selling products would have a more significant impact to our results of operations.
generic and other products may be viewed as more cost-effective than our products.
we face competition from products produced by other companies, including generic alternatives to our products. we depend on patents and regulatory data exclusivity periods to provide us with exclusive marketing rights for some of our products. patents for individual products expire at different times based on the date of the patent filing (or sometimes the date of patent grant) and the legal term of patents in the countries where such patents are obtained. the extent of protection afforded by our patents varies from country to country and is limited by the scope of the claimed subject matter of our patents, the term of the patent and the availability and enforcement of legal remedies in the applicable country. as a result, we face competition from lower-priced generic alternatives to many of our products that no longer have patent protection. in certain circumstances, we have been forced to lower our prices and provide discounts or rebates in order to compete with generic products. generic competitors are becoming more aggressive in terms of launching at risk before patent rights expire and, because of their pricing, are an increasing percentage of overall animal health sales in certain regions. for example, several companies have launched generic versions of our rimadyl chewable product. in the years since the start of generic and other competition, sales of our rimadyl chewable product have declined by approximately 19% in the u.s., its largest market. in 2021, the first year of generic competition, sales of draxxin declined by 12% in the u.s., its largest market, and additional declines are expected in subsequent years.
although the impact of generic competition in the animal health industry to date has not typically mirrored that seen in human health, in certain markets, the impact of generic competition in the future may more closely mirror human health as a result of changes in industry dynamics, such as channel expansion, customer consolidation, an increase in the availability and use of pet insurance and the potential for generic competition by established animal health businesses. if animal health customers increase their use of new or existing generic products, our operating results and financial condition could be materially adversely affected.
|
some of our products' patents have expired, and over the next few years, additional products' patents will expire as described below.
•draxxin: patents relating to the active ingredient (tulathromycin) and formulation of draxxin have expired, with the exception of the active ingredient and formulation patents in japan that expire in 2023 and 2025, respectively. in brazil, there are patents for the active ingredient and formulation which expire in february 2022 and in 2025, respectively, although their current status is uncertain. generic or other competing tulathromycin products are now marketed in many markets including the u.s., europe, canada, mexico and australia, as well as in many smaller markets, and are now marketed for swine in brazil. additional marketing authorizations for generic tulathromycin products may be granted in various markets in the future. sales of draxxin have been negatively affected by generic competition in the markets where the patents have expired.
•ceftiofur: all patents relating to the active ingredient of excede/naxcel (ceftiofur crystalline free acid) have expired. the patents covering the commercial formulation of excede in the u.s., japan and brazil extend to 2024, 2026, and 2027, respectively, but the corresponding patents in europe, canada and australia expired in september 2021. the commercial method of administration patent relevant to the product line expires in 2023 in the u.s., europe and australia, and in 2028 in japan. generic versions of excede have entered the market in mexico and russia. at this time, the market entry of a generic version of excede in the u.s. is not anticipated before 2024.
•revolution/stronghold: all patents relating to revolution/stronghold containing selamectin as the sole active ingredient have expired. generic versions of selamectin are now sold in markets including the u.s., europe, australia and canada. selamectin is one of the active ingredients in our combination parasiticide product, revolution plus/stronghold plus, which is separately patent protected.
•convenia: the patent for the active ingredient of convenia (cefovecin sodium) has expired in all countries, and the patents covering the commercial formulation expire in europe, australia, canada and japan in november 2022, in the u.s. in october 2023, and in brazil in 2025.
•cerenia: the patent for the active ingredient of cerenia has expired in all countries and the formulation patents relevant to the injectable product line expire between 2025 and 2028. generic versions of cerenia injectable have been registered and marketed in europe, and we are aware that regulatory approval of at least one generic version of cerenia injectable is currently being pursued in the u.s. there is also a pending registration for generic version of cerenia injectable in australia.
•proheart: all patents covering proheart 6 and proheart 12 have expired.
zoetis typically enforces its patents vigorously as appropriate both within and outside the u.s., including by filing infringement claims against other parties.
the animal health industry is highly competitive.
the animal health industry is highly competitive. we believe many of our competitors are conducting r&d activities in areas served by our products and in areas in which we are developing products. our competitors include standalone animal health businesses and the animal health businesses of large pharmaceutical companies. there are also many start-up companies working in the animal health area. we also compete with companies that produce generic products, but the level of competition from generic products varies from market to market. these competitors may have access to greater financial, marketing, technical and other resources or have significant market share in particular areas. as a result, they may be able to devote more resources to developing, manufacturing, marketing and selling their products, initiating or withstanding substantial price competition or more readily taking advantage of acquisitions or other opportunities. in recent years, there has been an increase in consolidation in the animal health industry, which could result in existing competitors realizing additional efficiencies or improving portfolio bundling opportunities, thereby potentially increasing their market share and pricing power, which could lead to a decrease in our revenue and profitability and an increase in competition. in addition to competition from established market participants, new entrants to the animal health medicines, vaccines and diagnostics industry, including start-up companies, could substantially reduce our market share or render our products obsolete.
to the extent that any of our competitors are more successful with respect to any key competitive factor or we are forced to reduce, or are unable to raise, the price of any of our products in order to remain competitive, our operating results and financial condition could be materially adversely affected.
disruptive innovations and advances in medical practices and technologies could negatively affect the market for our products.
the market for our products could be impacted negatively by the introduction and/or broad market acceptance of newly-developed or alternative products that address the diseases and conditions for which we sell products, including "green" or "holistic" health products or specially bred disease-resistant animals. in addition, technological breakthroughs by others may obviate our technology and reduce or eliminate the market for our products. introduction or acceptance of such products or technologies could materially adversely affect our operating results and financial condition.
consolidation of our customers and distributors could negatively affect the pricing of our products.
veterinarians and livestock producers are our primary customers. in recent years, there has been a trend towards the concentration of veterinarians in large clinics and hospitals. in addition, livestock producers, particularly swine and poultry producers, and our distributors, have seen consolidation in their industries. furthermore, we have seen the expansion of larger cross-border corporate customers and an increase in the consolidation of buying groups (cooperatives of veterinary practices that leverage volume to pursue discounts from manufacturers). the pace of consolidation and structure of markets varies greatly across geographies. if these trends towards consolidation continue, these customers and distributors could attempt to improve their profitability by leveraging their buying power to obtain favorable pricing. the resulting decrease in our prices could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition.
|
changes in distribution channels for companion animal products could negatively impact our market share, margins and distribution of our products.
in most markets, companion animal owners typically purchase their animal health products directly from veterinarians. companion animal owners increasingly have the option to purchase animal health products from sources other than veterinarians, such as internet-based retailers, "big-box" retail stores or other over-the-counter distribution channels. this trend has been demonstrated by the significant shift away from the veterinarian distribution channel in the sale of flea and tick products in recent years and has been accelerated by the increase in e-commerce during the covid-19 pandemic. companion animal owners also could decrease their reliance on, and visits to, veterinarians as they rely more on internet-based animal health information. because we primarily market our companion animal products through the veterinarian distribution channel, any decrease in visits to veterinarians by companion animal owners could reduce our market share for such products and materially adversely affect our operating results and financial condition. in addition, companion animal owners may substitute human health products for animal health products if human health products are deemed to be lower-cost alternatives.
legislation has also been proposed in the u.s. in the past, and may be proposed in the u.s. or abroad in the future, that could impact the distribution channels for our companion animal products. for example, such legislation may require veterinarians to provide pet owners with written prescriptions and disclosure that the pet owner may fill prescriptions through a third party, which may further reduce the number of pet owners who purchase their animal health products directly from veterinarians. such requirements may lead to increased use of generic alternatives to our products or the increased substitution of our products with other animal health products or human health products if such other products are deemed to be lower-cost alternatives. many states already have regulations requiring veterinarians to provide prescriptions to pet owners upon request and the american veterinary medical association has long-standing policies in place to encourage this practice.
in the u.s. and certain other markets, these and other competitive conditions have increased, and may continue to increase, our reliance on internet-based retailers, "big-box" retail stores or other over-the-counter distribution channels to sell our companion animal products. over time we may be unable to sustain our current margins due to the increased purchasing power of such retailers as compared to traditional veterinary practices.
any of these events could materially adversely affect our operating results and financial condition.
we may not successfully acquire and integrate other businesses, license rights to technologies or products, form and manage alliances or divest businesses.
we pursue acquisitions, technology licensing arrangements, strategic alliances or divestitures of some of our businesses as part of our business strategy. we may not complete these transactions in a timely manner, on a cost-effective basis or at all. in addition, we may be subject to regulatory constraints or limitations or other unforeseen factors that prevent us from realizing the expected benefits. even if we are successful in making an acquisition, the products and technologies that are acquired may not be successful or may require significantly greater resources and investments than originally anticipated. we may be unable to integrate acquisitions successfully into our existing business, and we may be unable to achieve expected gross margin improvements or efficiencies. we also could incur or assume significant debt and unknown or contingent liabilities. divesting businesses entails numerous operational and financial risks, including difficulties separating businesses or product groups, diversion of management's attention away from other business concerns, adverse customer reactions, and potential loss of key employees or customers. our reported results of operations could be negatively affected by acquisition or disposition-related charges, amortization of expenses related to intangibles and charges for impairment of long-term assets. we may be subject to litigation in connection with, or as a result of, acquisitions, dispositions, licenses or other alliances, including claims from terminated employees, customers or third parties, and we may be liable for future or existing litigation and claims related to the acquired business, disposition, license or other alliance because either we are not indemnified for such claims or the indemnification is insufficient.
while our evaluation of any potential transaction includes business, legal and financial due diligence with the goal of identifying and evaluating the material risks involved, our due diligence reviews may not identify all of the issues necessary to accurately estimate the cost and potential loss contingencies of a particular transaction, including potential exposure to regulatory sanctions or fines resulting from an acquisition target's previous activities, inadequate controls, or costs associated with any quality issues with an acquisition target's legacy products.
any of these events could cause us to incur significant expenses and could materially adversely affect our operating results and financial condition.
acquiring or implementing new business lines or offering new products and services may subject us to additional risks.
from time to time, we may acquire or implement new business lines or offer new products and services within existing lines of business. for example, we have recently expanded our diagnostics business with additional point-of-care offerings and reference labs. we are also investing in genetics and precision animal health, digital technology and data analytics and insurance agency services. there may be substantial risks and uncertainties associated with these efforts. we may invest significant time and resources in developing, marketing, or acquiring new lines of business and/or offering new products and services. initial timetables for the introduction and development or acquisition of new lines of business and/or the offering of new products or services may not be achieved, and price and profitability targets may prove to be unachievable. our lack of experience or knowledge, as well as external factors, such as compliance with regulations, competitive alternatives and shifting market preferences, may also impact the success of an acquisition or the implementation of a new line of business or a new product or service. new business lines or new products and services within existing lines of business could affect the sales and profitability of existing lines of business or products and services. other risks include: (i) potential diversion of management's attention, available cash, and other resources from our existing businesses; (ii) unanticipated liabilities or contingencies; (iii) the need for additional capital and other resources to expand into or acquire the new line of business; (iv) potential damage to existing customer relationships, lack of customer acceptance or inability to attract new customers; and (v) the inability to compete effectively. failure to successfully manage these risks in the implementation or
|
acquisition of new lines of business or the offering of new products or services could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, business, results of operations, and financial condition.
restrictions and bans on the use of and consumer preferences regarding antibacterials in food-producing animals may become more prevalent.
the issue of the potential transfer of increased antibacterial resistance in bacteria from food-producing animals to human pathogens, and the causality of that transfer, continue to be the subject of global scientific and regulatory discussion. antibacterials refer to small molecules that can be used to treat or prevent bacterial infections and are a sub-categorization of the products that make up our anti-infectives and medicated feed additives portfolios. in some countries, this issue has led to government restrictions and bans on the use of specific antibacterials in some food-producing animals, regardless of the route of administration (in feed or injectable). these restrictions are more prevalent in countries where animal protein is plentiful and governments are willing to take action even when there is scientific uncertainty. our total revenue attributable to antibacterials for livestock was approximately $1.1 billion for the year ended december 31, 2021.
for example, regulations regarding antibiotic usage in animals have been introduced in certain markets, including the u.s., the eu, china, france, germany, and vietnam. in addition, certain jurisdictions like italy have implemented the use of electronic prescriptions, which has caused more disciplined use of antibiotics and decreased the demand for our products.
in certain markets, there has been an increase in consumer preference towards proteins produced without the use of antibiotics.
we cannot predict whether antibacterial resistance concerns will result in additional restrictions or bans, expanded regulations, public pressure to discontinue or reduce use of antibacterials in food-producing animals or increased consumer preference for antibiotic-free protein, any of which could materially adversely affect our operating results and financial condition.
perceived adverse effects linked to the consumption of food derived from animals that utilize our products or animals generally could cause a decline in the sales of such products.
our livestock business depends heavily on a healthy and growing livestock industry. if the public perceives a risk to human health from the consumption of the food derived from animals that utilize our products, there may be a decline in the production of such food products and, in turn, demand for our products. for example, livestock producers may experience decreased demand for their products or reputational harm as a result of evolving consumer views of animal rights, nutrition, health-related, environmental or other concerns. furthermore, changing consumer preferences and increasing consumer interest in alternatives to animal-based protein and dairy products has driven the growth of plant-based substitutes. any reputational harm to the livestock industry may also extend to companies in related industries, including our company. adverse consumer views related to the use of one or more of our products in livestock also may result in a decrease in the use of such products and could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition.
our business is subject to risk based on global economic conditions.
macroeconomic, business and financial disruptions, including inflation, could have a material adverse effect on our operating results, financial condition and liquidity. certain of our customers and suppliers could be affected directly by an economic downturn and could face credit issues or cash flow problems that could give rise to payment delays, increased credit risk, bankruptcies and other financial hardships that could decrease the demand for our products or hinder our ability to collect amounts due from customers. if one or more of our large customers, including distributors, discontinue their relationship with us as a result of economic conditions or otherwise, our operating results and financial condition may be materially adversely affected. in addition, economic concerns may cause some pet owners to forgo or defer visits to veterinary practices or could reduce their willingness to treat pet health conditions or even to continue to own a pet. moreover, customers may seek lower price alternatives to our products if they are negatively impacted by poor economic conditions. infectious disease outbreaks, pandemics and widespread fear of spreading disease through human contact can cause disruptions to or negatively impact our, our customers' and our distributors' business operations, which could materially adversely affect our operating results. furthermore, our exposure to credit and collectability risk is higher in certain international markets and our ability to mitigate such risks may be limited. while we have procedures to monitor and limit exposure to credit and collectability risk, there can be no assurances that such procedures will effectively limit such risk and avoid losses.
increased regulation or decreased governmental financial support relating to the raising, processing or consumption of food-producing animals could reduce demand for our livestock products.
companies in the livestock industries are subject to extensive and increasingly stringent regulations. if livestock producers are adversely affected by new regulations or changes to existing regulations, they may reduce herd sizes or become less profitable and, as a result, they may reduce their use of our products, which may materially adversely affect our operating results and financial condition. also, many food-producing companies, including livestock producers, benefit from governmental subsidies, and if such subsidies were to be reduced or eliminated, these companies may become less profitable and, as a result, may reduce their use of our products. furthermore, new or more stringent regulations could, directly or indirectly, impact the use of one or more of our products. more stringent regulation of the livestock industry or our products could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition.
an outbreak of infectious disease carried by animals could negatively affect the sale and production of our products.
sales of our livestock products could be materially adversely affected by the outbreak of disease carried by animals, which could lead to the widespread death or precautionary destruction of animals as well as the reduced consumption and demand for animal protein. in addition, outbreaks of disease carried by animals may reduce regional or global sales of particular animal-derived food products or result in reduced exports of such products, either due to heightened export restrictions or import prohibitions, which may reduce demand for our products due to reduced herd or flock sizes. in recent years, outbreaks of various diseases, including african swine fever, avian influenza, foot-and-mouth disease, bovine spongiform encephalopathy (otherwise known as bse or mad cow disease) and porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (otherwise
|
known as pedv), have impacted the animal health business. the discovery of additional cases of any of these, or new diseases may result in additional restrictions on animal proteins, reduced herd sizes, or reduced demand for animal protein, which may have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition. also, the outbreak of any highly contagious disease near our main production sites could require us to immediately halt production of our products at such sites or force us to incur substantial expenses in procuring raw materials or products elsewhere.
our business may be negatively affected by weather conditions, natural disasters and the availability of natural resources.
weather conditions, including excessive cold or heat, natural disasters and other events, could negatively impact our livestock customers by impairing the health or growth of their animals or the production or availability of feed. such events can also interfere with our livestock customers' operations due to power outages, fuel shortages, damage to their farms or facilities or disruption of transportation channels, among other things. for example, severe droughts can lead to a decrease in harvested corn and higher corn prices, which may impact the profitability of livestock producers of cattle, pork and poultry. higher corn prices may contribute to reductions in herd or flock sizes that may result in reduced spending on animal health products. in addition, droughts can lead to reduced availability of grazing pastures, forcing cattle producers to cull their herds. fewer heads of cattle could result in reduced demand for our products. heat waves may cause stress in animals and lead to increased vulnerability to disease, reduced fertility rates and reduced milk production. adverse weather conditions and natural disasters may also have a material impact on the aquaculture business.
furthermore, livestock producers depend on the availability of natural resources, including large supplies of fresh water. their animals' health and their ability to operate could be adversely affected if they experience a shortage of fresh water due to human population growth, or floods, droughts or other weather conditions. in the event of a natural disaster, adverse weather conditions, or a shortage of fresh water, veterinarians or livestock producers may purchase less of our products and our operating results and financial condition could be materially adversely affected.
in addition, veterinary hospitals and practitioners depend on visits from and access to animals under their care. veterinarians' patient volume and ability to operate could be adversely affected if they experience natural disasters or adverse weather conditions, including floods, fires, earthquakes and hurricanes or other storms, or prolonged snow or ice, particularly in regions not accustomed to sustained inclement weather.
adverse weather events and natural disasters may also interfere with and negatively impact operations at our manufacturing sites, research and development facilities and office buildings, which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition, especially if such interruptions to regular operations are frequent or prolonged.
the animal health industry and demand for many of our animal health products in particular regions are also affected by weather conditions, as usage of our products follows varying weather patterns and weather-related pressures from pests, such as ticks. as a result, we may experience regional and seasonal fluctuations in our results of operations.
climate change could have a material adverse impact on our and our customers' businesses.
we operate in many regions, countries and communities around the world where our businesses, and our activities and the activities of our customers and suppliers, could be disrupted by climate change. potential physical risks from climate change may include altered distribution and intensity of rainfall, prolonged droughts or flooding, increased frequency of wildfires and other natural disasters, rising sea levels, and a rising heat index, any of which could cause negative impacts to our and our customers' and suppliers' businesses. increased temperatures and rising water levels may negatively impact our livestock customers by increasing the prevalence of parasites and diseases that affect food animals. in addition, changes in water temperatures could affect the timing of reproduction and growth of various fish species, and trigger the outbreak of certain water borne diseases. the physical changes caused by climate change may also prompt changes in regulations or consumer preferences which in turn could have negative consequences for our and our customers' businesses. climate change may negatively impact our customers' operations, particularly those in the livestock industry, through climate-related impacts such as increased air and water temperatures, rising water levels and increased incidence of disease in livestock. in addition, concerns regarding greenhouse gas emissions and other potential environmental impacts of livestock production have led to some consumers opting to limit or avoid consuming animal products. if such events affect our customers' businesses, they may purchase fewer zoetis products, and our revenues may be negatively impacted. climate driven changes could have a material adverse impact on the financial performance of our business, and on our customers.
the impacts from climate change may also impact zoetis' and our suppliers' manufacturing processes. for example, ample amounts of clean water are needed to produce our products, and the effects from climate change could result in water supply interruptions and low water quality. in addition, increased frequency of natural disasters and adverse weather conditions may disrupt our manufacturing processes or our supply chain. these disruptions may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and/or cash flows.
moreover, there has been a broad range of proposed and promulgated state, national and international regulation aimed at reducing the effects of climate change. such regulations apply or could apply in countries where we have interests or could have interests in the future. in the u.s., there is a significant possibility that some form of regulation will be enacted at the federal level to address the effects of climate change. such regulation could take several forms that could result in additional costs in the form of investments of capital to maintain compliance with laws and regulations and taxes. climate change regulation continues to evolve, and it is not possible to accurately estimate either a timetable for implementation or our future compliance costs relating to implementation.
modification of foreign trade policy by the u.s. or foreign countries or the imposition of tariffs on u.s. or foreign goods may harm our business.
changes in u.s. laws, agreements and policies governing foreign trade in the territories and countries where our customers do business could negatively impact such customers' businesses and adversely affect our operating results. a number of our customers, particularly u.s.-based livestock producers, benefit from free trade agreements. the u.s., canada and mexico reached an agreement to replace the north american free trade agreement (nafta) with the united states-mexico-canada agreement (usmca), which became effective on july 1, 2020, but it
|
remains to be seen what the ultimate impact of the new usmca will be on our customers. the new provisions of the usmca, as well as any other changes to international trade agreements or policies, could harm our customers, and as a result, negatively impact our financial condition and results of operations.
additionally, in response to u.s. tariffs affecting foreign exports, some foreign governments, including china, have instituted and may in the future institute tariffs on certain u.s. goods. while the scope and duration of these and any future tariffs remains uncertain, tariffs imposed by the u.s. or foreign governments on our products or the active pharmaceutical ingredients or other components thereof could negatively impact our financial condition and results of operations.
our business is subject to risk based on customer exposure to rising costs and reduced customer income.
feed, fuel and transportation and other key costs for livestock producers may increase or animal protein prices or sales may decrease. either of these trends could cause deterioration in the financial condition of our livestock product customers, potentially inhibiting their ability to purchase our products or pay us for products delivered. our livestock product customers may offset rising costs by reducing spending on our products, including by switching to lower-cost alternatives to our products. in addition, concerns about the financial resources of pet owners also could cause veterinarians to alter their treatment recommendations in favor of lower-cost alternatives to our products. these shifts could result in a decrease in sales of our companion animal products, especially in developed countries where there is a higher rate of pet ownership.
our business could be adversely affected by labor disputes, strikes or work stoppages.
some of our employees are members of unions, works councils, trade associations or are otherwise subject to collective bargaining agreements in certain jurisdictions, including the u.s. as a result, we are subject to the risk of labor disputes, strikes, work stoppages and other labor-relations matters. we may be unable to negotiate new collective bargaining agreements on similar or more favorable terms and may experience work stoppages or other labor problems in the future at our sites. we could experience a disruption of our operations or higher ongoing labor costs, which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition, potentially resulting in canceled orders by customers, unanticipated inventory accumulation or shortages and reduced revenue and net income. we may also experience difficulty or delays in implementing changes to our workforce in certain markets. in addition, labor problems at our suppliers, cmos or other service providers could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition.
our business may be harmed if we are unable to retain and hire executive officers or other key personnel.
we depend on the efforts of our executive officers and certain key personnel, including research, technical, sales, marketing, manufacturing and administrative personnel. our ability to recruit and retain such talent will depend on a number of factors, including compensation and benefits, work location and work environment. from time to time there may be shortages of skilled labor, which may make it more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified employees or lead to increased labor costs. in addition, we generally do not enter into employment agreements with our executive officers and other key personnel. if we cannot effectively recruit and retain qualified executives and employees, we may not be able to maintain or expand our operations, or our business could be otherwise adversely affected and could, at least temporarily, have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition.
we may be required to write down goodwill or identifiable intangible assets.
under accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america (u.s. gaap), if we determine goodwill or identifiable intangible assets are impaired, we will be required to write down these assets and record a non-cash impairment charge. as of december 31, 2021, we had goodwill of $2.7 billion and identifiable intangible assets, less accumulated amortization, of $1.5 billion. identifiable intangible assets consist primarily of developed technology rights, brands, trademarks, license agreements, patents, acquired customer relationships and in-process r&d.
determining whether an impairment exists and the amount of the potential impairment involves quantitative data and qualitative criteria that are based on estimates and assumptions requiring significant management judgment. future events or new information may change management's valuation of an intangible asset in a short amount of time. the timing and amount of impairment charges recorded in our consolidated statements of income and write-downs recorded in our consolidated balance sheets could vary if management's conclusions change. any impairment of goodwill or identifiable intangible assets could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial position.
risks related to research and development our r&d, acquisition and licensing efforts may fail to generate new products and product lifecycle innovations.
our future success depends on both our existing product portfolio and our pipeline of new products, including new products that we may develop through joint ventures and products that we are able to obtain through license or acquisition. we commit substantial effort, funds and other resources to r&d, both through our own dedicated resources and through collaborations with third parties.
we may be unable to determine with accuracy when or whether any of our products now under development will be approved or launched, or we may be unable to develop, license or otherwise acquire product candidates or products. in addition, we cannot predict whether any products, once launched, will be commercially successful or will achieve sales and revenue that are consistent with our expectations. the animal health industry is subject to regional and local trends and regulations and, as a result, products that are successful in some of our markets may not achieve similar success when introduced into new markets. furthermore, the timing and cost of our r&d may increase, and our r&d may become less predictable. for example, changes in regulations applicable to our industry may make it more time-consuming and/or costly to research, develop and register products. if we are unable to generate new products or expand the use of our existing products, our business, financial condition and results of operations will be materially adversely affected.
|
new product r&d leverages discoveries of agribusiness, pharmaceutical and biotechnology r&d. we have and expect to continue to enter into collaboration or licensing arrangements with third parties to provide us with access to molecules, compounds and other technology for purposes of our business. such agreements are typically complex and require time to negotiate and implement. if we enter into these arrangements, we may not be able to maintain these relationships or establish new ones in the future on acceptable terms or at all. in addition, any collaboration that we enter into may not be successful, and the success may depend on the efforts and actions of our collaborators, which we may not be able to control. if we are unable to access these technologies to conduct r&d on cost-effective terms, our ability to develop some types of new products could be limited.
we may experience difficulties or delays in the development and commercialization of new products.
new products may appear promising in development but fail to reach the market within the expected or optimal timeframe, or at all. in addition, product extensions or additional indications may not be approved. developing and commercializing new products subjects us to inherent risks and uncertainties, including (i) delayed or denied regulatory approvals, (ii) delays or challenges with producing products in accordance with regulatory requirements, on a commercial scale and at a reasonable cost; (iii) failure to accurately predict the market for new products; and (iv) efficacy and safety concerns. in addition, a failure to continue to identify and develop products, both internally and through external sources, could impact our future success. once necessary regulatory approvals are obtained, the commercial success of any new product depends upon, among other things, its acceptance by veterinarians and end customers, and on our ability to successfully manufacture, market, and distribute products in sufficient quantities to meet actual demand. the inability to successfully bring a product to market could negatively impact our revenues and earnings.
our r&d relies on evaluations in animals, which may become subject to bans or additional restrictive regulations.
the evaluation of our existing and new medicines and vaccines for animals is required in order to develop and commercialize them. animal testing in certain industries has been the subject of controversy and adverse publicity. some organizations and individuals have attempted to ban animal testing or encourage the adoption of additional regulations applicable to animal testing. to the extent that the activities of such organizations and individuals are successful, our r&d, and by extension our operating results and financial condition, could be materially adversely affected. in addition, negative publicity about us or our industry could harm our reputation.
risks related to manufacturing manufacturing problems and capacity imbalances may cause product launch delays, inventory shortages, recalls or unanticipated costs.
in order to sell our products, we must be able to produce and ship our products in sufficient quantities. on december 31, 2021, we had a global manufacturing network consisting of 28 manufacturing sites located in 12 countries. we also employ a network of 136 third-party cmos. many of our products involve complex manufacturing processes and are sole-sourced from certain manufacturing sites.
minor deviations in our manufacturing or logistical processes, such as temperature excursions or improper package sealing, could result in delays, inventory shortages, unanticipated costs, product recalls, product liability and/or regulatory action. in addition, a number of factors could cause production interruptions, including:
•the failure of us or any of our vendors or suppliers, including logistical service providers, to comply with applicable regulations and quality assurance guidelines, including any changes to good manufacturing practices (gmp);
•mislabeling;
•construction delays;
•equipment malfunctions;
•shortages of materials;
•labor problems, including any covid-related impacts;
•delays in receiving any required governmental authorizations or regulatory approvals, including as a result of any prolonged shutdown of the u.s. government;
•natural disasters and adverse weather conditions;
•power outages;
•criminal and terrorist activities;
•changes in manufacturing production sites and limits to manufacturing capacity due to regulatory requirements, changes in types of products produced, shipping distributions or physical limitations; and
•the outbreak of any highly contagious diseases at or near our production sites.
these interruptions could result in launch delays, inventory shortages, recalls, unanticipated costs or issues with our agreements under which we supply third parties, which may adversely affect our operating results and financial condition. for example, we experienced challenges in manufacturing apoquel when it was initially launched in 2015 that impacted our ability to meet customer demand. as a result, we had to place limits on the amounts of this product veterinarians could purchase and delayed the launch of the product in certain markets. in addition, the regulatory agency in russia no longer accepts gmp certificates issued by outside authorities and instead requires country-specific gmp certification based on local gmp rules. as a result, we have ongoing programs at the relevant manufacturing sites to satisfy the russia-specific gmp requirements. our failure to achieve these necessary certifications on a timely basis or at all could impact our ability to sell our products in russia.
|
our manufacturing network may be unable to meet the demand for our products or we may have excess capacity if demand for our products changes. the unpredictability of a product's regulatory or commercial success or failure, the lead time necessary to construct highly technical and complex manufacturing sites, and shifting customer demand (including as a result of market conditions or entry of branded or generic competition) increase the potential for capacity imbalances. in addition, construction of sites is expensive, and our ability to recover costs will depend on the market acceptance and success of the products produced at the new sites, which is uncertain.
we rely on third parties to provide us with materials and services, and are subject to increased labor and material costs and potential disruptions in supply.
the materials used to manufacture our products may be subject to availability constraints and price volatility caused by changes in demand, weather conditions, supply conditions, government regulations, economic climate and other factors, including any impacts caused by the covid-19 pandemic. in addition, labor costs may be subject to volatility caused by the supply of labor, governmental regulations, economic climate and other factors. increases in the demand for, availability or the price of, materials used to manufacture our products and increases in labor costs could increase the costs to manufacture our products, result in product delivery delays or shortages, and impact our ability to launch new products on a timely basis or at all. we may not be able to pass all or a material portion of any higher material or labor costs on to our customers, which could materially adversely affect our operating results and financial condition.
certain third-party suppliers are the sole or exclusive source of certain materials and services necessary for production of our products. we may be unable to meet demand for certain of our products if any of our third-party suppliers cease or interrupt operations, fail to renew contracts with us or otherwise fail to meet their obligations to us.
there may be delays and additional costs due to changes to our existing manufacturing facilities and the construction of new manufacturing plants.
as part of our supply network strategy, we have invested and will continue to invest in improvements to our existing manufacturing facilities and in new manufacturing plants. we are currently invested in a new plant in suzhou, china for the research and production of vaccines in china. in addition, certain of our existing manufacturing facilities are in the process of being upgraded. these types of projects are subject to risks of delay or cost overruns inherent in any large construction project, and require licensure by various regulatory authorities. significant cost overruns or delays in completing these projects could have an adverse effect on the company's return on investment.
risks related to legal matters and regulation our business is subject to substantial regulation.
as a global company, we are subject to various state, federal and international laws and regulations, including regulations relating to the development, quality assurance, manufacturing, importation, distribution, marketing and sale of our products. in addition, our manufacturing facilities are subject to periodic inspections by regulatory agencies. an inspection may report conditions or practices that indicate possible violations of regulatory requirements. our failure, or the failure of third parties we rely on, including cmos, to comply with these regulatory requirements, allegations of such non-compliance or the discovery of previously unknown problems with a product or manufacturer could result in, among other things, inspection observation notices, warning letters or similar regulatory correspondence, fines, a partial or total shutdown of production in one or more of our facilities while an alleged violation is remediated, withdrawals or suspensions of current products from the market, and civil or criminal prosecution, as well as decreased sales as a result of negative publicity and product liability claims. any one of these consequences could materially adversely affect our operating results and financial condition.
in addition, we will not be able to market new products unless and until we have obtained all required regulatory approvals in each jurisdiction where we propose to market those products. even after a product reaches market, it may be subject to re-review and may lose its approvals. we have changed, and may in the future change, the locations of where certain of our products are manufactured and, because of these changes, we may be required to obtain new regulatory approvals. our failure to obtain approvals, delays in the approval process, including any delays resulting from covid-19 or any prolonged shutdown of the u.s. government, or our failure to maintain approvals in any jurisdiction, may prevent us from selling products in that jurisdiction until approval or reapproval is obtained, if ever.
furthermore, we cannot predict the nature of future laws, regulations, or changes in tax laws and tariffs, nor can we determine the effect that additional laws or regulations or changes in existing laws or regulations could have on our business when and if promulgated, or the impact of changes in the interpretation of these laws and regulations, or of disparate federal, state, local and foreign regulatory schemes.
changes in applicable federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition.
we may incur substantial costs and receive adverse outcomes in litigation and other legal matters.
our operating results, financial condition and liquidity could be materially adversely affected by unfavorable results in pending or future litigation matters. these matters include, among other things, allegations of violation of u.s. and foreign competition laws, labor laws, consumer protection laws, and environmental laws and regulations, as well as claims or litigations relating to product liability, intellectual property, securities, breach of contract and tort. in addition, changes in the interpretations of laws and regulations to which we are subject, or in legal standards in one or more of the jurisdictions in which we operate, could increase our exposure to liability. for example, in the u.s., attempts have been made to allow damages for emotional distress and pain and suffering in connection with the loss of, or injury to, a companion animal. if such attempts were successful, our exposure with respect to product liability claims could increase materially. we also sell certain nutritional and diagnostic products used in human health that could increase the scope of our liability.
litigation matters, regardless of their merits or their ultimate outcomes, are costly, divert management's attention and may materially adversely affect our reputation and demand for our products. we cannot predict with certainty the eventual outcome of pending or future litigation
|
matters. an adverse outcome of litigation or legal matters could result in our being responsible for significant damages. any of these negative effects resulting from litigation matters could materially adversely affect our operating results and financial condition.
the misuse or off-label use of our products may harm our reputation or result in financial or other damages.
our products have been approved for use under specific circumstances for the treatment of certain diseases and conditions in specific species. there may be increased risk of product liability claims and other liability if veterinarians, livestock producers, pet owners or others attempt to use our products off-label, including the use of our products in species (including humans) for which they have not been approved. in addition, certain of our products could be misused or abused by humans, which could expose us to liability. for example, ketamine, the active pharmaceutical ingredient in our ketaset product (a nonnarcotic agent for anesthetic use in cats), is abused by humans as a hallucinogen. furthermore, the use of our products for indications other than those indications for which our products have been approved may not be effective, which could harm our reputation and lead to an increased risk of litigation. if we are deemed by a governmental or regulatory agency to have engaged in the promotion of any of our products for off-label use, such agency could request that we modify our training or promotional materials and practices and we could be subject to significant fines and penalties, and the imposition of these sanctions could also affect our reputation and position within the industry. any of these events could materially adversely affect our operating results and financial condition.
the illegal distribution and sale by third parties of counterfeit or illegally compounded versions of our products or of stolen, diverted or relabeled products could have a negative impact on our reputation and business.
third parties may illegally distribute and sell counterfeit or illegally compounded versions of our products that do not meet the exacting standards of our development, manufacturing and distribution processes. counterfeit or illegally compounded medicines pose a significant risk to animal health and safety because of the conditions under which they are manufactured and the lack of regulation of their contents. counterfeit or illegally compounded products are frequently unsafe or ineffective and can be potentially life-threatening to animals. our reputation and business could suffer harm as a result of counterfeit or illegally compounded products which are alleged to be equivalent and/or which are sold under our brand name. we are aware of at least one pharmacy in brazil that may be engaged in the practice of illegally compounding oclacitinib, the active pharmaceutical ingredient in our apoquel product. we are also aware of some counterfeit versions of our simparica product in brazil and a field investigation is being performed. in addition, products stolen or unlawfully diverted from inventory, warehouses, plants or while in transit, which are not properly stored or which have an expired shelf life and which have been repackaged or relabeled and which are sold through unauthorized channels, could adversely impact animal health and safety, our reputation and our business. public loss of confidence in the integrity of vaccines and/or pharmaceutical products as a result of counterfeiting, illegally compounding or theft could have a material adverse effect on our product sales, business and results of operations.
laws and regulations governing global trade compliance could adversely impact our business.
the ofac and the bureau of industry and security at the u.s. department of commerce (bis), administer certain laws and regulations that restrict u.s. persons and, in some instances, non-u.s. persons, in conducting activities, transacting business with or making investments in certain countries, governments, entities and individuals subject to u.s. economic sanctions. in addition, engaging in sales activities to foreign governments introduces additional compliance risks, including risks specific to anti-bribery regulations, including the fcpa, the u.k. bribery act 2010 and other similar statutory requirements prohibiting bribery and corruption in the jurisdictions in which we operate. our international operations subject us to these laws and regulations, which are complex, restrict our business dealings with certain countries, governments, entities, and individuals, and are constantly changing. further restrictions may be enacted, amended, enforced or interpreted in a manner that materially impacts our operations.
from time to time, we have limited business dealings in countries subject to comprehensive sanctions and sell products in such countries. these business dealings represent an insignificant amount of our consolidated revenues and income, but expose us to a heightened risk of violating applicable sanctions regulations. violations of these regulations are punishable by civil penalties, including fines, denial of export privileges, injunctions, asset seizures, debarment from government contracts and revocations or restrictions of licenses, as well as criminal fines and imprisonment. we have established policies and procedures designed to assist with our compliance with such laws and regulations. however, there can be no assurance that our policies and procedures will prevent us from violating these regulations in every transaction in which we may engage, or that any businesses that we may acquire have complied with such regulations, and such a violation could adversely affect our reputation, business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. for example, in december 2020, we submitted a final voluntary disclosure to ofac and the u.s. department of justice regarding certain transactions involving sales of food, medicine or devices to individuals or entities who may have been resident in or had ties to iran potentially in violation of the itsr administered by ofac. the sales were made by our platinum performance business, which we acquired in august 2019.
we are subject to complex environmental, health and safety laws and regulations.
we are subject to various federal, state, local and foreign environmental, health and safety laws and regulations. these laws and regulations govern matters such as the emission and discharge of hazardous materials into the ground, air or water; the generation, use, storage, handling, treatment, packaging, transportation, exposure to, and disposal of hazardous and biological materials, including recordkeeping, reporting and registration requirements; and the health and safety of our employees. due to our operations, these laws and regulations also require us to obtain, and comply with, permits, registrations or other authorizations issued by governmental authorities. these authorities can modify or revoke our permits, registrations or other authorizations and can enforce compliance through fines and injunctions.
given the nature of our business, we have incurred, are currently incurring and may in the future incur, liabilities under cercla or under other federal, state, local and foreign environmental cleanup laws, with respect to our current or former sites, adjacent or nearby third-party sites, or offsite disposal locations. see item 1. business-environmental, health and safety. the costs associated with future cleanup activities that we may be required to conduct or finance could be material. additionally, we may become liable to third parties for damages, including personal injury and property damage, resulting from the disposal or release of hazardous materials into the environment. such liability could
|
materially adversely affect our operating results and financial condition. furthermore, regulatory agencies are showing increasing concern over the impact of animal health products and livestock operations on the environment. this increased regulatory scrutiny may necessitate that additional time and resources be spent to address these concerns in both new and existing products.
a failure to comply with the environmental, health and safety laws and regulations to which we are subject, including any permits issued thereunder, may result in environmental remediation costs, loss of permits, fines, penalties or other adverse governmental or private actions, including regulatory or judicial orders enjoining or curtailing operations or requiring corrective measures, installation of pollution control equipment or remedial measures. we could also be held liable for any and all consequences arising out of human exposure to hazardous materials or environmental damage. environmental laws and regulations are complex, change frequently, have tended to become more stringent and stringently enforced over time and may be subject to new interpretation. we cannot assure you that our costs of complying with current and future environmental, health and safety laws, and our liabilities arising from past or future releases of, or exposure to, hazardous materials will not materially adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial condition.
our operations and reputation may be impacted if we do not comply with continually changing laws and regulations regarding data privacy.
we collect and use personal data of our customers, employees and suppliers in a variety of ways. in addition, we have been investing in data and digital capabilities and have expanded our diagnostics portfolio. as a result, we possess and process an increasing amount of personal data. our customers, employees and suppliers expect that we will adequately protect their data.
our collection, use, retention, storage, and sharing of personal data is subject to a variety of data privacy laws and regulations in the united states and other regions where we operate. as a global company, we are faced with the challenge of how to manage a diverse patchwork of laws, rules, regulations and industry standards, including the california consumer privacy act, the eu's general data protection regulation, the u.k.'s general data protection regulation, the brazilian general data protection law, and china's personal information protection law. these laws and regulations vary across countries, are complex and can be subject to significant change. for example, there are a number of legislative proposals in the eu, the u.s. (both at the federal and state levels) and other jurisdictions that could impose new obligations in areas affecting our business. any actual or perceived failure to comply with these current and future laws could result in significant consequences for zoetis. this includes substantial fines and penalties, regulatory investigations, and civil lawsuits with damages, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our reputation and our business. in addition, the costs associated with compliance with these legal and regulatory requirements are significant and likely to increase in the future.
risks related to operating in foreign jurisdictions a significant portion of our operations are conducted in foreign jurisdictions, including jurisdictions presenting a high risk of bribery and corruption, and are subject to the economic, political, legal and business environments of the countries in which we do business.
our international operations could be limited or disrupted by any of the following:
•volatility in the international financial markets;
•compliance with governmental controls;
•difficulties enforcing contractual and intellectual property rights;
•theft or compromise of technology, data and intellectual property;
•parallel trade in our products (importation of our products from eu countries where our products are sold at lower prices into eu countries where the products are sold at higher prices);
•compliance with a wide variety of laws and regulations, such as the fcpa and similar non-u.s. laws and regulations, including labor laws;
•burdens to comply with multiple and potentially conflicting foreign laws and regulations, including those relating to environmental, health and safety requirements;
•changes in laws, regulations, government controls or enforcement practices with respect to our business and the businesses of our customers, including the imposition of limits on our profitability;
•political and social instability, including crime, civil disturbance, terrorist activities and armed conflicts;
•trade restrictions and restrictions on direct investments by foreign entities, including restrictions administered by ofac and the eu, in relation to our products or the products of farmers and other customers (e.g., restrictions on the importation of agricultural products from the eu to russia);
•government limitations on foreign ownership;
•government takeover or nationalization of business;
•changes in tax laws and tariffs;
•imposition of anti-dumping and countervailing duties or other trade-related sanctions;
•costs and difficulties and compliance risks in staffing, managing and monitoring international operations, including the use of overseas third-party goods and service providers;
•corruption risk inherent in business arrangements and regulatory contacts with foreign government entities;
•longer payment cycles and increased exposure to counterparty risk; and
|
•additional limitations on transferring personal information between countries or other restrictions on the processing of personal information.
in addition, international transactions may involve increased financial and legal risks due to differing legal systems and customs. compliance with these requirements may prohibit the import or export of certain products and technologies or may require us to obtain a license before importing or exporting certain products or technology. a failure to comply with any of these laws, regulations or requirements could result in civil or criminal legal proceedings, monetary or non-monetary penalties, or both, disruptions to our business, limitations on our ability to import and export products and services, and damage to our reputation. in addition, variations in the pricing of our products between jurisdictions may result in the unauthorized importation or unauthorized re-importation of our products between jurisdictions and may also result in the imposition of anti-dumping and countervailing duties or other trade-related sanctions. while the impact of these factors is difficult to predict, any of them could materially adversely affect our operating results and financial condition. changes in any of these laws, regulations or requirements, or the political environment in a particular country, may affect our ability to engage in business transactions in certain markets, including investment, procurement and repatriation of earnings.
brexit-related impacts on our business could include disruption of the free movement of goods, services, and people between the u.k. and the eu, increased legal and regulatory complexities, higher costs of conducting business in europe, potential inventory shortages in the u.k., increased regulatory burdens and costs to comply with u.k.-specific regulations and higher transportation costs for our products coming into and out of the u.k. any further changes in international trade, tariff and import/export regulations as a result of brexit or otherwise may impose unexpected duty costs or other non-tariff barriers on us. it is also possible that brexit may negatively affect our ability to attract and retain employees, particularly those from the eu. the u.k.'s vote to exit the eu could also result in similar referendums or votes in other eu member countries in which we do business. any of these effects, among others, could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition.
foreign exchange rate fluctuations and potential currency controls affect our results of operations, as reported in our financial statements.
we conduct operations in many areas of the world, involving transactions denominated in a variety of currencies. in 2021, we generated approximately 44% of our revenue in currencies other than the u.s. dollar, principally the euro, chinese renminbi, brazilian real, australian dollar, british pound and canadian dollar. we are subject to currency exchange rate risk to the extent that our costs are denominated in currencies other than those in which we earn revenue. in addition, because our financial statements are reported in u.s. dollars, changes in currency exchange rates between the u.s. dollar and other currencies have had, and will continue to have, an impact on our results of operations.
we also face risks arising from currency devaluations and the imposition of cash repatriation restrictions and exchange controls. currency devaluations result in a diminished value of funds denominated in the currency of the country instituting the devaluation. cash repatriation restrictions and exchange controls may limit our ability to convert foreign currencies into u.s. dollars or to remit dividends and other payments by our foreign subsidiaries or businesses located in or conducted within a country imposing restrictions or controls. we currently have substantial operations in countries that have cash repatriation restrictions or exchange controls in place, including china, and, if we were to need to repatriate or convert such cash, these controls and restrictions may have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition.
we may not be able to realize the expected benefits of our investments in emerging markets and are subject to certain risks due to our presence in emerging markets, including political or economic instability and failure to adequately comply with legal and regulatory requirements.
we have been taking steps to increase our presence in emerging markets. failure to continue to maintain and expand our business in emerging markets could materially adversely affect our operating results and financial condition.
some countries within emerging markets may be especially vulnerable to periods of local, regional or global economic, political or social instability or crisis. for example, our sales in certain emerging markets have suffered from extended periods of disruption due to natural disasters and adverse weather conditions. furthermore, we have also experienced lower than expected sales in certain emerging markets due to local, regional and global restrictions on banking and commercial activities in those countries. in addition, certain emerging markets have currencies that fluctuate substantially, which may impact our financial performance. for example, in the past, our revenue in certain emerging markets in latin america has been adversely impacted by currency fluctuations and devaluations.
in addition, certain emerging markets have legal systems that are less developed or familiar to us. other jurisdictions in which we conduct business may have legal and regulatory regimes that differ materially from u.s. laws and regulations, are continuously evolving or do not include sufficient judicial or administrative guidance to interpret such laws and regulations. compliance with diverse legal requirements is costly and time-consuming and requires significant resources. in the event we believe or have reason to believe our employees have or may have violated applicable laws or regulations, we may be subject to investigation costs, potential penalties and other related costs which in turn could negatively affect our reputation and our results of operations.
for all these and other reasons, doing business within emerging markets carries significant risks.
risks related to tax matters the company could be subject to changes in its tax rates, the adoption of new u.s. or foreign tax legislation or exposure to additional tax liabilities.
the multinational nature of our business subjects us to taxation in the u.s. and numerous foreign jurisdictions. due to economic and political conditions, tax rates in various jurisdictions may be subject to significant change. the company's future effective tax rates could be affected by changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, or

changes in tax laws or their interpretation.
for example, in october 2021, the organisation for economic co-operation and development (oecd) announced that its members have agreed on a two-pillar approach to address the tax challenges of the digital economy. pillar one amends profit allocation and nexus rules to grant more taxing rights to countries where consumers are located regardless of the physical presence of the business. pillar two introduces common global minimum tax rules across the countries participating in the oecd inclusive framework. such rules, when implemented, would operate through top-up taxes and other measures if a multinational group's income is not subject to a sufficient level of tax in a particular jurisdiction. the oecd released the pillar two 15% minimum effective tax rate model rules on december 20, 2021. the oecd/g20 inclusive framework will continue to develop the remaining model rules and multilateral instruments, which would then need to be enacted on a country-by-country basis, in order to ensure global adoption by 2023. these two pillars combined may represent a significant change in the international tax regime, and there is risk of an adverse impact to our effective tax rate, but the amount of such impact remains uncertain at this time.
furthermore, president biden's administration has put forth comprehensive corporate tax reform proposals which may have an adverse impact to our effective tax rate. at this time, we are properly reflecting the provision for taxes on income using all current enacted global tax laws in every jurisdiction in which we operate.
in addition, our effective tax rate is subject to potential risks that various taxing authorities may challenge the pricing of our cross-border arrangements and subject us to additional tax, adversely impacting our effective tax rate and our tax liability. the company is also subject to the examination of its tax returns and other tax matters by the internal revenue service and other tax authorities and governmental bodies. the company regularly assesses the likelihood of an adverse outcome resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of its provision for taxes. there can be no assurance as to the outcome of these examinations. if the company's effective tax rates were to increase, particularly in the u.s. or other material foreign jurisdictions, or if the ultimate determination of the company's taxes owed is for an amount in excess of amounts previously accrued, the company's operating results, cash flows and financial condition could be adversely affected.
risks related to intellectual property the alleged intellectual property rights of third parties may negatively affect our business.
a third party may sue us, our distributors or licensors, or otherwise make a claim, alleging infringement or other violation of the third-party's patents, trademarks, trade dress, copyrights, trade secrets, domain names or other intellectual property rights. if we do not prevail in this type of dispute, we may be required to:
•pay monetary damages;
•obtain a license in order to continue manufacturing or marketing the affected products, which may not be available on commercially reasonable terms, or at all; or
•stop activities, including any commercial activities, relating to the affected products, which could include a recall of the affected products and/or a cessation of sales in the future.
the costs of defending an intellectual property action are often substantial and could materially adversely affect our operating results and financial condition, even if we successfully defend such action. moreover, even if we believe that we do not infringe a validly existing third-party patent, we may choose to license such patent, which would result in associated costs and obligations. we may also incur costs in connection with an obligation to compensate a distributor, licensor or other third party. the intellectual property positions of animal health medicines and vaccines businesses frequently involve complex legal and factual questions, and an issued patent does not provide the right to practice the patented technology or to develop, manufacture or commercialize the patented product. we cannot guarantee that a competitor or other third party does not have or will not obtain rights to intellectual property that, in the absence of a license, may prevent us from manufacturing, developing or marketing certain of our products, regardless of whether we believe such intellectual property rights are valid and enforceable, which may harm our operating results and financial condition.
if our intellectual property rights are challenged or circumvented, competitors may be able to take advantage of our research and development efforts.
our long-term success largely depends on our ability to market technologically competitive products. we rely and expect to continue to rely on a combination of intellectual property, including patent, trademark, trade dress, copyright, trade secret, data protection, and domain name protection laws, as well as confidentiality and license agreements with our employees and others, to protect our intellectual property and proprietary rights. if we fail to obtain and maintain adequate intellectual property protection, we may not be able to prevent third parties from using our proprietary technologies or from marketing products that are very similar or identical to ours. our currently pending or future patent applications may not result in issued patents, or be approved on a timely basis, or at all. similarly, any term extensions that we seek may not be approved on a timely basis, if at all. our currently pending and granted patents may be challenged in post grant review, inter partes review or opposition or revocation proceedings. in addition, our issued patents may not contain claims sufficiently broad to protect us against third parties with similar technologies or products or provide us with any competitive advantage, including exclusivity in a particular product area. the valid scope of our patent claims also may vary between countries, as individual countries have their own patent laws. for example, some countries only permit the issuance of patents covering a novel chemical compound itself, and its first use, and thus further methods of use for the same compound, may not be patentable. we may be subject to challenges by third parties regarding our intellectual property, including claims regarding validity, enforceability, scope and effective term. the validity, enforceability, scope and effective term of patents can be highly uncertain and often involve complex legal and factual questions and proceedings that differ between jurisdictions. our ability to enforce our patents also depends on the laws of individual countries and each country's practice with respect to enforcement of intellectual property rights. in addition, if we are unable to maintain our existing license agreements or other agreements pursuant to which third parties grant us
|
rights to intellectual property, including because such agreements expire or are terminated, our operating results and financial condition could be materially adversely affected.
changes in patent law and practice in the u.s. and other countries may also weaken our ability to enforce our patent rights or make such enforcement financially unattractive. for instance, u.s. court decisions continue to influence changes to u.s. patent and trademark office guidelines regarding inventions in the field of products isolated from nature, biopharma and diagnostic methods which may influence future patenting strategy in these areas. patent law reforms and new case law could result in increased costs to protect our intellectual property and/or limit our ability to adequately patent our products.
additionally, certain foreign governments have indicated that compulsory licenses to patents may be granted in the case of national emergencies, which could diminish or eliminate sales and profits from those regions and materially adversely affect our operating results and financial condition.
likewise, in the u.s. and other countries, we currently hold issued trademark registrations and have trademark applications pending, any of which may be the subject of a governmental or third-party objection, which could prevent the maintenance or issuance of the same and thus create the potential need to rebrand or re-label a product. as our products mature, our reliance on our trademarks to differentiate us from our competitors increases and as a result, if we are unable to prevent third parties from adopting, registering or using trademarks and trade dress that infringe, dilute or otherwise violate our trademark rights, our business could be materially adversely affected.
many of our vaccine products and other products are based on or incorporate proprietary information, including proprietary master seeds and proprietary or patented adjuvant formulations. we actively seek to protect our proprietary information, including our trade secrets and proprietary know-how, by requiring our employees, consultants, other advisors and other third parties to execute proprietary information and confidentiality agreements upon the commencement of their employment, engagement or other relationship. despite these efforts and precautions, we may be unable to prevent a third party from copying or otherwise obtaining and using our trade secrets or our other intellectual property without authorization and legal remedies may not adequately compensate us for the damages caused by such unauthorized use. further, others may independently and lawfully develop substantially similar or identical products that circumvent our intellectual property by means of alternative designs or processes or otherwise.
the misappropriation and infringement of our intellectual property, particularly in foreign countries where the laws may not protect our proprietary rights as fully as in the u.s., may occur even when we take steps to prevent it. we are currently, and expect to be in the future, party to patent lawsuits and other intellectual property rights claims that are expensive and time consuming, and if resolved adversely, could have a significant impact on our business and financial condition. in the future, we may not be able to enforce intellectual property that relates to our products for various reasons, including licensor restrictions and other restrictions imposed by third parties, or the cost of enforcing our intellectual property may outweigh the value of doing so; either of which could have a material adverse impact on our business and financial condition.
risks related to information technology we may be unable to adequately protect our information technology systems from cyber-attacks, breaches of security or misappropriation of data, which could result in the disclosure of confidential information, damage our reputation, and subject us to significant financial and legal exposure.
our reputation as a global leader in animal health and our reliance on complex information systems and digital solutions make us inherently vulnerable to malicious cyber intrusion and attack. in addition, we have been investing in data and digital capabilities and have expanded our diagnostics portfolio, and as a result, there could be an increased likelihood of a cyber-attack or breach of security that could negatively impact us or our customers. cyber-attacks are increasing in their frequency, sophistication and intensity, and have become increasingly difficult to detect. cyber-attacks could include wrongful conduct by hostile foreign governments, industrial espionage, the deployment of harmful malware, ransomware, denial-of-service attacks, and other means to threaten data confidentiality, integrity and availability. in addition, despite our efforts to protect sensitive, confidential or personal data or information, we (or our third party partners) may be vulnerable to material security breaches, theft, misplaced or lost data, programming errors, employee errors and/or malfeasance that could potentially lead to the compromise of sensitive, confidential or personal data or information, improper use of our systems or networks, unauthorized access, use, disclosure, modification or destruction of information (including confidential business information, trade secrets, intellectual property and corporate strategic plans), defective products, production downtimes and operational disruptions.
like other global companies, we have experienced threats to our data and information technology systems. to date, those threats have not had a material impact on our business operations or financial condition. however, although we devote resources to protect our information technology systems, we expect cyber-attacks to continue, and there can be no assurance that our efforts will prevent information security breaches that would result in business, legal or reputational harm to us, or would have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition.
if hackers or cyberthieves gain improper access to our technology systems, networks, or infrastructure, they may be able to access, steal, publish, delete, misappropriate, modify or otherwise disrupt access to confidential data. moreover, additional harm to customers could be perpetrated by third parties who are given access to the confidential data. a network disruption (including one resulting from a cyberattack) could cause an interruption or degradation of service as well as permit access, theft, publishing, deletion, misappropriation, or modification to or of confidential data. due to the evolving techniques used in cyberattacks to disrupt or gain unauthorized access to technology networks, we may not be able to anticipate or prevent such disruption or unauthorized access.
the costs imposed on us as a result of a cyberattack or network disruption could be significant. among others, such costs could include increased expenditures on cyber security measures, litigation, regulatory investigations, fines, and sanctions, lost revenues from business
|
interruption, damage to the public's perception regarding our ability to keep our information secure and significant remediation costs. as a result, a cyberattack or network disruption could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and operating results.
we depend on sophisticated information technology and infrastructure.
we rely on the efficient and uninterrupted operation of complex information technology systems to manage our operations, to process, transmit and store electronic and financial information, and to comply with regulatory, legal and tax requirements. we also depend on our information technology infrastructure for digital marketing activities and for electronic communications among our personnel, customers and suppliers around the world. system failures or outages could compromise our ability to perform these functions in a timely manner, which could harm our ability to conduct business, hurt our relationships with our customers, or delay our financial reporting. such failures could materially adversely affect our operating results and financial condition.
in addition, we depend on third parties and applications on virtualized (cloud) infrastructure to operate and support our information systems. these third parties include large established vendors, as well as many small, privately owned companies. failure by these providers to adequately support our operations or a change in control or insolvency of these providers could have an adverse effect on our business, which in turn may materially adversely affect our operating results and financial condition.
all information systems, despite implementation of security measures, are vulnerable to disability, failures or unauthorized access. if our information systems were to fail or be breached, such failure or breach could materially adversely affect our ability to perform critical business functions and sensitive and confidential data could be compromised.
we may be unable to successfully manage our online ordering sites.
in many markets around the world, such as the u.s. and brazil, we provide online ordering sites to customers, often relying on third parties to host and support the application. the operation of our online business depends on our ability to maintain the efficient and uninterrupted operation of our online order-taking and fulfillment operations. risks associated with our online business include: disruptions in telephone or internet service or power outages; failures of the information systems that support our website, including inadequate system capacity, computer viruses, human error, changes in programming, security breaches, system upgrades or migration of these services to new systems; reliance on third parties for computer hardware and software as well as delivery of merchandise to our customers; rapid technology changes; credit card fraud; natural disasters or adverse weather conditions; power and network outages; changes in applicable federal and state regulations; liability for online content; and consumer privacy concerns. problems in any one or more of these areas could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition and could damage our reputation.
risks related to our indebtedness we have substantial indebtedness.
we have a significant amount of indebtedness, which could materially adversely affect our operating results, financial condition and liquidity. as of december 31, 2021, we had approximately $6.65 billion of total unsecured indebtedness outstanding. in addition, we currently have agreements for a multi-year revolving credit facility and a commercial paper program, each with a capacity of up to $1.0 billion. while we currently do not have any amounts drawn under the credit facility nor any commercial paper issued under the commercial paper program, we may incur indebtedness under these arrangements in the future.
we may incur substantial additional debt from time to time to finance working capital, capital expenditures, investments or acquisitions, or for other purposes. if we do so, the risks related to our high level of debt could intensify. specifically, our high level of debt could have important consequences, including:
•making it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations with respect to our debt;
•limiting our ability to obtain additional financing to fund future working capital, capital expenditures, business development or other general corporate requirements, including dividends;
•increasing our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions;
•exposing us to the risk of increased interest rates as certain of our borrowings may in the future be at variable rates of interest;
•limiting our flexibility in planning for and reacting to changes in the animal health industry;
•placing us at a competitive disadvantage to other, less leveraged competitors;
•impacting our effective tax rate; and
•increasing our cost of borrowing.
in addition, the instruments governing our indebtedness contain restrictive covenants that will limit our ability to engage in activities that may be in our long-term best interest. for example, our credit facility contains a financial covenant requiring us to not exceed a maximum total leverage ratio and covenants that, among other things, limit or restrict our and our subsidiaries' ability, subject to certain exceptions, to incur liens, merge, consolidate or sell, transfer or lease assets, transact with affiliates and incur priority indebtedness. our failure to comply with such covenants could result in an event of default, which could result in the acceleration of all our debt.
we also hold certain interest rate swap agreements that have the economic effect of modifying the fixed interest obligations associated with our senior notes due 2028 so that a portion of the interest payable on these notes is effectively variable based on the london interbank offered rate (libor). in november 2020, the board of governors of the federal reserve system, the office of the comptroller of the currency, and the federal deposit insurance corporation (collectively, the agencies) issued a statement to encourage banks to transition away from u.s. dollar libor as soon as practicable and in any event by december 31, 2021. in march 2021, the the u.k. financial conduct authority and
|
ice benchmark administration (the administrator of libor) announced that british pound, euro, swiss franc and japanese yen libor panels, as well as panels for 1-week and 2-month u.s. dollar libor, will cease after december 31, 2021, with the remaining u.s. dollar libor panels ceasing after june 30, 2023. the alternative reference rates committee in the united states has proposed that the secured overnight financing rate (sofr) is the rate that represents best practice as the alternative to u.s dollar libor for use in derivatives and other financial contracts that are currently indexed to libor, however, it is unknown whether this or any other alternative reference rate will attain market acceptance as a replacement for libor. sofr is a measure of the cost of borrowing cash overnight, collateralized by u.s. treasury securities, and is based on directly observable u.s. treasury-backed repurchase transactions. the discontinuance or modification of libor, the introduction of alternative reference rates or other reforms to libor could cause the interest rate calculated on our interest rate swap agreements associated with our senior notes due 2028 to be materially different than expected.
we may not be able to generate sufficient cash to service all of our indebtedness and may be forced to take other actions to satisfy our obligations under our indebtedness, which may not be successful.
our ability to make scheduled payments on or refinance our debt obligations depends on our financial condition and operating performance, which are subject to prevailing economic and competitive conditions and to certain financial, business, legislative, regulatory and other factors beyond our control. we may be unable to maintain a level of cash flows from operating activities sufficient to permit us to pay the principal and interest on our indebtedness.
if our cash flows and capital resources are insufficient to fund our debt service obligations, we could face substantial liquidity problems and could be forced to reduce or delay investments and capital expenditures, or to dispose of material assets or operations, alter our dividend policy, seek additional debt or equity capital or restructure or refinance our indebtedness. we may not be able to effect any such alternative measures on commercially reasonable terms or at all and, even if successful, those alternative actions may not allow us to meet our scheduled debt service obligations. the instruments that will govern our indebtedness may restrict our ability to dispose of assets and may restrict the use of proceeds from those dispositions and may also restrict our ability to raise debt or equity capital to be used to repay other indebtedness when it becomes due. we may not be able to consummate those dispositions or to obtain proceeds in an amount sufficient to meet any debt service obligations when due.
in addition, we conduct our operations through our subsidiaries. accordingly, repayment of our indebtedness will depend on the generation of cash flow by our subsidiaries, including certain international subsidiaries, and their ability to make such cash available to us, by dividend, debt repayment or otherwise. our subsidiaries may not have any obligation to pay amounts due on our indebtedness or to make funds available for that purpose. our subsidiaries may not be able to, or may not be permitted to, make distributions to enable us to make payments in respect of our indebtedness. each subsidiary is a distinct legal entity, and under certain circumstances, legal, tax and contractual restrictions may limit our ability to obtain cash from our subsidiaries. in the event that we do not receive distributions from our subsidiaries, we may be unable to make required principal and interest payments on our indebtedness.
our inability to generate sufficient cash flows to satisfy our debt obligations, or to refinance our indebtedness on commercially reasonable terms or at all, may materially adversely affect our operating results, financial condition and liquidity and our ability to satisfy our obligations under our indebtedness or pay dividends on our common stock.
we may not have the funds necessary to finance the change of control offer required by the indenture governing our senior notes.
upon the occurrence of a change of control of zoetis and a downgrade below investment grade by moody's investor services, inc. and s&p global ratings, a division of s&p global inc., we will be required to offer to repurchase all of our outstanding senior notes. however, we may not have sufficient funds available at the time of the change of control to finance the required change of control offer or restrictions in our then-existing debt instruments will not allow such repurchases. our failure to purchase the senior notes as required under the indenture would result in a default under the indenture, which could have material adverse consequences for us and the holders of the senior notes.
our credit ratings may not reflect all risks of an investment in our senior notes.
the credit ratings assigned to our senior notes are limited in scope, and do not address all material risks relating to an investment in our senior notes, but rather reflect only the view of each rating agency at the time the rating is issued. there can be no assurance that such credit ratings will remain in effect for any given period of time or that a rating will not be lowered, suspended or withdrawn entirely by the applicable rating agencies, if, in such rating agency's judgment, circumstances so warrant. credit ratings are not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold any security. each agency's rating should be evaluated independently of any other agency's rating. actual or anticipated changes or downgrades in our credit ratings, including any announcement that our ratings are under further review for a downgrade, could affect the market prices of our securities and increase our borrowing costs.
risks related to our relationship with pfizer certain of our directors may have actual or potential conflicts of interest because of their positions with pfizer.
certain of our directors are employed or have been employed by pfizer or may own pfizer common stock, options to purchase pfizer common stock or other pfizer equity awards. certain of these holdings may be individually significant to these directors as compared with such director's total assets. these directors' positions at pfizer and the ownership of any pfizer equity or equity awards may create, or may create the appearance of, conflicts of interest when these directors are faced with decisions that could have different implications for pfizer than for us.
pfizer's rights as licensor under the patent and know-how license could limit our ability to develop and commercialize certain products.
under the patent and know-how license agreement (pfizer as licensor) (the patent and know-how license agreement), pfizer licenses to us certain of its intellectual property. if we fail to comply with our obligations under this license agreement and pfizer exercises its right to terminate it, our ability to continue to research, develop and commercialize products incorporating that intellectual property will be limited. in
|
addition, in circumstances where pfizer has an interest in the licensed intellectual property in connection with its human health development programs, our rights to use the licensed intellectual property are restricted and/or, in limited instances, subject to pfizer's right to terminate such license at will. these limitations and termination rights may make it more difficult, time-consuming or expensive for us to develop and commercialize certain new products, or may result in our products being later to market than those of our competitors.
we are dependent on pfizer to prosecute, maintain and enforce certain intellectual property.
under the patent and know-how license agreement, pfizer is responsible for filing, prosecuting and maintaining patents that pfizer licenses to us. in the animal health field, pfizer has the first right, and in some cases the sole right, to enforce such licensed patents, and in the human health field, subject to certain exceptions, pfizer has the sole right to enforce the licensed patents. if pfizer fails to fulfill its obligations or chooses to not enforce the licensed patents under this agreement, we may not be able to prevent competitors from making, using and selling competitive products, which could have an adverse effect on our business.
to preserve the tax-free treatment to pfizer and/or its stockholders of the exchange offer and certain related transactions, we may not be able to engage in certain transactions.
on may 22, 2013, pfizer announced an exchange offer (the exchange offer) whereby pfizer shareholders could exchange a portion of pfizer common stock for zoetis common stock. the exchange offer was completed on june 24, 2013, resulting in the full separation of zoetis and the disposal of pfizer's entire ownership and voting interest in zoetis. to preserve the tax-free treatment to pfizer and/or its stockholders of the exchange offer and certain related transactions, under the tax matters agreement, we are restricted from taking any action that prevents such transactions from being tax-free for u.s. federal, state, local and foreign income tax purposes. these restrictions may limit our ability to engage in certain transactions, including taking certain actions with respect to our 3.250% senior notes due 2023.
if there is a later determination that the exchange offer or certain related transactions are taxable for u.s. federal income tax purposes because the facts, assumptions, representations or undertakings underlying the irs private letter ruling and/or any tax opinion are incorrect or for any other reason, we could incur significant liabilities.
pfizer has received a private letter ruling from the irs substantially to the effect that, among other things, the exchange offer will qualify as a transaction that is tax-free for u.s. federal income tax purposes under sections 355 and 368(a)(1)(d) of the u.s. internal revenue code of 1986 (the code). completion by pfizer of the exchange offer was conditioned on, among other things, the continuing application of pfizer's private letter ruling from the irs and the receipt of an opinion of tax counsel, to the effect that, among other things, the exchange offer will qualify as a transaction that is tax-free for u.s. federal income tax purposes under sections 355 and 368(a)(1)(d) of the code. the ruling and the opinion rely on certain facts, assumptions, representations and undertakings from pfizer and us regarding the past and future conduct of the companies' respective businesses and other matters. if any of these facts, assumptions, representations or undertakings are incorrect or not otherwise satisfied, pfizer and its stockholders may not be able to rely on the ruling or the opinion of tax counsel and could be subject to significant tax liabilities. notwithstanding the private letter ruling and opinion of tax counsel, the irs could determine on audit that the exchange offer or certain related transactions are taxable if it determines that any of these facts, assumptions, representations or undertakings are not correct or have been violated or if it disagrees with the conclusions in the opinion that are not covered by the private letter ruling, or for other reasons, including as a result of certain significant changes in the stock ownership of pfizer or us after the exchange offer. if the exchange offer or certain related transactions are determined to be taxable for u.s. federal income tax purposes, we could incur significant liabilities under applicable law or under the tax matters agreement.
risks related to our common stock the price of our common stock may fluctuate substantially, and you could lose all or part of your investment in zoetis common stock as a result.
there may be wide fluctuations in the market value of our common stock as a result of many factors. from our ipo through december 31, 2021, the sales price of our common stock as reported by the nyse has ranged from a low sales price of $28.14 on april 15, 2014 to a high sales price of $249.27 on december 30, 2021. some factors that may cause the market price of our common stock to fluctuate, in addition to the other risks mentioned in this section and in our 2021 annual report, are:
•our operating performance and the performance of our competitors;
•our or our competitors' press releases, other public announcements and filings with the sec regarding new products or services, enhancements, significant contracts, acquisitions or strategic investments;
•changes in earnings estimates or recommendations by securities analysts, if any, who cover our common stock;
•changes in our investor base;
•failures to meet external expectations or management guidance;
•fluctuations in our financial results or the financial results of companies perceived to be similar to us;
•changes in our capital structure or dividend policy, future issuances or repurchases of securities, sales of large blocks of common stock by our stockholders or the incurrence of additional debt;
•reputational issues;
•changes in general economic and market conditions in any of the regions in which we conduct our business;
•the impact of the covid-19 pandemic and related global macroeconomic conditions;
•the arrival or departure of key personnel;
•the actions of speculators and financial arbitrageurs (such as hedge funds);
|
•changes in applicable laws, rules or regulations and other dynamics; and
•other developments or changes affecting us, our industry or our competitors.
in addition, if the market for stocks in our industry or industries related to our industry, or the stock market in general, experiences a loss of investor confidence, the trading price of our common stock could decline for reasons unrelated to our business, financial condition and results of operations. if any of the foregoing occurs, it could cause our stock price to fall and may expose us to lawsuits that, even if unsuccessful, could be costly to defend and a distraction to management.
while we currently pay a quarterly cash dividend to our common stockholders, we may change our dividend policy at any time.
on december 7, 2021, our board of directors declared the 2022 first quarter dividend of $0.325 per share to be paid on march 1, 2022, to holders of record on january 20, 2022; and on february 8, 2022, our board of directors declared the 2022 second quarter dividend of $0.325 per share to be paid on june 1, 2022, to holders of record on april 21, 2022. although we currently pay a quarterly cash dividend to our common stockholders, we have no obligation to do so, and our dividend policy may change at any time without notice to our stockholders. returns on stockholders' investments will primarily depend on the appreciation, if any, in the price of our common stock. we anticipate that we will retain most of our future earnings, if any, for use in the development and expansion of our business, repayment of indebtedness and for general corporate purposes. the declaration and payment of dividends is at the discretion of our board of directors in accordance with applicable law after taking into account various factors, including our financial condition, operating results, current and anticipated cash needs, cash flows available in the u.s., impact on our effective tax rate, indebtedness, legal requirements and other factors that our board of directors deems relevant.
provisions in our restated certificate of incorporation, amended and restated by-laws, and delaware law may prevent or delay an acquisition of us, which could decrease the trading price of our common stock.
our amended and restated certificate of incorporation, which we refer to as "our certificate of incorporation," and our amended and restated by-laws, which we refer to as "our by-laws," contain provisions that are intended to deter coercive takeover practices and inadequate takeover bids and to encourage prospective acquirers to negotiate with our board of directors rather than to attempt a hostile takeover. these provisions include:
•a board of directors that is divided into three classes with staggered terms;
•rules regarding how our stockholders may present proposals or nominate directors for election at stockholder meetings;
•the right of our board of directors to issue preferred stock without stockholder approval;
•limitations on the right of stockholders to remove directors;
•limitations on the right of stockholders to act by written consent; and
•limitations on the right of stockholders to call for special meetings.
in addition, delaware law also imposes some restrictions on mergers and other business combinations between us and any holder of 15% or more of our outstanding common stock. these provisions apply even if the offer may be considered beneficial by some stockholders and could delay or prevent an acquisition that our board of directors determines is not in our and our stockholders' best interests.

item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations.
introduction our management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations (md&a) is provided to assist readers in understanding our performance, as reflected in the results of our operations, our financial condition and our cash flows. this md&a should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and notes to consolidated financial statements included in item 8. financial statements and supplementary data. the discussion in this md&a contains forward-looking statements that involve substantial risks and uncertainties. our objective is to also provide discussion of material events and uncertainties known to management that are reasonably likely to cause reported financial information not to be indicative of future results, which could differ materially from historical performance and from those anticipated in the forward-looking statements as a result of various factors such as those discussed in item 1a. risk factors and forward-looking statements and factors that may affect future results sections of this md&a.
a discussion regarding our financial condition and results of operations for fiscal 2021 compared to fiscal 2020 is presented below. a discussion regarding our financial condition and results of operations for fiscal 2020 compared to fiscal 2019 can be found under item 7 of part ii of our annual report on form 10-k for the fiscal year ended december 31, 2020, filed with the sec on february 16, 2021 (our "2020 annual report"), which is available free of charge on the sec's website at www.sec.gov.
overview of our business we are a global leader in the animal health industry, focused on the discovery, development, manufacture and commercialization of medicines, vaccines, diagnostic products and services, biodevices, genetic tests and precision animal health technology. for 70 years, we have been innovating ways to predict, prevent, detect, and treat animal illness, and continue to stand by those raising and caring for animals worldwide - from livestock farmers to veterinarians and pet owners.
we manage our operations through two geographic operating segments: the united states (u.s.) and international. within each of these operating segments, we offer a diversified product portfolio for both companion animals and livestock customers in order to capitalize on local and regional trends and customer needs. see notes to consolidated financial statements-note 19. segment information.
we directly market our products to veterinarians and livestock producers located in approximately 45 countries across north america, europe, africa, asia, australia and south america, and are a market leader in nearly all of the major regions in which we operate. through our efforts to establish an early and direct presence in many emerging markets, such as brazil, chile, china and mexico, we believe we are one of the largest animal health medicines and vaccines businesses as measured by revenue across emerging markets as a whole. in markets where we do not have a direct commercial presence, we generally contract with distributors that provide logistics and sales and marketing support for our products.
we believe our investments in one of the industry's largest sales organizations, including our extensive network of technical and veterinary operations specialists, our high-quality manufacturing and reliability of supply, and our long track record of developing products that meet customer needs, has led to enduring and valued relationships with our customers. our research and development (r&d) efforts enable us to deliver innovative products to address unmet needs and evolve our product lines so they remain relevant for our customers.
we have approximately 300 product lines that we sell in over 100 countries for the prediction, prevention, detection and treatment of diseases and conditions that affect various companion animal and livestock species. the diversity of our product portfolio and our global operations provides stability to our overall business. for instance, in livestock, impacts on our revenue that may result from disease outbreaks or weather conditions in a particular market or region are often offset by increased sales in other regions from exports and other species as consumers shift to other proteins.

our operating environment industry the animal health industry, which focuses on both companion animals and livestock, is a growing industry that impacts billions of people worldwide. the primary companion animal species are dogs, cats and horses. factors influencing growth in demand for companion animal medicines, vaccines and diagnostics include:
•economic development and related increases in disposable income, particularly in many emerging markets;
•increasing pet ownership and pet owners' commitment to the health and well-being of their pets;
•companion animals living longer;
•increasing medical treatment of companion animals; and
•advances in companion animal medicines, vaccines and diagnostics.
|
the primary livestock species for the production of animal protein are cattle (both beef and dairy), swine, poultry, fish and sheep. livestock health and production are essential to meeting the growing demand for animal protein of a global population. factors influencing growth in demand for livestock medicines and vaccines include:
•human population growth and increasing standards of living, particularly in many emerging markets;
•increasing demand for improved nutrition, particularly animal protein;
•natural resource constraints, such as scarcity of arable land, fresh water and increased competition for cultivated land, resulting in fewer resources that will be available to meet an increasing demand for animal protein;
•increasing urbanization; and
•increased focus on food safety and food security.
product development initiatives our future success depends on both our existing product portfolio and our pipeline of new products, including new products that we may develop through joint ventures and products that we are able to obtain through license or acquisition. we believe we are an industry leader in animal health r&d, with a track record of generating new products and product lifecycle innovation. the majority of our r&d programs focus on product lifecycle innovation, which is defined as r&d programs that leverage existing animal health products by adding new species or claims, achieving approvals in new markets or creating new combinations and reformulations. in addition to traditional medicines and vaccines, we develop products across additional categories to address the needs of veterinarians and producers to predict, prevent, detect and treat conditions in both companion animals and livestock, including products and services in diagnostics, genetics, precision animal health and digital and data analytics.
perceptions of product quality, safety and reliability we believe that animal health customers value high-quality manufacturing and reliability of supply. the importance of quality and safety concerns to pet owners, veterinarians and livestock producers also contributes to animal health brand loyalty, which often continues after the loss of patent-based and regulatory exclusivity. we depend on positive perceptions of the safety and quality of our products by our customers, veterinarians and end-users.
in addition, negative beliefs about animal health products generally could impact demand for our products. for example, the issue of the potential transfer of increased antibacterial resistance in bacteria from food-producing animals to human pathogens, and the causality of that transfer, continue to be the subject of global scientific and regulatory discussion. antibacterials refer to small molecules that can be used to treat or prevent bacterial infections and are a sub-categorization of the products that make up our anti-infectives and medicated feed additives portfolios. in some countries, this issue has led to government restrictions and bans on the use of specific antibacterials in some food-producing animals, regardless of the route of administration (in feed or injectable). these restrictions are more prevalent in countries where animal protein is plentiful and governments are willing to take action even when there is scientific uncertainty. in addition, consumer preferences in some markets have impacted the use of antibacterials in food producing animals. such restrictions and consumer preferences in some cases may negatively impact sales of our antibacterial products, but in other instances may increase sales of our products that can be used as antibacterial alternatives. our total revenue attributable to antibacterials for livestock was approximately $1.1 billion for the year ended december 31, 2021.
similarly, concerns regarding greenhouse gas emissions and other potential environmental impacts of livestock production have led to some consumers opting to limit or avoid consuming animal products. however, we believe the impact of this trend is limited as the livestock industry is still expected to continue to grow in order to feed a growing global population.
changing distribution channels for companion animal products in most markets, companion animal owners typically purchase their animal health products directly from veterinarians. however, in the u.s. and certain other markets, companion animal owners increasingly have the option to purchase animal health products from sources other than veterinarians, such as internet-based retailers, "big-box" retail stores or other over-the-counter distribution channels. this trend has been demonstrated by the shift away from the veterinarian distribution channel in the sale of flea and tick products in recent years and has been accelerated by the increase in e-commerce during the covid-19 pandemic. we believe the ability of pet owners to purchase our products online and from retail stores may increase pet owner compliance and result in increased sales, particularly in the near term. however, over time, we may be unable to sustain our current margins due to the increased purchasing power of such retailers as compared to traditional veterinary practices.
in addition, this trend could negatively impact the sales of products we primarily sell through the veterinarian distribution channel, as any decrease in visits to veterinarians by companion animal owners could reduce our market share and sales of such products. a reduction in the number of pet owners who purchase our products directly from their veterinarian could also lead to increased use of generic alternatives to our products or the increased substitution of our products with other animal health products or human health products if such other products are deemed to be lower-cost alternatives.
the overall economic environment in addition to industry-specific factors, we, like other businesses, face challenges related to global economic conditions. growth in both the livestock and companion animal sectors is driven by overall economic development and related growth, particularly in many emerging markets. in the past, certain of our customers and suppliers have been affected directly by economic downturns, which decreased the demand for our products and, in some cases, hindered our ability to collect amounts due from customers.
the cost of medicines and vaccines to our livestock producer customers is small relative to other production costs, including feed, and the use of these products is intended to improve livestock producers' economic outcomes. as a result, demand for our products has historically been more stable than demand for other production inputs. similarly, industry sources have reported that pet owners indicated a preference for reducing spending on other aspects of their lifestyle, including entertainment, clothing and household goods, before reducing spending on pet care. each of these factors, plus our broad and innovative portfolio, contributes to our ability to incorporate inflationary challenges into our product pricing and mitigate the impact on our results. while these factors have mitigated the impact of prior downturns in the global economy, future economic
|
challenges, including inflation, could increase cost sensitivity among our customers, which may result in reduced demand for our products, which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition.
competition the animal health industry is highly competitive. although our business is the largest based on revenue in the animal health industry (which includes medicines, vaccines and diagnostics), we face competition in the regions in which we operate. principal methods of competition vary depending on the particular region, species, product category or individual product. some of these methods include new product development, quality, price, service and promotion to veterinary professionals, pet owners and livestock producers. our competitors include standalone animal health businesses and the animal health businesses of large pharmaceutical companies. in recent years, there has been an increase in consolidation in the animal health industry. there are also many start-up companies working in the animal health area. in addition to competition from established market participants, there could be new entrants to the animal health medicines, vaccines and diagnostics industry in the future. we also compete with companies that produce generic products, following our products' loss of exclusivity in a given market. for example, draxxin currently competes with generic products in key markets including the u.s., europe, canada, mexico and australia. for more information regarding the generic competition we currently have and expect to encounter as patents on certain of our key products expire, see item 1. business - intellectual property.
weather conditions, climate change and the availability of natural resources the animal health industry and demand for many of our animal health products in a particular region are affected by weather conditions, as usage of our products follows varying weather patterns and weather-related pressures from pests, such as ticks. as a result, we may experience regional and seasonal fluctuations in our results of operations.
in addition, veterinary hospitals and practitioners depend on visits from and access to the animals under their care. veterinarians' patient volume and ability to operate could be adversely affected if they experience prolonged snow, ice or other severe weather conditions, particularly in regions not accustomed to sustained inclement weather. furthermore, weather conditions, including excessive cold or heat, natural disasters and other events, could negatively impact our livestock customers by impairing the health or growth of their animals or the production or availability of feed, as well as disrupting their normal operations. for example, livestock producers depend on the availability of natural resources, including large supplies of fresh water. their animals' health and their ability to operate could be adversely affected if they experience a shortage of fresh water due to human population growth, climate change or floods, droughts or other weather conditions. in the event of adverse weather conditions, climate-change related impacts or a shortage of fresh water, veterinarians and livestock producers may purchase less of our products.
for example, drought conditions could negatively impact, among other things, the supply of corn and the availability of grazing pastures. a decrease in harvested corn results in higher corn prices, which could negatively impact the profitability of livestock producers of cattle, pork and poultry. higher corn prices and reduced availability of grazing pastures contribute to reductions in herd or flock sizes that in turn result in less spending on animal health products. as such, a prolonged drought could have a material adverse impact on our operating results and financial condition.
adverse weather conditions, natural disasters and climate change may also impact the aquaculture business. changes in water temperatures could affect the timing of reproduction and growth of various fish species, as well as trigger the outbreak of certain waterborne diseases.
uncertainty relating to covid-19
we continue to closely monitor the impact of the coronavirus (covid-19) pandemic and the resulting global recession on all aspects of our business across geographies, including how it has and may continue to impact our customers, workforce, suppliers and vendors. although we are unable to fully predict the impact that the covid-19 pandemic will ultimately have on our future financial position and operating results, we continue to monitor the potential effects, including impacts on our supply chain, the effect on customer demand, and changes to our operations. we cannot predict the impact that the covid-19 pandemic will have on our customers, vendors and suppliers; however, any material effect on these parties could adversely impact us.
the situation surrounding covid-19 remains fluid, and we will continue to actively monitor the situation and may take actions that alter our business operations that we determine are in the best interests of our workforce, customers, vendors, suppliers, and other stakeholders, or as required by federal, state, or local authorities.
for further information regarding the impact of covid-19 on the company, see item 1a, risk factors in this annual report on form 10-k.
disease outbreaks sales of our livestock products have in the past, and may in the future be, adversely affected by the outbreak of disease carried by animals. outbreaks of disease may reduce regional or global sales of particular animal-derived food products or result in reduced exports of such products, either due to heightened export restrictions or import prohibitions, which may reduce demand for our products. also, the outbreak of any highly contagious disease near our main production sites could require us to immediately halt production of our products at such sites or force us to incur substantial expenses in procuring raw materials or products elsewhere. alternatively, sales of products that treat specific disease outbreaks may increase.
manufacturing and supply in order to sell our products, we must be able to produce and ship our products in sufficient quantities. many of our products involve complex manufacturing processes and are sole-sourced from certain manufacturing sites. minor deviations in our manufacturing or logistical processes, such as temperature excursions or improper package sealing, could result in delays, inventory shortages, unanticipated costs, product recalls, product liability and/or regulatory action. in addition, a number of factors could cause production interruptions that could result in launch delays, inventory shortages, recalls, unanticipated costs or issues with our agreements under which we supply third parties.
in 2021, we experienced isolated supply challenges for librela, solensia and some of our other products, resulting from strong demand as well as competition for manufacturing inputs with human health vaccine development during the pandemic. some of these challenges are expected to continue in 2022, but are being managed by our global manufacturing network through certain supply chain optimizations, controlled launches for new products in additional markets and customer coordination.
|
our manufacturing network may be unable to meet the demand for our products or we may have excess capacity if demand for our products changes. the unpredictability of a product's regulatory or commercial success or failure, the lead time necessary to construct highly technical and complex manufacturing sites, and shifting customer demand increase the potential for capacity imbalances.
foreign exchange rates significant portions of our revenue and costs are exposed to changes in foreign exchange rates. our products are sold in more than 100 countries and, as a result, our revenue is influenced by changes in foreign exchange rates. for the year ended december 31, 2021, approximately 44% of our revenue was denominated in foreign currencies. we seek to manage our foreign exchange risk, in part, through operational means, including managing same-currency revenue in relation to same-currency costs and same-currency assets in relation to same-currency liabilities. as we operate in multiple foreign currencies, including the australian dollar, brazilian real, british pound, canadian dollar, chinese yuan, euro and other currencies, changes in those currencies relative to the u.s. dollar will impact our revenue, cost of goods and expenses, and consequently, net income. exchange rate fluctuations may also have an impact beyond our reported financial results and directly impact operations. these fluctuations may affect the ability to buy and sell our goods and services between markets impacted by significant exchange rate variances. for the year ended december 31, 2021, approximately 56% of our total revenue was in u.s. dollars. our year-over-year total revenue growth was favorably impacted by 1% from changes in foreign currency values relative to the u.s. dollar.
our growth strategies we seek to enhance the health of animals and to bring solutions to our customers who raise and care for them. we have a global presence in both developed and emerging markets and across eight core species. we intend to grow our business by pursuing the following core strategies:
•drive innovative growth - we seek to deliver new products and solutions as well as lifecycle innovations across the continuum of care that spans from disease prediction and prevention to detection and treatment. we are focused on innovating across vaccines, pharmaceuticals, diagnostics, genetics, biodevices, and other product segments, and across all core species. where appropriate, we complement internal r&d programs with external innovations;
•enhance customer experience - we believe that delighting our customers with compelling and personalized experiences that enable them to provide the best care for animals is critical for our success. we are focused on providing greater value to our customers through the integration and connectedness of our portfolio and by reducing frictions in the way they engage with us and our products and solutions;
•lead in digital and data analytics - we believe that healthcare insights enabled by data and digital technology and complemented with our comprehensive portfolio of products and solutions will be critical in enhancing care for animals and improving livestock productivity;
•cultivate a high-performing organization - we view the strength of our leadership team and our talented colleagues around the world as a critical component of our past and future success. we are committed to continuing to be a company our colleagues can be proud of and to attracting, retaining and developing the best, most diverse talent in the industry. we are further committed to sustaining a diverse, equitable and inclusive work environment for our colleagues; and
•champion a healthier, more sustainable future - as the world's leading animal health company, our business purpose is well aligned with our social purpose. we strive to make a meaningful difference in society through the three pillars of our sustainability approach: (1) by caring and collaborating with our customers, colleagues, and communities, and the animals that depend on them by improving access to care for animals, by creating a diverse, equitable, and inclusive work environment, and by supporting the veterinary profession; (2) by leveraging our innovation capabilities to develop solutions that improve productivity, keep animals healthy, and fight emerging infectious diseases; and (3) by taking actions to protect our planet that reduce our footprint on the environment.
components of revenue and costs and expenses our revenue, costs and expenses are reported for the year ended december 31 for each year presented, except for operations outside the u.s., for which the financial information is included in our consolidated financial statements for the fiscal year ended november 30 for each year presented.
revenue our revenue is primarily derived from our diversified product portfolio of medicines, vaccines and diagnostic products and services used to treat and protect companion animals and livestock. generally, our products are promoted to veterinarians and livestock producers by our sales organization which includes sales representatives and technical and veterinary operations specialists, and then sold directly by us or through distributors, retailers or e-commerce outlets. the depth of our product portfolio enables us to address the varying needs of customers in different species and geographies. in 2021, our two top-selling products, apoquel and simparica/simparica trio, each contributed approximately 10% of our revenue, and combined with our next three top-selling products, revolution/revolution plus/stronghold, cytopoint and the ceftiofur line, these five contributed approximately 33% of our revenue. our ten top-selling product lines contributed 47% of our revenue. for additional information regarding our products, including descriptions of our product lines that each represented approximately 1% or more of our revenue in 2021, see item 1. business-products.
costs and expenses costs of sales consist primarily of cost of materials, facilities and other infrastructure used to manufacture our medicine and vaccine products, as well as costs to operate our reference labs and royalty expenses associated with the intellectual property of our products, when relevant.
selling, general and administrative (sg&a) expenses consist of, among other things, the internal and external costs of marketing, promotion, advertising and shipping and handling as well as certain costs related to business technology, facilities, legal, finance, human resources, business development, public affairs and procurement.
|
research and development (r&d) expenses consist primarily of project costs specific to new product r&d and product lifecycle innovation, overhead costs associated with r&d operations and investments that support local market clinical trials for approved indications and expenses related to regulatory approvals for our products. we do not disaggregate r&d expenses by research stage or by therapeutic area for purposes of managing our business.
amortization of intangible assets consists primarily of the amortization expense for identifiable finite-lived intangible assets that have been acquired through business combinations. these assets consist of, but are not limited to, developed technology, brands and trademarks.
restructuring charges and certain acquisition-related costs consist of all restructuring charges (those associated with acquisition activity and those associated with cost reduction/productivity initiatives), as well as costs associated with acquiring and integrating businesses. restructuring charges are associated with employees, assets and activities that will not continue in the company. acquisition-related costs are associated with acquiring and integrating acquired businesses, such as abaxis in 2018, and may include transaction costs and expenditures for consulting and the integration of systems and processes.
other (income)/deductions-net consists of various items, primarily net (gains)/losses on asset disposals, interest income, royalty-related income, foreign exchange translation (gains)/losses and certain asset impairment charges.
significant accounting policies and application of critical accounting estimates in presenting our financial statements in conformity with u.s. gaap, we are required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, costs and expenses and related disclosures. for a description of our significant accounting policies, see notes to consolidated financial statements- note 3. significant accounting policies.
we believe that the following accounting policies are critical to an understanding of our consolidated financial statements as they require the application of the most difficult, subjective and complex judgments and, therefore, could have the greatest impact on our financial statements: (i) fair value; (ii) revenue; (iii) asset impairment reviews; and (iv) contingencies.
below are some of our more critical accounting estimates. see also notes to consolidated financial statements- note 3. significant accounting policies: estimates and assumptions for a discussion about the risks associated with estimates and assumptions.
fair value for a discussion about the application of fair value to our long-term debt and financial instruments, see notes to consolidated financial statements-
note 9. financial instruments.
for a discussion about the application of fair value to our business combinations, see notes to consolidated financial statements- note 3. significant accounting policies: fair value.
for a discussion about the application of fair value to our asset impairment reviews, see asset impairment reviews below.
revenue our gross product revenue is subject to deductions that are generally estimated and recorded in the same period that the revenue is recognized and primarily represents sales returns and revenue incentives. for example:
•for sales returns, we perform calculations in each market that incorporate the following, as appropriate: local returns policies and practices; returns as a percentage of revenue; an understanding of the reasons for past returns; estimated shelf life by product; an estimate of the amount of time between shipment and return or lag time; and any other factors that could impact the estimate of future returns, product recalls, discontinuation of products or a changing competitive environment; and
•for revenue incentives, we use our historical experience with similar incentives programs to estimate the impact of such programs on revenue.
if any of our ratios, factors, assessments, experiences or judgments are not indicative or accurate predictors of our future experience, our results could be materially affected. although the amounts recorded for these revenue deductions are dependent on estimates and assumptions, historically our adjustments to actual results have not been material. the sensitivity of our estimates can vary by program, type of customer and geographic location.
amounts recorded for revenue deductions can result from a complex series of judgments about future events and uncertainties and can rely on estimates and assumptions. for further information about the risks associated with estimates and assumptions, see notes to consolidated financial statements- note 3. significant accounting policies: estimates and assumptions.
asset impairment reviews we review all of our long-lived assets for impairment indicators throughout the year and we perform detailed testing whenever impairment indicators are present. in addition, we perform impairment testing for goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets at least annually. when necessary, we record charges for impairments of long-lived assets for the amount by which the fair value is less than the carrying value of these assets.
our impairment review processes are described below and in notes to consolidated financial statements- note 3. significant accounting policies: amortization of intangible assets, depreciation and certain long-lived assets and, for deferred tax assets, in note 3. significant accounting policies: deferred tax assets and liabilities and income tax contingencies.
examples of events or circumstances that may be indicative of impairment include:
•a significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which an asset is used. for example, restrictions imposed by the regulatory authorities could affect our ability to manufacture or sell a product; and
|
•a projection or forecast that demonstrates losses or reduced profits associated with an asset. this could result, for example, from the introduction of a competitor's product that results in a significant loss of market share or the inability to achieve the previously projected revenue growth, or from the lack of acceptance of a product by customers.
for finite-lived identifiable intangible assets, such as developed technology rights, and for other long-lived assets, such as property, plant and equipment, whenever impairment indicators are present, we calculate the undiscounted value of the projected cash flows associated with the asset, or asset group, and compare this estimated amount to the carrying amount. if the carrying amount is found to be greater, we record an impairment loss for the excess of book value over fair value. in addition, in all cases of an impairment review, we re-evaluate the remaining useful lives of the assets and modify them, as appropriate.
our impairment reviews of most of our long-lived assets depend on the determination of fair value, as defined by u.s. gaap, and these judgments can materially impact our results of operations. a single estimate of fair value can result from a complex series of judgments about future events and uncertainties and can rely on estimates and assumptions. for information about the risks associated with estimates and assumptions, see notes to consolidated financial statements-note 3. significant accounting policies: estimates and assumptions.
intangible assets other than goodwill we test indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment at least annually, or more frequently if impairment indicators exist, by first assessing qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible asset is less than its carrying amount. if we conclude it is more likely than not that the fair value is less than the carrying amount, a quantitative test that compares the fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible asset with its carrying value is performed. if the fair value is less than the carrying amount, an impairment loss is recognized. impairments of identifiable intangible assets other than goodwill, are recorded in restructuring charges and certain acquisition-related costs and other (income)/deductions-net, as applicable. we did not have any significant intangible asset impairment charges for the years ended december 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019.
when we are required to determine the fair value of intangible assets other than goodwill, we use an income approach, specifically the multi-period excess earnings method, also known as the discounted cash flow method. we start with a forecast of all the expected net cash flows associated with the asset, which includes the application of a terminal value for indefinite-lived assets, and then we apply an asset-specific discount rate to arrive at a net present value amount. some of the more significant estimates and assumptions inherent in this approach include: the amount and timing of the projected net cash flows, which includes the expected impact of competitive, legal and/or regulatory forces on the projections, the impact of technological risk associated with ipr&d assets, as well as the selection of a long-term growth rate; the discount rate, which seeks to reflect the risks inherent in the projected cash flows; foreign currency fluctuations; and the effective tax rate, which seeks to incorporate the geographic diversity of the projected cash flows.
while all identifiable intangible assets can be impacted by events and thus lead to impairment, in general, identifiable intangible assets that are at the highest risk of impairment include ipr&d assets (approximately $88 million as of december 31, 2021). ipr&d assets are higher-risk assets because r&d is an inherently risky activity.
for a description of our accounting policy, see notes to consolidated financial statements-note 3. significant accounting policies: amortization of intangible assets, depreciation and certain long-lived assets.
goodwill goodwill represents the excess of the consideration transferred over the fair value of net assets of businesses purchased and is assigned to reporting units. we test goodwill for impairment on at least an annual basis, or more frequently if necessary, either by assessing qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount or by performing a periodic quantitative assessment.
factors considered in the qualitative assessment include general macroeconomic conditions, conditions specific to the industry and market, cost factors which could have a significant effect on earnings or cash flows, the overall financial performance of the reporting unit and whether there have been sustained declines in our share price. additionally, we evaluate the extent to which the fair value exceeded the carrying value of the reporting unit at the date of the last quantitative assessment performed.
when performing a quantitative assessment to test for goodwill impairment we utilize the income approach, which is forward-looking, and relies primarily on internal forecasts. within the income approach, the method that we use is the discounted cash flow method. we start with a forecast of all the expected net cash flows associated with the reporting unit, which includes the application of a terminal value, and then apply a reporting unit-specific discount rate to arrive at a net present value. some of the more significant estimates and assumptions inherent in this approach include: the amount and timing of the projected net cash flows, which includes the expected impact of technological risk and competitive, legal and/or regulatory forces on the projections, as well as the selection of a long-term growth rate; the discount rate, which seeks to reflect the various risks inherent in the projected cash flows; and the effective tax rate, which seeks to incorporate the geographic diversity of the projected cash flows.
we test goodwill for impairment on at least an annual basis, or more frequently if necessary, either by assessing qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount or by performing a periodic quantitative assessment. in 2021 and 2020, we performed a periodic quantitative impairment assessment as of september 30, 2021 and 2020, respectively, which did not result in the impairment of goodwill associated with any of our reporting units.
for all of our reporting units, there are a number of future events and factors that may impact future results and that could potentially have an impact on the outcome of subsequent goodwill impairment testing. for a list of these factors, see forward-looking statements and factors that may affect future results.

non-gaap financial measures we report information in accordance with u.s. generally accepted accounting principles (gaap). management also measures performance using non-gaap financial measures that may exclude certain amounts from the most directly comparable gaap measure. despite the importance of these measures to management in goal setting and performance measurement, non-gaap financial measures have no standardized meaning prescribed by u.s. gaap and, therefore, have limits in their usefulness to investors and may not be comparable to the calculation of similar measures of other companies. we present certain identified non-gaap measures solely to provide investors with useful information to more fully understand how management assesses performance.
operational growth we believe that it is important to not only understand overall revenue and earnings growth, but also "operational growth." operational growth is a non-gaap financial measure defined as revenue or earnings growth excluding the impact of foreign exchange. this measure provides information on the change in revenue and earnings as if foreign currency exchange rates had not changed between the current and prior periods to facilitate a period-to-period comparison. we believe this non-gaap measure provides a useful comparison to previous periods for the company and investors, but should not be viewed as a substitute for u.s. gaap reported growth.
adjusted net income and adjusted earnings per share adjusted net income and the corresponding adjusted earnings per share (eps) are non-gaap financial measures of performance used by management. we believe these financial measures are useful supplemental information to investors when considered together with our u.s. gaap financial measures. we report adjusted net income to portray the results of our major operations, and the discovery, development, manufacture and commercialization of our products, prior to considering certain income statement elements. we define adjusted net income and adjusted eps as net income attributable to zoetis and eps before the impact of purchase accounting adjustments, acquisition-related costs and certain significant items.
we recognize that, as an internal measure of performance, the adjusted net income and adjusted eps measures have limitations, and we do not restrict our performance management process solely to these metrics. a limitation of the adjusted net income and adjusted eps measures is that they provide a view of our operations without including all events during a period, such as the effects of an acquisition or amortization of purchased intangibles, and do not provide a comparable view of our performance to other companies. the adjusted net income and adjusted eps measures are not, and should not be viewed as, a substitute for u.s. gaap reported net income attributable to zoetis and reported eps. see the adjusted net income section below for more information.

the income tax provision in the consolidated statements of income includes tax costs and benefits, such as uncertain tax positions, repatriation decisions and audit settlements, among others.
2021 vs. 2020
the higher effective tax rate in 2021 compared with 2020 is primarily due to the following components:
•changes in the jurisdictional mix of earnings, which includes the impact of the location of earnings from operations and repatriation costs. the jurisdictional mix of earnings can vary as a result of repatriation decisions, operating fluctuations in the normal course of business and the impact of non-deductible and non-taxable items. in addition, 2021 includes a tax benefit related to foreign-derived intangible income;
•a $6 million and $19 million discrete tax benefit recorded in 2021 and 2020, respectively, related to changes in various other tax items;
•a $7 million discrete tax benefit recorded in 2020 related to a remeasurement of deferred tax assets and liabilities resulting from the integration of acquired businesses;
•a $1 million discrete tax expense and a $4 million discrete tax benefit recorded in 2021 and 2020, respectively, related to a remeasurement of deferred tax assets and liabilities as a result of changes in statutory tax rates; and
•a $24 million and $29 million discrete tax benefit recorded in 2021 and 2020, respectively, related to the excess tax benefits for share-based payments, partially offset by:
•a $5 million discrete tax expense recorded in 2020 related to changes in valuation allowances; and

•an $8 million and $4 million discrete tax benefit recorded in 2021 and 2020, respectively, related to the effective settlement of certain issues with tax authorities.
operating segment results beginning in the first quarter of 2021, certain costs associated with information technology that specifically support our global manufacturing operations, which were previously reported in other unallocated, are now reported in corporate. in addition, in the first quarter of 2021, the company realigned certain management responsibilities. these changes did not impact the determination of our operating segments, however they resulted in the reallocation of certain costs between segments. these changes primarily include the following: (i) certain diagnostics costs, which were previously reported in corporate, are now reported in our u.s. results; and (ii) certain other miscellaneous costs, which were previously reported in our u.s. results, are now reported in corporate.

2021 vs. 2020
u.s. operating segment u.s. segment revenue increased by $485 million, or 14%, in 2021 compared with 2020, of which $599 million resulted from growth in companion animal products, offset by a $114 million decline in livestock products.
•companion animal revenue growth was driven primarily by increased sales of parasiticides including simparica trio, as well as the proheart and revolution/stronghold franchises. in-line product growth benefited from increased sales of our key dermatology portfolio, vaccines and diagnostics products.
•livestock revenue declined due to cattle, poultry and swine. cattle product sales declined as a result of increased generic competition and challenges in the beef and dairy end-markets due to rising input costs. the poultry portfolio declined as a result of the expanded use of lower cost alternatives and smaller flock sizes reducing disease pressure, as well as generic competition. the decline in swine product sales was primarily due to pricing pressures on our anti-infective and vaccine portfolio and a non-recurring government purchase in the prior year.
u.s. segment earnings increased by $330 million, or 15%, in 2021 compared with 2020, primarily due to revenue and gross margin growth, partially offset by higher operating expenses.
international operating segment international segment revenue increased by $617 million, or 20%, in 2021 compared with 2020. operational revenue growth was $519 million, or 17%, reflecting growth of $383 million in companion animal products and $136 million in livestock products.
•companion animal operational revenue growth resulted primarily from increased sales of our parasiticide products including the simparica/simparica trio and revolution/stronghold franchises. also contributing to growth were our key dermatology portfolio, vaccine products, the recent launches of our mab therapies, librela and solensia, and diagnostics products. growth across the broader in-line portfolio benefited from increased pet ownership and standards of care.
•livestock operational revenue growth was primarily driven by increased sales in cattle, swine and fish. growth in cattle product sales was mainly due to the effect of marketing campaigns, key account penetration and favorable export market conditions in brazil and favorable conditions in other emerging markets. sales of swine products grew as a result of expanding pork production in the wake of african swine fever in china in the first half of the year. fish growth was due to an increase in sales of the alpha flux sea lice treatment product, an increase in vaccine sales in key salmon markets and the 2020 acquisition of fish vet group.
•additionally, international segment revenue was favorably impacted by foreign exchange which increased revenue by approximately $98 million, or 3%, primarily driven by the euro, chinese yuan, australian dollar and canadian dollar, partially offset by the brazilian real and argentinian peso.
international segment earnings increased by $401 million, or 26%, in 2021 compared with 2020. operational earnings growth was $324 million, or 21%, primarily due to revenue and gross margin growth, partially offset by higher operating expenses.
other business activities other business activities includes our css contract manufacturing results, our human health business and expenses associated with our dedicated veterinary medicine r&d organization, research alliances, u.s. regulatory affairs and other operations focused on the development of our products. other r&d-related costs associated with non-u.s. market and regulatory activities are generally included in the international segment.
2021 vs. 2020
other business activities net loss increased by $34 million, or 9%, in 2021 compared with 2020, reflecting an increase in r&d costs due to an increase in compensation-related costs, an increase in project investments and unfavorable foreign exchange.
reconciling items reconciling items include certain costs that are not allocated to our operating segments results, such as costs associated with the following:
•corporate, which includes certain costs associated with information technology, facilities, legal, finance, human resources, business development and communications, among others. these costs also include certain compensation costs, certain procurement costs, and other miscellaneous operating expenses that are not charged to our operating segments, as well as interest income and expense;
•certain transactions and events such as (i) purchase accounting adjustments, which includes expenses associated with the amortization of fair value adjustments to inventory, intangible assets and property, plant and equipment; (ii) acquisition-related activities, which includes costs for acquisition and integration; and (iii) certain significant items, which includes non-acquisition-related restructuring charges, certain asset impairment charges, certain legal and commercial settlements, and costs associated with cost reduction/productivity initiatives; and
•other unallocated, which includes (i) certain overhead expenses associated with our global manufacturing operations not charged to our operating segments; (ii) certain costs associated with finance that specifically support our global manufacturing operations; (iii) certain supply chain and global logistics costs; and (iv) certain procurement costs.
2021 vs. 2020
corporate expenses increased by $173 million, or 20%, in 2021 compared with 2020, primarily due to increases in certain compensation-related costs, investments in information technology, charitable contributions and unfavorable foreign exchange. lower interest income was offset by lower interest expense.
|
other unallocated expenses increased by $31 million, or 11%, in 2021 compared with 2020, primarily due to higher manufacturing costs, higher freight charges and unfavorable foreign exchange, partially offset by lower inventory obsolescence, scrap and other charges.

adjusted net income general description of adjusted net income (a non-gaap financial measure)
adjusted net income is an alternative view of performance used by management, and we believe that investors' understanding of our performance is enhanced by disclosing this performance measure. the adjusted net income measure is an important internal measurement for us. additionally, we measure our overall performance on this basis in conjunction with other performance metrics. the following are examples of how the adjusted net income measure is utilized:
•senior management receives a monthly analysis of our operating results that is prepared on an adjusted net income basis;
•our annual budgets are prepared on an adjusted net income basis; and
•other goal setting and performance measurements.
purchase accounting adjustments adjusted net income is calculated prior to considering certain significant purchase accounting impacts that result from business combinations and net asset acquisitions. these impacts, primarily associated with the acquisition of abaxis (acquired in july 2018), the pharmaq business (acquired in november 2015), certain assets of abbott animal health (acquired in february 2015), king animal health (acquired in 2011), fort dodge animal health (acquired in 2009), and pharmacia animal health business (acquired in 2003), include amortization related to the increase in fair value of the acquired finite-lived intangible assets and depreciation related to the increase/decrease to fair value of the acquired fixed assets. therefore, the adjusted net income measure includes the revenue earned upon the sale of the acquired products without considering the aforementioned significant charges.
while certain purchase accounting adjustments can occur through 20 or more years, this presentation provides an alternative view of our performance that is used by management to internally assess business performance. we believe the elimination of amortization attributable to acquired intangible assets provides management and investors an alternative view of our business results by providing a degree of parity to internally developed intangible assets for which r&d costs previously have been expensed.
a completely accurate comparison of internally developed intangible assets and acquired intangible assets cannot be achieved through adjusted net income. these components of adjusted net income are derived solely from the impact of the items listed above. we have not factored in the impact of any other differences in experience that might have occurred if we had discovered and developed those intangible assets on our own, and this approach does not intend to be representative of the results that would have occurred in those circumstances. for example, our r&d costs in total, and in the periods presented, may have been different; our speed to commercialization and resulting revenue, if any, may have been different; or our costs to manufacture may have been different. in addition, our marketing efforts may have been received differently by our customers. as such, in total, there can be no assurance that our adjusted net income amounts would have been the same as presented had we discovered and developed the acquired intangible assets.
acquisition-related costs adjusted net income is calculated prior to considering transaction and integration costs associated with significant business combinations or net asset acquisitions because these costs are unique to each transaction and represent costs that were incurred to acquire and integrate certain businesses as a result of the acquisition decision. we have made no adjustments for the resulting synergies.
we believe that viewing income prior to considering these charges provides investors with a useful additional perspective because the significant costs incurred in a business combination result primarily from the need to eliminate duplicate assets, activities or employees--a natural result of acquiring a fully integrated set of activities. for this reason, we believe that the costs incurred to convert disparate systems, to close duplicative facilities or to eliminate duplicate positions (for example, in the context of a business combination) can be viewed differently from those costs incurred in the ordinary course of business.
the integration costs associated with a business combination may occur over several years, with the more significant impacts generally ending within three years of the transaction. because of the need for certain external approvals for some actions, the span of time needed to achieve certain restructuring and integration activities can be lengthy. for example, due to the regulated nature of the animal health medicines and vaccines business, the closure of excess facilities can take several years, as all manufacturing changes are subject to extensive validation and testing and must be approved by the fda and/or other regulatory authorities.
certain significant items adjusted net income is calculated excluding certain significant items. certain significant items represent substantive, unusual items that are evaluated on an individual basis. such evaluation considers both the quantitative and the qualitative aspect of their unusual nature. unusual, in this context, may represent items that are not part of our ongoing business; items that, either as a result of their nature or size, we would not expect to occur as part of our normal business on a regular basis; items that would be nonrecurring; or items that relate to products that we no longer sell. while not all-inclusive, examples of items that could be included as certain significant items would be costs related to a major non-acquisition-related restructuring charge and associated implementation costs for a program that is specific in nature with a defined term, such as those related to our non-acquisition-related cost-reduction and productivity initiatives; amounts related to disposals of products or facilities that do not qualify as discontinued operations as defined by u.s. gaap; certain intangible asset impairments; adjustments related to the resolution of certain tax positions; significant currency devaluation; the impact of adopting certain significant, event-driven tax legislation; costs related to our ceo transition in fiscal 2020; or charges related to legal matters. see notes to consolidated financial statements- note 18. commitments and contingencies. our normal, ongoing defense costs or settlements of and accruals on legal matters made in the normal course of our business would not be considered certain significant items.

analysis of the consolidated statements of comprehensive income substantially all changes in other comprehensive income for the periods presented are related to foreign currency translation adjustments. these changes result from the strengthening or weakening of the u.s. dollar as compared to the currencies in the countries in which we do business. the gains and losses associated with these changes are deferred on the balance sheet in accumulated other comprehensive loss until realized.
analysis of the consolidated balance sheets december 31, 2021 vs. december 31, 2020
for a discussion about the changes in cash and cash equivalents, short-term borrowings, current portion of long-term debt and long-term debt, net of discount and issuance costs, see "analysis of financial condition, liquidity and capital resources" below.
accounts receivable, less allowance for doubtful accounts increased primarily as a result of higher net sales in the period and the timing of customer payments, partially offset by the impact of foreign exchange and rebate credits issued to customers.
inventories increased primarily as a result of the build-up of certain products for increased demand and new product launches, partially offset by higher sales than anticipated for certain products. see notes to consolidated financial statements - note 11. inventories.
other current assets increased primarily due to the mark-to-market adjustment of derivative instruments and higher prepaid expenses, partially offset by the timing of income tax payments.
property, plant and equipment less accumulated depreciation increased primarily as a result of capital spending, partially offset by depreciation expense. see notes to consolidated financial statements - note 12. property, plant and equipment
53 |
the decreases in operating lease right of use assets and operating lease liabilities reflect lease amortization and payments, partially offset by assets acquired through new lease obligations. see notes to consolidated financial statements - note 10. leases.
identifiable intangible assets, less accumulated amortization decreased primarily as a result of amortization expense, the impairment of certain intangible assets and the impact of foreign exchange, partially offset by intangible asset additions from acquisitions. see notes to consolidated financial statements - note 13. goodwill and other intangible assets.
dividends payable increased as a result of an increase in the dividend rate for the first quarter 2022 dividend, which was declared on december 7, 2021.
accrued expenses increased primarily as a result of accrued contract rebates, accrued third-party inventory and other accrued expenses.
accrued compensation and related items increased primarily due to the accrual of 2021 annual incentive bonuses and a higher sales incentive bonus accrual, as well as the reclassification of fica payroll taxes to be paid in 2022 under the cares act from other noncurrent liabilities, partially offset by the payment of the 2020 annual incentive bonuses.
the net changes in noncurrent deferred tax assets, noncurrent deferred tax liabilities, income taxes payable and other taxes payable primarily reflect adjustments to the accrual for the income tax provision, the timing of income tax payments, the tax impact of various acquisitions, the impact of the remeasurement of deferred tax assets and liabilities as a result of changes in tax rates.
other current liabilities and other noncurrent liabilities decreased primarily due to the mark-to-market adjustment of derivative instruments, the reclassification of fica payroll taxes to be paid in 2022 under the cares act to accrued compensation and related items and decreases in accrued pension benefits and deferred compensation related to net investment activity.

operating activities
2021 vs. 2020
net cash provided by operating activities was $2,213 million in 2021 compared with $2,126 million in 2020. the increase in operating cash flows was primarily attributable to higher cash earnings, partially offset by timing of receipts and payments in the ordinary course of business.
investing activities
2021 vs. 2020
net cash used in investing activities was $458 million in 2021 compared with $572 million in 2020. the net cash used in investing activities for 2021 was primarily attributable to capital expenditures, acquisitions and purchase of investments, partially offset by proceeds from cross-currency interest rate swaps. the net cash used in investing activities for 2020 was primarily due to capital expenditures, acquisitions and net payments for cross-currency interest rate swaps, partially offset by proceeds from the sale of assets, including a cash payment received pursuant to an agreement related to the 2016 sale of certain u.s. manufacturing sites.
financing activities
2021 vs. 2020
net cash used in financing activities was $1,862 million in 2021 compared with net cash provided by financing activities of $123 million in 2020. the net cash used in financing activities for 2021 was primarily attributable to the purchase of treasury shares, the repayment of the $300 million aggregate principal amount of our 2018 floating rate senior notes due 2021 and the $300 million aggregate principal amount of our 2018 senior notes due 2021, the payment of dividends and taxes paid on withholding shares, partially offset by proceeds in connection with the issuance of common stock under our equity incentive plan. the net cash provided by financing activities for 2020 was primarily attributable to the proceeds received from the issuance of senior notes in may 2020 and net proceeds in connection with the issuance of common stock under our equity incentive plan, partially offset by the payment of dividends and the purchase of treasury shares.

analysis of financial condition, liquidity and capital resources while we believe our cash and cash equivalents on hand, our operating cash flows and our existing financing arrangements will be sufficient to support our cash needs for the next twelve months and beyond, this may be subject to the environment in which we operate. risks to our meeting future funding requirements include global economic conditions described in the following paragraph.
global financial markets may be impacted by macroeconomic, business and financial volatility. as markets change, we will continue to monitor our liquidity position. while we do not anticipate it, there can be no assurance that a challenging economic environment or an economic downturn will not impact our liquidity or our ability to obtain future financing.

(a)    accounts receivable are usually collected over a period of 45 to 75 days. for the years ended december 31, 2021 and 2020, the number of days that accounts receivables were outstanding have remained within this range. we regularly monitor our accounts receivable for collectability, particularly in markets where economic conditions remain uncertain. we believe that our allowance for doubtful accounts is appropriate. our assessment is based on such factors as past due aging, historical and expected collection patterns, the financial condition of our customers, the robust nature of our credit and collection practices and the economic environment.
for additional information about the sources and uses of our funds, see the analysis of the consolidated balance sheets and analysis of the consolidated statements of cash flows sections of this md&a.
credit facility and other lines of credit in december 2016, we entered into an amended and restated revolving credit agreement with a syndicate of banks providing for a multi-year $1.0 billion senior unsecured revolving credit facility (the credit facility). in december 2018, the maturity for the amended and restated credit facility was extended through december 2023. subject to certain conditions, we have the right to increase the credit facility to up to $1.5 billion. the credit facility contains a financial covenant requiring us to not exceed a maximum total leverage ratio (the ratio of consolidated net debt as of the end of the period to consolidated earnings before interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization (ebitda) for such period) of 3.50:1. upon entering into a material acquisition, the maximum total leverage ratio increases to 4.00:1, and extends until the fourth full consecutive fiscal quarter ended immediately following the consummation of a material acquisition.
the credit facility also contains a financial covenant requiring that we maintain a minimum interest coverage ratio (the ratio of ebitda at the end of the period to interest expense for such period) of 3.50:1. in addition, the credit facility contains other customary covenants.
we were in compliance with all financial covenants as of december 31, 2021 and december 31, 2020. there were no amounts drawn under the credit facility as of december 31, 2021 or december 31, 2020.
we have additional lines of credit and other credit arrangements with a group of banks and other financial intermediaries for general corporate purposes. we maintain cash and cash equivalent balances in excess of our outstanding short-term borrowings. as of december 31, 2021, we had access to $63 million of lines of credit which expire at various times through 2022, and are generally renewed annually. we had no borrowings outstanding related to these facilities as of december 31, 2021 and $4 million borrowings outstanding as of december 31, 2020.
domestic and international short-term funds many of our operations are conducted outside the u.s. the amount of funds held in the u.s. will fluctuate due to the timing of receipts and payments in the ordinary course of business and due to other reasons, such as business development activities. as part of our ongoing liquidity assessments, we regularly monitor the mix of u.s. and international cash flows (both inflows and outflows). actual repatriation of overseas funds can result in additional u.s and local income taxes, such as u.s. state income taxes, local withholding taxes, and taxes on currency gains and losses. see notes to consolidated financial statements- note 8. tax matters.
global economic conditions challenging economic conditions in recent years have not had, nor do we anticipate that it will have, a significant impact on our liquidity. due to our operating cash flows, financial assets, access to capital markets and available lines of credit and revolving credit agreements, we continue to believe that we have the ability to meet our liquidity needs for the foreseeable future. as markets change, we continue to monitor our liquidity position. there can be no assurance that a challenging economic environment or an economic downturn would not impact our ability to obtain financing in the future.

contractual obligations in the normal course of business, we enter into contracts and commitments that obligate us to make payments in the future. these obligations include long-term debt, including interest obligations, purchase obligations, operating lease commitments, other liabilities, benefit plan obligations and uncertain tax positions. see notes to consolidated financial statements-note 9. financial instruments, note 18. commitments and contingencies, note 10. leases, note 6. restructuring charges and other costs associated with acquisitions, cost-reduction and productivity initiatives, note 14. benefit plans and note 8. tax matters for further information on material cash requirements from known contractual and other obligations.

pension obligations our employees ceased to participate in the pfizer u.s. qualified defined benefit and u.s. retiree medical plans effective december 31, 2012, and liabilities associated with our employees under these plans were retained by pfizer. as part of the separation from pfizer, pfizer continued to credit certain employees' service with zoetis generally through december 31, 2017 (or termination of employment from zoetis, if earlier), for certain early retirement benefits with respect to pfizer's u.s. defined benefit pension and retiree medical plans. in connection with the employee matters agreement, zoetis is responsible for payment of three-fifths of the total cost of the service credit continuation (approximately $38 million) for these plans. the amount of the service cost continuation payment to be paid by zoetis to pfizer was determined and fixed based on an actuarial assessment of the value of the grow-in benefits and will be paid in equal installments over a period of 10 years. as of december 31, 2021, the remaining payments due to pfizer (approximately $4 million in the aggregate) are to be paid over the next year.
as part of the separation from pfizer, pfizer transferred to us the net pension obligations associated with certain international defined benefit plans. we expect to contribute a total of approximately $5 million to these plans in 2022.
as of december 31, 2021, the supplemental savings plan liability was approximately $51 million.
for additional information, see notes to consolidated financial statements- note 14. benefit plans.
share repurchase program in december 2018, the company's board of directors authorized a $2.0 billion share repurchase program. as of december 31, 2021, there was approximately $681 million remaining under this authorization. purchases of zoetis shares may be made at the discretion of management, depending on market conditions and business needs. share repurchases may be executed through various means, including open market or privately negotiated transactions. the company temporarily suspended share repurchases beginning in the second quarter of 2020. in january 2021, the company resumed share repurchases under its share repurchase program. during 2021, approximately 4.0 million shares were repurchased.
in december 2021, the company's board of directors authorized a $3.5 billion share repurchase program.
off-balance sheet arrangements in the ordinary course of business and in connection with the sale of assets and businesses, we may indemnify our counterparties against certain liabilities that may arise in connection with a transaction or that are related to activities prior to a transaction. these indemnifications typically pertain to environmental, tax, employee and/or product-related matters, and patent-infringement claims. if the indemnified party were to make a successful claim pursuant to the terms of the indemnification, we would be required to reimburse the loss. these indemnifications are generally subject to threshold amounts, specified claim periods and other restrictions and limitations. historically, we have not paid significant amounts under these provisions and, as of december 31, 2021 and december 31, 2020, recorded amounts for the estimated fair value of these indemnifications are not significant.

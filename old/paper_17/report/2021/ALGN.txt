item 1a. risk factors.
the following discussion is divided into two sections. the first, entitled "risks relating to our business operations and strategy," discusses some of the risks that may affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. the second, captioned "general risk factors," discusses some of the risks that apply generally to companies and to owning our common stock, in particular. you should carefully review both sections, as well as our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto and other information appearing in this annual report on form 10-k, for important information regarding these and other risks that may affect us. the order we have chosen to list the risks below or the sections in which we have identified them should not be interpreted to mean we deem any risks to be more or less important or likely to occur or, if any do occur, that their impact may be any less significant than others. these risk factors should be considered in connection with evaluating the forward-looking statements contained in this report because they could cause our actual results and conditions to differ materially from those statements. before you invest in align, you should know that investing involves risks, including those described below. the risks below are not the only ones we face. if any of the risks actually occur, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be negatively affected, the trading price of our common stock could decline, and you may lose all or part of your investment.
summary of risk factors the following is a summary of the risks that are more fully described below in this "risk factors" section:
risks relating to our business operations and strategy
•our results of operations have been materially adversely affected by global and regional efforts to mitigate the spread of covid-19 and we expect this will continue in as yet unknown ways and to varying degrees as the virus evolves and circumstances dictate.
•our net revenues are dependent primarily on our invisalign system and itero scanners and any decline in sales or average selling price of these products, for any reason, may adversely affect net revenues, gross margin and net income.
•competition in the markets for our products is increasing and we expect aggressive competition from existing competitors, other companies that may introduce new technologies in the future and customers who alone or with others create orthodontic appliances and solutions or other products or services that compete with us.
•an increasingly larger portion of our total revenues are derived from international sales and we are dependent on our international operations, which exposes us to foreign operational, political, military and other risks that may harm our business.
•demand for our products may not increase as rapidly as we anticipate or may decrease due to a variety of factors, including changing consumer demand, inflation, weakness in general economic conditions, recessions and resistance to non-traditional treatment methods.
•our success depends on our ability to develop, successfully introduce, achieve market acceptance of, and manage new products and services.
•as we continue to grow, we are subject to growth related risks, including risks related to excess or constrained capacity and operational inefficiencies at our manufacturing and treat facilities.
•our products and information technology systems are critical to our business. issues with product development or enhancements, it system integration, implementation, updates and upgrades along with security and data protection risks have previously and could again in the future disrupt our operations, which could have a material adverse impact on our business and operating results.
•if we are unable or fail to protect our customer or patient information or if we are unable to comply with applicable privacy, security and data protection laws, our operations may be severely adversely impacted, patient care could suffer, we could be liable for related damages, and our business, operations and reputation could be harmed.
•if we fail to sustain or increase revenue growth while controlling expenses, our profitability may decline.
•our operating results have and will continue to fluctuate in the future, which makes predicting the timing and amount of our revenues, costs and expenditures difficult.
•a disruption in the operations of a primary freight carrier, higher shipping costs or shipping delays could disrupt our supply chain and cause a decline in our net revenues or a reduction in our earnings.
•if we fail to accurately predict our volume growth, hire too many or too few technicians, or manufacture too many or too few products, the delivery time for our products could be delayed or our costs may exceed our revenues, each of which could adversely affect our results of operations.
•we are dependent on our marketing activities to deepen our market penetration and raise awareness of our brand and products, which may not prove successful or may become less effective or more costly to maintain in the long term.
•our success depends in part on our proprietary technology, and if we fail to successfully obtain or enforce our intellectual property ("ip") rights, our competitive position may be harmed. litigating claims of this type is costly and could distract our management and cause a decline in our results of operations and stock price.
•if we or any vendors on whose products or services we rely for our products and services infringe the patents or ip rights of other parties or are subject to a patent infringement claim, our ability to grow our business may be severely limited.
•obtaining approvals and complying with governmental regulations, particularly those related to personal healthcare information, financial information, quality systems and data privacy, is expensive and time-consuming, and any failure to obtain or maintain approvals or comply with regulations regarding our products or services or the products and services of our suppliers or customers could materially harm our sales, result in substantial penalties and cause harm to our reputation.
•we are highly dependent on third-party suppliers, some of whom are sole source suppliers, for certain key machines, components and materials, and our business and operating results could be harmed if supply is restricted or ends or the price of raw materials used in our manufacturing process increases.
•we rely on highly skilled personnel and, if we fail to attract, motivate, train or retain highly skilled personnel, it may be more difficult to grow effectively and pursue our strategic priorities.
•we use distributors for a portion of the importation, marketing and sales efforts related to our products and services, which exposes us to risks that may be harmful to our sales and operations, including that these distributors do not comply with applicable laws or our internal procedures.
•our business exposes us to potential liability for the quality and safety of our products and services, how we advertise and market those products and services and how and to whom we sell them, and we may incur substantial expenses or be found liable for substantial damages or penalties if we are subject to claims or litigation.
•compliance with current or future environmental, social, and governance ("esg") laws may materially increase our costs, expose us to potential liability and otherwise materially impact our business.
general risk factors
•we rely on our personnel and, if we fail to attract, motivate or retain personnel, or if our growth harms our corporate culture, it may be more difficult to grow effectively and pursue our strategic priorities.
•business disruptions could seriously harm our financial condition.
•changes in, or interpretations of, accounting rules and regulations, could result in unfavorable accounting charges.
•we are required to annually assess our internal control over financial reporting and any adverse results from such assessment may result in a loss of investor confidence in our financial reports and have an adverse effect on our stock price.
•we are exposed to fluctuations in currency exchange rates and inflation, each of which could negatively affect our financial condition and results of operations.
•if we fail to manage our exposure to global financial and securities market risks successfully, our operating results and financial statements could be materially impacted.
•if our goodwill or long-lived assets become impaired, we may be required to record a significant charge to earnings.
•our effective tax rate may vary significantly from period to period.
•new tax laws and practice, changes to existing tax laws and practice, or disputes regarding the positions we take regarding tax laws, could negatively affect our provision for income taxes as well as our ongoing operations.
•we have in the past and may again in the future invest in or acquire other businesses, products or technologies which may require significant management attention, disrupt our business, dilute stockholder value and adversely affect our results of operations.
•historically, the market price for our common stock has been volatile.
•we cannot guarantee that we will continue to repurchase our common stock in the future, and any repurchases that we may make may not achieve our desired objectives.
•future sales of significant amounts of our common stock may depress our stock price.
•increased scrutiny of our esg policies and practices have and will likely continue to result in additional costs and risks, and may adversely impact our reputation, employee retention, and willingness of customers and suppliers to do business with us.
risks relating to our business operations and strategy our results of operations have been materially adversely affected by global and regional efforts to mitigate the spread of covid-19 and we expect this will continue in as yet unknown ways and to varying degrees as the virus evolves and circumstances dictate.
the broad and extensive impact of the covid-19 pandemic on virtually all aspects of our business and society has exacerbated many pre-existing risks to our business by making them more likely to occur or more impactful when they do occur. accordingly, you should consider the risks described in this risk factor in addition to, and not in lieu of, the risks described elsewhere throughout these risk factors.
covid-19 has created significant, widespread and unprecedented volatility, uncertainty, and economic instability, disrupting broad aspects of the global economy, our operations and the businesses of our customers and suppliers. many of these effects continue to varying degrees and further mutated variants and outbreaks globally or regionally continue to harm recovering consumer confidence and have led to renewed implementation of harsh preventative measures by local and regional governments and businesses. therefore, comparing our financial results for the reporting periods of 2021 to the same reporting periods of 2020 or 2019 may not be a useful means by which to evaluate the health of our business and our results of operations.
as a result of the pandemic, customer demand and doctor availability has been inconsistent and difficult to predict. although the practices of the doctors, dental service organizations and labs that are our principal customers have largely reopened, many continue to operate at less than pre-pandemic capacities. in addition, new variants of the virus have caused unpredictable fluctuations in the number of patients seeking treatment and the number of doctors providing the services and treatments. while the pandemic increased demand for digital solutions such as the products and solutions we offer for the dental field, it is unclear whether increased demand for our products will continue. for instance, if the use of video conferencing declines when employees return to office work environments or the availability of travel, dining, entertainment and other consumer spending categories rebound, demand for our products or the growth rates for our products may decline. these fluctuations have adversely impacted our results of operations from time to time in the recent past and are expected to continue to impact our results, particularly in the near term.
in response to the pandemic, in 2020 we implemented measures aimed at limiting its spread for the health and safety of our employees, customers, patients and the communities in which we live and work as well as in accordance with orders and decrees of governmental agencies. these measures included diagnostic screenings at our facilities, increased social distancing mandates, closures of physical offices, manufacturing and treatment planning facilities, including our u.s. corporate headquarters and regional facilities worldwide, implementing remote working where feasible, and prohibiting non-essential travel. many of these actions remain in effect to varying degrees and we may implement new or revise existing measures as circumstances require. the actions and reactions to voluntary and involuntary protective measures have been highly disruptive to our business and may continue to be disruptive.
the rules and regulations for reopening and operating our offices will likely increase in complexity, making compliance more difficult. furthermore, if employees perceive the protocols and requirements we implement to create a safe and effective work environment to be inadequate, overly burdensome or no longer necessary, or alternatively, if we require employees to return to the office when they prefer the safety or convenience of working from home, employees may choose to leave, productivity may decline or we may experience employee unrest, slowdowns, stoppages or other demands. additionally, we may fail to timely meet customer demand or fulfill orders, the costs to maintain or implement protective measures or deliver our products may increase, and we may be subject to increased litigation, including product liability and occupational safety and condition claims. for further discussion or the risks related to employee satisfaction, retention and engagement see the risk factor "we rely on our personnel and, if we fail to attract, motivate or retain personnel, or if our growth harms our corporate culture, it may be more difficult to grow effectively and pursue our strategic priorities."
as the economic and societal impact of the pandemic continues, we are continually evaluating macroeconomic as well as industry-specific factors, including the extent our business and financial results and the business and financial results of our customers' and suppliers' have been and in the future may be impacted. the financial health and stability of businesses and consumers overall depends on numerous evolving factors, many of which we cannot control nor accurately predict. examples include:
•the duration, scope, and severity of governmental, business and societal actions in response to the pandemic;
•the impact on worldwide economic activity, employment rates and actions taken by central banks and governments;
•customer and consumer purchasing behavior changes as pandemic-related restrictions are curtailed, lifted or reinstated, and travel and discretionary spending patterns shift;
•the response of employees, customers and suppliers to the reimplementation or easing of social distancing mandates and returning to in-office or facility working, including anxieties regarding the continuing risks of the spread of the virus or any of its variants, vaccination requirements, and other mandates that may impact employee productivity and engagement, retention or require additional costly protective measures;
•the liquidity of funds and financial stability of consumers, customers, and patients, including their willingness to purchase our products and services, delays paying for products or services, requests for extended payment terms, or payment defaults;
•disruptions and shortages impacting the cost, availability and timing of the procurement, delivery, manufacturing and overall supply chain for raw materials, components, parts and products, including semiconductor chips;
•delays and cancellations as a result of port congestion and intermittent supplier shutdowns;
•travel and gathering restrictions, including those that adversely impair or prohibit our sales personnel from interacting with customers or that limit patients from visiting their doctors or capacity limits on the number of patients doctors can see in their offices;
•actions by competitors such as price reductions, aggressive product promotions, changes in or the launch or termination of products or product lines, and mergers, consolidations and liquidations;
•the confidence of our customers and patients that our products and solutions are sanitary and safe to use;
•data privacy and cybersecurity risks from new or expanded use of remote working and/or teledentistry by our suppliers, customers, and us, including new or expanded use of online service platforms, products and solutions such as video conferencing applications, doctor, consumer and patient apps, inadequately secured computing networks, servers, software or software applications, overheard telephone conversations, viewable computer screens, stolen passwords or access information, increased phishing and other cyber threats;
•the impact of remote working arrangements on our financial reporting systems and internal control over financial reporting, including our ability to ensure information required to be disclosed is timely and accurately recorded, processed, summarized, reported, and communicated to management, including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, as appropriate, to allow for timely decisions regarding required disclosure; and
•diversion of management's attention as they focus on the short- and long-term ramifications of the pandemic.
the effects of the pandemic continue to linger and evolve and we cannot predict future direct and ancillary impacts on our business or results of operations, although they may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and stock price as well as the businesses of our customers, suppliers and economic activity generally.
our net revenues are dependent primarily on our invisalign system and itero scanners and any decline in sales or average selling price of these products, for any reason, may adversely affect net revenues, gross margin and net income.
our net revenues remain largely dependent on sales of our invisalign system of clear aligners and itero intraoral scanners. of the two, we expect net revenues from the sale of the invisalign system, primarily our comprehensive products, will continue to account for the majority of our net revenues, making the continued and widespread acceptance of the invisalign system by orthodontists, gps and consumers critical to our future success. our itero scanners have become a material percentage of our overall revenues. although exocad and its cad/cam software solutions are important to the continuing evolution of the align digital platform, the contributions to our total net revenues from the exocad solutions remain immaterial. our operating results could be harmed if:
•orthodontists and gps experience a reduction in consumer demand for orthodontic services;
•consumers prove unwilling to adopt invisalign system treatment as rapidly or in the volumes we anticipate and at the prices offered;
•orthodontists or gps choose to continue using wires and brackets or competitive products rather than the invisalign system or the rates at which they utilize the invisalign system fail to increase or increase as rapidly as anticipated;
•sales of our itero scanners decline or fail to grow sufficiently or as expected;
•the growth of cad/cam solutions does not produce the results expected; or
•if the average selling price of our products declines.
the average selling prices of our products, particularly our invisalign system, are influenced by numerous factors, including the type and timing of products sold (particularly the timing of orders for additional clear aligners for certain invisalign products) and foreign exchange rates. in addition, we sell a number of products at different list prices which may differ based on country. our average selling prices have been impacted in the past and may be adversely affected again in the future if:
•we introduce new or change existing promotions, general or volume-based discount programs, product or services bundles, or consumer rebate programs;
•participation in any promotions or programs unexpectedly increases or decreases or drives demand in unexpected and material ways;
•our geographic, channel, or product mix shifts to lower priced products or to products that have a higher percentage of deferred revenue;
•we decrease prices on one or more products or services in response to increasing competitive pricing pressures;
•we introduce new or change existing products or services, or modify how we market or sell any of our new or existing products or services; or
•our critical accounting estimates materially differ from actual behavior or results.
if any of the foregoing were to occur, our net revenues, gross profit, gross margin and net income may decline.
competition in the markets for our products is increasing and we expect aggressive competition from existing competitors, other companies that may introduce new technologies in the future and customers who alone or with others create orthodontic appliances and solutions or other products or services that compete with us.
the dental industry is in a period of immense and rapid digital transformation involving products, technologies, distribution channels and business models. while solutions such as our invisalign system, itero scanners and cad/cam software facilitate this transition, whether our technologies will achieve market acceptance and, if adopted, whether and when they may become obsolete as new offerings become available remains unclear.
currently, the invisalign system competes directly against traditional metal wires and brackets and increasingly against clear aligners manufactured and distributed by new market entrants and manufacturers of traditional wires and brackets, both within and outside the u.s., and from traditional medical device companies, laboratories, startups and, in some cases, doctors and dsos themselves. due in part to market opportunities and the expiration of certain of our key patents beginning in 2017, competition in the clear aligner market is increasing. the number and types of competitors are diverse and growing rapidly. they vary by segment, geography, and size, and include new and well-established regional competitors, as well as larger companies or divisions of larger companies with substantial sales, marketing, research financial capabilities, and existing dental market channels. our competitors also include direct-to-consumer ("dtc") companies that provide clear aligners using a remote teledentistry model requiring little or no in-office care from trained and licensed doctors, and doctors and dsos who can manufacture custom aligners in their offices using modern 3d printing technology. large consumer product companies may also enter the orthodontic supply market.
the manipulation and movement of teeth and bone is a complex and delicate process with potentially painful and debilitating results if improperly performed or monitored. accordingly, we are committed to delivering our invisalign system solutions primarily through trained and skilled doctors. invisalign system treatment requires a doctor's prescription and an in person physical examination of the patient's dentition before beginning treatment; however, with the advent of dtc providers, there has been a shift away from traditional dental practices that may impact our primary selling channels. doctors and dsos are sampling alternative products and taking advantage of competitive promotions and sale opportunities. in addition, we face competition from companies that introduce new technologies and we may be unable to compete with these competitors or they may render our technology obsolete or economically unattractive. if we are unable to compete effectively with existing products or respond effectively to any new technologies, our business could be harmed.
to stimulate product and services demand, we have a history of offering volume discounts, price reductions and other promotions to targeted customers and consumers. whether or not successful, these promotional campaigns have had and may in the future again have unexpected and unintended consequences, including reduced gross margins, profitability and average selling prices, net revenues, volume growth, and net income.
we cannot assure that we will be able to compete successfully against our current or future competitors or that competitive pressures will not have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.
an increasingly larger portion of our total revenues are derived from international sales and we are dependent on our international operations, which exposes us to foreign operational, political, military and other risks that may harm our business.
we earn an increasingly larger portion of our total revenues from international sales generated through our foreign direct and indirect operations and we expect to increase our sales and presence outside the u.s., particularly in markets we believe have high-growth potential. moreover, we perform many of our key production steps in locations outside of the u.s. for instance, our digital treatment planning and aligner fabrication are performed in multiple international locations, including large-scale operations in mexico, costa rica and china and we continue to establish additional sites closer to our international customers, such as our manufacturing facility in poland currently under construction. also, we maintain significant regional sales and marketing operations in switzerland, singapore and china along with research and development operations globally, including in the u.s., russia, israel and germany. our reliance on international operations exposes us to risks and uncertainties that may affect our business or results of operations, including:
•difficulties managing international operations, including any travel restrictions on us or our customers;
•fluctuations in currency exchange rates;
•import and export risks, including shipping delays, cost increases, penalties, controls, license requirements and restrictions;
•controlling production volume and quality of the manufacturing process;
•the engagement in activities by our employees, contractors, partners and agents prohibited by our policies and procedures as well as international and local trade, labor and other laws such as those prohibiting bribery and corrupt payments to government officials, including the u.s. foreign corrupt practices act, the u.k. bribery act of 2010 and export control laws;
•delays, disruptions and increasing costs to us and our suppliers for raw materials or components, manufacturing, and transportation, including as a result of customs clearance, port congestion, workforce unrest or labor shortages, slowdowns or stoppages, unionization efforts, or disasters, whether natural forces or human caused;
•increased expense of developing, testing, manufacturing and marketing localized versions of our products;
•threats, tensions, actions and responses to any social, economic, business, geopolitical, military, terrorism, or acts of war, including the possibility, threat of, imposition of, or changes in sanctions, trade restrictions and tariffs, as well as retaliatory military actions, sanctions, trade restrictions and tariffs particularly involving key customers, development or manufacturing markets such as china, mexico, russia, the middle east, eastern europe or other countries;
•some of our employees in israel are obligated to perform annual reserve duty in the israeli military and may be called for additional active duty under emergency circumstances which may materially impair all or a portion of our business critical to our itero operations. additionally, we have significant research and development activities in russia that may be impaired should any threatened or actual military actions occur in the ukraine or other countries. if any of these events or conditions occur, the impact to us, our employees and customers is uncertain, particularly if emergency circumstances, armed conflicts or an escalation in political instability or violence disrupts our product development, data or information exchange, payroll or banking operations, product or materials shipping by us or our suppliers and other unanticipated business disruptions, interruptions and limitations in telecommunication services or critical systems or applications reliant on a stable and uninterrupted communications infrastructure. moreover, we have developed a multi-dimensional business continuity plan designed to mitigate the impact of potential actions and reactions to a military incursion in ukraine and other areas, but it is unclear if it will successfully and adequately mitigate against any actions taken or sanctions imposed;
•burdens of complying with a wide variety of regional and local laws, including anti-trust, fair competition and environmental laws;
•the impact of initiatives to encourage the purchase or support of domestic vendors, which can influence customers to purchase products from, or collaborate to promote interoperability of products with, companies whose headquarters or primary operations are not domestic;
•reduced ip rights protections as compared to the protections afforded under the laws of the u.s.;
•longer customer payment cycles and greater difficulty in accounts receivable collection; and
•potential adverse tax consequences.
the potential impacts of the united kingdom's ("uk") withdrawal from the eu are still unfolding and have impacted varying parts of its economy at different times since the withdrawal. as the uk negotiates new trade deals and implements new laws and regulations following its withdrawal, the uk's actions could, among other potential outcomes, adversely affect the tax, tax treaty, currency, operational, legal and regulatory regimes to which our businesses are subject, including those involving data privacy and the regulation of medical devices. the withdrawal could also, among other potential outcomes, disrupt the free and timely movement of goods, services, people, data and information and significantly disrupt trade. further, uncertainty around these and related issues could lead to adverse effects on the economies and political stability of the uk, eu and the other economies in which we operate.
should any of these factors, either individually or in combination, occur they could materially impact our international operations and adversely affect our business as a whole.
demand for our products may not increase as rapidly as we anticipate or may decrease due to a variety of factors, including changing consumer demand, inflation, weakness in general economic conditions, recessions and resistance to non-traditional treatment methods.
consumer spending habits are affected by, among other things, pandemics, inflation, weakness in general economic conditions, recessions, levels of employment, salaries and wage rates, debt obligations, discretionary income, consumer confidence and consumer perception of current and future economic conditions. declines in, or uncertain economic outlooks for, the u.s. or certain international economies could adversely affect consumer spending habits which may, among other things, result in a decrease in the number of overall orthodontic and dental case starts, reduce patient traffic in dentists' offices, reduce or shift spending away from elective, non-urgent, or higher value procedures or reduce demand for dental services generally, any of which could materially adversely affect our revenues and operating results. conversely, to the extent social distancing, travel, work and other restrictions have limited options for consumer spending, demand for our products may decline once any or all of these restrictions ease. inflation, weakness in the global or regional economies and recessions can decrease demand for dental technologies, causing dentists to postpone investments in capital equipment, such as intraoral scanners and cad/cam software. in addition, invisalign treatment represents a significant change from traditional metal wires and brackets orthodontic treatment, and customers and consumers may not find it cost-effective or preferable to traditional treatment. for instance, a number of dental professionals continue to believe the invisalign treatment is appropriate for only a limited percentage of patients. increased market acceptance of our products depends in part upon the recommendations of dental professionals, as well as other factors including effectiveness, safety, ease of use, reliability, aesthetics, and price compared to competing products and treatment methods.
our success depends on our ability to develop, successfully introduce, achieve market acceptance of, and manage new products and services.
our success depends on our ability to profitably and quickly develop, manufacture, market and obtain regulatory approval or clearance of new products and services along with improvements to existing products and services. there is no assurance we can successfully develop, sell and achieve market acceptance of our new products and services. the extent of, and rate at which, new products or offerings may achieve market acceptance and penetration is a function of many variables, including our ability to:
•successfully predict and timely innovate and develop new technologies and applications with the features and functionality customers desire or expect;
•successfully and timely obtain approval or clearance of new products or services from government agencies such as the fda and analogous agencies in other countries;
•cost effectively manufacture, bring to market, market, and sell new products and services offerings;
•properly forecast the amount and timing of new product demand;
•allocate our research and development funding to products with higher growth prospects;
•ensure compatibility of our technology, services and systems with those of our customers;
•anticipate and rapidly innovate in response to new competitive products, product offerings and technologies;
•differentiate our products and product offerings from our competitors as well as other products in our own portfolio and successfully articulate the benefits to our customers;
•qualify for third-party reimbursement for procedures involving our products; and
•encourage customers to adopt new technologies and provide the needed technical, sales and marketing support to make new product and services launches successful.
if we fail to accurately predict customer needs and preferences or fail to produce viable technologies, we may invest heavily in research and development of products that do not lead to significant revenues. even if we successfully innovate and develop new products and product enhancements, we may incur substantial costs doing so and our profitability may suffer. it may be difficult to gain market share and acceptance for new or enhance products. introduction and acceptance of new products may take significant time and effort if the products or services require doctor education and training to understand the benefits of the new products or they measure the success of a product only after using it to treat patients. for instance, it can take up to 24 months or longer to treat patients using our invisalign system. consequently, doctors may be unwilling to adopt our products until they successfully complete one or more cases or until more historical clinical results are available.
in addition, as part of our effort to accommodate our customers' needs and demands, we periodically introduce new business and sales initiatives, such as our commercial teeth whitening products announced in 2021. in general, our internal resources support these new businesses or sales initiatives, and we frequently provide such support without clear indications it will prove successful or be without short-term execution challenges.
as we continue to grow, we are subject to growth related risks, including risks related to excess or constrained capacity and operational inefficiencies at our manufacturing and treat facilities.
we are subject to growth related risks, including excess or constrained capacity and pressure on our internal systems, personnel and suppliers. in order to manage current operations and future growth effectively, we must continue implementing and improving our operational, financial and management information systems, hire, train, motivate, manage and retain employees, and ensure our suppliers remain diverse and capable of meeting growing demand for the systems, raw materials, parts and components essential to the manufacture and delivery of our products. we may be unable to manage such growth effectively while balancing near-term efforts to meet existing demand, including adding personnel, creating scalable, secure and robust systems and operations, and automating processes needed for long term efficiencies. any such failure could have a material adverse impact on our business, operations and prospects.
we continue to establish treatment planning and manufacturing facilities closer to our international customers in order to provide them with better experiences, improve their confidence in using the invisalign system and itero intraoral scanners to treat more patients, and provide redundancy should other facilities be temporarily or permanently unavailable. our ability to obtain regulatory clearance and certifications for, move into, plan, construct and equip additional facilities is subject to significant risk and uncertainty, including risks related to establishing facilities, hiring and retaining employees and delays and cost overruns, any of which may be all or partially out of our control and can negatively impact our gross margin. in addition, operating facilities located in higher cost regions compared to mexico, china and costa rica negatively impacts our gross margin. if the construction or transition into additional facilities is significantly delayed, if a facility is required to temporarily or permanently, partially or fully shut down, or demand for our products outpaces our ability to hire qualified personnel and effectively implement systems and infrastructure, we may be unable to fulfill orders timely, or at all, which may negatively impact our financial results, reputation and overall business.
in addition, because adapting production capacity and related cost structures to changing market conditions takes time, our facilities' capacity may at times exceed or fall short of our production requirements. for instance, as a result of the covid-19 pandemic, sales in the final weeks of the first quarter of 2020 declined substantially and operations at our manufacturing facilities declined shortly thereafter. then, as dental practices reopened we experienced a rapid increase in demand. these fluctuations in demand and sales have recurred several times since the first quarter of 2020 corresponding with increases in the number of people infected with covid-19 and variants such as delta and omicron, and may continue to arise in the future. if product demand decreases or increases more than forecast, we could be required to write off inventory or record excess capacity charges, we may be required to purchase or lease additional or larger facilities and additional equipment, or we may be unable to fulfill customer demand in the time frames and with the quantities required, any of which may take time to accomplish, lower our gross margin, inhibit sales or harm our reputation. additionally, if we are required to implement new or modify existing health and safety protocols to safeguard our employees, customers or their patients, productivity could decline. production of our clear aligners and intraoral scanners are also limited by capacity constraints due to a variety of factors, including labor shortages, shipping delays, our dependency on third-party vendors for key materials, parts, components and equipment, and limited production yields. any or all of these problems could result in the loss of customers, provide an opportunity for competing products to gain market acceptance and otherwise harm our business and financial results.
our products and information technology systems are critical to our business. issues with product development or enhancements, it system integration, implementation, updates and upgrades along with security and data protection risks have previously and could again in the future disrupt our operations, which could have a material adverse impact on our business and operating results.
we rely on the efficient, uninterrupted and secure operation of our own complex information technology systems ("it systems") and are dependent on key software of third parties embedded in our products and it systems as well as third-party hosted it systems to support our operations. all software and it systems are vulnerable to damage, attack or interruption from a variety of sources. as our business has grown in size and complexity, including through the integration of acquired businesses, which to date have been smaller organizations with less-mature or less sophisticated systems, securities practices or training, the growth has placed, and will continue to place, significant demands on our operations and such systems and have increased the risk of security incidents. to effectively manage our existing operations and continue to grow, our it systems and applications require an ongoing commitment of significant resources to maintain, protect, enhance and restore existing systems and develop new systems to keep pace with continuing changes in information processing technology, evolving industry and regulatory standards, increasingly sophisticated cyber threats, and changing customer preferences. expanded remote working and increased usage of online and hosted technology platforms by us, our customers and suppliers have increased the demands on and risks to our it systems and personnel. moreover, we continue to transform certain business processes, extend established processes to new subsidiaries and/or implement additional functionality in our enterprise resource planning ("erp"), product development, manufacturing, and other software and it systems which entails certain risks, including disruption of our operations, such as our ability to develop and update products that are safe and secure, track orders and timely ship products, manage our supply chain and aggregate financial and operational data.
system upgrades, development of new releases and enhancements require significant expenditures and allocation of valuable employee resources. delays in integration or disruptions to our business from implementation of these new or upgraded systems could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and operating results.
additionally, we continuously upgrade and issue new releases of our products and customer facing software applications, such as our itero intraoral scanners, exocad cad/cam solutions, my itero, our clincheck software, myaligntech and the invisalign doctor site as well as our internal software applications upon which customer facing, manufacturing and treatment planning operations are dependent. software applications and products containing software frequently contain errors or defects, especially when first introduced or when new versions are released. additionally, the third-party software integrated into or interoperable with our products and services will routinely reach end of life, and as a consequence, certain models of our intraoral scanners may be exposed to additional vulnerabilities, including increased security risks, errors and malfunctions that may be irreparable or difficult to repair. the discovery of a defect, error or security vulnerability in our products, software applications or it systems, incompatibility with customers' computer operating systems and hardware configurations with a new release or upgraded version or the failure of our products or primary it systems may cause adverse consequences, including: delay or loss of revenues, significant remediation costs, delay in market acceptance, loss of data, disclosure of financial, health or other personal information of our customers or their patients, product recalls, damage to our reputation, loss of market share or increased service costs, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.
a significant portion of our clear aligner production is dependent on digital scans from our itero and third-party intraoral scanners. failures of all or any portion of ours or third-party software or other components or systems to interoperate with itero or third-party scanners, termination of interoperability with third-party scanners, malware or ransomware attacks, product or system vulnerabilities or defects, or a system outage for any reason have harmed our operations previously and in the future could affect materially and adversely our ability to accept scans, manufacture clear aligners or restorative procedures or treatments and services or otherwise service our customers which may, amongst other things, harm our sales, damage our reputation, adversely impact our strategic partners or result in litigation.
additionally, our globally-dispersed installed base of itero intraoral scanners at customer, strategic business partner or other locations may be independently or collectively the target of a cybersecurity incident or attack or subject to the intrusion of a virus, bug, or other similar negative intruder. due to the large and growing number of these decentralized locations, we may not be able to, or not have the capacity, knowledge, or infrastructure to, respond to or remedy a cybersecurity issue in a timely manner or sufficiently, either of which may cause loss or damage to us or our customers or strategic business partners or may cause further malfunctions in, or damage to, our servers, databases, systems or products and services, loss or damage of our data, interruption or temporary cessation of our operations, or an overall negative impact to our business or reputation.
if the information we rely on to run our businesses is inaccurate or unreliable, or if the data governance controls in place fail or change, or if compliance with such controls fails, or if we fail to properly maintain, secure or restore our it systems, or if the integrity of our products or it systems is compromised or questioned or data is lost, or if we fail to develop new capabilities to meet our business needs in a timely manner, we could suffer operational disruptions, have customer disputes, and fail to produce timely, accurate or complete reports. we may also be required to respond to regulatory inquiries or actions, forced to defend against litigation or pay damages, penalties or fines, experience increases in operating and administrative expenses, find it necessary to recall or repair products, rebuild networks or systems, lose existing customers or strategic business partners, experience difficulties attracting new customers or implementing our growth strategies, or suffer other adverse consequences. in addition, experienced computer programmers and hackers may be able to penetrate the security features of our products, it systems or our cloud-based software servers hosted by third parties and misappropriate, destroy or damage our confidential information or that of third parties, expose health, financial data, or other personal information of our customers and their patients, create system disruptions or cause shutdowns. furthermore, sophisticated hardware and operating system software and applications that we either internally develop or procure from third parties may contain defects or present risks in design, development, manufacture or distribution, including "bugs," security vulnerabilities, and other problems that can unexpectedly interfere with the operation of the system or compromise or exploit the safety and security of our products, networks or data. the costs to eliminate, mitigate or recover from security problems, viruses and bugs could be significant and depending on the nature and extent of the problem and the networks or products impacted, may result in network or systems interruptions, decreased product sales, or data loss that may have a material adverse impact on our operations, net revenues and operating results.
there can be no assurance that our process of improving existing or developing new products or it systems, integrating new it systems, protecting confidential patient health information, and improving service levels will not be delayed or that additional product or it systems issues will not arise in the future. failure to adequately protect and maintain the integrity of our products and it systems and data may result in a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.
if we are unable or fail to protect our customer or patient information or if we are unable to comply with applicable privacy, security and data protection laws, our operations may be severely adversely impacted, patient care could suffer, we could be liable for related damages, and our business, operations and reputation could be harmed.
we retain confidential customer financial as well as patient health information in addition to our own proprietary information and data essential to our business operations. therefore, it is critical that the facilities and infrastructure on which we depend to run our business and the products we develop remain secure and are also perceived by the marketplace and our customers to be secure. despite the implementation of security features in our products and security measures in our it systems, our products as well as the infrastructure and it systems on which we depend are vulnerable to physical break-ins, computer viruses, programming errors or other technical malfunctions, hacking or phishing attacks by third parties, malware and ransomware, employee error or malfeasance or similar disruptive problems. for example, we have experienced cybersecurity incidents and may again in the future. further, the frequency of third-party cyber attacks has increased since the onset of the covid-19 pandemic. significant service disruptions, breaches in our infrastructure and it systems or other cybersecurity incidents could expose us to litigation or regulatory investigations, impair our reputation and competitive position, be distracting to our management, and require significant time and resources to address. affected parties or regulatory agencies could initiate legal or regulatory action against us, which could prevent us from resolving the issues quickly or in unanticipated ways, cause us to incur significant expense and liability, or result in judicial or governmental orders forcing us to cease operations or modify our business practices in ways that could materially limit or restrict the products and services we provide. concerns over our privacy practices could adversely affect others' perception of us and deter customers, patients and partners from using our products. in addition, patient care could suffer, and we could be liable if our products or it systems fail to deliver accurate and complete information in a timely manner. we have cybersecurity and other forms of insurance coverage related to a breach event covering expenses for notification, credit monitoring, investigation, crisis management, public relations and legal advice. the policy also provides coverage for regulatory action defense including oversight, investigations and disclosure obligations as well as fines and penalties, potential payment card industry fines and penalties and costs related to cyber extortion; however, damages and claims arising from such incidents may not be covered or may exceed the amount of any coverage and do not cover the time and effort we incur investigating and responding to any incidents, which may be significant.
we are also subject to federal, state and foreign laws and regulations, including ones relating to privacy, data security and protection, content regulation, and consumer protection among others. we are subject to various national and regional data localization or data residency laws which generally require that certain types of data collected within a country be stored and processed only within that country or approved countries and other countries are considering enacting similar data localization or data residency laws. we have and likely will again in the future be required to implement new or expand existing data storage protocols, build new storage facilities, and/or devote additional resources to comply with such laws, any of which could be costly. we are also subject to data export restrictions and international transfer laws which prohibit or impose conditions upon the transfer of such data from one country to another. these laws and regulations are constantly evolving and may be interpreted, applied, created or amended in a manner that could adversely affect our business.
in addition, we must comply with numerous data privacy and data security requirements that span from individual state and national laws in the u.s. and china to multinational requirements in the eu. for instance, china has enacted complex and highly restrictive cybersecurity, data localization, and cross border data transfer laws. in the eu, we must comply with the general data protection regulation which serves as a harmonization of eu data-privacy laws, and in the u.s., we must comply with data privacy and data security provisions of the u.s. health insurance portability and accountability act regulations. moreover, the number of local and national governments enacting data privacy laws continues to increase and we expect this trend to continue. maintaining compliance with these laws and regulations is costly and could require complex changes in the way we do business or provide services to our customers and their patients. additionally, our success may be dependent on the success of healthcare providers, many of whom are comprised of individual or small operations with limited it experience and inadequate or untested security protocols, in managing data privacy and data security requirements.
if we fail to sustain or increase revenue growth while controlling expenses, our profitability may decline.
if we are to sustain or increase profitability in future periods, we need to continue increasing our net revenues while controlling expenses. because our business and the markets we target are evolving, it is difficult to predict our future operating results or levels of growth or declines. we have not in the past and may be unable in the future to sustain or regain our historical growth rates which may cause our profitability to decline.
our operating results have and will continue to fluctuate in the future, which makes predicting the timing and amount of our revenues, costs and expenditures difficult.
our quarterly and annual operating results have and will continue to fluctuate for a variety of reasons, including as a result of changing doctor and consumer product demand. some of the factors that have historically and in the future could cause our operating results to fluctuate include:
•limited visibility into, and difficulty predicting from quarter to quarter, the types of procedures and level of activities in our customers' practices;
•fluctuations in the number of patients seeking treatment and the number of doctors providing services and treatment as a result of the pandemic and new variants in the virus;
•changes in demand based on geographies, channels, or product mix;
•the level of confidence of doctors in our products and changes in the rates at which they recommend or utilize our products for their patients;
•weakness in consumer spending and confidence, inflation, a slowdown or recession in domestic or international economies;
•higher manufacturing, delivery and inventory costs;
•unanticipated delays and disruptions in the manufacturing process caused by insufficient capacity or availability of raw materials, parts or components, shortages or turnover in the labor force or the introduction of new production processes, power outages or insufficient power, natural or other disasters, pandemics or general economic conditions impacting the solvency of vendors in our supply chain;
•competition in general and competitive developments in our target markets;
•new programs or business models, new product or services introductions or changes or modifications to existing products and services offerings, including any impacts related to the timing of orders, product mix or market cannibalization;
•changes in relationships with dsos and distributors, including the timing of orders;
•changes in the timing of revenue recognition and changes in our average selling prices, including as a result of the timing of receipt of product orders and shipments, product and services mix, geographic mix, product and services deferrals, the introduction of new products and software releases, product pricing, bundling and promotions, pricing for fees or expenses, modifications to our terms and conditions such as payment terms, or as a result of new accounting pronouncements or changes to critical accounting estimates including, without limitation, those estimates based on such matters as our predicted usage of additional aligners;
•the creditworthiness, liquidity and solvency of our customers and their ability to timely make payments when due;
•fluctuations in currency exchange rates against the u.s. dollar;
•our inability to scale, suspend or reduce production and treatment operations based on variations in product demand;
•seasonal fluctuations, including those related to patient demographics such as the seasonality of teen treatments in the u.s., china and europe as well as the number of doctors in their offices and their availability to take appointments;
•costs and expenditures in connection with such things as the establishment of new treatment planning and fabrication facilities, the hiring and deployment of personnel, and litigation, and the success of or changes to our marketing programs from quarter to quarter;
•timing and fluctuation of spending around marketing and brand awareness campaigns and industry trade shows;
•our reliance on our contract manufacturers for the production of sub-assemblies for our intraoral scanners;
•increased advertising or marketing efforts or aggressive price competition from competitors;
•changes to our effective tax rate;
•major changes in available technology or the preferences of customers may cause our current product offerings to become less competitive or obsolete;
•unanticipated delays or disruptions in our receipt of patient records made through intraoral scanners for any reason;
•disruptions to our business due to political, economic or other social instability or any governmental regulatory or similar actions, including the impact of epidemics and pandemics such as covid-19, any of which results in changes in consumer spending habits, limiting or restricting patient visits to orthodontists or general practitioners, as well as any impact on workforce absenteeism;
•inaccurate forecasting of net revenues, production and other operating costs;
•investments in research and development to develop new products and enhancements; and
•material impairments of goodwill and long-lived assets.
to respond to these and other factors, we may make business decisions that adversely affect our operating results such as modifications to our pricing policy and payment terms, promotions, development efforts, product releases, business structure or operations. most of our expenses, such as employee compensation and lease obligations, are relatively fixed in the short term. moreover, our expense levels are based, in part, on our expectations for future revenues. as a result, if our net revenues for a particular period fall below expectations, we may be unable to timely or effectively reduce spending to offset any shortfall in net revenues. due to these and other factors, we do not believe that quarter-to-quarter comparisons of our operating results are meaningful.
a disruption in the operations of a primary freight carrier, higher shipping costs or shipping delays could disrupt our supply chain and cause a decline in our net revenues or a reduction in our earnings.
we are dependent on commercial freight carriers, primarily ups, to deliver our products. if the operations of these carriers are disrupted for any reason, we may be unable to timely deliver our products to our customers who may choose alternative products causing our net revenues and gross margin to decline, possibly materially. when fuel costs increase, our freight costs generally do so as well. in addition, we earn an increasingly larger portion of our total revenues from international sales. international sales carry higher shipping costs which could negatively impact our gross margin and results of operations. if freight costs materially increase and we are unable to successfully pass all or significant portions of the increase along to our customers, or we cannot otherwise offset such increases in our cost of net revenues, our gross margin and financial results could be adversely affected.
if we fail to accurately predict our volume growth, hire too many or too few technicians, or manufacture too many or too few products, the delivery time for our products could be delayed or our costs may exceed our revenues, each of which could adversely affect our results of operations.
if we fail to accurately predict our volume growth, we may inaccurately estimate the staffing, materials or storage required to manufacture our products. if we underestimate volume growth, our growth may exceed our manufacturing capacity of one or more of our suppliers or manufacturing facilities, we may be understaffed and we may not have sufficient materials.
specifically, our manufacturing process relies on sophisticated computer software and requires new technicians to undergo a relatively long training process, often 120 days or longer. as a result, if we are unable to accurately predict our volume growth, we may have an insufficient number of trained technicians to ensure products are manufactured and delivered within the time frames our customers expect. without sufficient capacity, trained personnel or materials, we may be unable to provide our products to customers in a timely manner, which could damage our relationships with our existing customers or harm our ability to attract new customers. this could cause a decline in our net revenues and net income and could adversely affect our results of operations.
conversely, if we over estimate our growth, we may have excess expenses caused by excess staffing, materials, and capacity. if we hire and train too many technicians in anticipation of volume growth that does not materialize, materializes at a rate slower than anticipated, or if volumes decline, our costs and expenditures may outpace our revenues or revenue growth, harming our gross margin and financial results. additionally, in order to secure supplies for production of products, we sometimes enter into non-cancelable minimum purchase commitments with vendors, which could impact our ability to adjust our inventory to reflect declining market demands. if demand for our products is less than we expect, we may experience additional excess and obsolete inventories and be forced to incur additional charges and our profitability may suffer.
we are dependent on our marketing activities to deepen our market penetration and raise awareness of our brand and products, which may not prove successful or may become less effective or more costly to maintain in the long term.
our marketing efforts and costs are significant and include national and regional campaigns in multiple countries involving television, print media, social media and, more recently, alliances with professional sports teams, social media influencers and other strategic partners. we attempt to structure our advertising campaigns to increase brand awareness, adoption and goodwill; however, there is no assurance our campaigns will achieve the returns on advertising spend desired, increase brand or product awareness sufficiently to sustain or increase our growth goals or generate goodwill and positive reputational goals. moreover, should any entity or individual endorsing us or our products take actions, make or publish statements in support of, or lend support to events or causes which may be perceived by all or any portion of society negatively, our sponsorships or support of these entities or individuals may be called into question, boycotts of our products announced, and our reputation may be harmed, any of which could have an adverse effect on our gross margin and business overall.
in addition, various countries prohibit certain types of marketing activities. for example, some countries restrict direct to consumer advertising of medical devices. we could run afoul of restrictions and be ordered to stop certain marketing activities. moreover, competitors do not always follow these restrictions, creating an unfair advantage and making it more difficult and costly for us to compete.
additionally, we rely heavily on data generated from our campaigns to target specific audiences and evaluate their effectiveness, particularly data generated from internet activities on mobile devices. to obtain this data, we are dependent on third parties and popular mobile operating systems, networks, technologies, products, and standards that we do not control, such as the android and ios operating systems and mobile browsers. any changes in such systems that degrade, reduce or eliminate our ability to target or measure the results of ads or increase costs to target audiences could adversely affect the effectiveness of our campaigns. for example, apple has released mobile operating systems that include significant data privacy changes that may limit our ability to interpret, target and measure ads effectively.
our success depends in part on our proprietary technology, and if we fail to successfully obtain or enforce our intellectual property ("ip") rights, our competitive position may be harmed. litigating claims of this type is costly and could distract our management and cause a decline in our results of operations and stock price.
our success depends in part on our ability to maintain existing ip rights and to obtain and maintain further ip protection for our products. our inability to do so could harm our competitive position.
we rely on our portfolio of issued and pending patent applications in the u.s. and other countries to protect a large part of our ip and our competitive position; however, these patents may be insufficient to protect our ip rights because our patents may be challenged, invalidated, held unenforceable, circumvented, or may not be sufficiently broad to prevent third parties from producing competing products similar in design to our products and foreign patents protections may be more limited than those provided under u.s. patents and ip laws.
we may not be afforded the protection of a patent if our currently pending or future patent filings do not result in the issuance of patents or we fail to apply for patent protection. we may fail to apply for a patent if our personnel fail to disclose or recognize new patentable ideas or innovations. remote working can decrease the opportunities for our personnel to collaborate, thereby reducing the opportunities for effective invention disclosures and patent application filings. we may choose not to file a foreign patent application if the limited protections provided by a foreign patent outweigh the costs to obtain it. our foreign patent portfolio is less extensive than our u.s. portfolio.
we also rely on protection of our copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, know-how and proprietary information. we generally enter into confidentiality agreements with our employees, consultants and collaborative partners upon commencement of a relationship with us; however, these agreements may not provide meaningful protection against the unauthorized use or disclosure of our trade secrets or other confidential information, and adequate remedies may not exist when unauthorized uses or disclosures occur.
our inability to maintain the proprietary nature of our technology through patents, copyrights or trade secrets would impair our competitive advantages and could have a material adverse effect on our operating results, financial condition and future growth prospects. in particular, a failure to protect our ip rights might allow competitors to copy our technology or create counterfeit or pirated versions of our products, which could adversely affect our reputation, pricing and market share.
litigation, interferences, oppositions, re-exams, inter partes reviews, post grant reviews or other proceedings have been necessary and will likely be needed in the future to determine the validity and scope of certain of our ip rights and the ip rights claimed by third parties to determine the validity, scope or non-infringement of certain patent rights pertinent to the manufacture, use or sale of our products and the products of competitors. asserting or defending these types of proceedings can be unpredictable, protracted, time consuming, expensive and distracting to management and technical personnel. the outcome of such proceedings could adversely affect the validity and scope of our patent or other ip rights, hinder our ability to manufacture and market our products, require us to seek a license for infringing products or technologies or result in the assessment of significant monetary damages. an unfavorable ruling could include monetary damages, an injunction prohibiting us from selling our products, or an exclusion order preventing us from importing our products in one or more countries. moreover, independent actions by competitors, customers or others have been brought alleging that our efforts to assert or attempt to enforce our patent or other ip rights constitute unfair competition or violations of antitrust laws in the u.s. and other jurisdictions and investigations and additional litigation based on the same or similar claims may be brought in the future. the potential effects on our business operations resulting from litigation, whether or not ultimately determined in our favor or settled by us, are costly and could adversely affect our results of operations and stock price.
if we or any vendors on whose products or services we rely for our products and services infringe the patents or ip rights of other parties or are subject to a patent infringement claim, our ability to grow our business may be severely limited.
extensive litigation over patents and other ip rights is common in the medical device, optical scanner, 3d printing and other technologies and industries on which our products and services are based. we have been sued for infringement of third parties' patents in the past and we are currently defending patent infringement lawsuits and other legal claims. in addition, we periodically receive letters from third parties drawing our attention to their patent rights. while we do not believe we infringe upon any valid and enforceable rights that have been brought to our attention, there may be other more pertinent rights of which we are presently unaware. the defense and prosecution of ip lawsuits, interference proceedings and related legal and administrative proceedings could result in substantial expense to us and significant diversion of effort by our technical and management personnel. an adverse determination in any legal proceeding to which we may become a party could subject us to significant liabilities, exclusion orders or injunctions that may prevent or limit our rights to sell or import our products in one or more countries. an adverse determination of this nature could require us to seek licenses from third parties. licenses may not be available on commercially reasonable terms or at all, in which event, our business would be materially adversely affected.
obtaining approvals and complying with governmental regulations, particularly those related to personal healthcare information, financial information, quality systems and data privacy, is expensive and time-consuming, and any failure to obtain or maintain approvals or comply with regulations regarding our products or services or the products and services of our suppliers or customers could materially harm our sales, result in substantial penalties and cause harm to our reputation.
as a supplier of medical devices and solutions, we and many of our healthcare provider customers, suppliers and distributors are subject to extensive and frequently changing regulations under numerous federal, state, local and foreign laws, including those regulating:
•the storage, transmission and disclosure of medical information and healthcare records;
•prohibitions against the offer, payment or receipt of remuneration to induce referrals to entities providing healthcare services or goods or to induce the order, purchase or recommendation of our products; and
•the marketing and advertising of our products.
the healthcare market itself is also highly regulated and subject to changing political, economic and regulatory influences. for instance, regulations affecting the security and privacy of patient healthcare information applicable to healthcare providers and their business associates, such as hipaa, may require us to make significant and unplanned enhancements of software applications or services, result in delays or cancellations of orders, or result in the revocation of endorsement of our products and services by healthcare participants. our critical vendors and service providers are similarly subject to various regulations. our failure or the failure of our suppliers, customers, advertisers and influencers to strictly adhere to clearances or approvals in the labeling, marketing and sales of our products and services could subject us to claims or litigation, including actions alleging false or misleading advertising, unfair or anti-competitive business practices or other violations of laws or regulations, which may result in costly investigations, fines, penalties, as well as material judgments, settlements or decrees. there can be no assurance that we will adequately address the business risks associated with the implementation and compliance with such laws or that we will be able to take advantage of any resulting business opportunities.
furthermore, in general before we can sell a new medical device or market a new use of or claim for an existing product, we must obtain clearance or approval to gain market access unless an exemption applies. for instance, in the u.s., fda regulations are wide ranging and govern, among other things:
•product design, development, manufacturing and testing;
•product labeling;
•product storage;
•pre-market clearance or approval;
•complaint handling and corrective actions;
•advertising and promotion; and
•product sales and distribution.
it takes significant time, effort and expense to obtain and maintain fda clearances or approvals of products and services and there is no guarantee we will successfully or timely obtain or maintain approvals in all or any of the countries in which we do business now or in the future. in other countries, the requirements to obtain and maintain similar approvals may differ materially from those of the fda and may require additional time and expense. moreover, these laws may change resulting in additional time and expense or loss of approvals. additionally, the impact of the covid-19 pandemic on normal governmental operations may delay our efforts to obtain and maintain approvals, possibly significantly. if approvals to market our products or services are delayed, whether in the u.s. or other countries, we may be unable to offer them in markets we deem important to our business. failure or delays to obtain or maintain regulatory approvals may materially harm our domestic or international operations, and our business as a whole adversely impacted.
any failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements could result in enforcement actions in the u.s. and other countries. for example, enforcement actions by the fda may include one or more of the following sanctions:
•warning letters, fines, injunctions, consent decrees and civil penalties;
•repair, replacement, refunds, recall or seizure of our products;
•operating restrictions or partial suspension or total shutdown of production;
•refusing our requests for 510(k) clearance or pre-market approval of new products, new intended uses, or modifications to existing products;
•withdrawing clearance or pre-market approvals previously granted; and
•criminal prosecution.
we and certain of our vendors must also comply with facility registration and product listing requirements of the fda and adhere to applicable quality system regulations. the fda enforces its quality system regulations through periodic unannounced inspections. our failure to satisfactorily correct an adverse inspection finding or to comply with applicable manufacturing regulations could result in enforcement actions, and we may be required to find alternative manufacturers, which could be a long and costly process. any enforcement action by the fda or foreign governments could have a material adverse effect on us.
in addition, while we provide significant training to our personnel, they may not properly adhere to our policies or applicable laws or regulations. if our employees fail to comply with any or all laws or regulations or our policies or procedures, it could result in violations of laws or regulations and subject us to harm to our reputation, loss of customers, loss or revenues, or regulatory investigations and actions.
consequently, if we cannot successfully obtain approval for our products or services or timely and cost-effectively maintain compliance with laws regulating our products and services, our results of operations and financial condition could be harmed.
we are highly dependent on third-party suppliers, some of whom are sole source suppliers, for certain key machines, components and materials, and our business and operating results could be harmed if supply is restricted or ends or the price of raw materials used in our manufacturing process increases.
we are highly dependent on our supply chain, particularly manufacturers of specialized scanning equipment, rapid prototyping machines, resin and other advanced materials, as well as the optics, electronic and other mechanical components of our intraoral scanners.
we maintain single supply relationships for many of these machines and materials. in particular, our ct scanning and stereolithography equipment used in our aligner manufacturing and many of the critical components for the optics of our scanners are provided by single suppliers. we rely on a single third-party manufacturer to supply key sub-assemblies for our itero element scanner. we purchase the vast majority of our resin and polymer, the primary raw materials used in our manufacturing process for clear aligners, from a single source. by using single suppliers for materials and manufacturing in a limited number of locations, we risk multiple supply chain vulnerabilities. for example, damage or destruction of a facility can materially disrupt our ability to timely deliver key components and materials or products or a supplier could encounter financial, operating or other difficulties, be unable to hire or maintain personnel, fail to timely obtain supplies, fail to maintain manufacturing standards or controls, or fail to timely deliver materials, parts or components. any one of these occurrences would impact our supply chain.
restrictions in response to the pandemic and other macroeconomic factors have affected and are expected to continue to affect our supply chain. the manufacture of product components, the final assembly of our products and other critical operations are concentrated in certain geographic locations, including china. a significant portion of our finished goods product distribution occurs through china and emea. each of these areas has been affected by the pandemic and has implemented measures to try to contain its spread, including restrictions on manufacturing facilities, commerce, travel, our support operations and workforce, and our customers, strategic partners, vendors and suppliers. there is considerable uncertainty regarding the current and future impact of such measures, including reduced availability or increased cost of air transport, port closures and increased border controls and closures. any or all restrictions can limit our manufacturers' capacity to produce our parts or products and have a material adverse effect on our supply chain.
the effects of climate change on regional and global economies could change the supply, demand or availability of sources of energy or other resources material to our products and operations and affect the availability or cost of natural resources and goods and services on which we and our suppliers rely.
because of our dependence on our suppliers, changes in one or more of our relationships with them or changes in their circumstances can result in disruptions to the supply chain, which can materially impact our business. for instance, we may be unable to quickly establish or qualify replacement suppliers creating production interruptions, delays and inefficiencies. finding substitute manufacturers may be expensive, time-consuming or impossible and could result in a significant interruption in the supply of one or more products causing us to lose revenues and suffer damage to our customer relationships. technology changes by our vendors could disrupt access to required manufacturing capacity or require expensive, time consuming development efforts to adapt and integrate new equipment or processes. in the event of technology changes, delivery delays, labor stoppages or shortages, or shortages of, or increases in price for these items, sales may decrease and our business and growth prospects may be harmed.
we rely on highly skilled personnel and, if we fail to attract, motivate, train or retain highly skilled personnel, it may be more difficult to grow effectively and pursue our strategic priorities.
we are highly dependent on the talent and effort of highly skilled employees, including orthodontists and production technicians in our treatment planning facilities, and employees on our clinical engineering, technology development and sales teams. to be successful, we must effectively manage our growth through our ability to identify, hire, develop, motivate, train and retain these skilled employees as well as personnel throughout our organization.
we provide significant training to our personnel and our business will be impacted if our training fails to properly prepare our personnel to perform the work required, we are unable to successfully instill technical expertise in new and existing personnel or if our techniques prove unsuccessful or not cost-effective.
moreover, for certain roles, this training and experience can make key personnel, such as our sales personnel, highly desirable by competitors and lead to increased attrition. the loss of the services and knowledge from our highly skilled employees may significantly delay or prevent the achievement of our development and business objectives and could harm our business. for example, it can take up to twelve months or more to train sales representatives to successfully market and sell our products and for them to establish strong customer relationships.
for more discussion related to our personnel and corporate culture see the risk factor, "we rely on our personnel and, if we fail to attract, motivate or retain personnel, or if our growth harms our corporate culture, it may be more difficult to grow effectively and pursue our strategic priorities."
if we are unable to expand our workforce, including key sales and other skilled personnel, retain key personnel or quickly replace personnel with individuals of equivalent technical expertise and qualifications, our net revenues and our ability to maintain market share could be materially harmed.
we use distributors for a portion of the importation, marketing and sales efforts related to our products and services, which exposes us to risks that may be harmful to our sales and operations, including that these distributors do not comply with applicable laws or our internal procedures.
in addition to our direct sales force, we have and expect to continue to use distributors to import, market, sell, service and support our products. our agreements with these distributors are generally non-exclusive and terminable by either party with little notice. if any of these relationships are terminated and if alternative distributors must be quickly found and trained in the use, marketing, sales and support of our products and services, our revenues and ability to sell or service our products in markets key to our growth and expansion could be adversely affected. these distributors may also choose to sell alternative or competing products or services. in addition, we may be held responsible for the actions of these distributors and their employees and agents for compliance with laws and regulations, including fair competition, bribery and corruption, trade compliance, and marketing and sales activities. a distributor may also affect our ability to effectively market our products in certain foreign countries or regulatory jurisdictions if it holds the regulatory authorization in such countries or within such regions and causes, by action or inaction, the suspension of such marketing authorization or sanctions for non-compliance or prevents us from taking control of any such authorization. it may be difficult, expensive, and time-consuming for us to re-establish market access or regulatory compliance in such cases.
our business exposes us to potential liability for the quality and safety of our products and services, how we advertise and market those products and services and how and to whom we sell them, and we may incur substantial expenses or be found liable for substantial damages or penalties if we are subject to claims or litigation.
our products and services involve an inherent risk of claims concerning their design, manufacture, safety and performance, how they are marketed and advertised in a complex framework of highly regulated domestic and international laws and regulations, how we package, bundle or sell them to customers who may be private individuals or companies or public entities such as hospitals and clinics and how we train and support doctors, their staffs and patients who administer or use our products. moreover, consumer products and services are routinely subject to claims of false, deceptive or misleading advertising, consumer fraud and unfair business practices. additionally, we may be held liable if any product we develop or manufacture or services we offer or perform causes injury or is otherwise found unhealthy. if our products are safe but they are promoted for use or used in unintended or unexpected ways or for which we have not obtained clearance or approvals ("off-label" usage), we may be investigated, fined or have our products or services enjoined or approvals rescinded or we may be required to defend ourselves in litigation. although we maintain insurance for product liability, business practices and other types of activities we make or offer, coverage may not be available on acceptable terms, if at all, and may be insufficient for actual liabilities. any claim for product liability, sales, advertising and business practices, regardless of its merit or eventual outcome, could result in significant legal defense costs and damage our reputation, increase our expenses and divert management's attention.
compliance with current or future environmental, social, and governance ("esg") laws may materially increase our costs, expose us to potential liability and otherwise materially impact our business.
our operations are subject to a variety of existing local, regional and global esg laws and regulations, and we will likely be required to comply with new, broader, more complex and costly laws and regulations that focus on esg matters in the future. our compliance obligations will likely span all aspects of our business and operations, including product design and development, materials sourcing and other procurement activities, energy and natural resources usage, facilities design and utilization, recycling and collection, transportation, disposal activities and workers' rights.
the environmental regulations related to greenhouse gases may have an impact on our or our suppliers' energy sources. many u.s. and foreign regulators have enacted or are considering enacting new or additional limits on the emissions of greenhouse gases, including, but not limited to, carbon dioxide and methane, from power generation units using fossil fuels like coal and natural gas. the effects of greenhouse gas emission limits on power generation that have been enacted already or that may be enacted in the future are subject to significant uncertainties, including the timing of any new requirements and levels of emissions reductions. initiatives and legislation designed to reduce, restrict or eliminate greenhouse gas emissions from power generation may have the effect of increasing our costs and those of our suppliers and could result in manufacturing, transportation and supply chain disruptions and delays if clean energy alternatives are not readily available in adequate supply when required. moreover, alternative energy sources that supply the power to meet our current and future demands as well as those of our suppliers and the global and regional economies in general, coupled with reduced investments in traditional energy sources and infrastructure, may fail to provide the predictable, reliable, and consistent energy that we, our suppliers and other businesses need for operations.
regulations related to sourcing of certain metals may have an impact on our business. for instance, the sourcing and availability of metals that may be used in the manufacture of, or contained in, our products may be affected by laws and regulations in the u.s. or internationally regarding the use of minerals obtained from certain regions of the world like the democratic republic of congo and adjoining countries. although we do not believe that we or our suppliers source minerals from this region, these laws and regulations may decrease the number of suppliers capable of supplying our needs for certain metals, thereby negatively affecting our ability to manufacture products in sufficient quantities or at competitive prices, leading customers to potentially choose competitive goods and services.
meeting our obligations under existing laws, rules, or regulations is already costly to us and our suppliers, and we expect those costs to increase in the future, possibly materially. additionally, we expect regulators to perform investigations, inspections and periodically audit our compliance with these laws and regulations, and we cannot provide assurance that our efforts or operations will be compliant. if we fail to comply with any requirements, we could be subject to significant penalties or liabilities and we may be required to implement new and significantly more costly processes and procedures to come into compliance. further these laws are subject to unpredictable changes. even if we successfully comply with these laws and regulations, our suppliers may fail to comply. we may also suffer financial and reputational harm if customers require, and we are unable to deliver, certification that our products are conflict free. in all of these situations, customers may stop purchasing products from us, and may take legal action against us, which could harm our reputation, revenues and results of operations.
general risk factors we rely on our personnel and, if we fail to attract, motivate or retain personnel, or if our growth harms our corporate culture, it may be more difficult to grow effectively and pursue our strategic priorities.
we believe a key factor in our success has been the culture we have created that emphasizes a shared vision and values focusing on agility, customer success and accountability. we believe this culture fosters an environment of integrity, innovation, creativity, and teamwork. we have also experienced in the past and expect to experience in the future, difficulties attracting and retaining employees that meet the qualifications, experience, compliance mindset and values we expect. if we are unable to attract and retain personnel that meet our selection criteria or relax our standards in order to meet the demands of our growth or if our growth is not managed effectively, our corporate culture, ability to achieve our strategic objectives, and our compliance with obligations under our internal controls and other requirements may be harmed.
we are considering adjusting our remote working policies, which may cause our culture to change, cause us to incur additional costs, or cause us to lose talent or fail to attract talent. many of our employees have worked remotely during the covid-19 pandemic, which makes it difficult to maintain or enhance our culture, especially for new employees onboarded remotely. as we evaluate when and how to return employees to our offices globally, we continue to assess the impact various return-to-office plans may have on our culture, morale, and hiring and retention, particularly considering tight labor markets and generous or broad remote working policies being adopted by companies against whom we compete for talent. should we choose to require employees to return to the office, implement or modify a remote working policy, and/or allow or modify a hybrid approach in which employees can continue to work from home or other remote locations on a limited or part time basis only, it may materially increase our costs or create unforeseen challenges or complications, including:
•difficulties maintaining our corporate culture, disruption of morale or decreased loyalty;
•negative impacts to collaboration, performance and productivity;
•increased employee stress, fatigue or "burn out" by employees unable to disengage their work life from the home life;
•increased operational, governance, compliance, and tax risks;
•increased attrition or limits to our ability to attract employees who prefer for convenience or for safety reasons to continue working remotely full time, or in offices or geographies different from where they were hired to work or are expected to work;
•problems managing office space requirements;
•concerns regarding favoritism or discrimination;
•strains to our business continuity plans and difficulties achieving our strategic objectives; and
•increased labor and employment claims and litigation.
furthermore, our compensation and benefit arrangements, such as our equity award programs, may not always be successful in attracting new employees and retaining and motivating existing employees. in addition, other internal and external factors can impact our ability to hire and retain talent, including insufficient advancement or career opportunities, restrictive immigration policy and regulatory changes, an increase in employees choosing to retire or quit with no immediate intentions to continue working and significantly higher demand for technical and digital talent.
if we are unable to attract and retain personnel that meet our selection criteria or relax our standards in order to meet the demands of our growth or if our growth is not managed effectively, our corporate culture, ability to achieve our strategic objectives, and our compliance with obligations under our internal controls and other requirements may be harmed.
business disruptions could seriously harm our financial condition.
our global operations have been disrupted in the past and will likely be disrupted and harmed again in the future. the occurrence of any material or prolonged business disruptions could harm our growth and expansion, result in significant losses, seriously harm our revenues, profitability and financial condition, adversely affect our competitive position, increase our costs and expenses, and require substantial expenditures and recovery time in order to fully resume operations.
human error can have a significant effect on our business. while we train our employees and perform our due diligence when contracting with third parties, mistakes and accidents still occur. for instance, in march 2021, a container ship carrying some of our products was stuck in the suez canal for six days. although this did not have a material adverse effect on our business, there is no assurance that such incidents may not impact us in a material way in the future.
natural disasters can impact our business, including as a result of earthquakes, tsunamis, floods, droughts, hurricanes, wildfires, extreme weather conditions, power outages, restrictions and shortages, telecommunications failures, materials scarcity and price volatility, and medical epidemics or health pandemics. climate change is likely to increase both the frequency and severity of natural disasters and, consequently, risks to our operations and growth. our digital dental modeling and certain of our customer facing operations are primarily processed in our facilities located in costa rica. our aligner molds and finished aligners are fabricated in mexico and china. our locations in costa rica and mexico as well as others are in earthquake zones and may be subject to other natural disasters. moreover, a significant portion of our research and development activities are located in california, which suffers from earthquakes, periodic droughts, power shortages and wildfires. if there is a major earthquake or any other natural disaster in a region where one of these facilities is located, our employees could be impacted, our research could be lost, and our ability to create clincheck treatment plans, respond to customer inquiries or manufacture and ship our aligners could be compromised which could result in our customers experiencing significant delays receiving their aligners and a decrease in service levels.
when human induced or natural disasters occur, they may, individually or in the aggregate, affect our ability to provide products, services and solutions to our customers, and could cause production delays or limitations, create adverse effects on distributors, disrupt supply chains, result in shipping and distribution disruptions and reduce the availability of or access to one or more facilities, any of which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
changes in, or interpretations of, accounting rules and regulations, could result in unfavorable accounting charges.
we prepare our consolidated financial statements in conformity with u.s. gaap. these principles are subject to interpretation by the sec and various bodies formed to interpret and create appropriate accounting policies. a change in these policies or in the way these policies are interpreted by us or regulators can have a significant effect on our reported results and may even retroactively affect previously reported transactions.
we are required to annually assess our internal control over financial reporting and any adverse results from such assessment may result in a loss of investor confidence in our financial reports and have an adverse effect on our stock price.
we are required to furnish in our form 10-k a report by our management regarding the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting that includes, among other things, an assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of the end of our fiscal year, including a statement as to whether our internal control over financial reporting is effective. our internal controls may become inadequate because of changes in personnel, updates and upgrades to existing software including our erp software system, changes in accounting standards or interpretations of existing standards, and, as a result, the degree of compliance of our internal control over financial reporting with the existing policies or procedures may become ineffective. establishing, testing and maintaining an effective system of internal control over financial reporting requires significant resources and time commitments on the part of our management and our finance staff, may require additional staffing and infrastructure investments and increases our costs of doing business. if we are unable to assert that our internal control over financial reporting is effective in any future period (or if our auditors are unable to express an opinion on the effectiveness of our internal controls or conclude that our internal controls are ineffective), the timely filing of our financial reports could be delayed or we could be required to restate past reports, and cause us to lose investor confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports in the future, which could have an adverse effect on our stock price.
we are exposed to fluctuations in currency exchange rates and inflation, each of which could negatively affect our financial condition and results of operations.
although the u.s. dollar is our reporting currency, a growing portion of our net revenues and net income are generated in foreign currencies. net revenues and net income generated by subsidiaries operating outside of the u.s. are translated into u.s. dollars using constantly, often substantially, fluctuating exchange rates. as a result, negative movements in exchange rates against the u.s. dollar have and may increasingly adversely affect our net revenues and net income in our consolidated financial statements. we enter into currency forward contract transactions in an effort to cover some of our exposure to currency fluctuations, but there is no assurance these transactions will fully or effectively hedge our exposure to currency fluctuations, and, under certain circumstances, these transactions could have an adverse effect on our financial condition.
we also experienced rising inflationary pressures in 2021 and expect such pressures to continue in 2022. cost inflation, including increases in ocean container rates, raw material prices, labor rates, and domestic transportation costs threaten to impact our profitability and our ability to recover these cost increases through price increases may continue to lag, resulting in downward pressure on our gross margin and operating margin. any attempts to offset cost increases with price increases may result in reduced sales, increase customer dissatisfaction or otherwise harm our reputation.
if we fail to manage our exposure to global financial and securities market risks successfully, our operating results and financial statements could be materially impacted.
the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal. to achieve this objective, a majority of our marketable investments are investment grade, liquid, fixed-income securities and money market instruments denominated in u.s. dollars. if the carrying value of an investment exceeds the fair value, and the decline in fair value is deemed to be other-than-temporary, we are required to write down the value of the investment, which could materially harm our results of operations and financial condition. moreover, the performance of certain securities in our investment portfolio correlates with the credit condition of the u.s. financial sector. in an unstable credit or economic environment, it is necessary to assess the value of our investments more frequently and we might incur significant realized, unrealized or impairment losses associated with these investments.
additionally, in july 2017, the united kingdom financial conduct authority announced that it would stop compelling banks to submit interest rates for the calculation of the london interbank offered rate ("libor") after 2021. although we do not have any outstanding debt under our 2020 credit facility, were we to draw on it, the outstanding amounts would bear interest at fluctuating interest rates on an approved replacement benchmark. we also have other contracts indexed to libor. we continue to monitor this matter and evaluate the related risks and potential impact of libor's expiration. any indebtedness that we incur may be indexed to a replacement benchmark, such as the secured overnight financing rate ("sofr"). any such change could cause the effective interest rate under an agreement, including our 2020 credit facility, and our overall interest expense to increase, adversely affecting our cash flows and results of operations.
if our goodwill or long-lived assets become impaired, we may be required to record a significant charge to earnings.
under gaap, we review our goodwill and long-lived asset group for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. additionally, goodwill is required to be tested for impairment at least annually. the qualitative and quantitative analysis used to test goodwill are dependent upon various assumptions and reflect management's best estimates. changes in certain assumptions including revenue growth rates, discount rates, earnings multiples and future cash flows may cause a change in circumstances indicating that the carrying value of goodwill or the asset group may be impaired and assessing these assumptions and predicting and forecasting future events can be difficult. goodwill and purchased assets require periodic fair value assessments to determine if they have become impaired. consequently, we may be required to record a significant charge to earnings in the financial statements during the period in which any impairment of goodwill or long-lived asset group is determined.
our effective tax rate may vary significantly from period to period.
various internal and external factors may have favorable or unfavorable effects on our future effective tax rate. these factors include, but are not limited to, changes in the global economic environment, changes in legal entity structure or activities performed within our entities, changes in tax laws, regulations and/or rates, new or changes to accounting pronouncements, changing interpretations of existing tax laws or regulations, changes in the relative proportions of revenues and income before taxes in the various jurisdictions in which we operate that have differing statutory tax rates, changes in overall levels of pretax earnings, the future levels of tax benefits of stock-based compensation, settlement of income tax audits and non-deductible goodwill impairments. for example, our effective tax rate varied significantly in the first quarter of fiscal 2020 due to the relocation of our emea regional headquarters from the netherlands to switzerland.
our effective tax rate is also dependent in part on forecasts of full year results which can vary materially. furthermore, we may continue to experience significant variation in our effective tax rate related to excess tax benefits on stock-based compensation, particularly in the first quarter of each year when the majority of our equity awards vest.
new tax laws and practice, changes to existing tax laws and practice, or disputes regarding the positions we take regarding tax laws, could negatively affect our provision for income taxes as well as our ongoing operations.
as a u.s. multinational corporation, we are subject to tax laws both within and outside of the u.s. and significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes. changes in tax laws or changes to how those laws are applied to our business in practice, could affect the amount of tax to which we are subject and the manner in which we operate. additionally, the organization for economic cooperation and development's ("oecd") base erosion and profit shifting ("beps") project has resulted in considerable new reporting obligations worldwide as oecd member countries have implemented its guidance. the oecd continues to publish guidance pursuant to the beps and other projects which, if adopted by member countries, may affect our tax positions in many of the countries in which we do business.
moreover, the application of indirect taxes (such as sales and use tax ("sut"), value-added tax ("vat"), goods and services tax ("gst"), and other indirect taxes) to our operations is complex and evolving. u.s. states, local and foreign taxing jurisdictions have differing rules and regulations governing differing types of taxes, and these rules and regulations are subject to varying interpretations and exemptions that may change over time. we collect and remit sut, vat, gst and other taxes in many jurisdictions and we are routinely subject to audits. the positions we take regarding taxes as well as the amounts we collect or remit may be challenged and we may be liable for failing to collect or remit all or any portion of taxes deemed owed or the taxes could exceed our estimates. one or more u.s. states or countries may seek to impose incremental or new sales, use, or other tax collection obligations on us or may determine that such taxes should have but have not been paid by us.
we are routinely subject to audits regarding our tax reporting and remissions by local and national governments. we may also be subject to audits in u.s. states, local and foreign jurisdictions for which we have not accrued tax liabilities. the positions we take and assumptions we make regarding taxes as well as the amounts we collect or remit may be challenged and we may be liable for failing to collect or remit all or any portion of taxes deemed owed or the taxes could exceed our estimates. if we dispute rulings or positions taken by tax authorities, we may incur expenses and expend significant time and effort to defend our positions, which may be costly.
the application of existing, new, or future tax laws, and results of audits, whether in the u.s. or internationally, could harm our business. furthermore there have been and will continue to be substantial ongoing costs associated with complying with the various tax requirements and defending our positions in the numerous markets in which we conduct or will conduct business.
we have in the past and may again in the future invest in or acquire other businesses, products or technologies which may require significant management attention, disrupt our business, dilute stockholder value and adversely affect our results of operations.
periodically, we may acquire, or make investments in, complementary companies, products or technologies like our acquisition of exocad in 2020. alternatively, we may be unable to find suitable investment or acquisition targets in the future, and we may not be able to complete investments or acquisitions on favorable terms, if at all. if we do make investments or complete acquisitions, we may not ultimately strengthen our competitive position or achieve our goals or desired synergies, and any investments that we make or acquisitions we complete could be viewed negatively by our customers, securities analysts and investors. moreover, to the extent we make strategic investments, the companies in which we invest may fail or we may ultimately own less than a majority of the outstanding shares of the company and be outvoted on critical matters or issues that could harm us or the value of our investment.
additionally, as an organization we do not have a history of significant acquisitions or integrating their operations and cultures with our own. as such we are subject to multiple vulnerabilities and risks when making a strategic investment or acquisition, including we may:
•fail to perform proper due diligence and inherit or fail to uncover material issues of the acquired company or assets, including ip or other litigation or ongoing investigations, accounting irregularities or improprieties, bribery, corruption or other compliance liabilities;
•fail to comply with regulations, governmental orders or decrees;
•create it security and privacy compliance issues;
•invest in companies that generate net losses and the market for their products, services or technologies may be slow to develop;
•not realize a positive return on investment or determine that our investments have declined in value, such that we may be required to record impairments which could be material and could have an adverse impact on our financial results;
•have to pay cash, incur debt or issue equity securities to pay for an acquisition, adversely affecting our liquidity, financial condition or the value of our common stock. the sale of equity or issuance of debt to finance any acquisition could result in dilution to our stockholders. the occurrence of indebtedness would result in increased fixed obligations and could also include covenants or other restrictions that would impede our ability to manage our operations;
•find it difficult to implement and harmonize company-wide financial reporting, forecasting and budgeting, accounting, billing, information technology and other systems due to inconsistencies in standards, internal controls, procedures and policies;
•require significant time and resources to effectuate the transition;
•fail to retain key personnel;
•inaccurately forecast the financial impact of an acquired business;
•not realize any or all or material portions of the expected synergies and benefits of the acquisition; or
•unsuccessfully evaluate or utilize the acquired technology or acquired company's know-how or fail to successfully integrate any acquisitions or the technologies acquired.
moreover, opposition to one of more acquisitions could lead to negative ratings by analysts or investors, give rise to objections by one or more stockholders or result in stockholder activism, any of which could harm our stock price. acquisitions can also lead to large non-cash charges that can have an adverse effect on our results of operations as a result of write-offs for items such as future impairments of intangible assets and goodwill or the recording of stock-based compensation.
historically, the market price for our common stock has been volatile.
the market price of our common stock is subject to rapid and wide price fluctuations in response to various factors, many of which are beyond our control. the factors include:
•the impact on global and regional economies as a result of the covid-19 pandemic;
•quarterly variations in our results of operations and liquidity or changes in our forecasts and guidance;
•changes in recommendations by the investment community or speculation in the press or investment community regarding estimates of our net revenues, operating results or other performance indicators;
•announcements by us or our competitors or new market entrants, including strategic actions, management changes, and material transactions or acquisitions;
•technical factors in the public trading markets for our stock that may produce price movements that may or may not comport with macro, industry or company-specific fundamentals, including, without limitation, the sentiment of retail investors (including as it may be expressed on financial trading and other social media sites), the amount and status of short interest in our securities, access to margin debt, trading in options and other derivatives on our common stock, fractional share trading, and other technical trading factors or strategies;
•announcements regarding stock repurchases, sales of our common stock, credit agreements and debt issuances;
•announcements of technological innovations, new, additional or revised programs, business models, products or product offerings by us, our customers or competitors;
•key decisions in pending litigation, new litigation, settlements, judgments or decrees;
•sales of stock by us, our officers or directors; and
•general economic market conditions.
in addition, the stock market in general, and the market for technology and medical device companies, in particular, have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that are often unrelated to or disproportionate to the operating performance of those companies. these broad market and industry factors may include market expectations of, or actual changes in, monetary policies that have the goal of easing or tightening interest rates such as the federal funds rate in the u.s. and austerity measures of governments intended to control budget deficits. historically, our stock has fluctuated materially based on broad economic and industry factors unrelated to our actual performance and future changes in monetary policies, austerity, and other market factors may seriously harm the market price of our common stock, regardless of our operating performance. historically, securities litigation, including securities class action lawsuits and securities derivative lawsuits, is often brought against an issuing company following periods of volatility in the market price of its securities and we have not been excepted from such litigation.
we cannot guarantee that we will continue to repurchase our common stock in the future, and any repurchases that we may make may not achieve our desired objectives.
we have a history of recurring stock repurchase programs intended to return capital to our investors. future stock repurchase programs are contingent on a variety of factors, including our financial condition, results of operations, business requirements, and our board of directors' continuing determination that stock repurchases are in the best interests of our stockholders and in compliance with all applicable laws and agreements. there is no assurance that we will continue repurchasing our common stock in the future, consistent with historical levels or at all, or that our stock repurchase programs will have a beneficial impact on our stock price.
future sales of significant amounts of our common stock may depress our stock price.
a large percentage of our outstanding common stock is currently owned by a small number of significant stockholders. these stockholders have sold in the past, and may sell in the future, large amounts of common stock over relatively short periods of time. sales of substantial amounts of our common stock in the public market by existing stockholders may adversely affect the market price of our common stock by creating the perception of difficulties or problems with our business that may depress our stock price.
increased scrutiny of our esg policies and practices have and will likely continue to result in additional costs and risks, and may adversely impact our reputation, employee retention, and willingness of customers and suppliers to do business with us.
investor advocacy groups, institutional investors, investment funds, proxy advisory services, stockholders, and customers are increasingly focused on esg practices of companies. additionally, public interest and legislative pressure related to public companies' esg practices continues to grow. if our esg practices fail to meet regulatory requirements or investor or other industry stakeholders' evolving expectations and standards for responsible corporate citizenship in areas including environmental stewardship, support for local communities, board of director and employee diversity, human capital management, employee health and safety practices, product quality, supply chain management, corporate governance and transparency and employing esg strategies in our operations, our brand, reputation and employee retention may be negatively impacted and customers and suppliers may be unwilling to do business with us. in addition, as we work to align our esg practices with industry standards, we have expanded and, in the future, will likely continue to expand our disclosures in these areas. we also expect to incur additional costs and require additional resources to monitor, report, and comply with our various esg practices. if we fail to adopt esg standards or practices as quickly as stakeholders desire or regulators require, report on our esg efforts or practices accurately, or satisfy the disclosure and other expectations of stakeholders or regulators, our reputation, business, financial performance, growth, and stock price may be adversely impacted.
item 7.management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations.
the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read together with our consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10-k.
a discussion regarding our financial condition and results of operations for fiscal 2021 compared to fiscal 2020 is presented under results of operations of this form 10-k. discussions regarding our financial condition and results of operations for fiscal 2020 compared to 2019 have been omitted from this annual report on form 10-k, but can be found in "item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations" in our annual report on form 10-k for the fiscal year ended december 31, 2020, filed with the sec on february 26, 2021, which is available without charge on the sec's website at www.sec.gov and on our investor relations website at investor.aligntech.com.
executive overview of results trends and uncertainties our business strategic priorities remain focused on four principal pillars of growth: (i) international expansion; (ii) gp adoption; (iii) patient demand and conversion; and (iv) orthodontic utilization.
we strive to deliver on each of our strategic growth drivers through a variety of interrelated enterprise-wide efforts including:
•our growth depends on the continued penetration and adoption of invisalign products, intraoral scanners and cad/cam solutions in international markets. we continue to invest in manufacturing operations, research and development, clinical treatment planning, sales and marketing and building our quality and regulatory capabilities in existing and emerging markets globally. for instance, in 2021, we:
◦opened new offices in israel to support the long-term growth of itero scanner and services business for treatment planning and other operations;
◦announced plans to open an aligner fabrication facility in wroclaw, poland as a part of our strategy to bring operational facilities closer to customers and thereby serve them more quickly and respond to their needs more effectively as well as new treatment planning operations in targeted regional geographies; and
◦expanded our sales and marketing efforts into new countries and regions, including establishing offices in the african countries of ghana and morocco.
•we continue to see growth opportunities with international orthodontists and gp customers, particularly with adopters of digital dentistry platforms as we continue to tailor our sales and marketing strategies and resources around the unique needs of each customer channel. as we continue growing, we intend to opportunistically expand our research, development, manufacturing, treatment planning, sales and marketing operations to meet local and regional demand thoughtfully and deliberately. over the longer-term, we expect international revenues to grow faster than americas' revenues as a result of growing international demand, our continued investment in international market expansion, the size of the market opportunities and our relatively low market penetration of these regions.
•we believe our training and education efforts are important to building the confidence within the gp and orthodontic communities needed to increase their adoption and utilization of clear aligner treatment. accordingly, we continue to expand our invisalign customer base by educating new doctors on the benefits of digital dentistry through the invisalign system and demonstrating to gps and orthodontists how the itero portfolio of intraoral scanners and cad/cam restorative services and workflows can increase the profitability of their dental practices by enhancing patient experiences.
however, training and education alone are insufficient to drive adoption and utilization growth sufficiently. we need to continue to innovate, develop and bring to market products and solutions that deliver the ever-increasing clinical precision and predictability doctors expect with the speed and convenience their patients require. for this reason, we expect to continue to invest in research and development and open facilities closer to our customers and their patients to timely and conveniently support them.
•patient demand and conversion depends on making targeted investments in advertising and public relations through social media, influencers and other forms of digital communications to encourage patients to seek treatment from invisalign trained doctors. we believe that well-designed, targeted sales and marketing promotions that build on our strong brand awareness and allow us to differentiate our products and solutions from traditional and emerging competitors. accordingly, we continue to increase investments intended to grow consumer demand. for instance, in 2021, we introduced the "invis-is" consumer advertising campaign with new creative content and influencers focused on teens, moms and young adults. we expect to make further investments to create additional demand for invisalign system treatment driving more consumers to dental professionals for those treatments.
in addition, we are pursuing new lines of consumer products that are complementary to our doctor-prescribed principal products currently available in certain e-commerce channels in the u.s. similarly, in order to grow our retainer business, which is significantly underpenetrated, we have begun investing more directly in marketing strategies focused on driving adoption and increasing market share in the u.s.
•we expect global orthodontic utilization rates to continue increasing overall as doctors' clinical confidence in the efficacy and predictability of the invisalign system increases with advancements in products and technology and as patients and doctors demand treatments that emphasize convenience and safety through fewer in office visits and less invasive and quicker treatments rise. in addition, the teenage and younger market makes up 75% of the approximately 21 million total annual global orthodontic case starts each year. as we continue to emphasize the benefits of the invisalign system for teenage and younger patient treatments through education, training and sales and marketing programs, we expect utilization rates to rise. however, our utilization rates will fluctuate from period to period due to a variety of factors, which may include seasonal trends in our business, office closures or slowdowns related to covid-19-related preventative measures and adoption rates for new products and features. refer to "covid-19 pandemic update" below for further details.
•to achieve these strategic pillars, we expect to continue hiring skilled employees in our clinical engineering, technology development, manufacturing, sales and management teams. expanding our workforce will require that we offer competitive compensation and result in increasing costs which we expect to offset with increasing revenues.
covid-19 pandemic update the covid-19 pandemic continues to cause significant volatility and uncertainty in the global and regional economies, leading to changes in consumer and business behavior, fear and market fluctuations, materials and product shortages and restrictions on business and individual activities, all of which is materially impacting supply and demand in broad sectors of the world markets. during 2021, many businesses and countries, including the u.s., continued imposing preventative and precautionary measures to mitigate the spread of the virus and its variants. as a result of the restrictive measures imposed, the demand for digital solutions has increased. society and businesses continue to adapt to practices such as social distancing and remote working that further the need for greater flexibility and convenience of digital solutions. our efforts to promote the digital transformation of dental practices with our clear aligners, intraoral scanners, clinical treatment planning and other offerings has allowed us to quickly respond to fluctuating demands in the dental field in various regions.
consequently, despite the economic challenges caused by the pandemic, our revenue grew by 59.9% in 2021 compared to 2020. the growth was a combination of non-covid related increases as well as lower revenues in 2020 as the initial preventative measures to combat the spread of the virus resulted in significant office closures and materially reduced operating capacities for many of our customers. our overall business performance has been strong, and we believe the digital transition to dentistry that began before the pandemic will continue to be positive for our business, results of operations, cash flows, and financial condition, although we intend to adjust spending to coincide with the fluctuating pace of recovery and changes in demand. as such, our recent operating results and levels of growth may not be indicative of our future performance.
the continuing evolution of the pandemic remains highly fluid and unpredictable, including the setbacks occurring as a result of new virus strains and new or additional operating restrictions imposed on businesses, supply chain shortages and delays, the positive impacts of vaccinations, the uncertainties regarding consumer spending as demand for entertainment, dining, and travel returns and remote working diminishes. our top priority continues to be the health and safety of our employees and their families, our customers and their staff. in addition, new variants of the virus have caused unpredictable fluctuations in the number of patients seeking treatment and the number of doctors providing the services and treatments. these fluctuations have adversely impacted our results of operations from time to time in the recent past and are expected to continue to impact our results, particularly in the near term.
we continue to follow recommended safety measures, including encouraging employees to work from home when possible, suspending non-essential work travel, and implementing various access controls at our facilities. in order to overcome the supply chain shortages and delays, we are also proactively communicating with our suppliers and distributors and modifying our purchase order commitments to mitigate the risks of supply chain interruptions and maintaining inventory levels greater than historically required.
further discussion of the impact of the covid-19 pandemic on our business may be found in part i, item 1a of this annual report on form 10-k under the heading "risk factors."
key financial and operating metrics we measure our performance against these strategic priorities by the achievement of key financial and operating metrics. for the year ended december 31, 2021, we achieved the following, taking into consideration that percentage changes from prior year financial results include the impact of covid-19 and do not necessarily reflect our future growth rates:
◦revenues of $3,952.6 million, an increase of 59.9% year-over-year;
◦clear aligner revenues of $3,247.1 million, an increase of 54.5% year-over-year reflecting the expanding opportunity for invisalign system treatment among adults globally, as well as the underlying orthodontic market as we continue to build awareness of the invisalign brand and drive utilization among teens and younger patients through increased consumer marketing.
▪americas clear aligner revenues of $1,544.8 million, an increase of 52.9% year-over-year;
▪international clear aligner revenues of $1,498.7 million, an increase of 55.2% year-over-year;
▪clear aligner volume increase of 54.8% year-over-year and clear aligner volume increase for teenage patients of 47.3% year-over-year;
◦imaging systems and cad/cam services revenues of $705.5 million, an increase of 90.4% year-over-year reflecting strong growth across all regions with continued adoption of the itero element 5d and 5d plus series of next generation scanners and imaging systems launched in february 2021, as well as increased average selling prices ("asp") predominately due to favorable product mix shift towards higher priced scanners;
◦income from operations of $976.4 million and operating margin of 24.7%;
◦effective tax rate of 23.7%;
◦net income of $772.0 million with diluted net income per share of $9.69;
◦cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities of $1,296.7 million as of december 31, 2021;
◦operating cash flow of $1,172.5 million;
◦capital expenditures of $401.1 million, predominantly related to increases in our manufacturing capacity and facilities; and
◦number of employees was 22,540 as of december 31, 2021, an increase of 24.7% year-over-year.
other statistical data and trends
•our primary goal is to establish clear aligners as the principal solution for the treatment of malocclusions and our invisalign system as the treatment solution of choice by orthodontists, gps and patients globally, our intraoral scanning platform as the preferred scanning protocol for digital dental scans, and our exocad cad/cam software as the solution of choice for dental labs. as of december 31, 2021, over 12 million people worldwide have been treated with our invisalign system, over 68,000 itero scanners have been sold and over 47,000 exocad software licenses have been installed. management measures these results by comparing to the estimated 500 million people who can benefit from straighter teeth, 21 million annual orthodontic case starts and 2 million dental practices that could use intraoral scanners and uses this data to target opportunities to expand the market for orthodontics by educating consumers about the benefits of straighter teeth using the invisalign system, dental professionals and/or labs and service providers to use itero intraoral scanners, and dental labs and practitioners to install exocad cad/cam software.
•for the fourth quarter of 2021, total invisalign cases submitted with a digital scanner in the americas increased to 89.1%, up from 84.0% in the fourth quarter of 2020 and international scans increased to 80.8%, up from 73.7% in the fourth quarter of 2020. for the fourth quarter of 2021, 96.4% of invisalign cases submitted by north american orthodontists were submitted digitally. our annual utilization rates for the last three fiscal years are as follows:
* invisalign utilization rates are calculated by the number of cases shipped divided by the number of doctors to whom cases were shipped. our international region includes emea, apac. latin america ("latam") is excluded from the international region based on its immateriality to the year, however is included in the total utilization.
•total utilization rate in 2021 increased to 20.8 cases per doctor compared to 16.1 cases per doctor in 2020 and 15.9 cases per doctor in 2019.
•north america: utilization rate among our north american orthodontist customers increased to 98.1 cases per doctor in 2021 compared to 67.3 cases per doctor in 2020 and 65.0 cases per doctor in 2019 and the utilization rate among our north american gp customers increased to 14.3 cases per doctor in 2021 compared to 9.6 cases per doctor in 2020 and 9.5 cases per doctor in 2019.
•international: international doctor utilization rate increased to 17.5 cases per doctor in 2021 compared to 14.5 cases per doctor in 2020 and 13.8 cases per doctor in 2019.
results of operations net revenues by reportable segment we group our operations into two reportable segments: clear aligner segment and systems and services segment.
•our clear aligner segment consists of comprehensive products, non-comprehensive products and non-case revenues as defined below:
•comprehensive products include, but are not limited to, invisalign comprehensive and invisalign first.
•non-comprehensive products include, but are not limited to, invisalign moderate, lite and express packages and invisalign go and invisalign go plus.
•non-case products include, but are not limited to, retention products, invisalign training, adjusting tools used by dental professionals during the course of treatment and, more recently, consumer products that are complementary to our doctor-prescribed principal products such as aligner cases (clamshells), teeth whitening products, cleaning solutions (crystals, foam and other material) and other oral health products available in certain e-commerce channels in the u.s.
•our systems and services segment consists of our itero intraoral scanning systems, which includes a single hardware platform and restorative or orthodontic software options. our services include subscription software, disposables, rentals, pay per scan services, as well as exocad's cad/cam software solutions that integrate workflows to dental labs and dental practices.

research and development expense generally includes personnel-related costs, including payroll and stock-based compensation, outside service costs associated with the research and development of new products and enhancements to existing products, software, equipment, material and maintenance costs, depreciation and amortization expense and allocations of corporate overhead expenses including facilities and it.
research and development expense increased in 2021 compared to 2020 primarily due to higher compensation costs including higher salaries, fringe benefits and incentive bonuses mainly from increased headcount as we continue to focus our investments in innovation and research.

the increase in our effective tax rate for the year ended december 31, 2021 compared to 2020 is primarily attributable to the recognition of tax benefits associated with the intra-entity transfer of certain intellectual property rights and fixed assets during the year ended december 31, 2020.
during 2020, we completed an intra-entity transfer of certain intellectual property rights and fixed assets to our swiss entity. the transfer of intellectual property rights did not result in a taxable gain; however, it did result in a step-up of the swiss tax deductible basis in the transferred assets, and accordingly, created a temporary difference between the book basis and the tax basis of such intellectual property rights. consequently, this transaction resulted in the recognition of a deferred tax asset and related one-time tax benefit of approximately $1,493.5 million during the year ended december 31, 2020, which is the net impact of the deferred tax asset recognized as a result of the additional swiss tax deductible basis in the transferred assets and certain costs related to the transfer of fixed assets and inventory. the amortization of this deferred tax asset depends on the profitability of our swiss headquarters and the recognition of this tax benefit is allowed for a maximum recovery period of 15 years.

as of december 31, 2021 and 2020, approximately $713.8 million and $412.5 million, respectively, of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities was held by our foreign subsidiaries. our intent is to permanently reinvest our earnings from our international operations going forward, and our current plans do not require us to repatriate them to fund our u.s. operations as we generate sufficient domestic operating cash flow and have access to external funding under our $300.0 million revolving line of credit. we believe that our current cash balances and the borrowing capacity under our credit facility, if necessary, will be sufficient to fund our business for at least the next 12 months.
our material cash requirements as of december 31, 2021 are as below:
•our purchase commitments for goods and services, excluding capital expenditures, totaled $1,278.0 million, of which $731.0 million will be payable within the next 12 months. these commitments primarily relate to agreements with contract manufacturers and suppliers, sales and marketing services, research and development services and technological services.
•we expect our investments in capital expenditures to exceed $350.0 million for the next 12 months. capital expenditures primarily relate to building construction and improvements as well as additional manufacturing capacity to support our international expansion. this includes our planned investment in an aligner fabrication facility in wroclaw, poland, which is expected to begin serving doctors in 2022, as a part of our strategy to bring operational facilities closer to customers. as we continue growing, we intend to expand our investments in research and development, manufacturing, treatment planning, sales and marketing operations to meet local and regional demand.
•we have future operating lease payments of $160.8 million, which includes $17.8 million for leases that have not yet commenced as of december 31, 2021. refer to note 4 "leases" of the notes to consolidated financial statements for details on the lease payments.
•we have $725.0 million available for repurchase under the stock repurchase program authorized by our board of directors in may 2021. our stock repurchase program is subject to periodic evaluations to determine when and if repurchases are in the best interests of our stockholders, taking into account prevailing market conditions. refer to note 13 "common stock repurchase programs" of the notes to consolidated financial statements for details on our stock repurchase programs. subsequent to year end, during february 2022, we repurchased on the open market approximately 0.1 million shares of our common stock at an average price of $522.35 per share, including commissions, for an aggregate purchase price of $75.0 million.

critical accounting policies and estimates management's discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america. the preparation of financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, revenues and expenses and disclosures at the date of the financial statements. we evaluate our estimates on an on-going basis and use authoritative pronouncements, historical experience and other assumptions as the basis for making the estimates. actual results could differ from those estimates.
we believe the following critical accounting policies and estimates affect our more significant judgments used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements. for further information on all of our significant accounting policies, see note 1 "summary of significant accounting policies" of the notes to consolidated financial statements under item 8.
revenue recognition our revenues are derived primarily from the sale of aligners, scanners, and services from our clear aligner and systems and services segments. we enter into sales contracts that may consist of multiple distinct performance obligations where certain performance obligations of the sales contract are not delivered in one reporting period. we measure and allocate revenues according to asc 606-10, "revenues from contracts with customers."
determining the standalone selling price ("ssp"), allocation of consideration from the contract to the individual performance obligations and the appropriate timing of revenue recognition is the result of significant qualitative and quantitative judgments. while changes in the allocation of the ssp between performance obligations will not affect the amount of total revenues recognized for a particular contract, any material changes could impact the timing of revenue recognition, which would have a material effect on our financial position and result of operations. this is because the contract consideration is allocated to each performance obligation, delivered or undelivered, at the inception of the contract based on the ssp of each distinct performance obligation.
we allocate revenues for each clear aligner treatment plan based on each unit's ssp. management considers a variety of factors such as same or similar product historical sales, costs, and gross margin, which may vary over time depending upon the unique facts and circumstances related to each performance obligation in making these estimates. for treatment plans with multiple future performance obligations, we also consider usage rates, which is the number of times a customer is expected to order more aligners after the initial shipment. our process for estimating usage rates requires significant judgment and evaluation of inputs, including historical usage data by region, country and channel.
we estimate the ssp of each element in a scanner system and services sale taking into consideration same or similar product historical prices as well as our discounting strategies.
unfulfilled performance obligations for clear aligners and scanners the estimated revenues expected to be recognized in the future related to our unfulfilled performance obligations, including deferred revenues and backlog, as of december 31, 2021 is $1,307.3 million. this estimate includes both product and service unfulfilled performance obligations and the time range reflects our best estimate of when we will transfer control to the customer and may change based on customer usage patterns, timing of shipments, readiness of customers' facilities for installation, and manufacturing availability all of which involve significant judgement. generally, our deferred revenue will be recognized over a period of one to five years.
goodwill and finite-lived acquired intangible assets goodwill and acquired intangible assets with finite lives are subject to impairment testing and are reviewed for impairment when events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset is not recoverable and the carrying amount exceeds its fair value. we evaluate the recoverability of the carrying value of these identifiable intangible assets based on estimated undiscounted cash flows to be generated from such assets. if the cash flow estimates or the significant operating assumptions upon which they are based change in the future, we may be required to record impairment charges.
assumptions and estimates about future values and remaining useful lives of our acquired intangible assets are complex and subjective. they can be affected by external factors such as industry and economic trends and internal factors such as changes in our business strategy and internal forecasts. our ongoing consideration of all these factors could result in impairment charges in the future.
if we were to have impairments to goodwill or finite-lived acquired intangible assets, it could adversely affect our operating results. during the fiscal year 2021 and 2020, we did not have any impairment charges related to our goodwill or acquired intangible assets.
accounting for income taxes we are subject to income taxes in the u.s. and numerous foreign jurisdictions. the evaluation of our uncertain tax positions involves significant judgment in the interpretation and application of u.s. gaap and complex domestic and international tax laws related to the allocation of international taxation rights between countries. we are also required to evaluate the realizability of our deferred tax assets on an ongoing basis in accordance with u.s. gaap, which requires the assessment of both of our historical and future performance as well as other relevant factors. realization of our deferred tax assets is dependent on our ability to generate future taxable income which is determined based on assumptions such as estimated growth rates in revenues, gross margins, future cash flows and discount rates. the accuracy of these estimates could be affected by unforeseen events or actual results, and the sustainability of our future tax benefits is dependent upon the acceptance of these valuation estimates and assumptions by the taxing authorities.
accounting for legal proceedings and litigation estimates of probable losses resulting from litigation are inherently difficult to make, particularly when the matters are in early procedural stages with incomplete facts and information. the final outcome of legal proceedings is dependent on many variables difficult to predict and, therefore, the ultimate cost to entirely resolve such matters may be materially different than the amount of current estimates. consequently, new information or changes in judgments and estimates could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations or cash flows.
recent accounting pronouncements see note 1 "summary of significant accounting policies" of the notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8 for a discussion of recent accounting pronouncements, including the expected dates of adoption and estimated effects on results of operations and financial condition, which is incorporated herein.

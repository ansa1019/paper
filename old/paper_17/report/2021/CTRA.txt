item 1a.    risk factors business and operational risks you should carefully consider the following risk factors in addition to the other information included in this report. each of these risk factors could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and/or cash flows, as well as adversely affect the value of an investment in our common stock or debt securities.
commodity prices fluctuate widely, and low prices for an extended period would likely have a material adverse impact on our business.
our revenues, operating results, financial condition and ability to borrow funds or obtain additional capital depend substantially on prices we receive for the oil, natural gas and ngls that we sell. lower commodity prices may reduce the amount of oil, natural gas and ngls that we can produce economically. historically, commodity prices have been volatile, with prices fluctuating widely, and they are likely to continue to be volatile. for example, the wti oil prices in 2021 ranged from a high of $84.65 to a low of $47.62 per bbl and nymex natural gas prices in 2021 ranged from a high of $23.86 (during winter storm uri) to a low of $2.43 per mmbtu. any substantial or extended decline in future commodity prices would have a material adverse effect on our future business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, liquidity or ability to finance planned capital expenditures and commitments. furthermore, substantial, extended decreases in commodity prices may cause us to delay or postpone a significant portion of our exploration and development projects or may render such projects uneconomic, which may result in significant downward adjustments to our estimated proved reserves and could negatively impact our ability to borrow and cost of capital and our ability to access capital markets, increase our costs under our revolving credit facility and limit our ability to execute aspects of our business plans. refer to "future commodity price declines may result in write-downs of the carrying amount of our oil and gas properties, which could materially and adversely affect our results of operations."
wide fluctuations in commodity prices may result from relatively minor changes in the supply of and demand for oil, natural gas and ngls, market uncertainty and a variety of additional factors that are beyond our control. these factors include but are not limited to the following:
•the levels and location of oil, natural gas and ngls supply and demand and expectations regarding supply and demand, including the potential long-term impact of an abundance of natural gas from shale (such as that produced from our marcellus shale properties) on the global natural gas supply;
•the level of consumer demand for oil, natural gas and ngls, which has been significantly impacted by the covid-19 pandemic, particularly during 2020;
•weather conditions and seasonal trends;
•political, economic or health conditions in oil, natural gas and ngl producing regions, including the middle east, africa, south america and the u.s., including for example, the impacts of local or international pandemics and disasters or events such as the global covid-19 pandemic;
•the ability and willingness of the members of opec+ to agree to and maintain oil price and production controls;
•the price level and quantities of foreign imports;
•actions of governmental authorities;
•the availability, proximity and capacity of gathering, transportation, processing and/or refining facilities in regional or local areas;
•inventory storage levels and the cost and availability of storage and transportation of oil, natural gas and ngls;
•the nature and extent of domestic and foreign governmental regulations and taxation, including environmental and climate change regulation;
•the price, availability and acceptance of alternative fuels;
•technological advances affecting energy consumption;
•speculation by investors in oil, natural gas and ngls;
•variations between product prices at sales points and applicable index prices; and table of contents
•overall economic conditions, including the value of the u.s. dollar relative to other major currencies.
these factors and the volatile nature of the energy markets make it impossible to predict future commodity prices. if commodity prices decline significantly for a sustained period of time, the lower prices may cause us to reduce our planned drilling program or adversely affect our ability to make planned expenditures, raise additional capital or meet our financial obligations.
drilling oil and natural gas wells is a high-risk activity.
our growth is materially dependent upon the success of our drilling program. drilling for oil and natural gas involves numerous risks, including the risk that no commercially productive reservoirs will be encountered. the cost of drilling, completing and operating wells is substantial and uncertain, and drilling operations may be curtailed, delayed or canceled as a result of a variety of factors beyond our control, including:
•decreases in commodity prices;
•unexpected drilling conditions, pressure or irregularities in formations;
•equipment failures or accidents, including blowouts, explosions and fires;
•adverse weather conditions;
•surface access restrictions;
•loss of title or other title related issues;
•lack of available gathering or processing facilities or delays in the construction thereof;
•compliance with, or changes in, governmental requirements and regulation, including with respect to wastewater disposal, discharge of greenhouse gases and fracturing;
•unusual or unexpected geological formations or pressure or irregularities in formations; and
•costs of shortages or delays in the availability of drilling rigs or crews and the delivery of equipment and materials.
our future drilling activities may not be successful and, if unsuccessful, such failure will have an adverse effect on our future results of operations and financial condition. our overall drilling success rate or our drilling success rate within a particular geographic area may decline. we may be unable to lease or drill identified or budgeted prospects within our expected time frame, or at all. we may be unable to lease or drill a particular prospect because, in some cases, we identify a prospect or drilling location before seeking an option or lease rights in the prospect or location. similarly, our drilling schedule may vary from our capital budget. the final determination with respect to the drilling of any scheduled or budgeted wells will depend on a number of factors, including:
•the results of exploration efforts and the acquisition, review and analysis of seismic data;
•the availability of sufficient capital resources to us and the other participants for the drilling of the prospects;
•the approval of the prospects by other participants after additional data has been compiled;
•economic and industry conditions at the time of drilling, including prevailing and anticipated prices for oil and natural gas and the availability of drilling rigs and crews;
•our financial resources and results; and
•the availability of leases and permits on reasonable terms for the prospects and any delays in obtaining such permits.
these projects may not be successfully developed and the wells, if drilled, may not encounter reservoirs of commercially productive oil or natural gas.
business disruptions from unexpected events, including pandemics, health crises and natural disasters, may disrupt our operations and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
the occurrence of one or more unexpected events, including a public health crisis, pandemic and epidemic, war or civil unrest, a terrorist act, a cybersecurity incident resulting in unauthorized access to sensitive information or causing data or table of contents systems to be unusable, a weather event, an earthquake or other catastrophe could cause instability in world financial markets and lead to increased volatility in prices for oil and natural gas, all of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. for example, the ongoing covid-19 outbreak has resulted in widespread adverse impacts on the global economy. there is considerable uncertainty regarding the extent to which covid-19 will continue to spread, including new strains of covid-19 such as the delta and omicron variants, the global availability and efficacy of treatments and vaccines and boosters and the acceptance of such treatments and vaccines by a significant portion of the population, and the extent and duration of governmental and other measures implemented to try to slow the spread of the virus, such as quarantines, shelter-in-place orders and business and government shutdowns (whether through a continuation of existing measures or the re-imposition of prior measures). the worldwide vaccine rollouts in 2021 have allowed governments to ease covid-19 restrictions and lockdown protocols; however, the recent increase in covid-19 cases resulting from the delta and omicron variants has created questions about whether lockdown protocols must be adjusted and the ultimate impact of those variants is unknown. we have implemented preventative measures and developed response plans intended to minimize unnecessary risk of exposure to infection among our employees at our work sites, and we continue to assess and plan for various operational contingencies related to covid-19. however, if a significant portion of our employees or contractors or the employees or contractors of the operators of pipelines, processing and other facilities we utilize or of our vendors or suppliers were unable to work due to illness or if our field operations were suspended or temporarily restricted due to control measures designed to contain the outbreak, that could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations, and we cannot guarantee that any precautionary actions taken by us will be effective in preventing disruptions to our business. in the event of any significant resurgence in covid-19 transmission and infection in the areas in which we operate, our non-operational employees may return to working remotely, which could increase the risk of security breaches or other cyber-incidents or attacks, loss of data, fraud and other disruptions as a consequence of more employees accessing sensitive and critical information from remote locations via network infrastructure and internet services not arranged, established or secured by us.
additionally, vaccination and testing requirements related to covid-19 could impact our business in the future. in september 2021, the osha was directed to implement an emergency temporary standard requiring employers with 100 or more employees to ensure their workforce is fully vaccinated or to require unvaccinated workers to produce a negative covid-19 test result on at least a weekly basis. although the u.s. supreme court recently blocked the implementation of the standard, the future implementation of similar mandatory vaccination and testing requirements could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations in the event that, among other things, a significant portion of our workforce does not choose to become vaccinated, the costs related to mandatory testing for unvaccinated employees are significant or the time away from work for testing is disruptive to our operations.
furthermore, the covid-19 pandemic caused a significant reduction in demand for crude oil, and to a lesser extent, natural gas and ngls during much of 2020. the supply/demand imbalance driven by the covid-19 pandemic and production disagreements in march 2020 among members of opec+ led to a significant global economic contraction generally in 2020 and continued to have disruptive impacts on our industry in 2021. although an agreement to cut production was subsequently announced by opec+, the situation, coupled with the impact of covid-19 and storage and transportation capacity constraints, resulted in a significant downturn in the oil and gas industry. we cannot predict the full impact that covid-19 and its variants or the significant disruption and volatility currently being experienced in the oil and natural gas markets will have on our business, financial condition and results of operations at this time due to numerous uncertainties. for example, the operations of our midstream service providers, on whom we rely for the transmission, gathering and processing of a significant portion of our produced oil, natural gas and ngls, may be disrupted or suspended in response to containing outbreaks, and/or the economic challenges may lead to a reduction in capacity or closing of the facilities and infrastructure of our midstream service providers, which may result in substantial discounts in the prices we receive for our produced oil, natural gas or ngls or result in the shut-in of producing wells or the delay or discontinuance of development plans for our properties. although we have not received notices from our customers or counterparties regarding non-performance issues or delays resulting from the covid-19 pandemic, to the extent we or any of our material suppliers or customers are unable to operate due to government restrictions or otherwise, we may have to temporarily shut down or reduce production, which could result in significant downtime and have significant adverse consequences for our business, financial condition and results of operations.
in addition, the covid-19 pandemic has impacted supply chains, delaying deliveries of supplies and equipment and increasing costs. our costs for services, labor and supplies increased during 2021 due to increased demand for those items and supply chain disruptions related to the covid-19 pandemic. the ultimate impacts of the covid-19 pandemic will depend on future developments, including, among others, the ultimate severity of the virus, any resurgence in covid-19 transmission and infection in affected regions after they have begun to experience improvements, the consequences of governmental and other measures, the efficacy of treatments and vaccines and boosters and the success of vaccination programs, the duration of the outbreak, further actions taken by members of opec+, actions taken by governmental authorities, customers, suppliers and other third parties, workforce availability and the timing and extent to which normal economic and operating conditions resume.
table of contents our proved reserves are estimates. any material inaccuracies in our reserve estimates or underlying assumptions could cause the quantities and net present value of our reserves to be overstated or understated.
reserve engineering is a subjective process of estimating underground accumulations of oil and natural gas that cannot be measured in an exact manner. the process of estimating quantities of proved reserves is complex and inherently imprecise, and the reserve data included in this document are only estimates. the process relies on interpretations of available geologic, geophysical, engineering and production data. the extent, quality and reliability of this technical data can vary. the process also requires certain economic assumptions, some of which are mandated by the sec, such as assumptions relating to commodity prices. additional assumptions include drilling and operating expenses, capital expenditures, taxes and availability of funds. furthermore, different reserve engineers may make different estimates of reserves and cash flows based on the same data.
results of drilling, testing and production subsequent to the date of an estimate may justify revising the original estimate. accordingly, initial reserve estimates often vary from the quantities of oil and natural gas that are ultimately recovered, and such variances may be material. any significant variance could reduce the estimated quantities and present value of our reserves.
you should not assume that the present value of future net cash flows from our proved reserves is the current market value of our estimated reserves. in accordance with sec requirements, we base the estimated discounted future net cash flows from our proved reserves on the 12-month average index price for the respective commodity, calculated as the unweighted arithmetic average for the first day of the month price for each month and costs in effect on the date of the estimate, holding the prices and costs constant throughout the life of the properties. actual future prices and costs may differ materially from those used in the net present value estimate, and future net present value estimates using then current prices and costs may be significantly less than the current estimate. in addition, the 10 percent discount factor we use when calculating discounted future net cash flows for reporting requirements in compliance with the applicable accounting standards may not be the most appropriate discount factor based on interest rates in effect from time to time and risks associated with us or the oil and gas industry in general.
future commodity price declines may result in write-downs of the carrying amount of our oil and gas properties, which could materially and adversely affect our results of operations.
the value of our oil and gas properties depends on commodity prices. declines in these prices as well as increases in development costs, changes in well performance, delays in asset development or deterioration of drilling results may result in our having to make material downward adjustments to our estimated proved reserves, and could result in an impairment charge and a corresponding write-down of the carrying amount of our oil and gas properties.
we evaluate our oil and gas properties for impairment on a field-by-field basis whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate a property's carrying amount may not be recoverable. we compare expected undiscounted future cash flows to the net book value of the asset. if the future undiscounted expected cash flows, based on our estimate of future commodity prices, operating costs and anticipated production from proved reserves and risk-adjusted probable and possible reserves, are lower than the net book value of the asset, the capitalized cost is reduced to fair value. commodity pricing is estimated by using a combination of assumptions management uses in its budgeting and forecasting process as well as historical and current prices adjusted for geographical location and quality differentials, as well as other factors that management believes will impact realizable prices. in the event that commodity prices decline, there could be a significant revision to the carrying amounts of oil and gas properties in the future.
our future performance depends on our ability to find or acquire additional oil and natural gas reserves that are economically recoverable.
in general, the production rate of oil and gas properties declines as reserves are depleted, with the rate of decline depending on reservoir characteristics. unless we successfully replace the reserves that we produce, our reserves will decline, eventually resulting in a decrease in oil and natural gas production and lower revenues and cash flow from operations. our future production is, therefore, highly dependent on our level of success in finding or acquiring additional reserves. we may not be able to replace reserves through our exploration, development and exploitation activities or by acquiring properties at acceptable costs. low commodity prices may further limit the kinds of reserves that we can develop and produce economically.
we estimate that production from our proved developed reserves as of december 31, 2021 will decrease at a rate of 24 percent, 17 percent and 13 percent during 2023, 2024 and 2025, respectively (although production from our proved developed reserves is expected to increase during 2022 due to the effects of the merger, partially offset by natural decline rates). future development of proved undeveloped and other reserves that we have not currently classified as proved developed producing will impact these rates of decline.
table of contents exploration, development and exploitation activities involve numerous risks that may result in, among other things, dry holes, the failure to produce oil, natural gas and ngls in commercial quantities and the inability to fully produce discovered reserves.
the development of our proved undeveloped reserves may take longer and may require higher levels of capital expenditures than we currently anticipate.
as of december 31, 2021, approximately 26 percent of our estimated proved reserves (by volume) were undeveloped. these reserve estimates reflect our plans to make capital expenditures for estimated future development costs of $2.1 billion to convert our pud reserves into proved developed reserves. developing pud reserves requires significant capital expenditures, and the estimated future development costs associated with our pud reserves may not equal our actual costs, development may not occur as scheduled and results of our development activities may not be as estimated. if we choose not to develop our pud reserves, or if we are not otherwise able to develop them successfully, we will be required to remove them from our reported proved reserves. in addition, under the sec's reserve reporting rules, because pud reserves generally may be recorded only if they relate to wells scheduled to be drilled within five years of the date of booking, we may be required to remove any pud reserves that are no longer planned to be developed within this five-year time frame.
strategic determinations, including the allocation of capital and other resources to strategic opportunities, are challenging, and our failure to appropriately allocate capital and resources among our strategic opportunities may adversely affect our financial condition and reduce our growth rate.
our future growth prospects depend on our ability to identify optimal strategies for our business. in developing our business plans, we considered allocating capital and other resources to various aspects of our business including well-development (primarily drilling), reserve acquisitions, exploratory activity, corporate items and other alternatives. we also consider our likely sources of capital. notwithstanding the determinations made in the development of our 2022 plan, business opportunities not previously identified periodically may come to our attention, including possible acquisitions and dispositions. if we fail to identify optimal business strategies, or fail to optimize our capital investment and capital raising opportunities and the use of our other resources in furtherance of our business strategies, our financial condition and growth rate may be adversely affected. moreover, economic or other circumstances may change from those contemplated by our 2022 plan, and our failure to recognize or respond to those changes may limit our ability to achieve our objectives.
our ability to sell our oil, natural gas and ngl production and/or the prices we receive for our production could be materially harmed if we fail to obtain adequate services such as transportation and processing.
the sale of our oil, natural gas and ngl production depends on a number of factors beyond our control, including the availability and capacity of transportation and processing facilities. we deliver the majority of our oil, natural gas and ngl production through gathering systems and pipelines that we do not own. the lack of available capacity on these systems and facilities could reduce the price offered for our production or result in the shut-in of producing wells or the delay or discontinuance of development plans for properties. third-party systems and facilities may be unavailable due to market conditions or mechanical or other reasons, and in some cases the resulting curtailments of production could lead to payment being required where we fail to deliver oil, natural gas and ngls to meet minimum volume commitments. in addition, construction of new pipelines and building of required infrastructure may be slow to build out. to the extent these services are unavailable, we would be unable to realize revenue from wells served by such facilities until suitable arrangements are made to market our production. our failure to obtain these services on acceptable terms could materially harm our business.
moreover, these availability and capacity issues are more likely to occur in remote areas with less established infrastructure, such as our delaware basin properties where we have significant oil and natural gas production. any of these availability or capacity issues, whether resulting from the covid-19 pandemic, construction delays, government restrictions, adverse weather conditions (such as the severe winter storm that impacted texas and oklahoma in february 2021), fire or other reasons, could negatively affect our operations, revenues and expenses. in addition, the marcellus shale wells we have drilled to date have generally reported very high initial production rates. the amount of natural gas being produced in the area from these new wells, as well as natural gas produced from other existing wells, may exceed the capacity of the various gathering and intrastate or interstate transportation pipelines currently available. in such an event, this could result in wells being shut in or awaiting a pipeline connection or capacity and/or natural gas being sold at much lower prices than those quoted on nymex or than we currently project, which would adversely affect our results of operations and cash flows.
acquired properties may not be worth what we pay to acquire them, due to uncertainties in evaluating recoverable reserves and other expected benefits, as well as potential liabilities.
successful property acquisitions require an assessment of a number of factors beyond our control. these factors include estimates of recoverable reserves, exploration potential, future commodity prices, operating costs, production taxes and table of contents potential environmental and other liabilities. these assessments are complex and inherently imprecise. our review of the properties we acquire may not reveal all existing or potential problems. in addition, our review may not allow us to assess fully the potential deficiencies of the properties. we do not inspect every well, and even when we inspect a well we may not discover structural, subsurface or environmental problems that may exist or arise.
there may be threatened or contemplated claims against the assets or businesses we acquire related to environmental, title, regulatory, tax, contract, litigation or other matters of which we are unaware, which could materially and adversely affect our production, revenues and results of operations. we often assume certain liabilities, and we may not be entitled to contractual indemnification for pre-closing liabilities, including environmental liabilities, and our contractual indemnification may not be effective. at times, we acquire interests in properties on an "as is" basis with limited representations and warranties and limited remedies for breaches of such representations and warranties. in addition, significant acquisitions can change the nature of our operations and business if the acquired properties have substantially different operating and geological characteristics or are in different geographic locations than our existing properties.
the integration of the businesses and properties we have acquired or may in the future acquire could be difficult, and may divert management's attention away from our existing operations.
the integration of the businesses and properties we have acquired, including via the merger, or may in the future acquire could be difficult, and may divert management's attention and financial resources away from our existing operations. these difficulties include:
•the challenge of integrating the acquired businesses and properties while carrying on the ongoing operations of our business;
•the inability to retain key employees of the acquired business;
•the challenge of inconsistencies in standards, controls, procedures and policies of the acquired business;
•potential unknown liabilities, unforeseen expenses or higher-than-expected integration costs;
•an overall post-completion integration process that takes longer than originally anticipated;
•potential lack of operating experience in a geographic market of the acquired properties; and
•the possibility of faulty assumptions underlying our expectations.
if management is not able to effectively manage the integration process, or if any significant business activities are interrupted as a result of the integration process, our business could suffer. our future success will depend, in part, on our ability to manage our expanded business, which may pose substantial challenges for management. we may also face increased scrutiny from governmental authorities as a result of the increase in the size of our business. there can be no assurances that we will be successful in our integration efforts.
we face a variety of hazards and risks that could cause substantial financial losses.
our business involves a variety of operating risks, including:
•well site blowouts, cratering and explosions;
•equipment failures;
•pipe or cement failures and casing collapses, which can release oil, natural gas, drilling fluids or hydraulic fracturing fluids;
•uncontrolled flows of oil, natural gas or well fluids;
•pipeline ruptures;
•fires;
•formations with abnormal pressures;
•handling and disposal of materials, including drilling fluids and hydraulic fracturing fluids;
•release of toxic gas;

•buildup of naturally occurring radioactive materials;
•pollution and other environmental risks, including conditions caused by previous owners or operators of our properties; and
•natural disasters.
any of these events could result in injury or loss of human life, loss of hydrocarbons, significant damage to or destruction of property, environmental pollution, natural resource damages, regulatory investigations and penalties, suspension or impairment of our operations and substantial losses to us.
our utilization of oil and natural gas gathering and pipeline systems also involves various risks, including the risk of explosions and environmental hazards caused by pipeline leaks and ruptures. the location of pipelines near populated areas, including residential areas, commercial business centers and industrial sites, could increase these risks.
we have limited control over the activities on properties we do not operate.
other companies operate some of the properties in which we have an interest. as of december 31, 2021, non-operated wells represented approximately 68 percent of our total owned gross wells, or 18 percent of our owned net wells. we have limited ability to influence or control the operation or future development of these non-operated properties and on properties we operate in joint ventures in which we may share control with third parties, including compliance with environmental, safety and other regulations or the amount of capital expenditures that we are required to fund with respect to them. the failure of an operator of our wells or joint venture participant to adequately perform operations, an operator's breach of the applicable agreements or an operator's failure to act in ways that are in our best interest could reduce our production and revenues. our dependence on the operator and other working interest owners, including a joint venture participant, for these projects and our limited ability to influence or control the operation and future development of these properties could materially adversely affect the realization of our targeted returns on capital in drilling or acquisition activities and lead to unexpected future costs.
many of our properties are in areas that may have been partially depleted or drained by offset wells and certain of our wells may be adversely affected by actions other operators may take when drilling, completing or operating wells that they own.
many of our properties are in areas that may have been partially depleted or drained by earlier offset drilling. we have no control over offsetting operators, who could take actions, such as drilling and completing additional wells, which could adversely affect our operations. when a new well is completed and produced, the pressure differential in the vicinity of the wellbore causes the migration of reservoir fluids toward the new wellbore (and potentially away from existing wellbores), which could cause a depletion of our proved reserves and may inhibit our ability to further develop our proved reserves. the possibility for these impacts may increase with respect to wells that are shut in as a response to lower commodity prices or the lack of pipeline and storage capacity. in addition, completion operations and other activities conducted on other nearby wells could cause us, in order to protect our existing wells, to shut in production for indefinite periods of time. shutting in our wells and damage to our wells from offset completions could result in increased costs and could adversely affect the reserves and re-commenced production from such shut in wells.
we may lose leases if production is not established within the time periods specified in the leases or if we do not maintain production in paying quantities.
we could lose leases under certain circumstances if we do not maintain production in paying quantities or meet other lease requirements, and the amounts we spent for those leases could be lost. if we shut in wells in response to lower commodity prices or a lack of pipeline and storage capacity, we may face claims that we are not complying with lease provisions. in addition, the biden administration also may impose new restrictions and regulations affecting our ability to drill, conduct hydraulic fracturing operations, and obtain necessary rights-of-way on federal lands, which could, in turn, result in the loss of federal leases. the combined net acreage expiring over the next three years represents approximately one percent of our total net undeveloped acreage as of december 31, 2021. our actual drilling activities may materially differ from those presently identified, which could adversely affect our business.
cyber-attacks targeting our systems, the oil and gas industry systems and infrastructure or the systems of our third-party service providers could adversely affect our business.
our business and the oil and gas industry in general have become increasingly dependent on digital data, computer networks and connected infrastructure, including technologies that are managed by third-party providers on whom we rely to help us collect, host or process information. we depend on this technology to record and store financial data, estimate quantities of oil and natural gas reserves, analyze and share operating data and communicate internally and externally. computers control table of contents nearly all of the oil and gas distribution systems in the u.s., which are necessary to transport our products to market. computers also enable communications and provide a host of other support services for our business. in recent years (and, in large part, due to the covid-19 pandemic), we have increased the use of remote networking and online conferencing services and technologies that enable employees to work outside of our corporate infrastructure, which exposes us to additional cybersecurity risks, including unauthorized access to sensitive information as a result of increased remote access and other cybersecurity related incidents.
cyber-attacks are becoming more sophisticated and include, but are not limited to, malicious software, phishing, ransomware, attempts to gain unauthorized access to data and other electronic security breaches that could lead to disruptions in critical systems, unauthorized release of confidential or otherwise protected information and corruption of data. unauthorized access to our seismic data, reserves information, customer or employee data or other proprietary or commercially sensitive information could lead to data corruption, communication interruption or other disruptions in our exploration or production operations or planned business transactions, any of which could have a material adverse impact on our business and operations. if our information technology systems cease to function properly or are breached, we could suffer disruptions to our normal operations, which may include drilling, completion, production and corporate functions. a cyber-attack involving our information systems and related infrastructure, or that of our business associates, could result in supply chain disruptions that delay or prevent the transportation and marketing of our production, non-compliance leading to regulatory fines or penalties, loss or disclosure of, or damage to, our or any of our customer's or supplier's data or confidential information that could harm our business by damaging our reputation, subjecting us to potential financial or legal liability and requiring us to incur significant costs, including costs to repair or restore our systems and data or to take other remedial steps.
in addition, certain cyber incidents, such as surveillance, may remain undetected for an extended period, and our systems and insurance coverage for protecting against such cybersecurity risks may be costly and may not be sufficient. as cyber-attackers become more sophisticated, we may be required to expend significant additional resources to continue to protect our business or remediate the damage from cyber-attacks. furthermore, the continuing and evolving threat of cyber-attacks has resulted in increased regulatory focus on prevention, and we may be required to expend significant additional resources to continue to modify or enhance our protective measures or to investigate and remediate any information security vulnerabilities. to the extent we face increased regulatory requirements, we may be required to expend significant additional resources to meet such requirements.
risks related to our indebtedness, hedging activities and financial position we have substantial capital requirements, and we may not be able to obtain needed financing on satisfactory terms, if at all.
we make and expect to make substantial capital expenditures in connection with our development and production projects. we rely on access to both our revolving credit facility and longer-term capital markets as sources of liquidity for any capital requirements not satisfied by cash flow from operations or other sources. future challenges in the global financial system, including the capital markets, may adversely affect our business, financial condition and access to capital. our ability to access the capital markets may be restricted at a time when we desire, or need, to raise capital, which could have an impact on our flexibility to react to changing economic and business conditions. adverse economic and market conditions could adversely affect the collectability of our trade receivables and cause our commodity hedging counterparties to be unable to perform their obligations or to seek bankruptcy protection. in addition, there have been efforts in recent years aimed at the investment community, including investment advisors, sovereign wealth funds, public pension funds, universities and other groups, promoting the divestment of fossil fuel equities as well as to pressure lenders and other financial services companies to limit or curtail activities with companies engaged in the extraction of fossil fuel reserves, which, if successful, could limit our ability to access capital markets. for example, in october 2020, jp morgan chase & co. announced that it was adopting a financing commitment that is aligned to the goals of the paris climate accord of 2015 (the "paris agreement"). other banks have made climate-related pledges for various causes, such as stopping the financing of arctic drilling and coal companies. these initiatives by activists and banks, including certain banks who are parties to the credit agreement providing for our revolving credit facility, could interfere with our business activities, operations and ability to access capital. future challenges in the economy could also lead to reduced demand for oil and natural gas, which could have a negative impact on our revenues.
table of contents risks associated with our debt and the provisions of our debt agreements could adversely affect our business, financial position and results of operations.
as of december 31, 2021, we had approximately $3.1 billion of debt outstanding (with a principal amount of $2.9 billion) and we may incur additional indebtedness in the future. following the merger, our legacy revolving credit facility and private placement senior notes remained outstanding. in addition, on october 7, 2021, we completed an exchange offer, whereby we issued $1.8 billion in aggregate principal amount of new senior notes in exchange for $1.8 billion in aggregate principal amount of previously outstanding cimarex senior notes. following completion of that exchange offer, approximately $200 million in aggregate principal amount of cimarex senior notes remained outstanding. the increase in our indebtedness as a result of the merger and related transactions could have adverse effects on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows, including by:
•requiring us to use a substantial portion of our cash flow to make debt service payments, which will reduce the funds that would otherwise be available for operations, returning free cash flow to stockholders and future business opportunities;
•increasing the risk of default on debt obligations;
•limiting our ability to sell assets, engage in strategic transactions or obtain additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures, general corporate and other purposes;
•limiting our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in our business and the industry in which we operate, which could place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors with lower debt-service obligations;
•increasing our exposure to a rise in interest rates, which would generate greater interest expense to the extent we do not have applicable interest rate fluctuation hedges;
•depending on the levels of our outstanding debt, limit our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures, general corporate and other purposes; and
•increasing our vulnerability to adverse changes in general economic and industry conditions, including declines in commodity prices, economic downturns and adverse developments in our business.
our ability to make payments on and to refinance our indebtedness will depend on our ability to generate cash in the future from operations, financings or asset sales. our ability to generate cash is subject to general economic, financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control. in addition, our ability to withstand competitive pressures and to react to changes in the oil and gas industries could be impaired. if we fail to make required payments or otherwise default on our debt, the lenders who hold such debt also could accelerate amounts due, which could potentially trigger a default or acceleration of other debt.
in addition, the margins we pay under our revolving credit facility depend on (1) the credit rating of our debt, at times when our debt has an investment grade credit rating and (2) our leverage ratio, at times when our debt does not have an investment grade rating. accordingly, adverse changes in our leverage ratio or the credit rating of our debt may result in an increase in our interest expense.
our debt agreements also require compliance with covenants to maintain specified financial ratios. if commodity prices deteriorate from current levels, it could lead to reduced revenues, cash flow and earnings, which in turn could lead to a default due to lack of covenant compliance. because the calculations of the financial ratios are made as of certain dates, the financial ratios can fluctuate significantly from period to period. a prolonged period of lower commodity prices could further increase the risk of our inability to comply with covenants to maintain specified financial ratios. in order to provide a margin of comfort with regard to these financial covenants, we may seek to reduce our capital expenditures, sell non-strategic assets or opportunistically modify or increase our derivative instruments to the extent permitted under our debt agreements. in addition, we may seek to refinance or restructure all or a portion of our indebtedness. we cannot provide assurance that we will be able to successfully execute any of these strategies, and such strategies may be unavailable on favorable terms or at all. for more information about our debt agreements, please read "management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations-financial condition-capital resources and liquidity."
we may have hedging arrangements that expose us to risk of financial loss and limit the benefit to us of increases in prices for oil and natural gas.
from time to time, when we believe that market conditions are favorable, we use financial derivative instruments to manage price risk associated with our oil and natural gas production. while there are many different types of derivatives table of contents available, we generally utilize collar, swap, roll differential swap and basis swap agreements to manage price risk more effectively. in addition, to mitigate a portion of its exposure to changes in commodity prices, cimarex historically hedged oil and natural gas prices from time to time, primarily through the use of certain derivative instruments. upon completion of the merger, we assumed cimarex's existing hedges, such that we will now bear the economic impact of those hedges.
the collar arrangements are put and call options used to establish floor and ceiling prices for a fixed volume of production during a certain time period. they provide for payments to counterparties if the index price exceeds the ceiling and payments from the counterparties if the index price falls below the floor. the swap agreements call for payments to, or receipts from, counterparties based on whether the index price for the period is greater or less than the fixed price established for that period when the swap is put in place. these arrangements limit the benefit to us of increases in prices. in addition, these arrangements expose us to risks of financial loss in a variety of circumstances, including when:
•there is an adverse change in the expected differential between the underlying price in the derivative instrument and actual prices received for our production;
•production is less than expected; or
•a counterparty is unable to satisfy its obligations.
the cftc has promulgated regulations to implement statutory requirements for swap transactions. these regulations are intended to implement a regulated market in which most swaps are executed on registered exchanges or swap execution facilities and cleared through central counterparties. although we believe that our use of swap transactions exempt us from certain regulatory requirements, the changes to the swap market due to increased regulation could significantly increase the cost of entering into new swaps or maintaining existing swaps, materially alter the terms of new or existing swap transactions and/or reduce the availability of new or existing swaps. if we reduce our use of swaps as a result of the dodd-frank wall street reform and consumer protection act and implementing regulations thereunder, our results of operations may become more volatile and our cash flows may be less predictable.
in addition, the use of financial derivative instruments involves the risk that the counterparties will be unable to meet the financial terms of such transactions. we are unable to predict changes in a counterparty's creditworthiness or ability to perform, and even if we could predict such changes accurately, our ability to negate such risk may be limited depending on market conditions and the contractual terms of the instruments. if any of our counterparties were to default on its obligations under our financial derivative instruments, such a default could (1) have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, (2) result in a larger percentage of our future production being subject to commodity price changes and (3) increase the likelihood that our financial derivative instruments may not achieve their intended strategic purposes.
we will continue to evaluate the benefit of utilizing derivatives in the future. please read "management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations" in item 7 and "quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk" in item 7a for further discussion concerning our use of derivatives.
legal, regulatory and governmental risks esg concerns or negative public perception regarding us and/or our industry could have an adverse effect on our business operations and the price of our common stock.
businesses across all industries are facing increasing scrutiny from investors, stockholders and the public related to their esg practices. failure, or a perceived failure, to adequately respond to or meet evolving investor, stockholder or public esg expectations, concerns and standards may cause a business entity to suffer reputational damage and materially and adversely affect the entity's business, financial condition, and/or stock price. in addition, organizations that provide esg information to investors have developed ratings processes for evaluating a business entity's approach to esg matters. although currently no universal rating standards exist, the importance of sustainability evaluations is becoming more broadly accepted by investors and stockholders, with some using these ratings to inform investment and voting decisions. additionally, certain investors use these scores to benchmark businesses against their peers and, if a business entity is perceived as lagging, these investors may engage with the entity to require improved esg disclosure or performance. moreover, certain members of the broader investment community may consider a business entity's sustainability score as a reputational or other factor in making an investment decision. consequently, a low sustainability score could result in exclusion of our common stock from consideration by certain investment funds, engagement by investors seeking to improve such scores and a negative perception of our operations by certain investors.
further, negative public perception regarding us and/or our industry resulting from, among other things, concerns raised by advocacy groups about climate change impacts of methane and other greenhouse gas emissions, hydraulic fracturing, oil table of contents spills, and pipeline explosions coupled with increasing societal expectations on businesses to address climate change and potential consumer use of substitutes to carbon-intensive energy commodities may result in increased costs, reduced demand for our oil, natural gas and ngl production, reduced profits, increased regulation, regulatory investigations and litigation, and negative impacts on our stock price and access to capital markets. these factors could also cause the permits we need to conduct our operations to be challenged, withheld, delayed, or burdened by requirements that restrict our ability to profitably conduct our business.
federal, state and local laws and regulations, judicial actions and regulatory initiatives related to oil and gas development and the use of hydraulic fracturing could result in increased costs and operating restrictions or delays and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
our operations are subject to extensive federal, state and local laws and regulations, including drilling and environmental and safety laws and regulations, which increase the cost of planning, designing, drilling, installing and operating oil and natural gas facilities. new laws and regulations or revisions or reinterpretations of existing laws and regulations could further increase these costs, could increase our liability risks, and could result in increased restrictions on oil and gas production activities, which could have a material adverse effect on us and the oil and gas industry as a whole. risk of substantial costs and liabilities related to environmental and safety matters in particular, including compliance issues, environmental contamination and claims for damages to persons or property, are inherent in oil and natural gas operations. failure to comply with applicable environmental and safety laws and regulations also may result in the suspension or termination of our operations and subject us to administrative, civil and criminal penalties as well as the imposition of corrective action requirements and orders. in addition, applicable laws and regulations require us to obtain many permits for the operation of various facilities. the issuance of required permits is not guaranteed and, once issued, permits are subject to revocation, modification and renewal. failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations can result in fines and penalties or require us to incur substantial costs to remedy violations.
most of our exploration and production operations depend on the use of hydraulic fracturing to enhance production from oil and gas wells. this technology involves the injection of fluids-usually consisting mostly of water but typically including small amounts of several chemical additives-as well as sand or other proppants into a well under high pressure in order to create fractures in the rock that allow oil or gas to flow more freely to the wellbore. most of our wells would not be economical without the use of hydraulic fracturing to stimulate production from the well. if existing laws and regulations with regard to hydraulic fracturing are revised or reinterpreted or if new laws and regulations become applicable to our operations through judicial or administrative actions, our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected. further, state and federal regulatory agencies have focused on a possible connection between the operation of injection wells used for oil and gas waste disposal and seismic activity in recent years. similar concerns have been raised that hydraulic fracturing may also contribute to seismic activity. when caused by human activity, such events are called induced seismicity. in march 2016, the u.s. geological survey identified six states with the most significant hazards from induced seismicity, including oklahoma, kansas, texas, colorado, new mexico, and arkansas. these concerns have further increased regulatory scrutiny on hydraulic fracturing as well as oil and gas waste injection wells and led to the adoption of state and local laws regulating such activities. we cannot predict whether additional federal, state or local laws or regulations applicable to hydraulic fracturing or oil and gas waste injection wells will be enacted in the future and, if so, what actions any such laws or regulations would require or prohibit. these concerns also could lead to greater opposition to, and litigation concerning, oil and gas activities utilizing hydraulic fracturing or injection wells for waste disposal, which could have an adverse effect on oil and natural gas production activities, including operational delays or increased operating costs in the production of oil and natural gas from developing shale plays, or could make it more difficult to perform hydraulic fracturing. in addition, if existing laws and regulations with regard to hydraulic fracturing are revised or reinterpreted or if new laws and regulations become applicable to our operations through judicial or administrative actions, our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected.
some of our producing wells and associated facilities are subject to restrictive air emission limitations and permitting requirements. two examples are the epa's source aggregation rule and the epa's new source performance standards ("nsps") and national emission standards for hazardous air pollutants ("neshap"). in june 2016, the epa published a final rule concerning aggregation of sources that affects source determinations for air permitting in the oil and gas industry, and, as a result, aggregating our oil and gas facilities for permitting could result in more complex, costly, and time-consuming air permitting and cause delays in our operations. in august 2012 and june 2016, the epa published rules establishing new air emission control requirements for the oil and natural gas sector, including nsps to address emissions of sulfur dioxide and volatile organic compounds and to regulate methane emissions for new and modified sources in the oil and gas industry, and neshap to address hazardous air pollutants frequently associated with gas production and processing activities. although these rules were stayed and ultimately carved back by a september 2020 epa rule, on june 30, 2021, president biden signed into law a joint congressional resolution under the congressional review act disapproving the september 2020 rule. on november 15, 2021, the epa proposed rules to reduce methane emissions from both new and existing oil and natural gas table of contents industry sources. compliance with the 2012 and 2016 nsps for the oil and gas sector and any additional requirements imposed by new epa regulations, particularly a new methane regulation, may require modifications to certain of our operations or increase the cost of new or modified facilities, including the installation of new equipment to control emissions at the well site, which could result in significant costs, including increased capital expenditures and operating costs, and adversely impact our business.

oil and natural gas production operations, especially those using hydraulic fracturing, are substantially dependent on the availability of water. our ability to produce oil and natural gas economically and in commercial quantities could be impaired if we are unable to acquire adequate supplies of water for our operations or are unable to dispose of or recycle the water we use economically and in an environmentally safe manner.
water is an essential component of oil and natural gas production during the drilling process. in particular, we use a significant amount of water in the hydraulic fracturing process. our inability to locate sufficient amounts of water, or dispose of or recycle water used in our exploration and production operations, could adversely impact our operations. for water sourcing, we first seek to use non-potable water supplies for our operational needs. in certain areas, there may be insufficient local aquifer capacity to provide a source of water for drilling activities. water must then be obtained from other sources and transported to the drilling site. an inability to secure sufficient amounts of water or to dispose of or recycle the water used in our operations could adversely impact our operations in certain areas. compliance with environmental regulations and permit requirements governing the withdrawal, storage and use of surface water or groundwater necessary for hydraulic fracturing of wells may increase our operating costs and cause delays, interruptions or termination of our operations, the extent of which cannot be predicted, all of which could have an adverse effect on our operations and financial condition.
for additional information, please read "business and properties-other business matters-environmental and safety regulations-clean water act" in items 1 and 2.
the adoption of climate change legislation or regulations restricting emission of greenhouse gases could result in increased operating costs and reduced demand for the oil and gas we produce.
studies have found that emission of certain gases, commonly referred to as greenhouse gases ("ghg"), impact the earth's climate. the u.s. congress and various states have been evaluating, and in some cases implementing, climate-related legislation and other regulatory initiatives that restrict emissions of ghgs. in the absence of significant federal ghg legislation, a number of state and regional efforts have emerged, aimed at tracking and/or reducing ghg emissions through cap-and-trade programs, which typically require major sources of ghg emissions, such as electric power plants, to acquire and surrender emission allowances in return for emitting ghgs. on january 20, 2021, his first day in office, president biden signed an executive order on climate action and reconvened an interagency working group to establish social costs of three ghgs: carbon dioxide, nitrous oxide, and methane. carbon dioxide is released during the combustion of fossil fuels, including oil, natural gas, and ngls, and methane is a primary component of natural gas. the biden administration stated it will use updated social cost figures to inform federal regulations and major agency actions and to justify aggressive climate action as the u.s. moves toward a "100% clean energy" economy with net-zero ghg emissions. these actions as well as any future laws or regulations that regulate or limit emissions of ghgs from our equipment and operations could require us to both develop and implement new practices aimed at reducing ghg emissions, such as emissions control technologies, and monitor and report ghg emissions associated with our operations, any of which could increase our operating costs and could adversely affect demand for the oil and gas that we produce. at this time, it is not possible to quantify the impact of such future laws and regulations on our business.
for additional information, please read "business and properties-other business matters-environmental and safety regulations-greenhouse gas and climate change laws and regulations" in items 1 and 2.
we are subject to various climate-related risks.
the following is a summary of potential climate-related risks that could adversely affect us:
transition risks. transition risks are related to the transition to a lower-carbon economy and include policy and legal, technology, and market risks.
policy and legal risks. policy risks include actions that seek to lessen activities that contribute to adverse effects of climate change or to promote adaptation to climate change. these policy actions potentially could be accelerated with a table of contents democratic party in control of congress and the presidency. examples of policy actions that would increase the costs of our operations or lower demand for our oil and gas include implementing carbon-pricing mechanisms, shifting energy use toward lower emission sources, adopting energy-efficiency solutions, encouraging greater water efficiency measures, and promoting more sustainable land-use practices. policy actions also may include restrictions or bans on oil and gas activities, which could lead to write-downs or impairments of our assets. legal risks include potential lawsuits claiming failure to mitigate impacts of climate change, failure to adapt to climate change, and the insufficiency of disclosure around material financial risks.
furthermore, we also could also face an increased risk of climate‐related litigation or "greenwashing" suits with respect to our operations, disclosures, or products. claims have been made against certain energy companies alleging that ghg emissions from oil, gas and ngl operations constitute a public nuisance under federal and state law. private individuals or public entities also could attempt to enforce environmental laws and regulations against us and could seek personal injury and property damages or other remedies. additionally, governments and private parties are also increasingly filing suits, or initiating regulatory action, based on allegations that certain public statements regarding esg-related matters by companies are false and misleading "greenwashing" campaigns that violate deceptive trade practices and consumer protection statutes or that climate-related disclosures made by companies are inadequate. similar issues can also arise when aspirational statements such as net-zero or carbon neutrality targets are made without clear plans. although we are not a party to any such climate-related or "greenwashing" litigation currently, unfavorable rulings against us in any such case brought against us in the future could significantly impact our operations and could have an adverse impact on our financial condition.
technology risks. technological improvements or innovations that support the transition to a lower-carbon, more energy efficient economic system may have a significant impact on us. the development and use of emerging technologies in renewable energy, battery storage, and energy efficiency may lower demand for oil and gas, resulting in lower prices and revenues, and higher costs. in addition, many automobile manufacturers have announced plans to shift production from internal combustion engine to electric powered vehicles, and states and foreign countries have announced bans on sales of internal combustion engine vehicles beginning as early as 2025, which would reduce demand for oil.
market risks. markets could be affected by climate change through shifts in supply and demand for certain commodities, especially carbon-intensive commodities such as oil and gas and other products dependent on oil and gas. lower demand for our oil and gas production could result in lower prices and lower revenues. market risk also may take the form of limited access to capital as investors shift investments to less carbon-intensive industries and alternative energy industries. in addition, investment advisers, banks, and certain sovereign wealth, pension, and endowment funds recently have been promoting divestment of investments in fossil fuel companies and pressuring lenders to limit funding to companies engaged in the extraction, production, and sale of oil and gas. for additional information, please read "-risks related to our indebtedness, hedging activities and financial position-we have substantial capital requirements, and we may not be able to obtain needed financing on satisfactory terms, if at all" in this item.
reputation risk. climate change is a potential source of reputational risk, which is tied to changing customer or community perceptions of an organization's contribution to, or detraction from, the transition to a lower-carbon economy. for additional information, please read "-esg concerns or negative public perception regarding us and/or our industry could have an adverse effect on our business operations and the price of our common stock."
physical risks. potential physical risks resulting from climate change may be event driven (including increased severity of extreme weather events, such as hurricanes, droughts, or floods) or may be driven by longer-term shifts in climate patterns that may cause sea level rise or chronic heat waves. potential physical risks may cause direct damage to assets and indirect impacts, such as supply chain disruption, and also could include changes in water availability, sourcing, and quality, which could impact drilling and completion operations. these physical risks could cause increased costs, production disruptions, lower revenues and substantially increase the cost or limit the availability of insurance.
we are subject to a number of privacy and data protection laws, rules and directives (collectively, data protection laws) relating to the processing of personal data.
the regulatory environment surrounding data protection laws is uncertain. complying with varying jurisdictional requirements could increase the costs and complexity of compliance, and violations of applicable data protection laws can result in significant penalties. a determination that there have been violations of applicable data protection laws could expose us to significant damage awards, fines and other penalties that could materially harm our business and reputation.
any failure, or perceived failure, by us to comply with applicable data protection laws could result in proceedings or actions against us by governmental entities or others, subject us to significant fines, penalties, judgments and negative publicity, require us to change our business practices, increase the costs and complexity of compliance and adversely affect our business. as noted above, we are also subject to the possibility of security and privacy breaches, which themselves may result in a table of contents violation of these laws. additionally, the acquisition of a company that is not in compliance with applicable data protection laws may result in a violation of these laws.
tax law changes could have an adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.
substantive changes to existing federal income tax laws have been proposed that, if adopted, would repeal many tax incentives and deductions that are currently used by u.s. oil and gas companies and would impose new taxes. the proposals include: repeal of the percentage depletion allowance for oil and gas properties; elimination of the ability to fully deduct intangible drilling costs in the year incurred; and increase in the geological and geophysical amortization period for independent producers. additional proposed general tax law changes include raising tax rates on both domestic and foreign income and imposing a new alternative minimum tax on book income. further, many states are currently in deficits, and have been enacting laws eliminating or limiting certain deductions, carryforwards and credits in order to increase tax revenue.
should the u.s. or the states pass tax legislation limiting any currently allowed tax incentives and deductions, our taxes would increase, potentially significantly, which would have a negative impact on our net income and cash flows. this could also reduce our drilling activities in the u.s. since future changes to federal and state tax legislation and regulations are unknown, we cannot predict the ultimate impact such changes may have on our business.
additional risks related to the merger the merger may result in a loss of customers, distributors, service providers, suppliers, vendors, joint venture participants and other business counterparties and may result in the termination of existing contracts.
as a result of the merger, some of our and cimarex's legacy customers, distributors, service providers, suppliers, vendors, joint venture participants and other business counterparties may terminate or scale back their current or prospective business relationships with the combined business. if relationships with customers, distributors, service providers, suppliers, vendors, joint venture participants and other business counterparties are adversely affected by the merger, our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected.
we may fail to realize all of the anticipated benefits of the merger.
the long-term success of the merger will depend, in part, on our ability to realize the anticipated benefits and cost savings from combining our two businesses and operational synergies. the anticipated benefits and cost savings of the merger may not be realized fully or at all, may take longer to realize than expected, may not be realized or could have other adverse effects that we do not currently foresee. some of the assumptions that we have made, such as the achievement of the anticipated benefits related to the geographic, commodity and asset diversification and the expected size, scale, inventory and financial strength of the combined business, may not be realized. in addition, there could be potential unknown liabilities and unforeseen expenses associated with the merger that could adversely impact us.
the market price of our common stock may fluctuate for various reasons and may decline if large amounts of our common stock are sold following the merger.
the market price of our common stock may fluctuate significantly in the future and holders of our common stock could lose some or all of the value of their investment. as a result of the merger, we issued approximately 408.2 million shares of our common stock to former cimarex stockholders (excluding shares that were awarded in replacement of previously outstanding cimarex restricted share awards). the merger agreement contained no restrictions on the ability of former cimarex stockholders or our historic stockholders to sell or otherwise dispose of shares of our common stock. former cimarex stockholders may decide not to hold the shares of our common stock that they received in the merger, and our historic stockholders may decide to reduce their investment in us as a result of the changes to our investment profile as a result of the merger. these sales of our common stock (or the perception that these sales may occur) could have the effect of depressing the market price for our common stock. in addition, with the completion of the merger, our financial position is different from our financial position before the completion of the merger, and our future results of operations and cash flows will be affected by factors different from those that previously affected our results of operations and cash flows, all of which could adversely affect the market price of our common stock. furthermore, the stock market has experienced significant price and volume fluctuations in recent times which, if they continue to occur, could have a material adverse effect on the market for, or liquidity of, our common stock, regardless of our actual operating performance.
our ability to utilize cimarex's historic net operating loss carryforwards and other tax attributes may be limited.
on october 1, 2021, we completed the merger, and as a result, we acquired cimarex's u.s. federal net operating loss carryforwards ("nols") and other tax attributes. our ability to utilize these nols and other tax attributes to reduce future taxable income depends on many factors, including future income, which cannot be assured. section 382 of the internal table of contents revenue code of 1986, as amended ("section 382"), generally imposes an annual limitation on the amount of nols and other tax attributes that may be used to offset taxable income when a corporation has undergone an "ownership change" (as determined under section 382). an ownership change generally occurs if one or more stockholders (or groups of stockholders) who are each deemed to own at least 5 percent of such corporation's stock increase their ownership by more than 50 percentage points over their lowest ownership percentage within a rolling three-year period.
as a result of the merger, an ownership change occurred with respect to cimarex under section 382, which triggered a limitation on our ability to utilize cimarex's historic nols and other tax attributes and could cause some of those nols and other tax attributes to expire unutilized. this annual limitation under section 382 is determined by multiplying (1) the fair market value of cimarex's stock at the time of the merger by (2) the long-term tax exempt rate published by the internal revenue service for the month in which the merger occurred, subject to certain adjustments (provided that any unused annual limitation may be carried over to later years). in addition, the nols cimarex acquired in 2019 as part of its acquisition of resolute energy corporation are already subject to a section 382 limitation.
see note 10 of the notes to consolidated financial statements, "income taxes," included in item 8 for more information regarding cimarex's historic nol carryforwards and the section 382 limitation.
risks related to our corporate structure provisions of delaware law and our bylaws and charter could discourage change-in-control transactions and prevent stockholders from receiving a premium on their investment.
our charter authorizes our board of directors to set the terms of preferred stock. in addition, delaware law contains provisions that impose restrictions on business combinations with interested parties. our bylaws prohibit the calling of a special meeting by our stockholders and place procedural requirements and limitations on stockholder proposals at meetings of stockholders. because of these provisions of our charter, bylaws and delaware law, persons considering unsolicited tender offers or other unilateral takeover proposals may be more likely to negotiate with our board of directors rather than pursue non-negotiated takeover attempts. as a result, these provisions may make it more difficult for our stockholders to benefit from transactions that are opposed by an incumbent board of directors.
the personal liability of our directors for monetary damages for breach of their fiduciary duty of care is limited by the delaware general corporation law and by our charter.
the delaware general corporation law allows corporations to limit available relief for the breach of directors' duty of care to equitable remedies such as injunction or rescission. our charter limits the liability of our directors to the fullest extent permitted by delaware law. specifically, our directors will not be personally liable for monetary damages for any breach of their fiduciary duty as a director, except for liability:
•for any breach of their duty of loyalty to the company or our stockholders;
•for acts or omissions not in good faith or that involve intentional misconduct or a knowing violation of law;
•under provisions relating to unlawful payments of dividends or unlawful stock repurchases or redemptions; and
•for any transaction from which the director derived an improper personal benefit.
this limitation may have the effect of reducing the likelihood of derivative litigation against directors, and may discourage or deter stockholders or management from bringing a lawsuit against directors for breach of their duty of care, even though such an action, if successful, might otherwise have benefited our stockholders.
the exclusive-forum provision contained in our bylaws could limit our stockholders' ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us or our directors, officers or other employees.
our bylaws provide that, unless we consent in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, the sole and exclusive forum for (1) any derivative action or proceeding brought on behalf of us, (2) any action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any current or former director, officer, other employee or agent of coterra to coterra or our stockholders, including a claim alleging the aiding and abetting of such a breach of fiduciary duty, (3) any action asserting a claim arising pursuant to any provision of the delaware general corporation law or our bylaws or charter or (4) any action asserting a claim governed by the internal affairs doctrine or asserting an "internal corporate claim" shall, to the fullest extent permitted by law, be the court of chancery of the state of delaware (or, if the court of chancery does not have jurisdiction, the u.s. federal district court for the district of delaware).
table of contents to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, this exclusive-forum provision applies to state and federal law claims, including claims under the federal securities laws, including the securities act of 1933, as amended (the "securities act"), and the securities exchange act of 1934, as amended (the "exchange act"), although our stockholders will not be deemed to have waived our compliance with the federal securities laws and the rules and regulations thereunder. this exclusive-forum provision may limit the ability of a stockholder to bring a claim in a judicial forum of its choosing for disputes with us or our directors, officers or other employees, which may discourage lawsuits against us and our directors, officers and other employees. alternatively, if a court were to find this exclusive-forum provision inapplicable to, or unenforceable in respect of, one or more of the specified types of actions or proceedings described above, we may incur additional costs associated with resolving such matters in other jurisdictions, which could negatively affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. in addition, stockholders who do bring a claim in a state or federal court located within the state of delaware could face additional litigation costs in pursuing any such claim, particularly if they do not reside in or near delaware. in addition, the court located in the state of delaware may reach different judgments or results than would other courts, including courts where a stockholder would otherwise choose to bring the action, and such judgments or results may be more favorable to us than to our stockholders.
general risk factors the loss of key personnel could adversely affect our ability to operate.
our operations depend on a relatively small group of key management and technical personnel, and one or more of these individuals could leave our employment. the change in control and severance benefits triggered by the merger may provide incentive for key management and technical personnel to leave our company. the unexpected loss of the services of one or more of these individuals could have a detrimental effect on us. in addition, our drilling success and the success of other activities integral to our operations will depend, in part, on our ability to attract and retain experienced geologists, engineers and other professionals. competition for experienced geologists, engineers and some other professionals is extremely intense and can be exacerbated following a downturn in which talented professionals leave the industry or when potential new entrants to the industry decide not to undertake the professional training to enter the industry. this has occurred as a result of the downturn in commodity prices in 2020 and previous downturns and as a result of initiatives to move from oil and gas to alternative energy sources. if we cannot retain our technical personnel or attract additional experienced technical personnel, our ability to compete could be harmed.
we may not be insured against all of the operating risks to which we are exposed.
we maintain insurance against some, but not all, operating risks and losses. we do not carry business interruption insurance. in addition, pollution and environmental risks generally are not fully insurable. the occurrence of an event not fully covered by insurance could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows. the cost of insurance may increase, and the availability of insurance may decrease, as a result of climate change or other factors.
competition in our industry is intense, and many of our competitors have substantially greater financial and technological resources than we do, which could adversely affect our competitive position.
competition in the oil and natural gas industry is intense. major and independent oil and natural gas companies actively bid for desirable oil and gas properties, as well as for the capital, equipment, labor and infrastructure required to operate and develop these properties. our competitive position is affected by price, contract terms and quality of service, including pipeline connection times, distribution efficiencies and reliable delivery record. many of our competitors have financial and technological resources and exploration and development budgets that are substantially greater than ours. these companies may be able to pay more for exploratory projects and productive oil and gas properties and may be able to define, evaluate, bid for and purchase a greater number of properties and prospects than our financial or human resources permit. in addition, these companies may be able to expend greater resources on the existing and changing technologies that we believe will be increasingly important to attaining success in the industry. these companies may also have a greater ability to continue drilling activities during periods of low oil and natural gas prices and to absorb the burden of current and future governmental regulations and taxation.
further, driven in part by reduced commodity prices related to the global covid-19 pandemic, certain of our competitors may engage in bankruptcy proceedings, debt refinancing transactions, management changes or other strategic initiatives in an attempt to reduce operating costs to maintain a position in the market. this could result in such competitors emerging with stronger or healthier balance sheets and in turn an improved ability to compete with us in the future. we have seen and may continue to see corporate consolidations among our competitors, which could significantly alter industry conditions and competition within the industry.
table of contents because our activity is concentrated in areas of heavy industry competition, there is heightened demand for equipment, power, services, facilities and resources, resulting in higher costs than in other areas. such intense competition also could result in delays in securing, or the inability to secure, the equipment, power, services, resources or facilities necessary for our development activities, which could negatively impact our production volumes. in remote areas, vendors also can charge higher rates due to the inability to attract employees to those areas and the vendors' ability to deploy their resources in easier-to-access areas.
the declaration, payment and amounts of future dividends distributed to our stockholders will be uncertain.
although we have paid cash dividends on shares of common stock in the past, our board of directors may determine not to declare dividends in the future or may reduce the amount of dividends paid in the future. decisions on whether, when and in which amounts to declare and pay any future dividends will remain in the discretion of our board of directors. any dividend payment amounts will be determined by our board of directors on a quarterly basis, and it is possible that our board of directors may increase or decrease the amount of dividends paid in the future, or determine not to declare dividends in the future, at any time and for any reason. we expect that any such decisions will depend on our financial condition, results of operations, cash balances, cash requirements, future prospects, the outlook for commodity prices and other considerations that our board of directors deems relevant, including, but not limited to:
•whether we have enough cash to pay such dividends due to our cash requirements, capital spending plans, cash flows or financial position;

overview cimarex merger on october 1, 2021, we and cimarex completed the merger. cimarex is an oil and gas exploration and production company with operations in texas, new mexico and oklahoma. under the terms of the merger agreement and subject to certain exceptions specified therein, each eligible share of cimarex common stock was converted into the right to receive 4.0146 shares of our common stock. as a result of the completion of the merger, we issued approximately 408.2 million shares of common stock to cimarex stockholders (excluding shares that were awarded in replacement of previously outstanding cimarex restricted share awards). additionally on october 1, 2021, we changed our name to coterra energy inc.
certain financial and operational information set forth herein does not include the activity of cimarex for periods prior to the closing of the merger.
financial and operating overview financial and operating results for the year ended december 31, 2021 compared to the year ended december 31, 2020 are as follows:
•natural gas production increased 53.4 bcf, or six percent, from 857.7 bcf in 2020 to 911.1 bcf in 2021. the slight increase was attributable to production during the fourth quarter of 2021 from properties acquired in the merger, which significantly expanded our operations, partially offset by the timing of our drilling and completion activities in the marcellus shale in 2021.
•oil production increased 8 mmbbl from prior year. the increase was attributable to production during the fourth quarter of 2021 from properties acquired in the merger.
•ngl production increased 7 mmbbl from prior year. the increase was attributable to production during the fourth quarter of 2021 from properties acquired in the merger.
•average realized natural gas price for 2021 was $2.73 per mcf, 63 percent higher than the $1.68 per mcf price realized in 2020.
•average realized oil and ngl prices for 2021 were $60.35 and $34.18 per bbl, respectively.
•total capital expenditures were $725 million in 2021 compared to $570 million in 2020. the increase in capital expenditures was attributable to expanded drilling and completion activities during the fourth quarter of 2021 as a result of the merger.
•drilled 114 gross wells (99.9 net) with a success rate of 100 percent in 2021 compared to 74 gross wells (64.3 net) with a success rate of 100 percent in 2020.
•completed 132 gross wells (108.3 net) in 2021 compared to 86 gross wells (77.3 net) in 2020.
•average rig count during 2021 was approximately 2.5 rigs in the marcellus compared to an average rig count of approximately 2.3 rigs during 2020. rig count since the merger averaged 5.3 and zero rigs in the permian basin and anadarko basin, respectively.

•repaid $88 million of our 5.58% weighted-average private placement senior notes, which matured in january 2021, and $100 million of our 3.65% weighted-average private placement senior notes, which matured in september 2021.
•paid dividends of $1.12 per share, including $0.445 per share for regular quarterly dividends, a special common stock dividend of $0.50 per share in october 2021 after the completion of the merger and a variable common stock dividend of $0.175 per share in november 2021.
impact of the covid-19 pandemic the ongoing covid-19 outbreak has caused widespread illness and significant loss of life, leading governments across the world to impose severely stringent limitations on movement and human interaction. we have implemented preventative measures and developed response plans intended to minimize unnecessary risk of exposure and prevent infection among our employees and the communities in which we operate. beginning in march 2020, we modified certain business practices (including those related to nonoperational employee work locations and the cancellation of physical participation in a number of meetings, events and conferences) to conform to government restrictions and best practices encouraged by the centers for disease control and prevention, the who and other governmental and regulatory authorities. in addition, we implemented and provided training on a covid-19 safety policy containing personal safety protocols; provided additional personal protective equipment to our workforce; implemented rigorous covid-19 self-assessment, contact tracing and quarantine protocols; increased cleaning protocols at all of our employee work locations; and provided additional paid leave to employees with actual or presumed covid-19 cases. we also collaborated, and continue to collaborate, with customers, suppliers and service providers to minimize potential impacts to or disruptions of our operations and to implement longer-term emergency response protocols. although we returned to full in-person working in our houston headquarters and other offices in july 2021, we intend to continue to monitor developments affecting our workforce, our customers, our suppliers, our service providers and the communities in which we operate, including any significant resurgence in covid-19 transmission and infection. should the need arise, we will take such precautions as we believe are warranted.
our efforts to respond to the challenges presented by the ongoing pandemic, as well as certain operational decisions we previously implemented, such as our maintenance capital program, have helped to minimize the impact, and any resulting disruptions, of the pandemic to our business and operations.
the long-term impact that the covid-19 pandemic will have on our business, cash flows, liquidity, financial condition and results of operations will depend on future developments, including, among others, the duration, ultimate geographic spread and severity of the virus and its variants (such as the delta and omicron variants), the global availability and efficacy of treatments and vaccines and boosters and the acceptance of such treatments and vaccines by a significant portion of the population, any significant resurgence in virus transmission and infection in regions that have experienced improvements, the extent and duration of governmental and other measures implemented to try to slow the spread of the virus (whether through a continuation of existing measures or the re-imposition of prior measures), and other actions by governmental authorities, customers, suppliers and other third parties.
market conditions and commodity prices our financial results depend on many factors, particularly commodity prices and our ability to market our production on economically attractive terms. commodity prices are affected by many factors outside of our control, including changes in market supply and demand, which are impacted by pipeline capacity constraints, inventory storage levels, basis differentials, weather conditions and other factors. our realized prices are also further impacted by our hedging activities.
our revenues, operating results, financial condition and ability to borrow funds or obtain additional capital depend substantially on prevailing commodity prices, particularly oil and natural gas prices. material declines in commodity prices could have a material adverse effect on our operating results, financial condition, liquidity and ability to obtain financing. lower commodity prices also may reduce the amount of oil, natural gas, and ngls that we can produce economically. in addition, in periods of low commodity prices, we may elect to curtail a portion of our production from time to time. historically, commodity prices have been volatile, with prices sometimes fluctuating widely, and they may remain volatile. as a result, we cannot accurately predict future commodity prices and, therefore, cannot determine with any degree of certainty what effect increases or decreases in these prices will have on our capital program, production volumes or revenues. in addition to commodity prices and production volumes, finding and developing sufficient amounts of oil and natural gas reserves at economical costs are critical to our long-term success.
we account for our derivative instruments on a mark-to-market basis, with changes in fair value recognized in operating revenues in the consolidated statement of operations. as a result of these mark-to-market adjustments associated with our derivative instruments, we will experience volatility in our earnings due to commodity price volatility. refer to "results of operations - impact of derivative instruments on operating revenues" below and note 5 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements, "derivative instruments," for more information.
one of the impacts of the covid-19 pandemic was a significant reduction in demand for crude oil, and to a lesser extent, natural gas. the supply/demand imbalance driven by the covid-19 pandemic and production disagreements in march 2020 among members of opec+ led to a significant global economic contraction generally in 2020 and continued to have disruptive impacts on the oil and gas industry in 2021. although the members of opec+ agreed in april 2020 to cut oil production and have subsequently taken actions that generally have supported commodity prices, and u.s. production has declined, oil prices and natural gas prices remained low, relative to pre-pandemic levels, through the first quarter of 2021, as the oversupply and lack of demand in the market persisted. oil, natural gas and ngl prices increased during the second half of 2021 compared to 2020, in part due to greater demand and slightly decreasing production levels. in addition, our costs for services, labor and supplies increased during 2021 due to increased demand for those items and supply chain disruptions related to the covid-19 pandemic.
meanwhile, nymex oil and natural gas futures prices have strengthened since the reduction of pandemic-related restrictions and recent opec+ cooperation. improving oil and natural gas futures prices in part reflect market expectations of limited u.s. supply growth from publicly traded companies as a result of capital investment discipline and a focus on delivering free cash flow returns to stockholders. in addition, natural gas prices have benefited from strong worldwide liquefied natural gas ("lng") demand and sustained higher u.s. exports, lower associated gas growth from oil drilling and improved u.s. economic activity. oil price futures have improved coinciding with recovering global economic activity, lower supply from major oil producing countries, opec+ cooperation and moderating inventory levels.
although the current outlook on oil and natural gas prices is generally favorable and our operations have not been significantly impacted in the short-term, in the event further disruptions occur and continue for an extended period of time, our operations could be adversely impacted, commodity prices could decline and our costs may increase further. although we are unable to predict future commodity prices, at current oil, natural gas and ngl price levels, we do not believe that an impairment of our oil and gas properties is reasonably likely to occur in the near future; however, in the event that commodity prices significantly decline from current levels, our management would evaluate the recoverability of the carrying value of our oil and gas properties.
for information about the impact of realized commodity prices on our revenues, refer to "results of operations" below.
financial condition liquidity and capital resources we strive to maintain an adequate liquidity level to address commodity price volatility and risk. our primary sources of liquidity are (1) cash on hand, (2) net cash provided by operating activities and (3) available borrowing capacity under our revolving credit facility.
our liquidity requirements consist primarily of (1) capital expenditures, (2) payment of contractual obligations, including debt maturity and interest payments, (3) working capital requirements, (4) dividend payments and (5) share repurchases. see below for additional discussion and analysis of our cash flows. we believe that, with operating cash flow, cash on hand and availability under our revolving credit facility, we have the ability to finance our spending plans over the next twelve months and, based on current expectations, for the long term.
we had $1.5 billion of capacity on our revolving credit facility at december 31, 2021. the revolving credit facility is scheduled to mature in april 2024, subject to extension up to one year if certain conditions are met.
at december 31, 2021, we had no borrowings outstanding under our revolving credit facility. we also had unrestricted cash on hand of $1.0 billion as of december 31, 2021.
our revolving credit facility includes a covenant limiting our borrowing capacity based on our leverage ratio. refer to note 4 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements, "debt and credit agreements," for further details regarding our leverage ratio.
immediately prior to the merger, cimarex had outstanding senior notes in the aggregate principal amount of $2.0 billion. on october 7, 2021 and after the completion of the merger, we completed private offers to eligible holders to exchange $1.8 billion in aggregate principal of cimarex senior notes (the "existing cimarex notes") for $1.8 billion in aggregate principal of new notes issued by us (the "new coterra notes") and $2 million of cash consideration. in connection with the debt exchange, cimarex obtained consents to adopt certain amendments to each of the indentures governing the existing cimarex notes to eliminate certain of the covenants, restrictive provisions and events of default from such indentures. the new coterra notes are table of contents general, unsecured, senior obligations of ours and have substantially identical terms and covenants to the existing cimarex notes (before giving effect to the amendments referred to in the immediately preceding sentence), which we believe are customary for senior, unsecured notes issued by companies of similar size and credit quality as compared to us. the new coterra notes consist of $706 million aggregate principal amount of 4.375% senior notes due 2024, $687 million aggregate principal amount of 3.90% senior notes due 2027 and $433 million aggregate principal amount of 4.375% senior notes due 2029.
our debt is currently rated as investment grade by the three leading rating agencies. in determining our debt ratings, the agencies consider a number of qualitative and quantitative items including, but not limited to, current commodity prices, our liquidity position, our asset quality and reserve mix, debt levels, cost structure and growth plans. credit ratings are not recommendations to buy, sell, or hold securities and may be subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating agency. there are no "rating triggers" in any of our debt agreements that would accelerate the scheduled maturities should our debt rating fall below a certain level. however, a change in our debt rating could impact our interest rate on any borrowings under our revolving credit facility and our ability to economically access debt markets in the future and could trigger the requirement to post credit support under various agreements, which could reduce the borrowing capacity under our revolving credit facility.
at december 31, 2021, we were in compliance with all financial covenants for both our revolving credit facility and senior notes. refer to note 4 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements, "debt and credit agreements," for further details regarding financial covenants.
as market conditions warrant and subject to our contractual restrictions, liquidity position and other factors, we may from time to time seek to repurchase or retire our outstanding debt through cash purchases and/or exchanges for other debt or equity securities in open market transactions, privately negotiated transactions, by tender offer or otherwise. any such cash repurchases by us may be funded by cash on hand or incurring new debt. the amounts involved in any such transactions, individually or in the aggregate, may be material.
cash flows our cash flows from operating activities, investing activities and financing activities are as follows:
year ended december 31,
(in millions)                                                        2021                      2020                        2019
cash flows provided by operating activities                    $1,667                      $778                      $1,445
cash flows provided by (used in) investing activities             313                     (584)                       (543)
cash flows used in financing activities                       (1,086)                     (256)                       (690)
operating activities. operating cash flow fluctuations are substantially driven by changes in commodity prices, production volumes and operating expenses. commodity prices have historically been volatile, primarily as a result of supply and demand for oil and natural gas, pipeline infrastructure constraints, basis differentials, inventory storage levels, seasonal influences and other factors. in addition, fluctuations in cash flow may result in an increase or decrease in our capital expenditures.
on october 1, 2021, we and cimarex completed the merger. although we expect to achieve certain general and administrative expense synergies over the long-term through cost savings, in the near-term we will incur certain merger-related restructuring cost cash outflows ranging from $100 million to $110 million. these payments will primarily relate to workforce reductions and the associated employee severance benefits, and the acceleration of employee benefits that were triggered by the merger.
our working capital is substantially influenced by the variables discussed above and fluctuates based on the timing and amount of borrowings and repayments under our revolving credit facility, repayments of debt, the timing of cash collections and payments on our trade accounts receivable and payable, respectively, payment of dividends, repurchases of our securities and changes in the fair value of our commodity derivative activity. from time to time, our working capital will reflect a deficit, while at other times it will reflect a surplus. this fluctuation is not unusual. at december 31, 2021 and 2020, we had a working capital surplus of $916 million and $26 million, respectively. we believe we have adequate liquidity and availability under our revolving credit facility to meet our working capital requirements over the next 12 months.
net cash provided by operating activities in 2021 increased by $889 million compared to 2020. this increase was primarily due to higher natural gas, oil and ngl revenue, partially offset by higher operating expenses, higher cash paid on derivative settlements and unfavorable changes in working capital and other assets and liabilities. the increase in natural gas, table of contents oil and ngl revenue was primarily due to the merger, an increase in realized natural gas prices and moderately higher natural gas production in the marcellus shale. average realized natural gas prices increased by 87 percent in 2021 compared to 2020.
refer to "results of operations" for additional information relative to commodity price, production and operating expense fluctuations. we are unable to predict future commodity prices and, as a result, cannot provide any assurance about future levels of net cash provided by operating activities.
investing activities. cash flows used in investing activities decreased by $897 million from 2020 compared to 2021. the decrease was primarily driven by $1.0 billion of cash acquired as a result of the merger, partially offset by $152 million of higher capital expenditures which were primarily a result of the merger.
financing activities. cash flows used in financing activities increased by $830 million from 2020 compared to 2021. the increase was due to $621 million of higher dividend payments related to special and variable common stock dividends paid in 2021, $101 million higher net repayments of debt primarily related to maturities of certain of our senior notes and $104 million higher tax withholding payments related to share-based awards that vested as a result of the merger.
2020 and 2019 compared. for information on the comparison of operating, investing and financing cash flows for the year ended december 31, 2019 compared to the year ended december 31, 2020, refer to financial condition (cash flows) included in the coterra energy inc. (formerly cabot oil & gas corporation) annual report on form 10-k for the year ended december 31, 2020.

_______________________________________________________________________________
(1)includes $188 million of current portion of long-term debt at december 31, 2020. there were no borrowings outstanding under our revolving credit facility as of december 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.
(2)includes consideration of $9.1 billion related to the issuance of our common stock in connection with the merger.
on september 29, 2021, our stockholders approved an amendment to our certificate of incorporation to increase the number of authorized shares of our common stock from 960,000,000 shares to 1,800,000,000 shares. that amendment became effective on october 1, 2021.
on october 1, 2021 and following the effectiveness of the merger, we issued approximately 408.2 million shares of common stock to cimarex stockholders under the terms of the merger agreement (excluding shares that were awarded in replacement of previously outstanding cimarex restricted share awards).
share repurchases. we did not repurchase any shares of our common stock during 2021 and 2020 under our share repurchase program. as of december 31, 2021, 125,067 shares of common stock went into treasury stock that were retained from restricted stock award vestings for the withholding of taxes.
in february 2022, our board of directors terminated our previously authorized share repurchase program and authorized a new share repurchase program. this new share repurchase program authorizes the company to purchase up to $1.25 billion of our common stock in the open market or in negotiated transactions.
dividends. during 2021 and 2020, we paid dividends of $780 million ($1.12 per share) and $159 million ($0.40 per share) on our common stock, respectively.
in april 2021, our board of directors approved an increase in the quarterly dividend on our common stock from $0.10 per share to $0.11 per share. in november 2021, our board of directors also approved an increase in the base component of our quarterly dividend on our common stock from $0.11 per share to $0.125 per share. also on that date, related to our dividend table of contents strategy to return at least 50 percent of quarterly free cash flows to stockholders, our board of directors approved a variable dividend of $0.175 per share, resulting in a total base-plus-variable dividend of $0.30 per share on our common stock.
on october 4, 2021, and in connection with the completion of the merger, our board of directors approved a special dividend of $0.50 per share payable on our common stock on october 22, 2021.
in february 2022, our board of approved an additional increase in the quarterly dividend on our common stock from $0.125 per share to $0.15 per share. also on that date, our board of directors approved a variable dividend of $0.41 per share, resulting in a quarterly base-plus-variable dividend of $0.56 per share on our common stock.
capital and exploration expenditures on an annual basis, we generally fund most of our capital expenditures, excluding any significant property acquisitions, with cash generated from operations and, if required, borrowings under our revolving credit facility. we budget these expenditures based on our projected cash flows for the year.
the following table presents major components of our capital and exploration expenditures:

(1)these amounts represent the fair value of the proved and unproved properties recorded in the purchase price allocation with respect to the merger. the purchase was funded through the issuance of our common stock.
(2)exploration expenditures include $4 million and $2 million of exploratory dry-hole costs in 2020 and 2019, respectively. there were no exploratory dry-hole costs in 2021.
in 2021, we drilled 114 gross wells (99.9 net) and completed 132 gross wells (108.3 net), of which 14 gross wells (13.0 net) were drilled but uncompleted in prior years.
our 2022 capital program is expected to be approximately $1,400 million to $1,500 million, of which $1,225 million to $1,325 million is allocated to drilling and completion activities. we expect to turn-in-line 134 to 153 total net wells in 2022 across our three operating regions. approximately 49 percent of drilling and completion capital will be invested in the permian basin, 44 percent in the marcellus shale and the balance in the anadarko basin. midstream, saltwater disposal, electrification, infrastructure and other investments are expected to total approximately $175 million in the year. we will continue to assess the commodity price environment and may increase or decrease our capital expenditures accordingly.
contractual obligations we have various contractual obligations in the normal course of our operations. as of december 31, 2021, our material contractual obligations include debt and related interest expense, transportation and gathering agreements, lease obligations, operational agreements, drilling and completion obligations, derivative obligations and asset retirement obligations. other joint owners in the properties operated by us could incur a portion of these costs. we expect that our sources of capital will be table of contents adequate to fund these obligations. refer to the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this annual report for further details.
from time to time, we enter into arrangements that can give rise to material off-balance sheet obligations. as of december 31, 2021, the material off-balance sheet arrangements we had entered into included certain firm transportation and processing commitments and operating lease agreements with terms at commencement of less than 12 months for equipment used in our exploration and development activities. we have no other off-balance sheet debt or other similar unrecorded obligations.
critical accounting estimates in preparing financial statements, we follow gaap. these principles require management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the balance sheet, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. actual results could differ from those estimates, and changes in our estimates are recorded when known. we consider the following to be our most critical estimates that involve judgement of management.
purchase accounting from time to time, we may acquire assets and assume liabilities in transactions accounted for as business combinations, such as the merger. in connection with the merger, we allocated the $9.1 billion of purchase price consideration to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on estimated fair values as of the effective date of the merger. the purchase price allocation is substantially complete; however, it may be subject to change for up to one year after october 1, 2021, the effective date of the merger.
we made a number of assumptions in estimating the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the merger. the most significant assumptions related to the fair value estimates of proved and unproved oil and gas properties, which were recorded at a fair value of $12.9 billion. since sufficient market data was not available regarding the fair values of the acquired proved and unproved oil and gas properties, we prepared our estimates using discounted cash flows and engaged third party valuation experts. significant judgments and assumptions are inherent in these estimates and include, among other things, estimates of reserve quantities and production volumes, future commodity prices and price differentials, expected development costs, lease operating costs, reserve risk adjustment factors and an estimate of an applicable market participant discount rate that reflects the risk of the underlying cash flow estimates.
estimated fair values assigned to assets acquired can have a significant impact on future results of operations, as presented in our financial statements. fair values are based on estimates of future commodity prices and price differentials, reserve quantities and production volumes, development costs and lease operating costs. in the event that future commodity prices or reserve quantities or production volumes are significantly lower than those used in the determination of fair value as of the effective date of the merger, the likelihood increases that certain costs may be determined to be unrecoverable.
in addition to the fair value of proved and unproved oil and gas properties, other significant fair value assessments for the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the merger relate to long-term debt, fixed assets and derivative instruments. the fair value of the assumed cimarex publicly traded debt was based on available third-party quoted prices. we prepared estimates and engaged third-party valuation experts to assist in the valuation of certain fixed assets, which required significant judgments and assumptions inherent in the estimates and included projected cash flows and comparable companies' cash flow multiples. the fair value of assumed derivative instrument liabilities included significant judgments and assumptions related to estimates of future commodity prices and related differentials and estimates of volatility factors and interest rates.
successful efforts method of accounting we follow the successful efforts method of accounting for our oil and gas producing activities. acquisition costs for proved and unproved properties are capitalized when incurred. judgment is required to determine the proper classification of wells designated as developmental or exploratory, which ultimately will determine the proper accounting treatment of costs incurred. exploration costs, including geological and geophysical costs, the costs of carrying and retaining unproved properties and exploratory dry-hole costs are expensed. development costs, including costs to drill and equip development wells and successful exploratory drilling costs to locate proved reserves, are capitalized.
oil and gas reserves the process of estimating quantities of proved reserves is inherently imprecise, and the reserves data included in this document is only an estimate. the process relies on interpretations and judgment of available geological, geophysical, engineering and production data. the extent, quality and reliability of this technical data can vary. the process also requires certain economic assumptions, some of which are mandated by the sec, such as commodity prices. additional assumptions table of contents include drilling and operating expenses, capital expenditures, taxes and availability of funds. any significant variance in the interpretations or assumptions could materially affect the estimated quantity and value of our reserves and can change substantially over time. periodic revisions to the estimated reserves and future cash flows may be necessary as a result of reservoir performance, drilling activity, commodity prices, fluctuations in operating expenses, technological advances, new geological or geophysical data or other economic factors. accordingly, reserve estimates are generally different from the quantities ultimately recovered. we cannot predict the amounts or timing of such future revisions.
the reserve quantity estimates of our oil and gas properties have been prepared by our petroleum engineering staff. miller and lents has audited 100 percent of the proved reserves estimates related to our marcellus shale properties, and degolyer and macnaughton has performed an independent evaluation of estimated net reserves representing greater than 80 percent of the total future net revenue discounted at 10 percent attributable to the proved reserves estimates related to our permian basin, anadarko basin and other properties (excluding our marcellus shale properties). each of miller and lents and degolyer and macnaughton concluded, in their opinions, that our presented estimates are reasonable in the aggregate. for more information regarding reserve estimation, including historical reserve revisions, refer to the supplemental oil and gas information to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8.
our rate of recording dd&a expense is dependent upon our estimate of proved and proved developed reserves, which are utilized in our unit-of-production calculation. if the estimates of proved reserves were to be reduced, the rate at which we record dd&a expense would increase, reducing net income. such a reduction in reserves may result from lower market prices, which may make it uneconomic to drill and produce higher cost fields. a five percent positive or negative revision to proved reserves would result in a decrease of $0.29 per boe and an increase of $0.32 per boe, respectively, on our dd&a rate. this estimated impact is based on current data, and actual events could require different adjustments to our dd&a rate.
in addition, a decline in proved reserve estimates may impact the outcome of our impairment test under applicable accounting standards. due to the inherent imprecision of the reserve estimation process, risks associated with the operations of proved producing properties and market sensitive commodity prices utilized in our impairment analysis, we cannot determine if an impairment is reasonably likely to occur in the future.
oil and gas properties we evaluate our proved oil and gas properties for impairment on a field-by-field basis whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate an asset's carrying amount may not be recoverable. we compare expected undiscounted future cash flows to the net book value of the asset. if the future undiscounted expected cash flows, based on our estimate of future commodity prices, operating costs and anticipated production from proved reserves and risk-adjusted probable and possible reserves, are lower than the net book value of the asset, the capitalized cost is reduced to fair value. commodity pricing is estimated by using a combination of assumptions management uses in its budgeting and forecasting process, historical and current prices adjusted for geographical location and quality differentials, as well as other factors that we believe will impact realizable prices. in the event that commodity prices significantly decline, we would test the recoverability of the carrying value of our oil and gas properties and, if necessary, record an impairment charge. fair value is calculated by discounting the future cash flows. the discount factor used is based on rates utilized by market participants that are commensurate with the risks inherent in the development and production of the underlying oil and natural gas.
unproved oil and gas properties are assessed periodically for impairment on an aggregate basis through periodic updates to our undeveloped acreage amortization based on past drilling and exploration experience, our expectation of converting leases to held by production and average property lives. average property lives are determined on a geographical basis and based on the estimated life of unproved property leasehold rights. historically, the average property life in each of the geographical areas has not significantly changed and generally range from three to five years. the commodity price environment may impact the capital available for exploration projects as well as development drilling.
as these properties are developed and reserves are proved, the remaining capitalized costs are subject to depreciation and depletion. if the development of these properties is deemed unsuccessful and the properties are abandoned or surrendered, the capitalized costs related to the unsuccessful activity are expensed in the year the determination is made. the rate at which the unproved properties are written off depends on the timing and success of our future exploration and development program.
derivative instruments under applicable accounting standards, the fair value of each derivative instrument is recorded as either an asset or liability on the balance sheet. at the end of each quarterly period, these instruments are marked-to-market. the change in fair value of derivatives not designated as hedges are recorded as a component of operating revenues in gain (loss) on derivative instruments in the consolidated statement of operations.
table of contents our derivative contracts are measured based on quotes from our counterparties or internal models. such quotes and models have been derived using an income approach that considers various inputs including current market and contractual prices for the underlying instruments, quoted forward commodity prices, basis differentials, volatility factors and interest rates for a similar length of time as the derivative contract term, as applicable. these estimates are derived from or verified using relevant nymex futures contracts or are compared to multiple quotes obtained from counterparties for reasonableness. the determination of fair value also incorporates a credit adjustment for non-performance risk. we measure the non-performance risk of our counterparties by reviewing credit default swap spreads for the various financial institutions with which we have derivative transactions, while our non-performance risk is evaluated using a market credit spread provided by one of our banks.
our financial condition, results of operations and liquidity can be significantly impacted by changes in the market value of our derivative instruments due to volatility of commodity prices, both nymex and basis differentials.
income taxes we make certain estimates and judgments in determining our income tax expense for financial reporting purposes. these estimates and judgments include the calculation of certain deferred tax assets and liabilities that arise from differences in the timing and recognition of revenue and expenses for tax and financial reporting purposes and estimating reserves for potential adverse outcomes regarding tax positions that we have taken. we account for the uncertainty in income taxes using a recognition and measurement threshold for tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position is recognized when it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination by taxing authorities based on technical merits of the position. the amount of the tax benefit recognized is the largest amount of the benefit that has a greater than 50 percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement. the effective tax rate and the tax basis of assets and liabilities reflect management's estimates of the ultimate outcome of various tax uncertainties.
we believe all of our deferred tax assets, net of any valuation allowances, will ultimately be realized, taking into consideration our forecasted future taxable income, which includes consideration of future operating conditions specifically related to commodity prices. if our estimates and judgments change regarding our ability to realize our deferred tax assets, our tax provision could increase in the period it is determined that it is more likely than not it will not be realized.
our effective tax rate is subject to variability as a result of factors other than changes in federal and state tax rates and/or changes in tax laws which could affect us. our effective tax rate is affected by changes in the allocation of property, payroll and revenues among states in which we operate. a small change in our estimated future tax rate could have a material effect on current period earnings.
contingency reserves a provision for contingencies is charged to expense when the loss is probable and the cost is estimable. the establishment of a reserve is based on an estimation process that includes the advice of legal counsel and subjective judgment of management. in certain cases, our judgment is based on the advice and opinions of legal counsel and other advisors, the interpretation of laws and regulations, which can be interpreted differently by regulators and courts of laws, our experience and the experiences of other companies dealing with similar matters, and our decision on how we intend to respond to a particular matter. actual losses can differ from estimates for various reasons, including those noted above. we monitor known and potential legal, environmental and other contingencies and make our best estimate based on the information we have. future changes in facts and circumstances not currently foreseeable could result in the actual liability exceeding the estimated ranges of loss and amounts accrued.
stock-based compensation we account for stock-based compensation under the fair value method of accounting in accordance with applicable accounting standards. under the fair value method, compensation cost is measured at the grant date for equity-classified awards and remeasured each reporting period for liability-classified awards based on the fair value of an award and is recognized over the service period, which is generally the vesting period. to calculate fair value, we use various models, including both a black scholes or a monte carlo valuation model, as determined by the specific provisions of the award. the use of these models requires significant judgment with respect to expected life, volatility and other factors.
recently issued and adopted accounting pronouncements refer to note 1 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements, "summary of significant accounting policies," for a discussion of recently issued and adopted accounting pronouncements.
table of contents other issues and contingencies regulations our operations are subject to various types of regulation by federal, state and local authorities. refer to the "other business matters" section of item 1 for a discussion of these regulations.
restrictive covenants our ability to incur debt, incur liens, pay dividends, repurchase or redeem our equity interests, redeem our senior notes, make certain types of investments, enter into mergers, sell assets, enter into transactions with affiliates, and engage in certain other activities are subject to certain restrictive covenants in our various debt instruments. in addition, the senior note agreements governing various series of senior notes that were issued in separate private placements (the "private placement senior notes") require us to maintain a minimum annual coverage ratio of consolidated cash flow to interest expense for the trailing four quarters of 2.8 to 1.0 and require a maximum ratio of total debt to consolidated ebitda for the trailing four quarters of not more than 3.0 to 1.0. our revolving credit agreement also requires us to maintain a leverage ratio of no more than 3.0 to 1.0 until such time as we have no other debt outstanding that has a financial maintenance covenant based on a leverage ratio, and thereafter requires us to maintain a ratio of total debt to total capitalization of no more than 65 percent.
at december 31, 2021, we were in compliance with all financial covenants in both our senior note agreements and our revolving credit agreement.
operating risks and insurance coverage our business involves a variety of operating risks. refer to "risk factors-business and operational risks-we face a variety of hazards and risks that could cause substantial financial losses" in part i, item 1a. in accordance with customary industry practice, we maintain insurance against some, but not all, of these hazards and risks and related losses. the occurrence of any loss events not fully covered by insurance could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows. the costs of these insurance policies are somewhat dependent on our historical claims experience, the areas in which we operate and market conditions.
commodity pricing and risk management activities our revenues, operating results, financial condition and ability to borrow funds or obtain additional capital depend substantially on prevailing commodity prices. significant declines in commodity prices may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, liquidity, ability to obtain financing and operating results. lower commodity prices also may reduce the amount of oil and natural gas that we can produce economically. historically, commodity prices have been volatile, with prices fluctuating widely, and they are likely to continue to be volatile. depressed prices in the future would have a negative impact on our future financial results. in particular, substantially lower prices would significantly reduce revenue and could potentially trigger an impairment of our oil and gas properties or a violation of certain financial debt covenants.
the majority of our production is sold at market-sensitive prices. generally, if the related commodity index declines, the price that we receive for our production will also decline. therefore, the amount of revenue that we realize is determined by certain factors that are beyond our control. however, we may mitigate this price risk on a portion of our anticipated production with the use of financial commodity derivatives, including collars, swaps, roll differential swaps and basis swaps to reduce the impact of sustained lower pricing on our revenue. under these arrangements, there is also a risk that the movement of index prices may result in our inability to realize the full benefit of an improvement in market conditions.

production revenues our production revenues vary from year to year and are derived from sales of our oil, natural gas and ngl production. our 2021 production revenues were substantially increased due to the merger, which significantly expanded our operations to include the permian and anadarko basins. increases or decreases in our revenues, profitability and future production growth are highly dependent on the commodity prices we receive. commodity prices are market driven and we expect future prices to be volatile due to supply and demand factors, pipeline capacity, seasonality and geopolitical, economic and other factors.
below is a discussion of our production revenue, price and volume variances.

natural gas revenues increased $1.4 billion primarily due to significantly higher natural gas prices combined with higher production. the increase in production was primarily driven by an increase in fourth quarter production due to the merger.
oil revenues oil revenues increased $616 million primarily due to the merger.
ngl revenues ngl revenues increased $243 million primarily due to the merger.
(loss) gain on derivative instruments net gains and losses on our derivative instruments are a function of fluctuations in the underlying commodity index prices as compared to the contracted prices and the monthly cash settlements (if any) of the instruments. we have elected not to designate our derivatives as hedging instruments for accounting purposes and, therefore, we do not apply hedge accounting treatment to our derivative instruments. consequently, changes in the fair value of our derivative instruments and cash settlements on the instruments are included as a component of operating revenues as either a net gain or loss on derivative instruments. cash settlements of our contracts are included in cash flows from operating activities in our statements of cash flows. the following table presents the components of "(loss) gain on derivative instruments" for the years indicated:

included in the table above are settlement losses of $194 million related to the derivative liabilities that we assumed in the merger. settlement losses realized in 2021 were primarily driven by significant price increases in the underlying commodity index prices that occurred during the fourth quarter of 2021.
operating costs and expenses costs associated with producing oil and natural gas are substantial. among other factors, some of these costs vary with commodity prices, some trend with the volume and commodity mix of production, some are a function of the number of wells we own, some depend on the prices charged by service companies, and some fluctuate based on a combination of the foregoing. our operating costs and expenses in 2021 were substantially increased due to the merger, which significantly expanded our operations to include the permian and anadarko basins. in addition, our costs for services, labor and supplies have recently increased due to increased demand for those items and supply chain disruptions related to the covid-19 pandemic.
the following table reflects our operating costs and expenses for the years indicated and a discussion of the operating costs and expenses follows.

lease operating and workover expense increased due to our expanded operations due to the merger.
table of contents transportation, processing and gathering transportation, processing and gathering costs principally consist of expenditures to prepare and transport production from the wellhead, including gathering, fuel, compression and processing costs. gathering costs also include costs associated with operating our gas gathering infrastructure, including operating and maintenance expenses. costs vary by operating area and will fluctuate with increases or decreases in production volumes, contractual fees, and changes in fuel and compression costs.
transportation, processing and gathering increased $92 million due to our expanded operations due to the merger, offset by a decrease in costs due to lower production in the marcellus shale.
taxes other than income taxes other than income consist of production (or severance) taxes, drilling impact fees, ad valorem taxes and other taxes. state and local taxing authorities assess these taxes, with production taxes being based on the volume or value of production, drilling impact fees being based on drilling activities and prevailing natural gas prices and ad valorem taxes being based on the value of properties. the following table presents taxes other than income for the years indicated:

depletion of our producing properties is computed on a field basis using the units-of-production method under the successful efforts method of accounting. the economic life of each producing property depends upon the estimated proved reserves for that property, which in turn depend upon the assumed realized sales price for future production. therefore, fluctuations in oil and gas prices will impact the level of proved developed and proved reserves used in the calculation. higher prices generally have the effect of increasing reserves, which reduces depletion expense. conversely, lower prices generally have the effect of decreasing reserves, which increases depletion expense. the cost of replacing production also impacts our depletion expense. in addition, changes in estimates of reserve quantities, estimates of operating and future development costs, reclassifications of properties from unproved to proved and impairments of oil and gas properties will also impact depletion expense. our depletion expense increased $290 million due to increased production and a higher depletion rate of $3.97 per mboe for 2021, both of which are attributable to a significant increase in the value of the oil and gas properties acquired on the closing date of the merger, compared to $2.61 per mboe for 2020.
table of contents fixed assets consist primarily of gas gathering facilities, water infrastructure, buildings, vehicles, aircraft, furniture and fixtures and computer equipment and software. these items are recorded at cost and are depreciated on the straight-line method based on expected lives of the individual assets, which range from three to 30 years. also included in our depreciation expense is the depreciation of the right-of-use asset associated with our finance lease gathering system. the increase in depreciation expense during 2021 as compared to 2020 is primarily due to increased depreciation on our gathering and plant facilities acquired in the merger.
general and administrative general and administrative ("g&a") expense consists primarily of salaries and related benefits, stock-based compensation, office rent, legal and consulting fees, systems costs and other administrative costs incurred. our g&a expense is reported net of amounts reimbursed to us by working interest owners of the oil and gas properties we operate. the table below reflects our g&a expense:

general and administrative increased $44 million primarily due to the merger, which significantly expanded our headcount and office-related expenses.
periodic stock-based compensation expense will fluctuate based on the grant date fair value of awards, the number of awards, the requisite service period of the awards, estimated employee forfeitures, and the timing of the awards. stock-based compensation expense increased primarily due to the acceleration of vesting of certain stock-based awards on closing of the merger of $10 million and an increase in compensation expense of $9 million related to replacement awards granted to cimarex employees at the closing of the merger. these increases were partially offset by lower stock-based compensation expense of $4 million related to the awards that vested at the closing of the merger.
merger-related expenses increased $106 million primarily due to $42 million of transaction-related costs (legal and financial advisor costs) associated with the merger, $20 million of deferred compensation expense related to certain change-in-control payments and $44 million associated with the expected termination of certain cimarex employees, which is being accrued over the expected transition period.

interest expense, net interest expense increased $8 million primarily due to the incremental interest expense, net of premium amortization associated with the debt related to the merger of $2.2 billion, including the new coterra notes and existing cimarex notes. this increase was partially offset by lower interest expense due to repayment of $87 million of our 6.51% weighted-average private placement senior notes, which matured in july 2020, the repayment of $88 million of our 5.58% weighted-average private placement senior notes, which matured in january 2021, and the repayment of $100 million of our 3.65% weighted-average private placement senior notes, which matured in september 2021.

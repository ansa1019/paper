maa, an s&p 500 company, is a multifamily-focused, self-administered and self-managed real estate investment trust, or reit. we own, operate, acquire and selectively develop apartment communities primarily located in the southeast, southwest and mid-atlantic regions of the united states. as of december 31, 2021, we owned and operated 290
apartment communities (which does not include development properties under construction) through the operating partnership and its subsidiaries, and we had an ownership interest in one apartment community through an unconsolidated real estate joint venture and had six development communities under construction. in addition, as of december 31, 2021, 33 of our apartment communities included retail components. our apartment communities, including development communities under construction, were located across 16 states and the district of columbia as of december 31, 2021.
we report in two segments, same store and non-same store and other. our same store segment represents those apartment communities that have been owned and stabilized for at least 12 months as of the first day of the calendar year. our non-same store and other segment includes recently acquired communities, communities being developed or in lease-up, communities identified for disposition, communities that have incurred a significant casualty loss and stabilized communities that do not meet the requirements to be same store communities. also included in our non-same store and other segment are non-multifamily activities. additional information regarding the composition of our segments is included in note 13 to the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10-k.
overview for the year ended december 31, 2021, net income available for maa common shareholders was $530.1 million as compared to $251.3 million for the year ended december 31, 2020. results for the year ended december 31, 2021
included $221.2 million of gains related to the sale of real estate assets and $40.9 million of gain, net of tax, related to our investments in unconsolidated limited partnerships. results for the year ended december 31, 2020
included $1.0 million of gains related to the sale of real estate assetsand $4.8 million of gain,net of tax, related to our investments in unconsolidated limited partnerships. revenues for the year ended december 31, 2021
increased 6.0% as compared to the year ended december 31, 2020, driven by a 5.5% increase in our same store segment. property operating expenses, excluding depreciation and amortization, for the year ended december 31, 2021
increased by 4.8% as compared to the year ended december 31, 2020, driven by a 4.4% increase in our same store segment. the primary drivers of these changes are discussed in the "results of operations" section.
trends during theyear ended december 31, 2021,revenue growth for our same store segment continued to be primarily driven by growth in average effective rent per unit. the average effective rent per unit for our same store segment continued to increase from the prior year, up5.2% for the year ended december 31, 2021as compared to theyear ended december 31, 2020. average effective rent per unit represents the average of gross rent amounts, after the effect of leasing concessions, for occupied apartment units plus prevalent market rates asked for unoccupied apartment units, divided by the total number of units. leasing concessions represent discounts to the current market rate. we believe average effective rent per unit is a helpful measurement in evaluating average pricing; however, it does not represent actual rental revenue collected per unit. in addition, for theyear ended december 31, 2021, average physical occupancy for our same store segment was96.1%, as compared to 95.6%for the year endedyear ended december
31, 2020. average physical occupancy is a measurement of the total number of our apartment units that are occupied by residents, and it represents the average of the daily physical occupancy for the period.
an important part of our portfolio strategy is to maintain diversity of markets, submarkets, product types and price points in the southeast, southwest and mid-atlantic regions of the united states. this diversity tends to mitigate exposure to economic issues in any one geographic market or area. we believe that a well-balanced portfolio, including both urban and suburban locations, with a broad range of monthly rent price points, will perform well in economic up cycles as well as better weather economic down cycles. through our investment in 36
defined markets, we are diversified across markets, urban and suburban submarkets, and a variety of product types and monthly rent price points.

while the united states economy continues to recover from the effects of the covid-19 pandemic, demand for apartments during theyear ended december 31, 2021was very strong, as evidenced by the accelerating rent growth we achieved. demand for apartments is primarily driven by general economic conditions in our markets and is particularly correlated to job growth. while our rent growth trends and rent collection trends during theyear ended december 31, 2021were strong, we continue to monitor pressures surrounding supply chain challenges and inflation trends. a worsening of the current environment could contribute to uncertain rent collections going forward and suppress demand for apartments and would likely drive rent growth on new leases and renewals lower than what we achieved during theyear ended december 31, 2021. elevated supply levels could further affect rent growth for our portfolio, particularly for apartment communities located in urban submarkets. to date, properties in suburban submarkets have been somewhat less impacted by supply, primarily because new development has been less prevalent in those submarkets. supply chain and inflationary pressures would likely drive higher operating expenses, particularly in personnel and repairs and maintenance.
with the covid-19 pandemic still impacting the country and contributing more uncertainty than normal, we believe that our portfolio strategy of maintaining a diversity of markets, submarkets, product types and rent price points will serve the company better in this environment than a more concentrated portfolio profile. at a portfolio level, we have focused on using our pricing system to maintain strong occupancy. as previously noted, average physical occupancy for our same store segment for theyear ended december 31, 2021 was 96.1%, which we believe positions us well to manage through the typically slower winter leasing season and progress toward the typically stronger spring and summer leasing season.
access to the financial markets remains strong, particularly for high credit rated borrowers. during 2021, we were able to efficiently raise capital through the debt market, and we positioned ourselves to access the equity market in the event we have such a need. however, a prolonged disruption of the markets or a decline in credit and financing conditions could negatively affect our ability to access capital necessary to fund our operations or refinance maturing debt in the future. the prospect of rising interest rates could negatively impact our borrowing costs for any variable rate borrowings or refinancing activity; however, as of december 31, 2021, the interest rate on all of our outstanding debt was fixed, and our fixed rate debt maturities in the year ending december 31, 2022
are not significant.
results of operations for the year ended december 31, 2021, we achieved net income available for maa common shareholders of $530.1
million, a 111.0% increase as compared to the year ended december 31, 2020, and total revenue growth of $100.1
million, representing a 6.0% increase in property revenues as compared to the year ended december 31, 2020. the following discussion describes the primary drivers of the increase in net income available for maa common shareholders for the year ended december 31, 2021 as compared to the year ended december 31, 2020. a discussion of the results of operations for the year ended december 31, 2020 as compared to the year ended december 31, 2019 is found in item 7 of part ii of our annual report on form 10-k for the year ended december 31, 2020, filed with the sec on february 18, 2021, which is available free of charge on the sec's website at https://www.sec.gov and on our website at https://www.maac.com, on the "for investors" page under "filings and financials-annual reports."

the increase in property revenues for our same store segment for the year ended december 31, 2021 as compared to the year ended december 31, 2020 was the primary driver of total property revenue growth. the same store segment generated a 5.5% increase in revenues for the year ended december 31, 2021, primarily a result of average effective rent per unit growth of 5.2% as compared to the year ended december 31, 2020. the increase in property revenues from the non-same store and other segment for the year ended december 31, 2021 as compared to the year ended december 31, 2020 was primarilythe result of increased revenues from recently completed development communities.these increases were partially offset by decreased revenues from the disposition of seven multifamily communities during the year ended december 31, 2021.

the increase in property operating expenses for our same store segment for the year ended december 31, 2021 as compared to the year ended december 31, 2020 was primarily driven by increases in real estate tax expense of $7.0
million, insurance expense of $6.2 million, building repairs and maintenance of $5.6 million, personnel expense of
$4.4 million and utilities expense of $2.7 million. the increase in property operating expenses from the non-same store and other segment for the year ended december 31, 2021 as compared to the year ended december 31, 2020 was primarilythe result of increased property operating expenses from recently completed development communities.these increases were partially offset by decreased property operating expenses from the disposition of seven multifamily communities during the year ended december 31, 2021.
depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization expense for the year ended december 31, 2021 was $533.4 million, an increase of $22.6
million as compared to the year ended december 31, 2020. the increase was primarily driven by the recognition of depreciation expense associated with our development and capital spend activities made in the normal course of business during the year ended december 31, 2021.
other income and expenses property management expenses for the year ended december 31, 2021 were $55.7 million, an increase of $3.4 million as compared to the year ended december 31, 2020. general and administrative expenses for the year ended december
31, 2021 were $52.9 million, an increase of $6.0 million as compared to the year ended december 31, 2020.
interest expense for theyear ended december 31, 2021 was $156.9 million,a decrease of $10.7 million as compared to the year ended december 31, 2020. the decrease was primarily due to a decrease of 27 basis points in our effective interest rate during the year ended december 31, 2021 as compared to the year ended december 31, 2020. the decrease in our effective interest rate was primarily due to debt retirements during theyear ended december 31, 2021, which were retired with proceeds from unsecured debt issuances with lower effective interest rates over the same period.
for the year ended december 31, 2021, we disposed of seven apartment communities, resulting in a gain on sale of depreciable real estate assets of $220.4 million. we did not dispose of any apartment communities during the year ended december 31, 2020. during the year ended december 31, 2021,we disposed of five land parcels resulting in a gain on sale of non-depreciable real estate assets of $0.8 million. during theyear ended december 31, 2020, we disposed of one land parcel resulting in a gain on sale of non-depreciable real estate assets of $1.0 million.
other non-operating income for the year ended december 31, 2021 was $33.9 million of income, as compared to $4.9
million of income for the year ended december 31, 2020. the increase was primarily driven by $51.7 million of non-
cash gain from unconsolidated limited partnerships compared to $5.6 million of non-cash gain from unconsolidated limited partnerships during the year ended december 31, 2020. during the year ended december 31, 2021, we also recognized $4.6 million of non-cash expense related to the fair value adjustment of the embedded derivative in the maa series i preferred shares compared to the recognition of $2.6 million of non-cash income related to the adjustment of the embedded derivative during the year ended december 31, 2020. during the year ended december 31,
2021, we recognized $13.4 million in debt extinguishment costs. expense recognized related to debt extinguishments during the year ended december 31, 2020 was negligible. during the year ended december 31, 2021, we recognized $1.3
million of covid-19 related expenses compared to $3.5 million of covid-19 related expenses during the year ended december 31, 2020.
funds from operations and core funds from operations funds from operations, or ffo, a non-gaap financial measure, represents net income available for maa common shareholders (computed in accordance with the united states generally accepted accounting principles, or gaap)
excluding gains or losses on disposition of operating properties and asset impairment, plus depreciation and amortization of real estate assets, net income attributable to noncontrolling interests and adjustments for joint ventures. because net income attributable to noncontrolling interests is added back, ffo, when used in this annual report on form 10-k, represents ffo attributable to the company.
29
ffo should not be considered as an alternative to net income available for maa common shareholders or any other gaap measurement, as an indicator of operating performance or as an alternative to cash flow from operating, investing and financing activities as a measure of liquidity. management believes that ffo is helpful to investors in understanding our operating performance, primarily because its calculation excludes depreciation and amortization expense on real estate assets. we believe that gaap historical cost depreciation of real estate assets is generally not correlated with changes in the value of those assets, whose value does not diminish predictably over time, as historical cost depreciation implies. while our calculation of ffo is in accordance with the national association of real estate investment trusts', or nareit's, definition, it may differ from the methodology for calculating ffo utilized by other reits and, accordingly, may not be comparable to such other reits.
core ffo represents ffo as adjusted for items that are not considered part of our core business operations, such as adjustments related to the fair value of the embedded derivative in the maa series i preferred shares, gain or loss on sale of non-depreciable assets, gain or loss from unconsolidated limited partnerships, net casualty gain or loss, gain or loss on debt extinguishment, legal costs and settlements, covid-19 related costs and mark-to-market debt adjustments. while our definition of core ffo may be similar to others in the industry, our methodology for calculating core ffo may differ from that utilized by other reits and, accordingly, may not be comparable to such other reits. core ffo should not be considered as an alternative to net income available for maa common shareholders as an indicator of operating performance. we believe that core ffo is helpful in understanding our core operating performance between periods in that it removes certain items that by their nature are not comparable over periods and therefore tend to obscure actual operating performance.
the following table presents a reconciliation of net income available for maa common shareholders to ffo and core ffo for the years ended december 31, 2021 and 2020, as we believe net income available for maa common shareholders is the most directly comparable gaap measure (dollars in thousands):

liquidity and capital resources overview our cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities, as well as general economic and market conditions, are the principal factors affecting our liquidity and capital resources.
we expect that our primary uses of cash will be to fund our ongoing operating needs, to fund our ongoing capital spending requirements, which relate primarily to our development, redevelopment and property repositioning activities, to repay maturing borrowings, to fund the future acquisition of assets and to pay shareholder dividends. we expect to meet our cash requirements through net cash flows from operating activities, existing unrestricted cash and cash equivalents, borrowings under our commercial paper program and our revolving credit facility, the future issuance of debt and equity and the future disposition of assets.
we historically have had positive net cash flows from operating activities. we believe that future net cash flows generated from operating activities, existing unrestricted cash and cash equivalents, borrowing capacity under our current commercial paper program and revolving credit facility, and our ability to issue debt and equity will provide sufficient liquidity to fund the cash requirements for our business over the next 12 months and the foreseeable future.
as of december 31, 2021, we had $1.1 billion of combined unrestricted cash and cash equivalents and available capacity under our revolving credit facility.
cash flows from operating activities net cash provided by operating activities was $895.0 million for the year ended december 31, 2021 as compared to
$823.9 million for the year ended december 31, 2020. the increase in operating cash flows was primarily driven by our operating performance.
cash flows from investing activities net cash used in investing activities was $253.6 million for the year ended december 31, 2021 as compared to $484.7

assets the decrease in cash outflows for purchases of real estate and other assets was driven by acquisition activity during the year ended december 31, 2021 as compared to the year ended december 31, 2020. the increase in cash outflows for capital improvements and other was primarily driven by reconstruction related capital spend due to winter storm uri in addition to increased redevelopment capital spend during the year ended december 31, 2021 as compared to the year ended december 31, 2020. the increase in cash outflows for development costs was driven by increased development activity during the year ended december 31, 2021 as compared to the year ended december 31,
2020. the increase in cash inflows related to proceeds from disposition of real estate assets was driven by the disposition of seven multifamily apartment communities during the year ended december 31, 2021 as compared to no apartment community dispositions during the year ended december 31, 2020.

activities the increase in cash outflows related to the net change in commercial paper resulted from the decrease in net borrowings of $172.0 million on our commercial paper program during the year ended december 31, 2021 as compared to the increase in net borrowings of $102.0 million on our commercial paper program during the year ended december 31,
2020. the increase in cash inflows related to proceeds from notes payable primarily resulted from the issuance of
$600.0 million of unsecured senior notes during the year ended december 31, 2021 as compared to the issuance of
$450.0 million of unsecured senior notes during the year ended december 31, 2020. the increase in cash outflows from principal payments on notes payable primarily resultedfrom the retirement of$222.0 million of privately placed unsecured senior notes, $125.0 million of publicly issued unsecured senior notes and $118.6 million of property mortgagesduring the year ended december 31, 2021 as compared tothe retirement ofa $300.0 million term loan and
$135.7 million of property mortgagesduring the year ended december 31, 2020. the increase in cash outflows from dividends paid on common shares primarily resulted from the increase in the dividend rate to $4.10 per share during the year ended december 31, 2021 as compared to the dividend rate of $4.00 per share during the year ended december
31, 2020. the increase in cash outflows from the net change in other financing activities was primarily driven by increased debt extinguishment costs paid during the year ended december 31, 2021 as compared to the year ended december 31, 2020, partially offset by increased cash inflows from contributions received from the noncontrolling interests related to our consolidated real estate entities.

unsecured revolving credit facility & commercial paper in may 2019, maalp closed on a $1.0 billion unsecured revolving credit facility with a syndicate of banks led by wells fargo bank, national association, and fourteen other banks, which we refer to as the credit facility. the credit facility replaced our previous unsecured revolving credit facility and includes an expansion option up to
$1.5 billion. the credit facility bears an interest rate of libor, plus a spread of 0.75% to 1.45% based on an investment grade pricing grid. the credit facility matures in may 2023 with an option to extend for two additional six-month periods. as of december 31, 2021, there wasno outstanding balance under the credit facility, while$4.0
million of capacity was used to support outstanding letters of credit. the credit facility serves as our primary source of short-term liquidity.
certain tenors of the usd libor (one-week and two-month) ceased publication as of december 31, 2021, and all remaining tenors of the usd libor (one, three, six and 12-month) will cease to be published after june 30, 2023.
currently, our exposure to the phase-out of libor is limited to the credit facility. the terms of the credit facility allow for the transition to an alternate benchmark interest rate, including sofr, to replace any outstanding usd libor borrowings at the time usd libor is no longer published.
in may 2019, maalp established an unsecured commercial paper program, whereby it can issue unsecured commercial paper notes with varying maturities not to exceed 397 days up to a maximum aggregate amount outstanding of $500.0
million. as of december 31, 2021, there were no outstanding borrowings under the commercial paper program.

unsecured senior notes as of december 31, 2021, maalp had $4.2 billion of publicly issued unsecured senior notes.
in july 2021, maalp retired a $72.8 million tranche of privately placed unsecured senior notes at maturity.
in august 2021, maalp publicly issued $300 million in aggregate principal amount of unsecured senior notes maturing september 2026 with a coupon rate of 1.100% per annum. interest will be paid semi-annually on march 15 and september 15 of each year beginning march 15, 2022.
in august 2021, maalp also publicly issued $300 million in aggregate principal amount of unsecured senior notes maturing september 2051 with a coupon rate of 2.875% per annum. interest will be paid semi-annually on march 15 and september 15 of each year beginning march 15, 2022.
in september 2021, maalp retired a $117.0 million tranche of privately placed unsecured senior notes due in november 2022, a $125.0 million portion of the $250.0 million in aggregate principal amount of publicly issued unsecured senior notes due in december 2022, a $12.3 million tranche of privately placed unsecured senior notes due in july 2023 and a $20.0 million tranche of privately placed unsecured senior notes due in november 2024. we incurred $13.4 million in prepayment penalties and write-offs of unamortized costs resulting from the debt retirements. these costs are included in "other non-operating income" in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations for the year ended december 31, 2021.
secured property mortgages maalp maintains secured property mortgages with various life insurance companies. as of december 31, 2021, maalp had $368.6 million of secured property mortgages with a weighted average interest rate of 4.4%. in february 2021, maalp retired a $118.6 million mortgage associated with eight apartment communities prior to its june 2021
maturity.

equity as of december 31, 2021, maa owned 115,336,876 op units, comprising a 97.3% limited partnership interest in maalp,while the remaining 3,206,118 outstanding op units were held by limited partners of maalp other than maa.
holders of op units (other than maa) may require us to redeem their op units from time to time, in which case we may, at our option, pay the redemption price either in cash (in an amount per op unit equal, in general, to the average closing price of maa's common stock on the nyse over a specified period prior to the redemption date) or by delivering one share of maa's common stock (subject to adjustment under specified circumstances) for each op unit so redeemed. maa has registered under the securities act the 3,206,118 shares of its common stock that, as of december 31, 2021, were issuable upon redemption of op units, in order for those shares to be sold freely in the public markets.
in august 2021, maa entered into two 18-month forward sale agreements with respect to a total of 1.1 million shares of its common stock at an initial forward sale price of $190.56 per share, which price is net of issuance costs.
under the forward sale agreements, the forward sale price is subject to adjustment on a daily basis based on a floating interest rate factor equal to a specified daily rate less a spread and will be decreased based on amounts related to dividends on maa's common stock during the term of the forward sale agreements. no shares had been settled under the forward sale agreements as of december 31, 2021. subject to certain conditions, we generally have the right to elect cash or net share settlement under the forward sale agreements, although we expect to settle the forward sale agreements entirely by the full physical delivery of shares of maa's common stock in exchange for cash proceeds. we intend to use any cash proceeds upon settlement of the forward sale agreements to fund our development and redevelopment activities, among other potential uses.
in november 2021, the company entered into an equity distribution agreement to establish a new atm program, replacing maa's previous atm program and allowing maa to sell shares of its common stock from time to time to or through its sales agents into the existing market at current market prices, and to enter into separate forward sales agreements to or through its forward purchasers. under its current atm program, maa has the authority to issue up to an aggregate of 4.0 million shares of its common stock, at such times to be determined by maa. maa has no obligation to issue shares through the atm program. during the years ended december 31, 2021 and 2020, maa did not sell any shares of common stock under its atm program. as of december 31, 2021, there were 4.0 million shares remaining under the current atm program.

primarily comprised of a ground lease underlying one apartment community we own and the lease of our corporate headquarters.
as of december 31, 2021, we also had contractual obligations, which are not reflected in the table above, to make additional capital contributions to two technology-focused limited partnerships in which we hold equity interests.
the capital contributions may be called by the general partners at any time until february 2025 after giving appropriate notice. as of december 31, 2021, we had committed to make additional capital contributions totaling up to $16.0 million if and when called by the general partners of the limited partnerships and until february 2025.
we have other material cash requirements that do not represent contractual obligations, but we expect to incur in the ordinary course of our business.
as of december 31, 2021, we had six development communities under construction totaling 2,021 apartment units once complete. total expected costs for the six development projects are $460.5 million, of which $273.7 million had been incurred through december 31, 2021. we expect to have additional development projects in the future. in addition, our property development and repositioning activities are ongoing, and we incur expenditures relating to recurring capital replacements, which typically include scheduled carpet replacement, new roofs, hvac units, plumbing, concrete, masonry and other paving, pools and various exterior building improvements. for the year ending december 31, 2022, we expect that our total capital expenditures relating to our development activities, our property redevelopment and repositioning activities and recurring capital replacements will be in line with our total capital expenditures for the year ended december 31, 2021.
we typically declare cash dividends on maa's common stock on a quarterly basis, subject to approval by maa's board of directors. we expect to pay quarterly dividends at an annual rate of $4.35 per share of maa common stock during the year ending december 31, 2022.
inflation our resident leases at our apartment communities allow for adjustments in the rental rate at the time of renewal, which may enable us to seek rent increases. the majority of our leases are for one year or less. the short-term nature of these leases generally serves to reduce our risk to adverse effects of inflation.
critical accounting estimates a critical accounting estimate is one that is both important to our financial condition and results of operations and that involves some degree of uncertainty. the preceding discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto, which have been prepared in accordance with gaap. the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management to make a number of estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. on an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates and assumptions based upon historical experience and various other factors and circumstances. we believe that our estimates and assumptions are reasonable under the circumstances; however, actual results may differ from these estimates and assumptions.
we believe that the estimates and assumptions summarized below are most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations because they involve a significant level of estimation uncertainty and they have had, or are reasonably likely to have, a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations.
acquisition of real estate assets we account for our acquisitions of investments in real estate as asset acquisitions in accordance with accounting standards codification topic 805,business combinations,which requires the cost of the real estate acquired to be allocated to the individual acquired tangible assets, consisting of land, buildings and improvements and other, and identified intangible assets, consisting of the value of in-place leases and other contracts, on a relative fair value basis. in calculating the asset value of acquired tangible and intangible assets, management may use significant subjective inputs, including forecasted net operating income, or noi, and market
35
specific capitalization and discount rates. management analyzes historical stabilized noi to determine its estimate for forecasted noi. management estimates the market capitalization rate by analyzing the market capitalization rates for sold properties with comparable ages in similarly sized markets. management allocates the purchase price of the asset acquisition based on the relative fair value of the individual components as a proportion of the total assets acquired. during the years ended december 31, 2021 and 2020, we did not acquire any real estate assets that required us to allocate the cost of the real estate asset to the individual acquired tangible and intangible assets.
impairment of long-lived assets we account for long-lived assets in accordance with the provisions of accounting standards for the impairment or disposal of long-lived assets. management periodically evaluates long-lived assets, including investments in real estate, for indicators that would suggest that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable. the judgments regarding the existence of such indicators are based on factors such as operating performance, market conditions and legal factors. long-lived assets, such as real estate assets, equipment, right-of-use lease assets and purchased intangibles subject to amortization, are grouped with other assets and liabilities at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities, or an asset group. management generally considers the individual assets of an apartment community to collectively represent an asset group. recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset. if the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its estimated future cash flows, an impairment charge is recognized for the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset. management calculates the fair value of an asset by dividing estimated future cash flows by a market capitalization rate. no material impairment losses were recognized during the years ended december 31, 2021 and 2020.
our impairment assessments contain uncertainties because they require management to make assumptions and to apply judgment to estimate future cash flows and the fair value of the assets. key assumptions used in estimating future cash flows and the fair value of an asset include projecting an apartment community's noi, estimating asset useful lives, disposition dates and recurring capital expenditures, as well as selecting an appropriate market capitalization rate. management considers its apartment communities' historical stabilized noi performance, local market economics and the business environment impacting our apartment communities as the basis in projecting forecasted noi, which management believes is representative of future cash flows. management estimates the market capitalization rate by analyzing the market capitalization rates for sold properties with comparable ages in similarly sized markets. these estimates are subjective and our ability to realize future cash flows and asset fair values is affected by factors such as ongoing maintenance and improvement of the assets, changes in economic conditions and changes in operating performance.
loss contingencies the outcomes of claims, disputes and legal proceedings are subject to significant uncertainty. management records an accrual for loss contingencies when a loss is probable and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated.
we also accrue an estimate of defense costs expected to be incurred in connection with legal matters. management reviews these accruals quarterly and makes revisions based on changes in facts and circumstances. when a loss contingency is not both probable and reasonably estimable, then we do not accrue the loss. however, for material loss contingencies, if the unrecorded loss (or an additional loss in excess of the accrual) is at least a reasonable possibility and material, then management discloses a reasonable estimate of the possible loss, or range of loss, if such reasonable estimate can be made. if we cannot make a reasonable estimate of the possible loss, or range of loss, then a statement to that effect is disclosed.
the assessment of whether a loss is probable or a reasonable possibility, and whether the loss or range of loss is reasonably estimable, often involves a series of complex and qualitative judgments about future events. among the factors that we consider in this assessment, including with respect to the matters disclosed in this annual report on form 10-k, are the nature of existing legal proceedings and claims, the asserted or possible damages or loss contingency (if reasonably estimable), the progress of the matter, existing law and precedent, the opinions or views of legal counsel and other advisers, our experience in similar matters, the facts available to us at the time of assessment, and how we intend to respond, or have responded, to the proceeding or claim. management's assessment of these factors may change over time as individual proceedings or claims progress. for matters where we are not currently able to reasonably estimate a range of reasonably possible loss, the factors that have contributed to this determination include the following: (i) the damages sought are indeterminate; (ii) the proceedings are in the early stages; (iii) the matters involve novel or unsettled legal theories or a large or uncertain number of actual or potential cases or parties; and/or (iv) discussions with the parties in matters that are expected ultimately to be resolved through negotiation and settlement have not reached the point where we believe a reasonable estimate of loss, or range of loss, can be made. in such instances, management believes that there is considerable uncertainty regarding the timing or ultimate resolution of such matters, including a possible eventual loss or business impact, if any.

valuation of embedded derivative the redemption feature embedded in the maa series i preferred stock is reported as a derivative asset and is adjusted to its fair value at each reporting date, with a corresponding non-cash adjustment to the income statement. the derivative asset related to the redemption feature is valued using widely accepted valuation techniques, including a discounted cash flow analysis in which the perpetual value of the preferred shares is compared to the value of the preferred shares assuming the call option is exercised, with the value of the bifurcated call option as the difference between the two values. the analysis reflects the contractual terms of the redeemable preferred shares, which are redeemable at our option beginning on october 1, 2026 and at the redemption price of $50 per share. we use various significant inputs in the analysis, including trading data available on the preferred shares, coupon yields on preferred stock issuances from reits with similar credit ratings as maa and treasury rates to determine the fair value of the bifurcated call option. as a result of the adjustments recorded to reflect the change in fair value of the derivative asset, the fair value of the embedded derivative asset decreased to $34.5 million as of december 31, 2021 as compared to $39.0 million as of december 31, 2020, a decrease in value of the asset of $4.5 million.
arriving at the valuation of the embedded derivative requires a significant amount of subjective judgment by management, and the valuation of the embedded derivative is highly sensitive to changes in certain inputs in the analysis. for example, changes in the inputs of the trading data available on the preferred shares, coupon yields on preferred stock issuances from reits with similar credit ratings as maa and treasury rates could cause the valuation of the embedded derivative to materially change from the recorded balance as of december 31, 2021. for instance, holding all other assumptions constant, a $1 decrease in the trading price of the preferred shares as of december 31, 2021 would result in a decrease in fair value of the embedded derivative asset of approximately $6
million.

market risk includes risks that arise from changes in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates, commodity prices, equity prices and other market changes that affect market sensitive instruments. our primary market risk exposure is to changes in interest rates on our borrowings. as of december 31, 2021, 14.2% of our total market capitalization consisted of debt borrowings. our interest rate risk objective is to limit the impact of interest rate fluctuations on earnings and cash flows and to lower our overall borrowing costs. to achieve this objective, we manage our exposure to fluctuations in market interest rates for borrowings through the use of fixed rate debt instruments and from time to time interest rate swaps to effectively fix the interest rate on anticipated future debt transactions. we use our best efforts to have our debt instruments mature across multiple years, which we believe limits our exposure to interest rate changes in any one year. we do not enter into derivative instruments for trading or other speculative purposes. as of december 31, 2021, 100.0% of our outstanding debt was subject to fixed rates. we regularly review interest rate exposure on outstanding borrowings in an effort to minimize the risk of interest rate fluctuations.

report of independent registered public accounting firm to the shareholders and the board of directors of mid-america apartment communities, inc.
opinion on the financial statements we have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of mid-america apartment communities, inc. (the company) as of december 31, 2021 and 2020, the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income, equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended december 31, 2021, and the related notes and financial statement schedule listed in the index at item 15(a)(2) (collectively referred to as the "consolidated financial statements"). in our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the company at december 31, 2021 and 2020, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended december 31, 2021, in conformity with u.s.
generally accepted accounting principles.
we also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the public company accounting oversight board (united states) (pcaob), the company's internal control over financial reporting as of december 31, 2021, based on criteria established in internal control-integrated framework issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission (2013 framework) and our report dated february 17, 2022 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.
basis for opinion these financial statements are the responsibility of the company's management. our responsibility is to express an opinion on the company's financial statements based on our audits. we are a public accounting firm registered with the pcaob and are required to be independent with respect to the company in accordance with the u.s. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the securities and exchange commission and the pcaob.
we conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the pcaob. those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. we believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
critical audit matters the critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective or complex judgments. the communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.
loss contingencies as discussed in note 11 to the consolidated financial statements, two separate putative class action lawsuits were filed against the company in 2016 and 2017.
the lawsuits both relate to purported violations of a late-fee statute in the state of texas. in 2018, the district court granted the plaintiffs' motions for partial summary judgment and class certification. the company appealed the class certifications to the fifth circuit court of appeals. in 2021, the fifth circuit court of appeals issued its opinions finding error in the district court's analysis of the texas late-fee statute and remanding the lawsuits to the district court to determine if class certifications are appropriate in light of the fifth circuit court of appeals' ruling. if the plaintiff classes are recertified, description of the matter    management estimates that the company's maximum exposure in the lawsuits is $63.0
million.auditing management's evaluation of an accrual for, and disclosure of, loss contingencies related to the class action lawsuits was especially challenging because management's evaluation of the likelihood and amount of loss and range of potential loss is highly subjective and requires significant judgment. in particular, management's evaluation considers, among other factors, the nature of the claim, the asserted or possible damages, the progress of the matter, existing law and precedent, the opinions or views of legal counsel and other advisors, the company's experience in similar matters, the facts available at the time of the assessment, and how the company intends to respond, or has responded, to the claim, which involves a series of complex judgments about future events.
f-1
we obtained an understanding, evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of controls over the evaluation of the class action lawsuits, including controls related to the company's assessment and measurement of its estimate of maximum exposure. for example, we tested controls over management's review and approval of the legal reserves and related disclosures.to test the company's assessment of the probability of incurrence of a loss and whether the loss was reasonably estimable, our audit procedures included, among others, reading summaries of the proceedings and related how we addressed the matter in our audit    lawsuit correspondence, requesting and receiving written responses to our inquiries of internal and external legal counsel and meeting with internal and external legal counsel to discuss developments related to the legal matters and case progression.  to test the measurement of management's estimate of maximum exposure, among other procedures, we evaluated the method of measuring the maximum exposure and related assumptions, tested the accuracy and completeness of the data, and reviewed correspondence received from internal and external counsel used to determine the estimate of maximum exposure that was disclosed.
valuation of embedded derivative as disclosed in notes 6 and 8 to the consolidated financial statements, the series i preferred stock shares ("preferred shares") include a redemption feature which represents an embedded call option exercisable at the company's option beginning on october 1, 2026 at the redemption price of $50 per share. the embedded call option has been bifurcated as a separate asset and is valued at fair value each reporting period with changes in its fair value reported in earnings. at each reporting date, management performs an analysis which compares the perpetual value of the description of the matter                   preferred shares to the value of the preferred shares assuming the call option is exercised, with the value of the bifurcated call option as the difference between the two values. at december 31,
2021, the fair value of the company's embedded derivative asset was
$34.5 million. auditing the company's valuation of this bifurcated embedded derivative was challenging as the company uses a complex valuation methodology that incorporates various inputs, including trading data available on the preferred shares, treasury rates and coupon yields on preferred stock issuances from reits with similar credit ratings, and includes significant assumptions about economic and market conditions with uncertain future outcomes.
we obtained an understanding, evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of the company's controls over the risks of material misstatement relating to the valuation of the bifurcated embedded derivative asset. for example, we tested controls over management's review of the valuation model and the underlying inputs and assumptions noted above. to test the valuation of the embedded derivative asset, our audit procedures included, among how we addressed the matter in our audit    others, assessing the methodology used in the valuation model and testing the significant assumptions discussed above. for example, we evaluated management's assumptions by comparing the coupon rate that was used to discount future dividend payments from the preferred stock to observable market data. we also assessed the completeness and accuracy of the underlying data used by the company in its valuation. in addition, we involved our valuation specialists to assist in our evaluation of the methodology used by the company and the underlying inputs and assumptions noted above.

definition and limitations of internal control over financial reporting a company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. a company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

mid-america apartment communities, inc. and mid-america apartments, l.p.
notes to consolidatedfinancial statements years ended december 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019
1. organization and summary of significant accounting policies unless the context otherwise requires, all references to the "company" refer collectively to mid-america apartment communities, inc., together with its consolidated subsidiaries, including mid-america apartments, l.p. unless the context otherwise requires, all references to "maa" refer only to mid-america apartment communities, inc., and not any of its consolidated subsidiaries. unless the context otherwise requires, the references to the "operating partnership" or "maalp" refer to mid-america apartments, l.p. together with its consolidated subsidiaries. "common stock" refers to the common stock of maa and, unless the context otherwise requires, "shareholders" refers to the holders of shares of maa's common stock. the common units of limited partnership interests in the operating partnership are referred to as "op units," and the holders of the op units are referred to as "common unitholders."
as of december 31, 2021, maa owned115,336,876op units (or97.3%of the total number of op units). maa conducts substantially all of its business and holds substantially all of its assets, directly or indirectly, through the operating partnership, and by virtue of its ownership of the op units and being the operating partnership's sole general partner, maa has the ability to control all of the day-to-day operations of the operating partnership.
management believes combining the notes to the consolidated financial statements of maa and the operating partnership results in the following benefits:
• enhances a readers' understanding of maa and the operating partnership by enabling the reader to view the business as a whole in the same manner that management views and operates the business;
• eliminates duplicative disclosure and provides a more streamlined and readable presentation since a substantial portion of the disclosure applies to both maa and the operating partnership; and
• creates time and cost efficiencies through the preparation of one combined set of notes instead of two separate sets.
maa, an s&p 500 company, is a multifamily-focused, self-administered and self-managed real estate investment trust, or reit. management operates maa and the operating partnership as one business. the management of the company is comprised of individuals who are officers of maa and employees of the operating partnership. management believes it is important to understand the few differences between maa and the operating partnership in the context of how maa and the operating partnership operate as a consolidated company. maa and the operating partnership are structured as an umbrella partnership reit, or upreit. maa's interest in the operating partnership entitles maa to share in cash distributions from, and in the profits and losses of, the operating partnership in proportion to maa's percentage interest therein and entitles maa to vote on substantially all matters requiring a vote of the partners.
maa's only material asset is its ownership of limited partnership interests in the operating partnership (other than cash held by maa from time to time); therefore, maa's primary function is acting as the sole general partner of the operating partnership, issuing public equity from time to time and guaranteeing certain debt of the operating partnership from time to time. the operating partnership holds, directly or indirectly, all of the company's real estate assets. except for net proceeds from public equity issuances by maa, which are contributed to the operating partnership in exchange for limited partnership interests, the operating partnership generates the capital required by the business through the operating partnership's operations, direct or indirect incurrence of indebtedness and issuance of op units.
the presentations of maa's shareholders' equity and the operating partnership's capital are the principal areas of difference between the consolidated financial statements of maa and those of the operating partnership. maa's shareholders' equity may include shares of preferred stock, shares of common stock, additional paid-in capital, cumulative earnings, cumulative distributions, noncontrolling interests, treasury shares, accumulated other comprehensive income or loss and redeemable common stock. the operating partnership's capital may include common capital and preferred capital of the general partner (maa), limited partners' common capital and preferred capital, noncontrolling interests, accumulated other comprehensive income or loss and redeemable common units. holders of op units (other than maa) may require the operating partnership to redeem their op units from time to time, in which case the operating partnership may, at its option, pay the redemption price either in cash (in an amount per op unit equal, in general, to the average closing price of maa's common stock on the new york stock exchange, or nyse, over a specified period prior to the redemption date) or by delivering one share of maa's common stock (subject to adjustment under specified circumstances) for each op unit so redeemed.

the company owns, operates, acquires and selectively develops apartment communities primarily located in the southeast, southwest and mid-atlantic regions of the united states. as of december 31, 2021, the company owned and operated290apartment communities (which does not include development communities under construction) through the operating partnership and its subsidiaries and had an ownership interest inoneapartment community through an unconsolidated real estate joint venture. as of december 31, 2021, the company also had six development communities under construction, totaling2,021apartment units once complete. total expected costs for thesixdevelopment projects are$460.5million, of which$273.7millionhad been incurred through december 31, 2021. the company expects to completethreeof these developments in 2022 andthreedevelopments in 2023. as ofdecember 31, 2021,33of the company's apartment communities included retail components. the company's apartment communities, including development communities under construction, were located across16states and the district of columbia as of december 31, 2021.
basis of presentation and principles of consolidation the accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared by the company's management in accordance with united states generally accepted accounting principles, or gaap, and applicable rules and regulations of the securities and exchange commission, or the sec. the consolidated financial statements of maa presented herein include the accounts of maa, the operating partnership and all other subsidiaries in which maa has a controlling financial interest. maa owns, directly or indirectly, approximately 80
% to 100 % of all consolidated subsidiaries, including the operating partnership. in management's opinion, all adjustments necessary for a fair presentation of the consolidated financial statements have been included, and all such adjustments were of a normal recurring nature. all significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. the company invests in entities which may qualify as variable interest entities, or vies, and maalp is considered a vie. a vie is a legal entity in which the equity investors lack sufficient equity at risk for the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support or, as a group, the holders of the equity investment at risk lack the power to direct the activities of a legal entity as well as the obligation to absorb its expected losses or the right to receive its expected residual returns. maalp is classified as a vie because the limited partners lack substantive kick-out rights and substantive participating rights. the company consolidates all vies for which it is the primary beneficiary and uses the equity method to account for investments that qualify as vies but for which it is not the primary beneficiary. in determining whether the company is the primary beneficiary of a vie, management considers both qualitative and quantitative factors, including, but not limited to, those activities that most significantly impact the vie's economic performance and which party controls such activities. the company uses the equity method of accounting for its investments in entities for which the company exercises significant influence but does not have the ability to exercise control. the factors considered in determining whether the company has the ability to exercise control include ownership of voting interests and participatory rights of investors (see "investments in unconsolidated affiliates" below).
noncontrolling interests as of december 31, 2021, the company had two types of noncontrolling interests with respect to its consolidated subsidiaries: (1) noncontrolling interests related to the common unitholders of its operating partnership; and (2) noncontrolling interests related to its consolidated real estate entities. the noncontrolling interests relating to the limited partnership interests in the operating partnership are owned by the holders of the class a op units. maa is the sole general partner of the operating partnership and holds all of the outstanding class b op units. net income (after allocations to preferred ownership interests) is allocated to maa and the noncontrolling interests based on their respective ownership percentages of the operating partnership.
issuance of additional class a op units or class b op units changes the ownership percentage of both the noncontrolling interests and maa. the issuance of class b op units generally occurs when maa issues common stock and the issuance proceeds are contributed to the operating partnership in exchange for class b op units equal to the number of shares of maa's common stock issued. at each reporting period, the allocation between total maa shareholders' equity and noncontrolling interests is adjusted to account for the change in the respective percentage ownership of the underlying equity of the operating partnership. maa's board of directors established economic rights in respect to each class a op unit that were equivalent to the economic rights in respect to each share of maa common stock. see note 9 for additional details.
the noncontrolling interests relating to the company's five consolidated real estate entities are owned by private real estate companies that are generally responsible for the development, construction and lease-up of the apartment communities that are owned through the consolidated real estate entities with a noncontrolling interest.
the entities were determined to be vie's with the company designated as the primary beneficiary. as a result, the accounts of the entities are consolidated by the company. as of december 31, 2021, the consolidated assets and liabilities of the company's consolidated real estate entities with a noncontrolling interest were $ 252.8 million and $ 15.9 million , respectively. as of december 31, 2020, the consolidated assets and liabilities of the company's consolidated real estate entities with a noncontrolling interest were $ 128.9 million and $ 8.1 million , respectively.

real estate assets and depreciation and amortization real estate assets are carried at depreciated cost and consist of land, buildings and improvements and other, and development and capital improvements in progress (see
"development costs" below). repairs and maintenance costs are expensed as incurred, while significant improvements, renovations and recurring capital replacements are capitalized and depreciated over their estimated useful lives.
recurring capital replacements typically include scheduled carpet replacement, new roofs, hvac units, plumbing, concrete, masonry and other paving, pools and various exterior building improvements. in addition to these costs, the company also capitalizes salary costs directly identifiable with renovation work. these expenditures extend the useful life of the property and increase the property's fair market value. the cost of interior painting and blinds are typically expensed as incurred. depreciation is computed on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the related assets, which range from three to 40 years. the line item "buildings and improvements and other" in the consolidated balance sheets includes land improvements and buildings, which have a useful life ranging from five to 40 years , as well as furniture, fixtures and equipment, which have a useful life of three to five years .
development costs development projects and the related carrying costs, including interest, property taxes, insurance and allocated direct development salary costs during the construction period, are capitalized and reported in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets as "development and capital improvements in progress"
during the construction period. interest is capitalized in accordance with accounting standards governing the capitalization of interest. upon completion and certification for occupancy of individual buildings or floors within a development, amounts representing the completed portion of total estimated development costs for the project are transferred to "buildings and improvements and other" as real estate held for investment.
capitalization of interest, property taxes, insurance and allocated direct development salary costs cease upon the transfer. the assets are depreciated over their estimated useful lives. total capitalized costs (including capitalized interest, salaries and real estate taxes) during the years ended december 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019 were
$ 16.6 million , $ 12.7 million and $ 6.5 million , respectively. certain costs associated with the lease-up of development projects, including cost of model units, furnishings and signs, are capitalized and amortized over their respective estimated useful lives. all other costs relating to renting development projects are expensed as incurred.
acquisition of real estate assets in accordance with accounting standards codification ("asc") topic 805, business combinations , most acquisitions of operating properties qualify as an asset acquisition. accordingly, the cost of the real estate acquired, including acquisition costs, is allocated to the acquired tangible assets, consisting of land, buildings and improvements and other, and identified intangible assets, consisting of the value of in-place leases and other contracts, on a relative fair value basis. acquisition costs include appraisal fees, title fees, broker fees and other legal costs to acquire the property. the purchase price of an acquired property is allocated based on the relative fair value of the individual components as a proportion of the total assets acquired. the company allocates the cost of the tangible assets of an acquired property by valuing the building as if it were vacant, based on management's determination of the relative fair values of these assets. management determines the as-if-vacant fair value of a building using methods similar to those used by independent appraisers. these methods include using stabilized net operating income, or noi, and market specific capitalization and discount rates. the company allocates the cost of land based on its relative fair value if acquired with a multifamily community or by the actual purchase price adjusted to an allocation of the relative fair value if acquired separately. in allocating the cost of identified intangible assets of an acquired property, the in-place leases are valued based on current rent rates and time and cost to lease a unit. management concluded that the residential leases acquired in connection with each of its property acquisitions approximate at-market rates since the residential lease terms generally do not extend beyond one year. for residential leases, the fair value of the in-place leases and resident relationships is amortized over the remaining term of the resident leases. for retail and commercial leases, the fair value of in-place leases and tenant relationships is amortized over the remaining term of the leases. the net amount of these lease intangibles included in "other assets" totaled $ 0.9 million and $ 1.3 million as of december
31, 2021 and 2020 , respectively.
impairment of long-lived assets the company accounts for long-lived assets in accordance with the provisions of accounting standards for the impairment or disposal of long-lived assets. management periodically evaluates long-
lived assets, including investments in real estate, for indicators that would suggest that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable. the judgments regarding the existence of such indicators are based on factors such as operating performance, market conditions and legal factors. long-lived assets, such as real estate assets, equipment and purchased intangibles subject to amortization, are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by f- 19 the asset. if the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its estimated future cash flows, an impairment charge is recognized for the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset. assets to be disposed of are separately presented in the consolidated balance sheets, are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell and are no longer depreciated. the assets and liabilities of a disposed group or a property classified as held for sale are presented separately in the appropriate asset and liability sections of the consolidated balance sheets.
undeveloped land undeveloped land includes sites intended for future multifamily developments and sites for future commercial development, which are carried at the lower of cost or fair value in accordance with gaap. any costs incurred prior to commencement of pre-development activities are expensed as incurred.
cash and cash equivalents investments in money market accounts and certificates of deposit with original maturities of three months or less are considered to be cash equivalents.
restricted cash restricted cash consists of security deposits required to be held separately, escrow deposits held by lenders for property taxes, insurance, debt service and replacement reserves, and exchanges under section
1031(b) of the internal revenue code of 1986, as amended, or the code. section 1031(b) exchanges are presented within cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash reported in the consolidated statements of cash flows.
investments in unconsolidated affiliates the company uses the equity method to account for its investments in a real estate joint venture and two technology-focused limited partnerships that each qualify as a vie. management determined the company is not the primary beneficiary in any of these investments but does have the ability to exert significant influence over the operations and financial policies of the real estate joint venture and considers its investments in the limited partnerships to be more than minor. the company's investment in the real estate joint venture was $ 42.8 million and $ 43.3 million as of december 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. as of december 31, 2021 and 2020, the company's investments in the technology-focused limited partnerships were $ 79.4
million and $ 23.0 million , respectively, and are included in "other assets" in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. the increase in the company's investment in the limited partnerships was driven by the recognition of unrealized gains, which were primarily a result of an increase in the valuation of an underlying investment that recently became publicly traded. as of december 31, 2021, the company was committed until february 2025 to make additional capital contributions totaling $ 16.0 million if and when called by the general partners of the limited partnerships.
other assets other assets consist primarily of receivables and deposits from residents, the value of derivative contracts, right-of-use lease assets, investments in technology-focused limited partnerships, deferred rental concessions, deferred financing costs relating to a revolving credit facility and other prepaid expenses. also included in other assets are the fair market value of in-place leases and resident relationships, net of accumulated amortization.

loss contingencies the outcomes of claims, disputes and legal proceedings are subject to significant uncertainty. the company records an accrual for loss contingencies when a loss is probable and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated.
the company also accrues an estimate of defense costs expected to be incurred in connection with legal matters.
management reviews these accruals quarterly and makes revisions based on changes in facts and circumstances. when a loss contingency is not both probable and reasonably estimable, management does not accrue the loss. however, if the loss (or an additional loss in excess of the accrual) is at least a reasonable possibility and material, then management discloses a reasonable estimate of the possible loss, or range of loss, if such reasonable estimate can be made. if the company cannot make a reasonable estimate of the possible loss, or range of loss, then a statement to that effect is disclosed.
the assessment of whether a loss is probable or a reasonable possibility, and whether the loss or range of loss is reasonably estimable, often involves a series of complex judgments about future events. among the factors considered in this assessment, are the nature of existing legal proceedings and claims, the asserted or possible damages or loss contingency (if reasonably estimable), the progress of the matter, existing law and precedent, the opinions or views of legal counsel and other advisers, management's experience in similar matters, the facts available to management at the time of assessment, and how the company intends to respond, or has responded, to the proceeding or claim. management's assessment of these factors may change over time as individual proceedings or claims progress. for matters where management is not currently able to reasonably estimate a range of reasonably possible loss, the factors that have contributed to this determination include the following: (i) the damages sought are indeterminate; (ii) the proceedings are in the early stages; (iii) the matters involve novel or unsettled legal theories or a large or uncertain number of actual or potential cases or parties; and/or (iv)
discussions with the parties in matters that are ultimately expected to be resolved through negotiation and settlement have not reached the point where management believes a reasonable estimate of loss, or range of loss, can be made. the company believes that there is considerable uncertainty regarding the timing or ultimate resolution of such matters, including a possible eventual loss or business impact, if any. see note 11 for additional disclosures regarding loss contingencies.
equity forward sale agreements maa has entered into, and in the future may enter into, forward sale agreements for the sale and issuance of shares of its common stock, either through an underwritten public offering or through maa's at-the-market share offering program, or atm program. when maa enters into a forward sale agreement, the contract requires maa to sell its shares to a counterparty at a predetermined price at a future date, which price is subject to adjustment during the term of the contract for maa's anticipated dividends as well as for a daily interest factor that varies with changes in the federal funds rate. maa generally has the ability to determine the dates and method of settlement
(i.e., gross physical settlement, net share settlement or cash settlement), subject to certain conditions and the right of the counterparty to accelerate settlement under certain circumstances. the company accounts for the shares of maa's common stock reserved for issuance upon settlement as equity in accordance with asc topic 815-40,contracts in entity's own equity, which permits equity classification when a contract is considered indexed to its own stock and the contract requires or permits the issuing entity to settle the contract in shares (either physically or net in shares).
the guidance in asc topic 815-40 establishes a two-step process for evaluating whether an equity-linked financial instrument is considered indexed to its own stock by evaluating the instrument's contingent exercise provisions and the instrument's settlement f-21
provisions. in evaluating the forward sale agreements maa has entered into, management concluded that (i) none of the agreements' exercise contingencies are based on observable markets or indices besides those related to the market of maa's common stock price; and (ii) none of the settlement provisions preclude the agreements from being indexed to maa's common stock.
before the issuance of shares of maa's common stock, upon physical or net share settlement of the forward sale agreements, maa expects the shares issuable upon settlement of the forward sale agreements will be reflected in its diluted earnings per share calculations using the treasury stock method. under this method, the number of shares of common stock used in calculating diluted earnings per share is deemed to be increased by the excess, if any, of the number of shares of common stock that would be issued upon full physical settlement of the forward sale agreements over the number of shares of common stock that could be purchased by maa in the open market (based on the average market price during the period) using the proceeds to be received upon full physical settlement (based on the adjusted forward sale price at the end of the reporting period). when maa physically or net share settles a forward sale agreement, the delivery of shares of common stock would result in an increase in the number of weighted average common shares outstanding and dilution to basic earnings per share. see note 8 for additional disclosures regarding the equity forward sale agreements.
revenue recognition the company primarily leases multifamily residential apartments to residents under operating leases generally due on a monthly basis with terms of approximately one year or less. rental revenues are recognized in accordance with asc topic 842, leases , using a method that represents a straight-line basis over the term of the lease. in addition, in circumstances where a lease incentive is provided to residents, the incentive is recognized as a reduction of rental revenues on a straight-line basis over the reasonably assured lease term.
rental revenues represent approximately 93 % of the company's total revenues and include gross rents charged less adjustments for concessions and bad debt. approximately 6 % of the company's total revenues represent non-lease reimbursable property revenues from its residents for utility reimbursements, which are generally recognized and due on a monthly basis as residents obtain control of the service over the term of the lease. the remaining 1 % of the company's total revenues represents other non-lease property revenues primarily driven by nonrefundable fees and commissions.
in accordance with asc topic 842, rental revenues and non-lease reimbursable property revenues meet the criteria to be aggregated into a single lease component and are reported on a combined basis in the line item "rental revenues," as presented in the disaggregation of the company's revenues in note 13. other non-lease property revenues are accounted for in accordance with asc topic 606, revenue from contracts with customers , which requires revenue recognized outside of the scope of asc topic 842 to be recognized when a customer obtains control of promised goods or services in an amount that reflects the consideration the entity expects to receive in exchange for those goods or services. other non-lease property revenues are reported in the line item "other property revenues", as presented in the disaggregation of the company's revenues in note 13.
rental costs costs associated with rental activities are expensed as incurred and include advertising expenses, which were $ 23.9 million , $ 23.9 million and $ 20.8 million for the years ended december 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.
leases the company is the lessee under certain ground, office, equipment and other operational leases, all of which are accounted for as operating leases in accordance with asc topic 842. the company recognizes a right-of-use asset for the right to use the underlying asset for all leases where the company is the lessee with terms of more than twelve months, and a related lease liability for the obligation to make lease payments. expenses related to leases determined to be operating leases are recognized on a straight-line basis. as of december 31, 2021 and 2020, right-
of-use assets recorded within "other assets" totaled $ 47.0 million and $ 49.4 million , respectively, and related lease obligations recorded within "accrued expenses and other liabilities" totaled $ 30.3 million and $ 31.7
million , respectively, in the consolidated balance sheets. lease expense recognized for the years ended december
31, 2021, 2020 and 2019 was immaterial to the company. cash paid for amounts included in the measurement of operating lease liabilities during the years ended december 31, 2021 and 2020 was also immaterial. see note 11 for additional disclosures regarding leases.
income taxes maa has elected to be taxed as a reit under the code and intends to continue to operate in such a manner. the current and continuing qualification as a reit depends on maa's ability to meet the various requirements imposed by the code, which are related to organizational structure, distribution levels, diversity of stock ownership and certain requirements with respect to the nature and diversity of maa's assets and sources of maa's gross income. as long as maa qualifies for taxation as a reit, it will generally not be subject to united states federal corporate income tax on its taxable income that is currently distributed to shareholders. this treatment substantially eliminates the "double taxation" (i.e., income taxation at both the corporate and shareholder levels) that generally results from an investment in a corporation. even if maa qualifies as a reit, maa may be subject to united states federal income and excise taxes in certain situations, such as if maa fails to distribute timely all of its taxable income with f- 22 respect to a taxable year. maa also will be required to pay a 100% tax on any net income on non-arm's length transactions between maa and one of its taxable reit subsidiaries, or trs. furthermore, maa and its shareholders may be subject to state or local taxation in various state or local jurisdictions, including those in which maa transacts business or its shareholders reside, and the applicable state and local tax laws may not conform to the united states federal income tax treatment. any taxes imposed on maa would reduce its operating cash flows and net income. the company has elected trs status for certain of its corporate subsidiaries. as a result, the trs incur both federal and state income taxes on any taxable income after consideration of any net operating losses. the trs use the liability method of accounting for income taxes.
deferred income tax assets and liabilities are recognized for future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases.
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities from a change in tax rate is recognized in earnings in the period of the enactment date. a valuation allowance is provided when it is more likely than not that all or some portion of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. the company recognizes liabilities for uncertain income tax positions based on a two-step process. the first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit, including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes, if any. the second step requires the company to estimate and measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more likely than not to be realized upon ultimate settlement.
see note 7 for additional disclosures regarding income taxes.
fair value measurements the company applies the guidance in asc topic 820, fair value measurements and disclosures , to the valuation of real estate assets recorded at fair value, to its impairment valuation analysis of real estate assets, to its disclosure of the fair value of financial instruments, principally indebtedness, and to its disclosure of the fair value of its derivative financial instruments. fair value disclosures required under asc topic 820 as well as the company's derivative accounting policies are summarized in note 6 utilizing the following hierarchy: level 1 - quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that are accessible at the measurement date. level 2 - inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly. level 3 - unobservable inputs for the assets or liability.
use of estimates management has made a number of estimates and assumptions relating to the reporting of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses to prepare these financial statements and notes in conformity with gaap. actual results could differ from those estimates.
2. earnings per common share of maa basic earnings per share is computed using the two-class method by dividing net income available to maa common shareholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period. all outstanding unvested restricted share awards contain rights to non-forfeitable dividends and participate in undistributed earnings with shareholders and, accordingly, are considered participating securities that are included in the two-
class method of computing basic earnings per share. both the unvested restricted shares and other potentially dilutive common shares, and the related impact to earnings, are considered when calculating earnings per share on a diluted basis with diluted earnings per share being the more dilutive of the treasury stock or two-class methods.
op units are included in dilutive earnings per share calculations when the units are dilutive to earnings per share.

3. earnings per op unit of maalp basic earnings per common unit is computed using the two-class method by dividing net income available for common unitholders by the weighted average number of op units outstanding during the period. all outstanding unvested restricted unit awards contain rights to non-forfeitable distributions and participate in undistributed earnings with common unitholders and, accordingly, are considered participating securities that are included in the two-
class method of computing basic earnings per common unit. diluted earnings per common unit reflects the potential dilution that could occur if securities or other contracts to issue op units were exercised or converted into op units. both the unvested restricted unit awards and other potentially dilutive common units, and the related impact to earnings, are considered when calculating earnings per common unit on a diluted basis with diluted earnings per common unit being the more dilutive of the treasury stock or two-class methods.
for theyears ended december 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, maalp's diluted earnings per common unit was computed using the treasury stock method as presented below (dollars and units in thousands, except per unit amounts):

4. stock-based compensation overview maa accounts for its stock-based employee compensation plans in accordance with accounting standards governing stock-based compensation. these standards require an entity to measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of an equity instrument based on the award's fair value on the grant date and recognize the cost over the period during which the employee is required to provide service in exchange for the award, which is generally the vesting period. any liability awards issued are remeasured at each reporting period.
maa's stock compensation plans consist of a number of incentives provided to attract and retain independent directors, executive officers and key employees. incentives are currently granted under the second amended and restated 2013 stock incentive plan, or the stock plan, which was approved at the 2018 annual meeting of maa shareholders. the stock plan allows for the grant of restricted stock and stock options up to2,000,000shares. maa believes that such awards better align the interests of its employees with those of its shareholders.
compensation expense is generally recognized for service based restricted stock awards using the straight-line method over the vesting period of the shares regardless of cliff or ratable vesting distinctions. compensation expense for market and performance based restricted stock awards is generally recognized using the accelerated amortization method with each vesting tranche valued as a separate award, with a separate vesting date, consistent with the estimated value of the award at each period end. additionally, compensation expense is adjusted for actual forfeitures for all awards in the period that the award was forfeited. compensation expense for stock options is generally recognized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period. maa presents stock compensation expense in the consolidated statements of operations in "general and administrative expenses".
total compensation expense under the stock plan was $18.2million, $16.0million and $14.7million for theyears ended december 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. of these amounts, total compensation expense capitalized was
$1.5million, $1.7million and $1.0million for theyears ended december 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. as of december 31, 2021, the total unrecognized compensation expense was $14.0million. this cost is expected to be recognized over the remaining weighted average period of0.8years. total cash paid for the settlement of plan shares totaled $9.0million, $5.7million and $3.7million for theyears ended december 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.
information concerning grants under the stock plan is provided below.
restricted stock in general, restricted stock is earned based on either a service condition, market condition, performance condition or a combination thereof and generally vests ratably over a period from at grant date up to5years. service based awards are earned when the employee remains employed over the requisite service period and are valued on the grant date based upon the market price of maa common stock on the date of grant. market based awards are earned when maa reaches a specified stock price or specified return on the stock price (price appreciation plus dividends) and are valued on the grant date using a monte carlo simulation. performance based awards are earned when maa reaches certain operational goals, such as funds available for distribution targets, and are valued based upon the market price of maa common stock on the date of grant as well as the probability of reaching the stated targets. maa remeasures the fair value of the performance based awards each balance sheet date with adjustments made on a cumulative basis until the award is settled and the final compensation is known. the weighted average grant date fair value per share of restricted stock awards granted during theyears ended december 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, was
$88.22, $100.53and $72.98, respectively.
the following is a summary of the key assumptions used in the valuation calculations for market based awards granted during theyears ended december 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019:
2021       2020       2019
risk free rate               0.161%     1.603%     2.578%
dividend yield               3.341%     3.070%     4.043%
volatility                   28.04%     17.02%     18.95%
requisite service period    3 years    3 years    3 years the risk free rate was based on a zero coupon risk-free rate. the dividend yield was based on the closing stock price of maa stock on the date of grant. volatility for maa was obtained by using a blend of both historical and implied volatility calculations. historical volatility was based on the standard deviation of daily total continuous returns, and implied volatility was based on the trailing month average of daily implied volatilities interpolating between the volatilities implied by stock call option contracts that were closest to the terms shown and closest to the money. the requisite service period is based on the criteria for the separate programs according to the vesting schedule.

6. financial instruments and derivatives financial instruments not carried at fair value cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash and accrued expenses and other liabilities are carried at amounts that reasonably approximate their fair value due to their short term nature.
fixed rate notes payable as of december 31, 2021 and 2020totaled $4.5billion and $4.4billion, respectively, and had estimated fair values of $4.8billion and $4.9billion (excluding prepayment penalties), respectively. the carrying value of variable rate debt as of december 31, 2020 totaled $172.0million and had an estimated fair value of
$172.0million. as of december 31, 2021, the company had no variable rate debt outstanding. the fair values of fixed rate debt are determined by using the present value of future cash outflows discounted with the applicable current market rate plus a credit spread. the fair values of variable rate debt are determined using the stated variable rate plus the current market credit spread. the variable rates reset at various maturities typically less than30days, and management concluded these rates reasonably estimate current market rates.
financial instruments measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of december 31, 2021, the company had one outstanding series of cumulative redeemable preferred stock, which is referred to as the maa series i preferred stock (see note 8). the company has recognized a derivative asset related to the redemption feature embedded in the maa series i preferred stock. the derivative asset is valued using widely accepted valuation techniques, including a discounted cash flow analysis in which the perpetual value of the preferred shares is compared to the value of the preferred shares assuming the call option is exercised, with the value of the bifurcated call option as the difference between the two values. the analysis reflects the contractual terms of the redeemable preferred shares, which are redeemable at the company's option beginning onoctober 1,
2026at the redemption price of $50.00per share. the company uses various significant inputs in the analysis, including trading data available on the preferred shares, coupon yields on preferred stock issuances from reits with similar credit ratings as maa and treasury rates to determine the fair value of the bifurcated call option.
the redemption feature embedded in the maa series i preferred stock is reported as a derivative asset in "other assets" in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets and is adjusted to its fair value at each reporting date, with a corresponding non-cash adjustment to "other non-operating income" in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations. as a result of the adjustments recorded to reflect the change in fair value of the derivative asset, the fair value of the embedded derivative asset decreased to$34.5millionas of december 31, 2021
as compared to$39.0millionas of december 31, 2020, a decrease in value of the derivative asset of$4.5million.
the company has determined the majority of the inputs used to value its outstanding debt and its embedded derivative fall within level 2 of the fair value hierarchy, and as a result, the fair value valuation of its debt and embedded derivative held as of december 31, 2021 and december 31, 2020 were classified as level 2 in the fair value hierarchy.
cash flow hedges of interest rate risk the company periodically uses derivatives to hedge exposures to interest rates. for transactions that meet the hedge accounting criteria, the company formally designates and documents the instrument as a hedge at inception and thereafter assesses the hedge to ensure it is effective in offsetting changes in the cash flows of the underlying exposures.the changes in the fair value of a derivative designated and that qualifies as a cash flow hedge are recorded in "accumulated other comprehensive loss" and are subsequently reclassified into earnings in the period that the hedged forecasted transaction affects earnings. as long as a hedging instrument is designated and the results of the effectiveness testing support that the instrument qualifies for hedge accounting treatment, there is no periodic measurement or recognition of ineffectiveness, regardless of whether or not economic mismatches exist in the hedging relationship.
as ofdecember 31, 2021,the company had$11.1millionin net realized losses recorded in "accumulated other comprehensive loss" related to terminated interest rate swap and forward rate swap derivatives which were previously designated as qualifying cash flow hedging instruments. the net realized losses are reclassified to interest expense as interest payments are made over the remaining life of the associated debt. during the next twelve months, the company estimates that an additional $1.1millionwill be reclassified to earnings as an increase to "interest expense." derivatives designated as cash flow hedging instruments and their related gains and losses are reported in "net change in operating accounts and other operating activities" in the accompanying consolidated statements of cash flows.

7. income taxes due to the structure of maa as a reit and the nature of the operations of its operating properties, no provision for federal income taxes has been made at the maa level. in addition, as maalp is structured as a limited partnership, and its partners recognize their proportionate share of income or loss in their tax returns, no provision for federal income taxes has been made at the maalp level. historically, the company has incurred certain state and local income, excise and franchise taxes.
taxable reit subsidiaries a trs is an entity that is subject to federal, state and any applicable local corporate income tax without the benefit of the dividends paid deduction applicable to reits. the company's trs generated taxable income of
$51.8million, $5.8million and $4.2million for theyears ended december 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019and income tax expense of $10.9million, $0.8million and $1.0million for the years ended december 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019. the company's trs generally provide the company with third-party services (property management services to a real estate joint venture and other services) for which the company reimburses its trs.
in addition, one of the company's trs has investments in two technology-focused limited partnerships that generate investment income and losses. the investment income is recognized for tax purposes at the time of sale or exchange of the investment. all intercompany transactions are eliminated in the accompanying consolidated financial statements.
in addition to the trs income tax provision, income tax expense primarily relates to the texas-based margin tax for all texas apartment communities. income tax expense for the company for the years ended december 31, 2021, 2020 and
2019was $13.6million, $3.3million and $3.7million, respectively, and is presented in "income tax expense" in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations.

equity forward sale agreements in august 2021, maa entered into two 18-month forward sale agreements with respect to a total of1.1million shares of its common stock at an initial forward sale price of $190.56per share, which price is net of issuance costs.
under the forward sale agreements, the forward sale price is subject to adjustment on a daily basis based on a floating interest rate factor equal to a specified daily rate less a spread and will be decreased based on amounts related to dividends on maa's common stock during the term of the forward sale agreements.noshares had been settled under the forward sale agreements as ofdecember 31, 2021. maa generally has the ability to determine the dates and method of settlement (i.e., gross physical settlement, net share settlement or cash settlement), subject to certain conditions and the right of the counterparty to accelerate settlement under certain circumstances, provided that settlement under each forward sale agreement must occur by february 2, 2023. maa currently expects to fully physically settle each forward sale agreement with the relevant forward purchaser on one or more dates specified by maa on or prior to the maturity date of the particular forward sale agreement, in which case maa expects to receive aggregate net cash proceeds at settlement equal to the number of shares underlying the particular forward sale agreement multiplied by the relevant forward sale price. the impact of the forward sale agreements wasnot dilutive to the company's diluted earnings per share for the year ended december 31, 2021.
at-the-market share offering program in november 2021, the company entered into an equity distribution agreement to establish a new atm program, replacing maa's previous atm program and allowing maa to sell shares of its common stock from time to time to or through its sales agents into the existing market at current market prices, and to enter into separate forward sales agreements to or through its forward purchasers. under its current atm program, maa has the authority to issue up to an aggregate of4.0million shares of its common stock, at such times to be determined by maa. maa has no obligation to issue shares through the atm program.

9. partners' capital of maalp common units of limited partnership interests in maalp are represented by op units.
as of december 31, 2021, there were 118,542,994 op units outstanding, 115,336,876 , or 97.3 % , of which represent class b op units (common units issued to or held by maalp's general partner or any of its subsidiaries), which were owned by maa, maalp's general partner. the remaining 3,206,118 op units were class a op units owned by class a limited partners. as of december 31, 2020, there were 118,431,384 op units outstanding, 114,373,727 , or 96.6 % , of which were owned by maa and 4,057,657 of which were owned by the class a limited partners. maa, as the sole general partner of maalp, has full, complete and exclusive discretion to manage and control the business of maalp subject to the restrictions specifically contained within maalp's agreement of limited partnership, or the partnership agreement. unless otherwise stated in the partnership agreement, this power includes, but is not limited to, acquiring, leasing or disposing of any real property; constructing buildings and making other improvements to properties owned; borrowing money, modifying or extinguishing current borrowings, issuing evidence of indebtedness and securing such indebtedness by mortgage, deed of trust, pledge or other lien on maalp's assets;
and distribution of maalp's cash or other assets in accordance with the partnership agreement. maa can generally, at its sole discretion, issue and redeem op units and determine the consideration to be received or the redemption price to be paid, as applicable. the general partner may delegate these and other powers granted to it if the general partner remains in supervision of the designee. under the partnership agreement, maalp may issue class a op units and class b op units. class a op units are any op units other than class b op units, while class b op units are those issued to or held by maalp's general partner or any of its subsidiaries. in general, the limited partners do not have the power to participate in the management or control of maalp's business except in limited circumstances, including changes in the general partner and protective rights if the general partner acts outside of the provisions provided in the partnership agreement. the transferability of class a op units is also limited by the partnership agreement. net income of maalp (after allocations to preferred ownership interests) is allocated to the general partner and limited partners based on their respective ownership percentages of maalp. issuance or redemption of additional class a op units or class b op units changes the relative ownership percentage of the partners. the issuance of class b op units generally occurs when maa issues common stock and the proceeds from that issuance are contributed to maalp in exchange for the issuance to maa of a number of op units equal to the number of shares of common stock issued. likewise, if maa repurchases or redeems outstanding shares of common stock, maalp generally redeems an equal number of class b op units with similar terms held by maa for a redemption price equal to the purchase price of those shares of common stock. at each reporting period, the allocation between general partner capital and limited partner capital is adjusted to account for the change in the respective percentage ownership of the underlying capital of maalp. holders of the class a op units may require maa to redeem their class a op units, in which case maa may, f- 31 at its option, pay the redemption price either in cash (in an amount per class a op unit equal, in general, to the average closing price of maa's common stock on the nyse over a specified period prior to the redemption date) or by delivering one share of maa common stock (subject to adjustment under specified circumstances) for each class a op unit so redeemed. as of december 31, 2021, a total of 3,206,118 class a op units were outstanding and redeemable for 3,206,118 shares of maa common stock, with an approximate value of $
735.6 million , based on the closing price of maa's common stock on december 31, 2021 of $ 229.44 per share. as of december 31, 2020, a total of 4,057,657 class a op units were outstanding and redeemable for 4,057,657 shares of maa common stock, with an approximate value of $ 514.1 million , based on the closing price of maa's common stock on december 31, 2020 of $ 126.69 per share. maalp pays the same per unit distributions in respect to the op units as the per share dividends maa pays in respect to its common stock. as of december 31, 2021, maalp had one outstanding series of cumulative redeemable preferred units, or the maalp series i preferred units. the maalp series i preferred units have the same characteristics as the maa series i preferred stock described in note 8. as of december 31, 2021, 867,846 units of the maalp series i preferred units were outstanding. see note 6 for details of the valuation of the derivative asset related to the redemption feature embedded in the maalp series i preferred units.
10. employee benefit plans the following provides details of the employee benefit plans not previously discussed in note 4. 401(k) savings plans maa's 401(k) savings plan, or 401(k) plan, is a defined contribution plan that satisfies the requirements of section 401(a) and 401(k) of the code. maa's board of directors has the discretion to approve matching contributions to the 401(k) plan. maa recognized expense from the 401(k) plan of $ 4.1 million , $
3.9 million and $ 3.5 million , for the years ended december 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. non-qualified executive deferred compensation retirement plan maa has adopted the maa non-qualified executive deferred compensation retirement plan amended and restated effective january 1, 2016, or the deferred compensation plan, for certain executive employees. under the terms of the deferred compensation plan, employees may elect to defer a percentage of their compensation and bonus, and maa may, but is not obligated to, match a portion of the employees'
salary deferral. maa recognized expense on its match to the deferred compensation plan for the years ended december
31, 2021, 2020 and 2019 of $ 0.1 million , $ 0.4 million and $ 0.3 million , respectively. non-qualified deferred compensation plan for outside company directors maa has adopted the non-qualified deferred compensation plan for outside company directors as amended effective november 30, 2010, or the directors deferred compensation plan, which allows non-employee directors to defer their director fees by having the fees held by maa as shares of maa's common stock. directors can also choose to have their annual restricted stock grants issued into the directors deferred compensation plan. amounts deferred through the directors deferred compensation plan are distributed to the directors in two annual installments beginning in the first 90 days of the year following the director's departure from the board. participating directors may choose to have the amount issued to them in shares of maa's common stock or paid to them as cash at the market value of maa's common stock as of the end of the year the director ceases to serve on the board. for the years ended december 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, directors deferred
6,944 shares, 10,593 shares and 10,738 shares of common stock, respectively, with weighted-average grant date fair values of $ 164.23 , $ 111.19 and 117.73 , respectively, into the directors deferred compensation plan. the shares of common stock held in the directors deferred compensation plan are classified outside of permanent equity in redeemable stock with changes in the redemption amount recorded immediately to retained earnings because the directors have redemption rights not solely within the control of maa. additionally, any shares that become mandatorily redeemable because a departed director has elected to receive a cash payout are recorded as a liability. maa did not record a liability related to mandatorily redeemable shares for the years ended december 31,
2021, 2020 and 2019. employee stock ownership plan maa's employee stock ownership plan, or esop, is a non-
contributory stock bonus plan that satisfies the requirements of section 401(a) of the code. on december 31, 2010, the esop was frozen by amendment, whereby effective january 1, 2011, no additional employees became eligible for the plan, no additional contributions were made to the esop, and all participants with an account balance under the esop became 100% vested. the company did not contribute to the esop during 2021, 2020 or 2019. as of december 31,
2021, the esop held 122,582 shares with a fair value of $ 28.1 million .

legal proceedings in june 2016, plaintiffs cathi cleven and tara cleven, on behalf of a putative class of plaintiffs, filed a complaint against maa and the operating partnership in the united states district court for the western district of texas, austin division. in january 2017, areli arellano and joe l. martinez joined the lawsuit as additional plaintiffs. the lawsuit alleges that the company (but not post properties - see the description of the brown class action lawsuit below) charged late fees at its texas properties that violate section 92.019 of the texas property code, or section 92.019, which provides that a landlord may not charge a tenant a late fee for failing to pay rent unless, among other things, the fee is a reasonable estimate of uncertain damages to the landlord that are incapable of precise calculation and result from the late payment of rent. the plaintiffs are seeking monetary damages and attorneys' fees and costs. in september 2018, the district court certified a class proposed by the plaintiffs. additionally, in september 2018, the district court denied the company's motion for summary judgment and granted the plaintiffs' motion for partial summary judgment. because the district court certified a class prior to granting the plaintiffs' motion for partial summary judgment, the district court's ruling applies to the entire class. in october 2018, the fifth circuit court of appeals accepted the company's petition to review the district court's order granting class certification.in september 2019, the fifth circuit court of appeals heard the company's oral arguments.thereafter, in december 2021, the fifth circuit court of appeals issued its opinion, finding error in the district court's analysis of section 92.019 and remanding the case to the district court to determine if class certification is appropriate in light of the fifth circuit's determination that section 92.019
does not require that a landlord engage in a process to arrive at its late fee, so long as the fee is a reasonable estimate at the time of contracting of damages that are incapable of precise calculation. the company will continue to vigorously defend the action and pursue such appeals as are warranted and available. management estimates that the company's maximum exposure in the lawsuit, if the class is recertified by the district court, is$54.6million, which includes both potential damages and attorneys' fees but excludes any prejudgment interest that may be awarded.

management estimates that the company's maximum exposure in the lawsuit, if the class is recertified, is$8.4million, which includes both potential damages and attorneys' fees but excludes any prejudgment interest that may be awarded.

the company is subject to various other legal proceedings and claims that arise in the ordinary course of its business operations. matters that arise out of allegations of bodily injury, property damage and employment practices are generally covered by insurance. while the resolution of these other matters cannot be predicted with certainty, management does not currently believe that such matters, either individually or in the aggregate, will have a material adverse effect on the company's financial condition, results of operations or cash flows in the event of a negative outcome.
as of december 31, 2021 and 2020, the company's accrual for loss contingencies relating to unresolved legal matters was$5.2millionand$5.3millionin the aggregate, respectively. the loss contingencies are presented in "accrued expenses and other liabilities" in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.
12. related party transactions the cash management of the company is managed by the operating partnership. in general, cash receipts are remitted to the operating partnership and all cash disbursements are funded by the operating partnership. as a result of these transactions, the operating partnership had a de minimis payable to maa, its general partner, as of december 31, 2021 and 2020 , respectively. the partnership agreement does not require the due to/due from balance to be settled in cash until liquidation of the operating partnership, and therefore, there is no regular settlement schedule for such amounts.
13. segment information as of december 31, 2021, the company owned and operated290multifamily apartment communities (which does not include development communities under construction) in15different states from which it derived all significant sources of earnings and operating cash flows. the company views each consolidated apartment community as an operating segment.
the company's chief operating decision maker, which is the company's chief executive officer, evaluates performance and determines resource allocations of each of the apartment communities on a same store and non-same store and other basis, as well as an individual apartment community basis. this is consistent with the aggregation criteria under gaap as each of the apartment communities generally has similar economic characteristics, facilities, services and residents.
the following reflects thetworeportable segments for the company:
• same store includes communities that the company has owned and have been stabilized for at least a full 12 months as of the first day of the calendar year.
• non-same store and other includes recently acquired communities, communities being developed or in lease-up, communities identified for disposition, communities that have incurred a significant casualty loss and stabilized communities that do not meet the requirements to be same store communities. also included in non-same store and other are non-multifamily activities.
on the first day of each calendar year, the company determines the composition of its same store and non-same store and other reportable segments for that year as well as adjusts the previous year, which allows the company to evaluate full period-over-period operating comparisons. communities previously in development or lease-up are added to the same store segment on the first day of the calendar year after the community has been owned and stabilized for at least a full12months. communities are considered stabilized after achieving90% average physical occupancy for90days. communities that have been identified for disposition are excluded from the same store segment.
the chief operating decision maker utilizes noi in evaluating the performance of its operating segments. total noi represents total property revenues less total property operating expenses, excluding depreciation and amortization, for all properties held during the period regardless of their status as held for sale. management believes that noi is a helpful tool in evaluating the operating performance of the segments because it measures the core operations of property performance by excluding corporate level expenses and other items not directly related to property operating performance.

item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations.
the following discussion analyzes the financial condition and results of operations of both maa and the operating partnership, of which maa is the sole general partner and in which maa owned a 97.3% interest as of december 31, 2021. maa conducts all of its business through the operating partnership and its various subsidiaries. this discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in this annual report on form 10-k. this discussion contains forward-looking statements that involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions. our actual results, performance or achievements may differ materially from those expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements as a result of many factors, including, but not limited to, those under the heading "risk factors" in this annual report on form 10-k.
maa, an s&p 500 company, is a multifamily-focused, self-administered and self-managed real estate investment trust, or reit. we own, operate, acquire and selectively develop apartment communities primarily located in the southeast, southwest and mid-atlantic regions of the united states. as of december 31, 2021, we owned and operated 290 apartment communities (which does not include development properties under construction) through the operating partnership and its subsidiaries, and we had an ownership interest in one apartment community through an unconsolidated real estate joint venture and had six development communities under construction. in addition, as of december 31, 2021, 33 of our apartment communities included retail components. our apartment communities, including development communities under construction, were located across 16 states and the district of columbia as of december 31, 2021.
we report in two segments, same store and non-same store and other. our same store segment represents those apartment communities that have been owned and stabilized for at least 12 months as of the first day of the calendar year. our non-same store and other segment includes recently acquired communities, communities being developed or in lease-up, communities identified for disposition, communities that have incurred a significant casualty loss and stabilized communities that do not meet the requirements to be same store communities. also included in our non-same store and other segment are non-multifamily activities. additional information regarding the composition of our segments is included in note 13 to the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10-k.
overview for the year ended december 31, 2021, net income available for maa common shareholders was $530.1 million as compared to $251.3 million for the year ended december 31, 2020. results for the year ended december 31, 2021 included $221.2 million of gains related to the sale of real estate assets and $40.9 million of gain, net of tax, related to our investments in unconsolidated limited partnerships. results for the year ended december 31, 2020 included $1.0 million of gains related to the sale of real estate assets and $4.8 million of gain, net of tax, related to our investments in unconsolidated limited partnerships. revenues for the year ended december 31, 2021 increased 6.0% as compared to the year ended december 31, 2020, driven by a 5.5% increase in our same store segment. property operating expenses, excluding depreciation and amortization, for the year ended december 31, 2021 increased by 4.8% as compared to the year ended december 31, 2020, driven by a 4.4% increase in our same store segment. the primary drivers of these changes are discussed in the "results of operations" section.
trends during the year ended december 31, 2021, revenue growth for our same store segment continued to be primarily driven by growth in average effective rent per unit. the average effective rent per unit for our same store segment continued to increase from the prior year, up 5.2% for the year ended december 31, 2021 as compared to the year ended december 31, 2020. average effective rent per unit represents the average of gross rent amounts, after the effect of leasing concessions, for occupied apartment units plus prevalent market rates asked for unoccupied apartment units, divided by the total number of units. leasing concessions represent discounts to the current market rate. we believe average effective rent per unit is a helpful measurement in evaluating average pricing; however, it does not represent actual rental revenue collected per unit. in addition, for the year ended december 31, 2021, average physical occupancy for our same store segment was 96.1%, as compared to 95.6% for the year ended year ended december 31, 2020. average physical occupancy is a measurement of the total number of our apartment units that are occupied by residents, and it represents the average of the daily physical occupancy for the period.
an important part of our portfolio strategy is to maintain diversity of markets, submarkets, product types and price points in the southeast, southwest and mid-atlantic regions of the united states. this diversity tends to mitigate exposure to economic issues in any one geographic market or area. we believe that a well-balanced portfolio, including both urban and suburban locations, with a broad range of monthly rent price points, will perform well in economic up cycles as well as better weather economic down cycles. through our investment in 36 defined markets, we are diversified across markets, urban and suburban submarkets, and a variety of product types and monthly rent price points.
while the united states economy continues to recover from the effects of the covid-19 pandemic, demand for apartments during the year ended december 31, 2021 was very strong, as evidenced by the accelerating rent growth we achieved. demand for apartments is primarily driven by general economic conditions in our markets and is particularly correlated to job growth. while our rent growth trends and rent collection trends during the year ended december 31, 2021 were strong, we continue to monitor pressures surrounding supply chain challenges and inflation trends. a worsening of the current environment could contribute to uncertain rent collections going forward and suppress demand for apartments and would likely drive rent growth on new leases and renewals lower than what we achieved during the year ended december 31, 2021. elevated supply levels could further affect rent growth for our portfolio, particularly for apartment communities located in urban submarkets. to date, properties in suburban submarkets have been somewhat less impacted by supply, primarily because new development has been less prevalent in those submarkets. supply chain and inflationary pressures would likely drive higher operating expenses, particularly in personnel and repairs and maintenance.
with the covid-19 pandemic still impacting the country and contributing more uncertainty than normal, we believe that our portfolio strategy of maintaining a diversity of markets, submarkets, product types and rent price points will serve the company better in this environment than a more concentrated portfolio profile. at a portfolio level, we have focused on using our pricing system to maintain strong occupancy. as previously noted, average physical occupancy for our same store segment for the year ended december 31, 2021 was 96.1%, which we believe positions us well to manage through the typically slower winter leasing season and progress toward the typically stronger spring and summer leasing season.
access to the financial markets remains strong, particularly for high credit rated borrowers. during 2021, we were able to efficiently raise capital through the debt market, and we positioned ourselves to access the equity market in the event we have such a need. however, a prolonged disruption of the markets or a decline in credit and financing conditions could negatively affect our ability to access capital necessary to fund our operations or refinance maturing debt in the future. the prospect of rising interest rates could negatively impact our borrowing costs for any variable rate borrowings or refinancing activity; however, as of december 31, 2021, the interest rate on all of our outstanding debt was fixed, and our fixed rate debt maturities in the year ending december 31, 2022 are not significant.
results of operations for the year ended december 31, 2021, we achieved net income available for maa common shareholders of $530.1 million, a 111.0% increase as compared to the year ended december 31, 2020, and total revenue growth of $100.1 million, representing a 6.0% increase in property revenues as compared to the year ended december 31, 2020. the following discussion describes the primary drivers of the increase in net income available for maa common shareholders for the year ended december 31, 2021 as compared to the year ended december 31, 2020. a discussion of the results of operations for the year ended december 31, 2020 as compared to the year ended december 31, 2019 is found in item 7 of part ii of our annual report on form 10-k for the year ended december 31, 2020, filed with the sec on february 18, 2021, which is available free of charge on the sec's website at https://www.sec.gov and on our website at https://www.maac.com, on the "for investors" page under "filings and financials-annual reports."
property revenues the following table reflects our property revenues by segment for the year ended december 31, 2021 (dollars in thousands):

the increase in property revenues for our same store segment for the year ended december 31, 2021 as compared to the year ended december 31, 2020 was the primary driver of total property revenue growth. the same store segment generated a 5.5% increase in revenues for the year ended december 31, 2021, primarily a result of average effective rent per unit growth of 5.2% as compared to the year ended december 31, 2020. the increase in property revenues from the non-same store and other segment for the year ended december 31, 2021 as compared to the year ended december 31, 2020 was primarily the result of increased revenues from recently completed development communities. these increases were partially offset by decreased revenues from the disposition of seven multifamily communities during the year ended december 31, 2021.
property operating expenses property operating expenses include costs for property personnel, building repairs and maintenance, real estate taxes and insurance, utilities, landscaping and other operating expenses. the following table reflects our property operating expenses by segment for the year ended december 31, 2021 (dollars in thousands):
december 31, 2021     december 31, 2020       increase      % change same store                            $638,433              $611,450        $26,983           4.4   %
non-same store and other                32,732                29,021          3,711          12.8   %
total                                 $671,165              $640,471        $30,694           4.8   %
the increase in property operating expenses for our same store segment for the year ended december 31, 2021 as compared to the year ended december 31, 2020 was primarily driven by increases in real estate tax expense of $7.0 million, insurance expense of $6.2 million, building repairs and maintenance of $5.6 million, personnel expense of $4.4 million and utilities expense of $2.7 million. the increase in property operating expenses from the non-same store and other segment for the year ended december 31, 2021 as compared to the year ended december 31, 2020 was primarily the result of increased property operating expenses from recently completed development communities. these increases were partially offset by decreased property operating expenses from the disposition of seven multifamily communities during the year ended december 31, 2021.
depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization expense for the year ended december 31, 2021 was $533.4 million, an increase of $22.6 million as compared to the year ended december 31, 2020. the increase was primarily driven by the recognition of depreciation expense associated with our development and capital spend activities made in the normal course of business during the year ended december 31, 2021.
other income and expenses property management expenses for the year ended december 31, 2021 were $55.7 million, an increase of $3.4 million as compared to the year ended december 31, 2020. general and administrative expenses for the year ended december 31, 2021 were $52.9 million, an increase of $6.0 million as compared to the year ended december 31, 2020.
interest expense for the year ended december 31, 2021 was $156.9 million, a decrease of $10.7 million as compared to the year ended december 31, 2020. the decrease was primarily due to a decrease of 27 basis points in our effective interest rate during the year ended december 31, 2021 as compared to the year ended december 31, 2020. the decrease in our effective interest rate was primarily due to debt retirements during the year ended december 31, 2021, which were retired with proceeds from unsecured debt issuances with lower effective interest rates over the same period.
for the year ended december 31, 2021, we disposed of seven apartment communities, resulting in a gain on sale of depreciable real estate assets of $220.4 million. we did not dispose of any apartment communities during the year ended december 31, 2020. during the year ended december 31, 2021, we disposed of five land parcels resulting in a gain on sale of non-depreciable real estate assets of $0.8 million. during the year ended december 31, 2020, we disposed of one land parcel resulting in a gain on sale of non-depreciable real estate assets of $1.0 million.
other non-operating income for the year ended december 31, 2021 was $33.9 million of income, as compared to $4.9 million of income for the year ended december 31, 2020. the increase was primarily driven by $51.7 million of non-cash gain from unconsolidated limited partnerships compared to $5.6 million of non-cash gain from unconsolidated limited partnerships during the year ended december 31, 2020. during the year ended december 31, 2021, we also recognized $4.6 million of non-cash expense related to the fair value adjustment of the embedded derivative in the maa series i preferred shares compared to the recognition of $2.6 million of non-cash income related to the adjustment of the embedded derivative during the year ended december 31, 2020. during the year ended december 31, 2021, we recognized $13.4 million in debt extinguishment costs. expense recognized related to debt extinguishments during the year ended december 31, 2020 was negligible. during the year ended december 31, 2021, we recognized $1.3 million of covid-19 related expenses compared to $3.5 million of covid-19 related expenses during the year ended december 31, 2020.
funds from operations and core funds from operations funds from operations, or ffo, a non-gaap financial measure, represents net income available for maa common shareholders (computed in accordance with the united states generally accepted accounting principles, or gaap) excluding gains or losses on disposition of operating properties and asset impairment, plus depreciation and amortization of real estate assets, net income attributable to noncontrolling interests and adjustments for joint ventures. because net income attributable to noncontrolling interests is added back, ffo, when used in this annual report on form 10-k, represents ffo attributable to the company.
ffo should not be considered as an alternative to net income available for maa common shareholders or any other gaap measurement, as an indicator of operating performance or as an alternative to cash flow from operating, investing and financing activities as a measure of liquidity. management believes that ffo is helpful to investors in understanding our operating performance, primarily because its calculation excludes depreciation and amortization expense on real estate assets. we believe that gaap historical cost depreciation of real estate assets is generally not correlated with changes in the value of those assets, whose value does not diminish predictably over time, as historical cost depreciation implies. while our calculation of ffo is in accordance with the national association of real estate investment trusts', or nareit's, definition, it may differ from the methodology for calculating ffo utilized by other reits and, accordingly, may not be comparable to such other reits.
core ffo represents ffo as adjusted for items that are not considered part of our core business operations, such as adjustments related to the fair value of the embedded derivative in the maa series i preferred shares, gain or loss on sale of non-depreciable assets, gain or loss from unconsolidated limited partnerships, net casualty gain or loss, gain or loss on debt extinguishment, legal costs and settlements, covid-19 related costs and mark-to-market debt adjustments. while our definition of core ffo may be similar to others in the industry, our methodology for calculating core ffo may differ from that utilized by other reits and, accordingly, may not be comparable to such other reits. core ffo should not be considered as an alternative to net income available for maa common shareholders as an indicator of operating performance. we believe that core ffo is helpful in understanding our core operating performance between periods in that it removes certain items that by their nature are not comparable over periods and therefore tend to obscure actual operating performance.
the following table presents a reconciliation of net income available for maa common shareholders to ffo and core ffo for the years ended december 31, 2021 and 2020, as we believe net income available for maa common shareholders is the most directly comparable gaap measure (dollars in thousands):

core ffo for the year ended december 31, 2021 was $830.6 million, an increase of $69.3 million as compared to the year ended december 31, 2020, primarily as a result of an increase in property revenues of $100.1 million and a decrease in interest expense of $10.7 million. the increases to core ffo were offset by increases in property operating expenses, excluding depreciation and amortization, of $30.7 million, general and administrative expenses of $6.0 million and property management expenses of $3.4 million.
liquidity and capital resources overview our cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities, as well as general economic and market conditions, are the principal factors affecting our liquidity and capital resources.
we expect that our primary uses of cash will be to fund our ongoing operating needs, to fund our ongoing capital spending requirements, which relate primarily to our development, redevelopment and property repositioning activities, to repay maturing borrowings, to fund the future acquisition of assets and to pay shareholder dividends. we expect to meet our cash requirements through net cash flows from operating activities, existing unrestricted cash and cash equivalents, borrowings under our commercial paper program and our revolving credit facility, the future issuance of debt and equity and the future disposition of assets.
we historically have had positive net cash flows from operating activities. we believe that future net cash flows generated from operating activities, existing unrestricted cash and cash equivalents, borrowing capacity under our current commercial paper program and revolving credit facility, and our ability to issue debt and equity will provide sufficient liquidity to fund the cash requirements for our business over the next 12 months and the foreseeable future.
as of december 31, 2021, we had $1.1 billion of combined unrestricted cash and cash equivalents and available capacity under our revolving credit facility.
cash flows from operating activities net cash provided by operating activities was $895.0 million for the year ended december 31, 2021 as compared to $823.9 million for the year ended december 31, 2020. the increase in operating cash flows was primarily driven by our operating performance.
cash flows from investing activities net cash used in investing activities was $253.6 million for the year ended december 31, 2021 as compared to $484.7 million for the year ended december 31, 2020. the primary drivers of the change were as follows (dollars in thousands):

the decrease in cash outflows for purchases of real estate and other assets was driven by acquisition activity during the year ended december 31, 2021 as compared to the year ended december 31, 2020. the increase in cash outflows for capital improvements and other was primarily driven by reconstruction related capital spend due to winter storm uri in addition to increased redevelopment capital spend during the year ended december 31, 2021 as compared to the year ended december 31, 2020. the increase in cash outflows for development costs was driven by increased development activity during the year ended december 31, 2021 as compared to the year ended december 31, 2020. the increase in cash inflows related to proceeds from disposition of real estate assets was driven by the disposition of seven multifamily apartment communities during the year ended december 31, 2021 as compared to no apartment community dispositions during the year ended december 31, 2020.
cash flows from financing activities net cash used in financing activities was $546.4 million for the year ended december 31, 2021 as compared to $374.1 million for the year ended december 31, 2020. the primary drivers of the change were as follows (dollars in thousands):

the increase in cash outflows related to the net change in commercial paper resulted from the decrease in net borrowings of $172.0 million on our commercial paper program during the year ended december 31, 2021 as compared to the increase in net borrowings of $102.0 million on our commercial paper program during the year ended december 31, 2020. the increase in cash inflows related to proceeds from notes payable primarily resulted from the issuance of $600.0 million of unsecured senior notes during the year ended december 31, 2021 as compared to the issuance of $450.0 million of unsecured senior notes during the year ended december 31, 2020. the increase in cash outflows from principal payments on notes payable primarily resulted from the retirement of $222.0 million of privately placed unsecured senior notes, $125.0 million of publicly issued unsecured senior notes and $118.6 million of property mortgages during the year ended december 31, 2021 as compared to the retirement of a $300.0 million term loan and $135.7 million of property mortgages during the year ended december 31, 2020. the increase in cash outflows from dividends paid on common shares primarily resulted from the increase in the dividend rate to $4.10 per share during the year ended december 31, 2021 as compared to the dividend rate of $4.00 per share during the year ended december 31, 2020. the increase in cash outflows from the net change in other financing activities was primarily driven by increased debt extinguishment costs paid during the year ended december 31, 2021 as compared to the year ended december 31, 2020, partially offset by increased cash inflows from contributions received from the noncontrolling interests related to our consolidated real estate entities.

unsecured revolving credit facility & commercial paper in may 2019, maalp closed on a $1.0 billion unsecured revolving credit facility with a syndicate of banks led by wells fargo bank, national association, and fourteen other banks, which we refer to as the credit facility. the credit facility replaced our previous unsecured revolving credit facility and includes an expansion option up to $1.5 billion. the credit facility bears an interest rate of libor, plus a spread of 0.75% to 1.45% based on an investment grade pricing grid. the credit facility matures in may 2023 with an option to extend for two additional six-month periods. as of december 31, 2021, there was no outstanding balance under the credit facility, while $4.0 million of capacity was used to support outstanding letters of credit. the credit facility serves as our primary source of short-term liquidity.
certain tenors of the usd libor (one-week and two-month) ceased publication as of december 31, 2021, and all remaining tenors of the usd libor (one, three, six and 12-month) will cease to be published after june 30, 2023. currently, our exposure to the phase-out of libor is limited to the credit facility. the terms of the credit facility allow for the transition to an alternate benchmark interest rate, including sofr, to replace any outstanding usd libor borrowings at the time usd libor is no longer published.
in may 2019, maalp established an unsecured commercial paper program, whereby it can issue unsecured commercial paper notes with varying maturities not to exceed 397 days up to a maximum aggregate amount outstanding of $500.0 million. as of december 31, 2021, there were no outstanding borrowings under the commercial paper program.
unsecured senior notes as of december 31, 2021, maalp had $4.2 billion of publicly issued unsecured senior notes.
in july 2021, maalp retired a $72.8 million tranche of privately placed unsecured senior notes at maturity.
in august 2021, maalp publicly issued $300 million in aggregate principal amount of unsecured senior notes maturing september 2026 with a coupon rate of 1.100% per annum. interest will be paid semi-annually on march 15 and september 15 of each year beginning march 15, 2022.
in august 2021, maalp also publicly issued $300 million in aggregate principal amount of unsecured senior notes maturing september 2051 with a coupon rate of 2.875% per annum. interest will be paid semi-annually on march 15 and september 15 of each year beginning march 15, 2022.
in september 2021, maalp retired a $117.0 million tranche of privately placed unsecured senior notes due in november 2022, a $125.0 million portion of the $250.0 million in aggregate principal amount of publicly issued unsecured senior notes due in december 2022, a $12.3 million tranche of privately placed unsecured senior notes due in july 2023 and a $20.0 million tranche of privately placed unsecured senior notes due in november 2024. we incurred $13.4 million in prepayment penalties and write-offs of unamortized costs resulting from the debt retirements. these costs are included in "other non-operating income" in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations for the year ended december 31, 2021.
secured property mortgages maalp maintains secured property mortgages with various life insurance companies. as of december 31, 2021, maalp had $368.6 million of secured property mortgages with a weighted average interest rate of 4.4%. in february 2021, maalp retired a $118.6 million mortgage associated with eight apartment communities prior to its june 2021 maturity.

equity as of december 31, 2021, maa owned 115,336,876 op units, comprising a 97.3% limited partnership interest in maalp, while the remaining 3,206,118 outstanding op units were held by limited partners of maalp other than maa. holders of op units (other than maa) may require us to redeem their op units from time to time, in which case we may, at our option, pay the redemption price either in cash (in an amount per op unit equal, in general, to the average closing price of maa's common stock on the nyse over a specified period prior to the redemption date) or by delivering one share of maa's common stock (subject to adjustment under specified circumstances) for each op unit so redeemed. maa has registered under the securities act the 3,206,118 shares of its common stock that, as of december 31, 2021, were issuable upon redemption of op units, in order for those shares to be sold freely in the public markets.
in august 2021, maa entered into two 18-month forward sale agreements with respect to a total of 1.1 million shares of its common stock at an initial forward sale price of $190.56 per share, which price is net of issuance costs. under the forward sale agreements, the forward sale price is subject to adjustment on a daily basis based on a floating interest rate factor equal to a specified daily rate less a spread and will be decreased based on amounts related to dividends on maa's common stock during the term of the forward sale agreements. no shares had been settled under the forward sale agreements as of december 31, 2021. subject to certain conditions, we generally have the right to elect cash or net share settlement under the forward sale agreements, although we expect to settle the forward sale agreements entirely by the full physical delivery of shares of maa's common stock in exchange for cash proceeds. we intend to use any cash proceeds upon settlement of the forward sale agreements to fund our development and redevelopment activities, among other potential uses.
in november 2021, the company entered into an equity distribution agreement to establish a new atm program, replacing maa's previous atm program and allowing maa to sell shares of its common stock from time to time to or through its sales agents into the existing market at current market prices, and to enter into separate forward sales agreements to or through its forward purchasers. under its current atm program, maa has the authority to issue up to an aggregate of 4.0 million shares of its common stock, at such times to be determined by maa. maa has no obligation to issue shares through the atm program. during the years ended december 31, 2021 and 2020, maa did not sell any shares of common stock under its atm program. as of december 31, 2021, there were 4.0 million shares remaining under the current atm program.

(1)represents principal payments gross of discounts, premiums, debt issuance costs and fair market value adjustments of debt assumed.
(2)primarily comprised of a ground lease underlying one apartment community we own and the lease of our corporate headquarters.
as of december 31, 2021, we also had contractual obligations, which are not reflected in the table above, to make additional capital contributions to two technology-focused limited partnerships in which we hold equity interests. the capital contributions may be called by the general partners at any time until february 2025 after giving appropriate notice. as of december 31, 2021, we had committed to make additional capital contributions totaling up to $16.0 million if and when called by the general partners of the limited partnerships and until february 2025.
we have other material cash requirements that do not represent contractual obligations, but we expect to incur in the ordinary course of our business.
as of december 31, 2021, we had six development communities under construction totaling 2,021 apartment units once complete. total expected costs for the six development projects are $460.5 million, of which $273.7 million had been incurred through december 31, 2021. we expect to have additional development projects in the future. in addition, our property development and repositioning activities are ongoing, and we incur expenditures relating to recurring capital replacements, which typically include scheduled carpet replacement, new roofs, hvac units, plumbing, concrete, masonry and other paving, pools and various exterior building improvements. for the year ending december 31, 2022, we expect that our total capital expenditures relating to our development activities, our property redevelopment and repositioning activities and recurring capital replacements will be in line with our total capital expenditures for the year ended december 31, 2021.
we typically declare cash dividends on maa's common stock on a quarterly basis, subject to approval by maa's board of directors. we expect to pay quarterly dividends at an annual rate of $4.35 per share of maa common stock during the year ending december 31, 2022.
inflation our resident leases at our apartment communities allow for adjustments in the rental rate at the time of renewal, which may enable us to seek rent increases. the majority of our leases are for one year or less. the short-term nature of these leases generally serves to reduce our risk to adverse effects of inflation.
critical accounting estimates a critical accounting estimate is one that is both important to our financial condition and results of operations and that involves some degree of uncertainty. the preceding discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto, which have been prepared in accordance with gaap. the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management to make a number of estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. on an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates and assumptions based upon historical experience and various other factors and circumstances. we believe that our estimates and assumptions are reasonable under the circumstances; however, actual results may differ from these estimates and assumptions.
we believe that the estimates and assumptions summarized below are most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations because they involve a significant level of estimation uncertainty and they have had, or are reasonably likely to have, a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations.
acquisition of real estate assets we account for our acquisitions of investments in real estate as asset acquisitions in accordance with accounting standards codification topic 805, business combinations, which requires the cost of the real estate acquired to be allocated to the individual acquired tangible assets, consisting of land, buildings and improvements and other, and identified intangible assets, consisting of the value of in-place leases and other contracts, on a relative fair value basis. in calculating the asset value of acquired tangible and intangible assets, management may use significant subjective inputs, including forecasted net operating income, or noi, and market specific capitalization and discount rates. management analyzes historical stabilized noi to determine its estimate for forecasted noi. management estimates the market capitalization rate by analyzing the market capitalization rates for sold properties with comparable ages in similarly sized markets. management allocates the purchase price of the asset acquisition based on the relative fair value of the individual components as a proportion of the total assets acquired. during the years ended december 31, 2021 and 2020, we did not acquire any real estate assets that required us to allocate the cost of the real estate asset to the individual acquired tangible and intangible assets.
impairment of long-lived assets we account for long-lived assets in accordance with the provisions of accounting standards for the impairment or disposal of long-lived assets. management periodically evaluates long-lived assets, including investments in real estate, for indicators that would suggest that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable. the judgments regarding the existence of such indicators are based on factors such as operating performance, market conditions and legal factors. long-lived assets, such as real estate assets, equipment, right-of-use lease assets and purchased intangibles subject to amortization, are grouped with other assets and liabilities at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities, or an asset group. management generally considers the individual assets of an apartment community to collectively represent an asset group. recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset. if the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its estimated future cash flows, an impairment charge is recognized for the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset. management calculates the fair value of an asset by dividing estimated future cash flows by a market capitalization rate. no material impairment losses were recognized during the years ended december 31, 2021 and 2020.
our impairment assessments contain uncertainties because they require management to make assumptions and to apply judgment to estimate future cash flows and the fair value of the assets. key assumptions used in estimating future cash flows and the fair value of an asset include projecting an apartment community's noi, estimating asset useful lives, disposition dates and recurring capital expenditures, as well as selecting an appropriate market capitalization rate. management considers its apartment communities' historical stabilized noi performance, local market economics and the business environment impacting our apartment communities as the basis in projecting forecasted noi, which management believes is representative of future cash flows. management estimates the market capitalization rate by analyzing the market capitalization rates for sold properties with comparable ages in similarly sized markets. these estimates are subjective and our ability to realize future cash flows and asset fair values is affected by factors such as ongoing maintenance and improvement of the assets, changes in economic conditions and changes in operating performance.
loss contingencies the outcomes of claims, disputes and legal proceedings are subject to significant uncertainty. management records an accrual for loss contingencies when a loss is probable and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. we also accrue an estimate of defense costs expected to be incurred in connection with legal matters. management reviews these accruals quarterly and makes revisions based on changes in facts and circumstances. when a loss contingency is not both probable and reasonably estimable, then we do not accrue the loss. however, for material loss contingencies, if the unrecorded loss (or an additional loss in excess of the accrual) is at least a reasonable possibility and material, then management discloses a reasonable estimate of the possible loss, or range of loss, if such reasonable estimate can be made. if we cannot make a reasonable estimate of the possible loss, or range of loss, then a statement to that effect is disclosed.
the assessment of whether a loss is probable or a reasonable possibility, and whether the loss or range of loss is reasonably estimable, often involves a series of complex and qualitative judgments about future events. among the factors that we consider in this assessment, including with respect to the matters disclosed in this annual report on form 10-k, are the nature of existing legal proceedings and claims, the asserted or possible damages or loss contingency (if reasonably estimable), the progress of the matter, existing law and precedent, the opinions or views of legal counsel and other advisers, our experience in similar matters, the facts available to us at the time of assessment, and how we intend to respond, or have responded, to the proceeding or claim. management's assessment of these factors may change over time as individual proceedings or claims progress. for matters where we are not currently able to reasonably estimate a range of reasonably possible loss, the factors that have contributed to this determination include the following: (i) the damages sought are indeterminate; (ii) the proceedings are in the early stages; (iii) the matters involve novel or unsettled legal theories or a large or uncertain number of actual or potential cases or parties; and/or (iv) discussions with the parties in matters that are expected ultimately to be resolved through negotiation and settlement have not reached the point where we believe a reasonable estimate of loss, or range of loss, can be made. in such instances, management believes that there is considerable uncertainty regarding the timing or ultimate resolution of such matters, including a possible eventual loss or business impact, if any.
valuation of embedded derivative the redemption feature embedded in the maa series i preferred stock is reported as a derivative asset and is adjusted to its fair value at each reporting date, with a corresponding non-cash adjustment to the income statement. the derivative asset related to the redemption feature is valued using widely accepted valuation techniques, including a discounted cash flow analysis in which the perpetual value of the preferred shares is compared to the value of the preferred shares assuming the call option is exercised, with the value of the bifurcated call option as the difference between the two values. the analysis reflects the contractual terms of the redeemable preferred shares, which are redeemable at our option beginning on october 1, 2026 and at the redemption price of $50 per share. we use various significant inputs in the analysis, including trading data available on the preferred shares, coupon yields on preferred stock issuances from reits with similar credit ratings as maa and treasury rates to determine the fair value of the bifurcated call option. as a result of the adjustments recorded to reflect the change in fair value of the derivative asset, the fair value of the embedded derivative asset decreased to $34.5 million as of december 31, 2021 as compared to $39.0 million as of december 31, 2020, a decrease in value of the asset of $4.5 million.
arriving at the valuation of the embedded derivative requires a significant amount of subjective judgment by management, and the valuation of the embedded derivative is highly sensitive to changes in certain inputs in the analysis. for example, changes in the inputs of the trading data available on the preferred shares, coupon yields on preferred stock issuances from reits with similar credit ratings as maa and treasury rates could cause the valuation of the embedded derivative to materially change from the recorded balance as of december 31, 2021. for instance, holding all other assumptions constant, a $1 decrease in the trading price of the preferred shares as of december 31, 2021 would result in a decrease in fair value of the embedded derivative asset of approximately $6 million.
significant accounting policies for more information regarding our significant accounting policies, including the accounting polices related to the critical accounting estimates discussed above as well as a brief description of recent accounting pronouncements that could have a material impact on our financial statements, see note 1 to the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10-k.

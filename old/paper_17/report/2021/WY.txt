risk factors, our board of directors, in its sole discretion, determines the amount, timing and frequency of our dividends to shareholders.
changes in tax laws or their interpretation could adversely affect our shareholders and our results of operations.
federal and state tax laws are constantly under review by persons involved in the legislative process, the irs, the united states department of the treasury, and state taxing authorities. changes to tax laws could adversely affect our shareholders or increase our effective tax rates. we cannot predict with certainty whether, when, in what forms, or with what effective dates, the tax laws applicable to us or our shareholders may be changed.
import/export taxes and duties we may be required to pay significant taxes or tariffs on our exported products or countervailing and anti-dumping duties or tariffs on our imported products.
we export logs and finished wood products to foreign markets, and our ability to do so profitably is affected by u.s. and foreign trade policy. international trade disputes occur frequently and can be taken to an international trade court for resolution of unfair trade practices between countries.
u.s. international trade policy could result in one or more of our foreign export market jurisdictions adopting trade policy making it more difficult or costly for us to export our products to those countries. we could therefore experience reduced revenues and margins in any of our businesses that is adversely affected by international trade tariffs, duties, taxes, customs or dispute settlement terms. to the extent such trade policies increase prices, they could also reduce the demand for our products and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial results and financial condition, including facility closures or impairments of assets. we cannot predict future trade policy or the terms of any settlements of international trade disputes and their effect on our business.
other risks risks related to owning our stock our cash dividends are not guaranteed and may fluctuate.
our board of directors, in its sole discretion, determines the amount and timing of our cash dividends to shareholders based on consideration of a number of factors. these factors include, but are not limited to: our results of operations and cash flows; current and forecasted economic conditions; changes in the current or expected prices and demand for our products and the general market demand for timberlands, including those timberland properties that have higher and better uses; current and forecasted harvest levels; balancing various capital allocation priorities and considerations including without limitation the company's capital requirements and debt repayment obligations; various finance considerations, including the company's credit ratings, borrowing capacity, debt covenant restrictions that may impose limitations on cash payments and other related factors and tax considerations. consequently, the amount, timing and frequency of our dividends, including our quarterly base dividend and annual supplemental dividend, may fluctuate.
the market price of our common stock may be influenced by many factors, some of which are beyond our control.
the market price of our common stock may be influenced by many factors, some of which are beyond our control, including without limitation those described above and elsewhere in this report, as well as the following:
•  actual or anticipated fluctuations in our operating results or our competitors' operating results;
•  announcements by us or our competitors of new products, capacity changes, significant contracts, acquisitions or strategic investments or initiatives;
•  our growth rate and our competitors' growth rates;
•  general economic conditions;
•  conditions in the financial markets;
•  market interest rates and the relative yields on other financial instruments;
•  general perceptions and expectations regarding housing markets, interest rates, commodity prices, and currencies;
•  changes in stock market analyst recommendations regarding us, our competitors or the forest products industry generally, or lack of analyst coverage of our common stock;
•  sales of our common stock by our executive officers, directors and significant shareholders;
•  sales or repurchases of substantial amounts of common stock;
weyerhaeuser company > 2021 annual report and form 10-k39

•  fluctuation in the market price of our products (see product pricing and profitability above);
•  changes in accounting principles and
•  changes in tax laws and regulations.
in addition, there has been significant volatility in the market price and trading volume of securities of companies, including companies operating in the forest products industry, that often has been unrelated to individual company operating performance. some companies that have experienced volatile market prices for their securities have had securities litigation brought against them. if litigation of this type is brought against us, it could result in substantial costs and divert management's attention and resources.
capital markets risks deterioration in economic conditions and capital markets could adversely affect our access to capital.
challenging market conditions could impair the company's ability to raise debt or equity capital or otherwise access capital markets on terms acceptable to us, which may, among other effects, reduce our ability to refinance debt maturities or take advantage of growth and expansion opportunities. moreover, our businesses require substantial capital for repair or replacement of existing facilities or equipment. while we believe our capital resources will be adequate to meet our current projected operating needs, capital expenditures and other cash requirements, if for any reason we are unable to access capital for our operating needs, capital expenditures and other cash requirements on acceptable economic terms, or at all, we could experience a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
changes in credit ratings issued by nationally recognized rating organizations could adversely affect our cost of financing and have an adverse effect on the market price of our securities.
credit rating agencies rate our debt securities on factors that include our operating results and balance sheet, actions that we take, their view of the general outlook for our industry and their view of the general outlook for the economy. ratings decisions by these agencies include maintaining, upgrading or downgrading our current rating, as well as placing the company on a "watch list" for possible future ratings actions. any downgrade of our credit rating, or decision by a rating agency to place us on a "watch list" for possible future downgrading could have an adverse effect on our ability to access credit markets, increase our cost of financing, and have an adverse effect on the market price of our securities.
information systems and cybersecurity we rely on information technology (it) to support our operations and reporting environments. we face risks associated with the use of it systems including from security breaches or other significant disruptions, which could affect our ability to operate our businesses effectively, adversely affect our reported financial results, affect our reputation and expose us to potential liability or litigation.
we use it systems to carry out our operational activities, maintain our business records, and collect and store sensitive data, including intellectual property and other proprietary and personally identifiable information. some of our systems are internally managed and some are maintained by third-party service providers. although we employ, and we believe our third-party service providers employ, what we deem to be reasonably adequate security measures and controls, there can be no assurance that our security measures will be effective against the risks we face from cyber-attacks, including from computer hackers, foreign governments and cyber terrorists; malicious code (such as malware, viruses and ransomware); an intentional or unintentional personnel action; a natural disaster; a hardware or software corruption, failure or error; a telecommunications system failure; a service provider failure or error;
or any one or more other causes of a security breach, failure or disruption. to date, no events of this nature have had a material adverse effect on our business. however, if in the future our it systems are significantly disrupted, shutdown or otherwise compromised, or if our data is destroyed, misappropriated or inappropriately disclosed, our financial results or our business operations, or both, could be negatively affected. additionally, we could suffer significant losses or incur significant liabilities, including without limitation damage to our reputation, loss of customer confidence or goodwill and significant expenditures of time and money to address and remediate resulting damages to affected individuals or business partners or to defend ourselves in resulting litigation or other legal proceedings by affected individuals, business partners or regulators.

table of contents management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations (md&a)
what you will find in this md&a our md&a includes the following major sections:
•  economic and market conditions affecting our operations;
•  financial performance summary;
•  results of our operations;
•  liquidity and capital resources;
•  environmental matters, legal proceedings and other contingencies;
•  accounting matters and
•  performance measures.
for management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations (md&a) related to the year ended december 31, 2019, refer to this same section in our 2020 annual report on form 10-k as filed with the securities and exchange commission on february 19, 2021.
economic and market conditions affecting our operations overview in march 2020, covid-19 was officially declared a global pandemic by the world health organization, and a national emergency was declared by the united states. the immediate economic effects of the pandemic were severe, as u.s.
gross domestic product (gdp) declined 31 percent in the second quarter of 2020 and the national unemployment rate soared to a record-high of nearly 15 percent in april 2020 driven by the restrictions imposed in response to the pandemic. since that time the unemployment rate has fallen steadily, and u.s. gdp has rebounded significantly as states have continued to reopen their economies and loosen restrictions. although market conditions across our businesses deteriorated rapidly in late first quarter and early second quarter 2020, they quickly rebounded as demand for housing and wood products proved resilient. growth in repair and remodel demand and new residential construction activity resulted in increased demand for wood products. as a result, benchmark prices rose to record levels through may 2021 for most lumber products and into early july for oriented strand board (osb). during the second quarter, lumber prices, followed by osb, began a substantial correction as demand from the repair and remodel segment lessened during the summer months. later in the third quarter, prices bottomed and began to rebound, and increased well above historical norms again by the end of 2021. looking ahead to 2022, our market conditions and the strength of the broader u.s. economy will continue to be influenced by the trajectory of u.s.
housing activity, repair and remodel activity, impacts from covid-related restrictions, inflation trends, interest rates, and the nature and extent of future government stimulus including the recently-passed infrastructure investment and jobs act.
we have taken proactive steps to safeguard the health of our employees and preserve business continuity from the beginning of the pandemic. these actions have included detailed cleaning and disinfecting procedures, strict processes around masking, social distancing and personal hygiene, clear communication with our employees, contractors, vendors and visitors about our safety protocols, comprehensive guidance for response to any covid-19
diagnoses or exposures in our operations, and a directive that employees work from home if feasible. in light of adjustments to federal, state and local health and safety restrictions, we began a phased-in approach to return some of our employees who have been working from home back to their work locations. we remain vigilant about employee safety and will continue to monitor developments, including but not limited to the spread of disease variants and their impact on local health systems.
business outlook the demand for sawlogs within our timberlands segment is directly affected by domestic production of wood-based building products. the strength of the u.s. housing market, especially new residential construction, strongly affects demand in our wood products segment, as does repair and remodeling activity. seasonal weather patterns impact the level of construction activity in the u.s., which in turn affects demand for our logs and wood products.
in the fourth quarter of 2021, weather conditions were favorable for harvest operations in the u.s. south. our timberlands segment, specifically the western region, is also affected by export demand and trade policy. japanese housing starts are a key driver of export log demand in japan. the demand for pulpwood from our timberlands segment is directly affected by the production of pulp, paper and osb as well as the demand for biofuels, such as pellets made from pulpwood. the timberlands segment is also influenced by the availability of harvestable timber. in general, western log markets are highly tensioned while southern log markets have more available supply. however, additional mill capacity being added in the u.s. south has led to tightening of markets in certain geographies.
on a seasonally adjusted annual basis, as reported by the u.s. census bureau, housing starts for fourth quarter
2021 averaged 1.644 million units, a 5.3 percent increase from third quarter 2021. single family starts averaged
1.148 million units and multi-family starts averaged 496
weyerhaeuser company > 2021 annual report and form 10-k43
table of contents thousand units in fourth quarter 2021, which represented increases of4.7 percentand 6.5 percent from the third quarter, respectively.total housing starts of 1.595 million in 2021wereup 15.6 percent from 2020.sales of newly built, single family homes averaged a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 728 thousand units for fourth quarter
2021, which is an increase of 4.2 percent fromthethird quarter.the continued strength of the housing market has been driven by low inventory, underlying demographic fundamentals, and low mortgage rates. builders have struggled to keep pace due to materialshortagesand other constraints, which has contributed to a growing backlog of construction activity.
repair and remodeling expenditures increased by 5.8 percent from third quarter to fourth quarter 2021 and increased by 13.5 percent for the full year compared to 2020 according to the census bureau advance retail spending report. a rebound in do-it-yourself activity and continued strength in projects undertaken by professional contractors contributed to higher sales in the sector.
in u.s. wood product markets, demand was steady during most of fourth quarter 2021 as dealer inventories remained tight. in the second half of the fourth quarter, lumber and osb prices rebounded sharply from lows in the third quarter. in addition to steady demand, floods in british columbia contributed to the increase in prices. the random lengths framing lumber composite price averaged $691/mbf and the osb composite averaged $624/msf in fourth quarter
2021.
western log markets have shown continued strength in response to the increase in lumber prices and limited log supply. douglas fir sawlog prices increased by 4 percent in fourth quarter 2021 compared with third quarter 2021 as reported by risi log lines. the strength in western log prices was supported by multiple factors including continued demand in export markets. in the south, sawlog prices increased by 1 percent from third quarter 2021 and
10 percent from fourth quarter 2020 as reported by timbermart-south. while weather events contributed to some of this increase, transportation constraints and additional mill demand also contributed to more tensioned log markets.
exchange rates, available supply from other countries and trade policy affect our export businesses. during fourth quarter 2021, continued disruptions in global shipping, diversion of european log and lumber supply to other markets, and bans on australian log imports to china generally had a positive impact on china's demand for logs imported from the u.s. in japan, total housing starts increased 5.1 percent year to date through november compared to the same period in 2020, while the key post and beam segment saw an 8.9 percent increase. decreased redwood lumber imports from europe to japan have continued to be favorable to our japanese log export business.
inflation affects our business, especially in increased costs for materials and labor, although there are also offsetting impacts including wood product prices and timberland's effectiveness as an inflation hedge. over the last twelve months, the consumer price index (cpi) increased by 7.0 percent, while the producer price index (final demand) increased by 9.7 percent.
governments and businesses across the globe are taking action on climate change and are making significant commitments towards reducing greenhouse gas emissions to net zero. achieving these commitments will require governments and companies to take major steps to modify operations, invest in low-carbon activities and purchase offsets to reduce environmental impacts. we believe we are uniquely positioned to help entities achieve these commitments through natural climate solutions, including forest carbon sequestration and carbon capture and storage activities.

net sales net sales increased $2,669 million - 35 percent - primarily due to:
•  a $2,431 million increase in wood products net sales to unaffiliated customers, primarily attributable to increased sales realizations across all product lines;
•  a $170 million increase in timberlands net sales to unaffiliated customers, primarily due to increased sales realizations in the western and southern regions and
•  a $68 million increase in real estate & enr net sales to unaffiliated customers, primarily attributable to increases in mitigation bank sales and the average price per real estate acre sold.
costs of sales costs of sales increased $656 million - 12 percent - primarily due to increased freight costs and increased sales volumes across most product lines within our wood products segment, as well as increased freight costs and third-
party log purchases within our timberlands segment.
these increases were partially offset by a decrease in real estate acres sold within our real estate & enr segment.

•  $(1,358) million in 2020.
comparing 2021 with 2020
net cash from financing activities increased $28 million in 2021, primarily due to:
•  a $385 million decrease in net cash used for payments on long-term debt and
•  a $230 million decrease in net cash paid related to borrowings on our line of credit.
these changes were largely offset by the following:
•  a $503 million increase in cash paid for dividends and
•  a $100 million increase in cash used for repurchases of common shares.
long-term debt our consolidated long-term debt (including current portion) was:
•  $5.1 billion as of december 31, 2021 and
•  $5.5 billion as of december 31, 2020.
the decrease in our long-term debt during 2021 is attributable to the repayment of our $225 million variable-rate term loan and our $150 million 9.00 percent notes.

environmental matters, legal proceedings and other contingencies see note 14: legal proceedings, commitments and contingencies.
accounting matters critical accounting policies in the preparation of our financial statements we follow established accounting policies and make estimates that affect both the amounts and timing of the recording of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. some of these estimates require judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain. accounting policies whose application may have a significant effect on the reported results of operations and financial position are considered critical accounting policies.
in accounting, we base our judgments and estimates on:
•  historical experience and
•  assumptions we believe are appropriate and reasonable under current circumstances.
actual results, however, may differ from the estimated amounts we have recorded.
our most critical accounting policies relate to our:
•  discount rates for pension and post-employment benefit plans;
•  potential impairments of long-lived assets and
•  contingent liabilities.
details about our other significant accounting policies - what we use and how we estimate - are in note 1: summary of significant accounting policies.
weyerhaeuser company > 2021 annual report and form 10-k53
table of contents discount rates for pension and post-employmentbenefit plans discount rates are used to estimate the net present value of our pension and other post-employment plan obligations. these rates are determined at the measurement date by matching current spot rates of high-quality corporate bonds with maturities similar to the timing of expected cash outflows for benefits. the selection of discount rates requires judgment as well as the involvement of actuarial specialists. these specialists assist with selecting yield curves based on published indices for high-quality corporate bonds and projecting the timing and amount of cash flows associated with our obligations to ultimately support our determination of an appropriate discount rate for each plan.
our discount rates as of december 31, 2021 are:
•  2.9 percent for our u.s. pension plans - compared with 2.5 percent at december 31, 2020;
•  2.6 percent for our u.s. post-employment plans - compared with 2.1 percent at december 31, 2020;
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
•  3.1 percent for our canadian pension plans - compared with 2.5 percent at december 31, 2020 and
•  3.0 percent for our canadian post-employment plans - compared with 2.4 percent at december 31, 2020.
pension expenses for 2022 will be based on the 2.9 percent and 3.1 percent assumed discount rates for the u.s.
pension plan and the canadian pension plan, respectively, and the 2.6 percent and 3.0 percent assumed discount rates for the u.s. and canadian post-employment benefit plans, respectively.
our discount rates are important in determining the cost of our plans. a 50 basis point decrease in our discount rate would increase expense or reduce a credit by approximately:
•  $18 million for our u.s. qualified pension plans and
•  $6 million for our canadian registered pension plans.
impairment of long-lived assets we review the carrying value of long-lived assets whenever an event or a change in circumstance indicates that the carrying value of the asset or asset group may not be recoverable through future operations. the carrying value is the original cost, less accumulated depreciation and any past impairments recorded. refer to note 4: timberland acquisitions and divestituresfor information on an impairment recognized in 2019.
if we evaluate recoverability, we are required to estimate future cash flows and residual values of the asset or asset group. key assumptions used in developing these estimates would include probability of alternative outcomes, product pricing, raw material cost and product sales.
an impairment occurs when the carrying value of a long-lived asset is greater than the amount that could be recovered from the estimated future cash flows of the asset and greater than fair market value (the amount we could receive if we were to sell the asset). key assumptions used in developing estimates of fair value would include the estimated future cash flows used to assess recoverability, discount rates and probability of alternative outcomes.
contingent liabilities we are subject to lawsuits, investigations and other claims related to environmental, product and other matters, and are required to assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes to these matters, as well as the amount or range of potential loss.
we record contingent liabilities when:
•  it becomes probable that a loss has been incurred and
•  the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated.
assessing probability of loss and estimating the amount of loss can require analysis of multiple factors, such as:
•  historical experience,
•  evaluations of relevant legal and environmental authorities and regulations,
•  judgments about the potential actions of third-party claimants and courts and
•  consideration of potential environmental remediation methods.
in addition to contingent liabilities recorded for probable losses, we disclose contingent liabilities when there is a reasonable possibility that a loss may have been incurred.
recorded contingent liabilities are based on the best information available and actual losses in any future period are inherently uncertain. if estimated probable future losses or actual losses exceed our recorded liability for such claims, we record additional charges. these exposures and proceedings can be significant and the ultimate negative outcomes could be material to our operating results or cash flows in any given quarter or year. see note
14: legal proceedings, commitments and contingenciesfor more information.

however, we believe adjusted ebitda provides meaningful supplemental information for our investors about our operating performance, better facilitates period to period comparisons and is widely used by analysts, lenders, rating agencies and other interested parties. our definition of adjusted ebitda may be different from similarly titled measures reported by other companies. adjusted ebitda, as we define it, is operating income adjusted for depreciation, depletion, amortization, basis of real estate sold and special items.

table of contents financial statements and supplementary data report of independent registered public accounting firm to the shareholders and board of directors weyerhaeuser company:
opinion on the consolidatedfinancial statements we have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of weyerhaeuser company and subsidiaries (the company)
as of december 31, 2021 and 2020, the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income, cash flows, and changes in equity for each of the years in the three-year period ended december 31, 2021, and the related notes (collectively, the consolidated financial statements). in our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the company as of december 31, 2021
and 2020, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended december 31, 2021, in conformity with u.s. generally accepted accounting principles.
we also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the public company accounting oversight board (united states) (pcaob), the company's internal control over financial reporting as of december 31, 2021, based on criteria established in internal control - integrated framework (2013) issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission, and our report dated february 18, 2022 expressed an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of the company's internal control over financial reporting.
basis for opinion these consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the company's management. our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audits. we are a public accounting firm registered with the pcaob and are required to be independent with respect to the company in accordance with the u.s. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the securities and exchange commission and the pcaob.
we conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the pcaob. those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. we believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
critical audit matter the critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1)
relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. the communication of a critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.
projected benefit obligations for pensions as discussed in notes 1 and 9 to the consolidated financial statements, the company's projected benefit obligations for pensions were $3,708 million as of december 31, 2021. the company estimates the liability related to their pension plans using actuarial models that include assumptions about the company's discount rates.
we identified the evaluation of the company's projected benefit obligations for pensions as a critical audit matter. this is due to the sensitivity of the obligations to changes in the discount rates used and the subjectivity in evaluating those rates. additionally, the assessment of discount rates required specialized actuarial skills and knowledge.
the following are the primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter. we evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of certain internal controls related to the pension obligation process. this included controls related to the actuarial determination of the discount rates used in the valuation of projected benefit obligations for pensions. these procedures also included analyzing year-over-year changes to the projected cash flows associated with the obligations. additionally, we involved actuarial professionals with specialized skills and knowledge, who assisted in the evaluation of the company's discount rates by:
•  evaluating the selected yield curves used to determine the discount rates
•  assessing changes in the discount rates from the prior year against changes in published indices
•  evaluating the discount rates based on the projected cash flows compared with those of similar plans.

table of contents notes to consolidated financial statements note 1: summary of significant accounting policies our significant accounting policies describe:
•  our election to be taxed as a real estate investment trust,
•  how we report our results,
•  changes in how we report our results and
•  how we account for various items.
our election to be taxed as a real estate investment trust (reit)
our company is a reit and reit income can be distributed to shareholders without first paying corporate level tax, substantially eliminating the double taxation on income. we expect to derive most of our reit income from investments in timberlands, including the sale of standing timber through pay-as-cut sales contracts and lump sum timber deeds. we continue to be required to pay federal corporate income taxes on earnings of our taxable reit subsidiaries (trss), which include our wood products segment and portions of our timberlands and real estate, energy and natural resources (real estate & enr) segments.
how we report our results our report includes:
•  consolidated financial statements,
•  our business segments,
•  estimates,
•  fair value measurements and
•  foreign currency translation.
consolidated financial statements our consolidated financial statements provide an overall view of our results and financial condition. they include our accounts and the accounts of entities that we control, including:
•  majority-owned domestic and foreign subsidiaries and
•  variable interest entities in which we are the primary beneficiary.
they do not include our intercompany transactions and accounts, which are eliminated.
throughout these notes to consolidated financial statements, unless specified otherwise, references to
"weyerhaeuser," "the company," "we" and "our" refer to the consolidated company.
our business segments reportable business segments are determined based on the company's "management approach," as defined by financial accounting standards board (fasb) accounting standards codification (asc) topic 280, segment reporting. the management approach is based on the way the chief operating decision maker organizes the segments within a company for making decisions about resources to be allocated and assessing their performance.
we are principally engaged in:
•  growing and harvesting timber;
•  maximizing the value of our acreage through the sale of higher and better use (hbu) properties and monetizing the value of surface and subsurface assets through leases and royalties and
•  manufacturing, distributing and selling products made from trees.
our business segments are organized based primarily on products and services.
segment            products and services timberlands        logs, timber, recreational leases and other products.
real estate & enr  real estate (sales of timberlands) and enr (rights to explore for and extract hard minerals, construction materials, natural gas production, wind and solar).
wood products      structural lumber, oriented strand board, engineered wood products and building materials distribution.
weyerhaeuser company > 2021 annual report and form 10-k65
table of contents we also transfer raw materials, semi-finished materials and end products among our business segments. because of this intracompany activity, accounting for our business segments involves pricing products transferred between our business segments at current market values.
unallocated items are gains or charges related to company level initiatives or previous businesses that are not allocated to our current business segments. they include all or a portion of items such as share-based compensation, pension and post-employment costs, elimination of intersegment profit in inventory and lifo, foreign exchange transaction gains and losses, interest income and other as well as legacy obligations such as environmental remediation and workers compensation.
estimates we prepare our financial statements according to u.s. generally accepted accounting principles (u.s. gaap). this requires us to make estimates and assumptions during our reporting periods and at the date of our financial statements. the estimates and assumptions affect our:
•  reported amounts of assets, liabilities and equity;
•  disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities and
•  reported amounts of revenues and expenses.
while we do our best in preparing these estimates, actual results can and do differ from those estimates and assumptions.
fair value measurements we use a fair value hierarchy in accounting for certain nonfinancial assets and liabilities including:
•  long-lived assets (asset groups) measured at fair value for an impairment assessment;
•  pension plan assets measured at fair value and
•  asset retirement obligations initially measured at fair value.
the fair value hierarchy is based on inputs to valuation techniques that are used to measure fair value that are either observable or unobservable. observable inputs reflect assumptions market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability based on market data obtained from independent sources while unobservable inputs reflect a reporting entity's pricing based upon its own market assumptions.
the fair value hierarchy consists of the following three levels:
•  level 1: inputs are unadjusted quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities traded in an active market.
•  level 2: inputs are quoted prices in non-active markets for which pricing inputs are observable either directly or indirectly at the reporting date.
•  level 3: inputs are derived from valuation techniques in which one or more significant inputs or value drivers are unobservable.
foreign currency translation we translate foreign currencies into u.s. dollars in two ways:
•  assets and liabilities - at the exchange rates in effect as of our balance sheet date and
•  revenues and expenses - at average monthly exchange rates throughout the year.
changes in how we report our results changes in how we report our results come from:
•  reclassification of certain balances and results from prior years to make them consistent with our current reporting and
•  accounting changes made upon our adoption of new accounting guidance.
reclassifications we have reclassified certain balances and results from prior years to be consistent with our 2021 reporting. this makes year-to-year balances comparable. our reclassifications had no effect on consolidated net earnings or equity.
how we account for various items this section provides information about how we account for certain key items related to:
•  capital investments,
•  financing our business and
•  operations.
items related to capital investments key items related to accounting for capital investments pertain to property and equipment, timber and timberlands and impairment of long-lived assets.
property and equipment we maintain property accounts on an individual asset basis and account for them as follows:
•  improvements to and replacements of major units of property are capitalized.
weyerhaeuser company > 2021 annual report and form 10-k66

•  maintenance, repairs and minor replacements are expensed.
•  depreciation is calculated using a straight-line method at rates based on estimated service lives.
•  costs associated with logging roads that we intend to utilize for a period longer than one year are capitalized. these roads are then amortized over an estimated service life.
•  cost and accumulated depreciation of property sold or retired are removed from the accounts and the gain or loss is included in earnings.
timber and timberlands we carry timber and timberlands at cost less depletion. depletion refers to the carrying value of timber that is harvested or sold.
key activities affecting how we account for timber and timberlands include:
•  reforestation,
•  depletion and
•  forest management in canada.
reforestation.generally, we capitalize initial site preparation and planting costs as reforestation and then expense costs after the first planting as they are incurred or over the period of expected benefit. these expensed costs include:
•  fertilization,
•  vegetation and insect control,
•  pruning and precommercial thinning and
•  property taxes.
accounting practices for these costs do not change when timber becomes merchantable and harvesting starts.
timber depletion.to determine depletion rates, we divide the net carrying value of timber by the related volume of timber estimated to be available over the growth cycle. to determine the growth cycle volume of timber, we consider:
•  regulatory and environmental constraints,
•  our management strategies,
•  inventory data improvements,
•  growth rate revisions and recalibrations and
•  known dispositions and inoperable acres.
in addition, the duration of the harvest cycle varies by geographic region and species of timber.
depletion rate calculations do not include estimates for:
•  future silviculture or sustainable forest management costs associated with existing stands;
•  future reforestation costs associated with a stand's final harvest and
•  future volume in connection with the replanting of a stand subsequent to its final harvest.
we include the cost of timber harvested in the carrying values of raw materials and product inventories. as these inventories are sold to third parties, we include them in costs of sales.
forest management in canada. we manage timberlands under long-term licenses in various canadian provinces that are:
•  granted by the provincial governments;
•  granted for initial periods of 15 to 25 years and
•  renewable provided we meet reforestation, operating and management guidelines.
calculation of the fees we pay on the timber we harvest:
•  varies from province to province,
•  is tied to product market pricing and
•  depends upon the allocation of land management responsibilities in the license.
impairment of long-lived assets we review the carrying value of long-lived assets whenever an event or a change in circumstance indicates that the carrying value of the asset or asset group may not be recoverable through future operations. the carrying value is the original cost, less accumulated depreciation and any past impairments recorded. impaired assets held for use are written down to fair value, while impaired assets held for sale are written down to fair value less cost to sell. we determine fair value based on:
•  appraisals,
•  market pricing of comparable assets,
•  discounted value of estimated future cash flows from the asset, weyerhaeuser company > 2021 annual report and form 10-k67

•  replacement values of comparable assets and
•  agreed upon sale price or offer price.
items related to financing our business key items related to financing our business include financial instruments, cash equivalents and concentration of risk.
financial instruments we estimate the fair value of financial instruments where appropriate. the assumptions we use - including the discount rate and estimates of cash flows - can significantly affect our fair-value amounts. our fair values are estimates and may not match the amounts we would realize upon sale or settlement of our financial positions.
cash equivalents cash equivalents are investments with maturities of 90 days or less at the date of purchase. we state cash equivalents at cost, which approximates market.
concentration of risk we disclose customers that represent a concentration of risk. as of december 31, 2021, and december 31, 2020, no customer accounted for percent or more of our net sales.
items related to operations key items related to operations include revenue recognition, inventories, shipping and handling costs, income taxes, pension and other post-employment benefit plans and environmental remediation.
revenue recognition refer to note 3: revenue recognitionfor details on how we account for revenue.
inventories we state inventories at the lower of cost or net realizable value. cost includes labor, materials and production overhead. lifo - the last-in, first-out method - applies to major inventory products held at our u.s. domestic locations. we began to use the lifo method for domestic products in the 1940s as required to conform with the tax method elected. subsequent acquisitions of entities added new products under the moving average cost or fifo - the first-in, first-out - methods and those products continue to be recognized under those methods. the moving average cost or fifo method applies to the balance of our domestic raw material and product inventories, all material and supply inventories and all foreign inventories.
shipping and handling costs we classify shipping and handling costs in "costs of sales" in the consolidated statement of operations.
income taxes we account for income taxes under the asset and liability method. unrecognized tax benefits represent potential future funding obligations to taxing authorities if uncertain tax positions we have taken on previously filed tax returns are not sustained. accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits are recognized as a component of income tax expense.
we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities to reflect:
•  future tax consequences due to differences between the carrying amounts for financial reporting purposes and the tax bases of certain items and
•  net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards.
to measure deferred tax assets and liabilities, we:
•  determine when the differences between the carrying amounts and tax bases of affected items are expected to be recovered or resolved and
•  use enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in those years.
pension and other post-employment benefit plans we recognize the overfunded or underfunded status of our defined benefit pension and other post-employment plans on our consolidated balance sheetand recognize changes in the funded status through comprehensive income (loss) in the year in which the changes occur.
actuarial valuations determine the amount of the pension and other post-employment benefit obligations and the net periodic benefit cost we recognize. the net periodic benefit cost includes:
•  cost of benefits provided in exchange for employees' services rendered during the year;
•  interest cost of the obligations;
•  expected long-term return on plan assets;
•  gains or losses on plan settlements and curtailments;
weyerhaeuser company > 2021 annual report and form 10-k68
table of contents amortization of prior service costs and plan amendments over the average remaining service period of the
•  active employee group covered by the plans or the average remaining life expectancy in situations where the plan participants affected by the plan amendment are inactive and amortization of cumulative unrecognized net actuarial gains and losses - generally in excess of 10 percent of the greater of the benefit obligation or the combination of market-related and fair value of plan assets
•  at the beginning of the year - over the average remaining service period of the active employee group covered by the plans or the average remaining life expectancy in situations where the plan participants are inactive.
pension plans. we have defined benefit pension plans covering approximately half of our employees. determination of benefits differs for salaried, hourly and union employees as follows:
•  salaried employee benefits are based on each employee's highest monthly earnings for five consecutive years during the final 10 years before retirement.
•  hourly and union employee benefits generally are stated amounts for each year of service.
•  union employee benefits are set through collective-bargaining agreements.
we contribute to our u.s. and canadian pension plans according to established funding standards. the funding standards for the plans are:
•  u.s. pension plans - according to the employee retirement income security act of 1974 and
•  canadian pension plans - according to the applicable provincial pension act and the income tax act.
post-employment benefits other than pensions. we provide certain post-employment health care and life insurance benefits for some retired employees. in some cases, we pay a portion of the cost of the benefit.note 9: pension and other post-employment benefit plansprovides additional information about our post-employment benefit plans.
estimates for pension and other post-employment benefit plans. estimates we use in accounting for our pension and other post-employment benefit plans include the:
•  fair value of our plan assets;
•  expected long-term rate of return on plan assets and
•  discount rates.
at the end of every year, we review our estimates with external advisers and make adjustments as appropriate. we use these estimates to calculate plan asset and liability information as of year-end as well as pension and post-
employment expense for the following year. actual experience that differs from our estimates and subsequent changes in our estimates could have a significant effect on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.
fair value of plan assets. plan assets are assets of the pension plan trusts that fund the benefits provided under the pension plans. the fair value of our plan assets estimatesthe amount that would be received if we were to sell each asset in an orderly transaction between market participants at the reporting date. we estimate the fair value of these assets based on the information available during the year-end reporting process.
refer to note 9: pension and other post-employment benefit plansfor information about the assets held within our pension plans and their related valuation methods.
expected long-term rate of return on plan assets. ourexpected long-term rate of return is our estimate of the return that our plan assets will earn over time. this rate is used in determining the net periodic benefit or cost we recognize for our plans.
factors we consider in determining our expected long-term rate of return include:
•  historical returns for a portfolio of assets similar to our expected allocation and
•  expected future performance of similar asset classes.
the actual return on plan assets in any given year may vary from our expected long-term rate of return. actual returns on plan assets affect the funded status of the plans. differences between actual returns on plan assets and the expected long-term rate of return are reflected as adjustments to accumulated other comprehensive loss, a component of total equity.
discount rates. discount rates are used to estimate the net present value of our plan obligations. the discount rates are determined at the measurement date by matching current spot rates of high-quality corporate bonds with maturities similar to the timing of expected cash outflows for benefits.
environmental remediation we accrue losses associated with environmental remediation obligations when such losses are probable and reasonably estimable. future expenditures for environmental remediation obligations are not discounted to their present value.
recoveries of environmental remediation costs from other parties are recorded as assets when the recovery is deemed probable and does not exceed the amount of losses previously recorded.

note 3: revenue recognition a majority of our revenue is derived from sales of delivered logs and manufactured wood products. we account for revenue in accordance with asc topic 606, revenue from contracts with customers.
performance obligations a performance obligation, as defined in asc topic 606, is a promise in a contract to transfer a distinct good or service to a customer. a contract's transaction price is allocated to each distinct performance obligation and recognized as revenue at the point in time, or over the period, in which the performance obligation is satisfied.
performance obligations associated with delivered log sales are typically satisfied when the logs are delivered to our customers' mills or delivered to an ocean vessel in the case of export sales. performance obligations associated with the sale of wood products are typically satisfied when the products are shipped. we have elected, as an accounting policy, to treat shipping and handling that is performed after a customer obtains control of the product as an activity required to fulfill the promise to transfer the good; therefore we will not evaluate this requirement as a separate performance obligation.
customers are generally invoiced shortly after logs are delivered or after wood products are shipped, with payment generally due within a month or less of the invoice date. asc topic 606 requires entities to consider significant financing components of contracts with customers, though allows for the use of a practical expedient when the period between satisfaction of a performance obligation and payment receipt is one year or less. given the nature of our revenue transactions, we have elected to utilize this practical expedient.
performance obligations associated with real estate sales are generally met when placed into escrow and all conditions of closing have been satisfied.
contract estimates substantially all of our performance obligations are satisfied as of a point in time. therefore, there is little judgment in determining when control transfers for our business segments as described above.
the transaction price for log sales generally equals the amount billed to our customer for logs delivered during the accounting period. for the limited number of log sales subject to a long-term supply agreement, the transaction price is variable but is known at the time of billing. for wood products sales, the transaction price is generally the amount billed to the customer for the products shipped but may be reduced slightly for estimated cash discounts and rebates.
there are no significant contract estimates related to the real estate business.
contract balances in general, customers are billed and a receivable is recorded as we ship and/or deliver wood products and logs. we generally receive payment shortly after products have been received by our customers. contract asset and liability balances are immaterial.
for real estate sales, the company receives the entire consideration in cash at closing.

table of contents note 4: timberland acquisitions and divestitures washington divestiture on april 30, 2021, we announced an agreement to sell thousand acres of timberlands in the north cascades region of washington. on july 7, 2021, we completed the sale for $ million in cash proceeds, which is net of purchase price adjustments and closing costs. this transaction was structured as a like-kind exchange along with the alabama acquisition discussed below. as a result of the sale, a gain of $ million was recorded in the timberlands segment in our consolidated statement of operations.
this divestiture is not considered a strategic shift that has, or will have, a major effect on our operations or financial results and therefore does not meet the requirements for presentation as discontinued operations.
alabama acquisition on february 25, 2021, we announced an agreement to purchase thousand acres of southwest alabama timberlands for approximately $ million. we completed the purchase on april 27, 2021 and recorded $ million of timberland assets in
"timber and timberlands at cost, less depletion" and $ million of related assets in "property and equipment, net"
on our consolidated balance sheet. as discussed above, this transaction was structured as a like-kind exchange.
oregon acquisition and divestiture on september 1, 2020, we announced an agreement to sell thousand acres of southern oregon timberlands and a separate agreement to purchase thousand acres of mid-coastal oregon timberlands.these transactions were structured as a like-kind exchange.
on november 17, 2020, we completed the sale of southern oregon timberlands for $ million in cash proceeds, which is net of purchase price adjustments and closing costs. as a result of the sale, we recorded a $ million gain in the timberlands segment. this sale was not considered a strategic shift that had, or will have, a major effect on our operations or financial results and therefore did not meet the requirements for presentation as discontinued operations.
on november 19, 2020, we completed the purchase of mid-coastal oregon timberlands for $ million, which is net of purchase price adjustments. as a result of the purchase, we recorded $ million of timberland assets in "timber and timberlands at cost, less depletion" and $ million of related assets in "property and equipment, net" on our consolidated balance sheet.
montana and michigan divestitures on december 17, 2019, we announced an agreement to sell thousand acres of montana timberlands. on march 26, 2020, we completed the sale for $ million in cash proceeds, which is net of purchase price adjustments and closing costs.
on september 16, 2019, we announced an agreement to sell thousand acres of michigan timberlands. on november 13,
2019, we completed the sale for $ million in cash proceeds, which is net of purchase price adjustments and closing costs. as a result of the sale, we recorded a $ million gain in the timberlands segment.
the montana and michigan divestitures were not considered strategic shifts that had or will have a major effect on our operations or financial results and therefore did not meet the requirements for presentation as discontinued operations. however, the related assets for the montana divestiture met the relevant criteria to be classified as held for sale which changed their presentation from long-term to current on our consolidated balance sheetas of december 31, 2019. the designation as held for sale required us to record the related net assets at the lower of their current cost basis or fair value, less an amount of estimated selling costs, and thus, we recognized a noncash pretax impairment charge of $ 80million in fourth quarter 2019. as a result, no material gain or loss was recorded upon completion of the sale in first quarter 2020.
note 5: net earnings (loss) per share our basic and diluted earnings (loss) per share for the last three years were:
•  $3.48 and $3.47, respectively, in 2021,
•  $1.07 in 2020 and
•  $(0.10) in 2019.
how we calculate basic and diluted net earnings (loss) per share basic earnings (loss) per share is net earnings (loss) available to common shareholders divided by the weighted average number of our outstanding common shares, including stock equivalent units where there is no circumstance under which those shares would not be issued.
diluted earnings (loss) per share is net earnings (loss) available to common shareholders divided by the sum of the:
•  weighted average number of our outstanding common shares and
•  the effect of our outstanding dilutive potential common shares.
dilutive potential common shares may include:
•  outstanding stock options,
•  restricted stock units and weyerhaeuser company > 2021 annual report and form 10-k73

note 8: related parties this note provides details about our transactions with related parties. for the years presented, our material related parties have consisted of variable interest entities.
from 2002 through 2004, we sold certain nonstrategic timberlands. as a result of these sales, buyer-sponsored and monetization variable interest entities, or special purpose entities (spes), were formed. we were the primary beneficiary and consolidated the assets and liabilities of the spes involved in these transactions.
the assets of the buyer-sponsored spes were financial investments which consisted of bank guarantees. these bank guarantees were in turn backed by bank notes, which were the liabilities of the monetization spes. interest earned from the financial investments within the buyer-sponsored spes was used to pay interest accrued on the corresponding monetization spe's note.
we had an equity interest in the monetization spes, but no ownership interest in the buyer-sponsored spes. the following disclosures refer to assets of buyer-sponsored spes and liabilities of monetization spes. however, because these spes were distinct legal entities:
•  assets of the spes were not available to satisfy our liabilities or obligations.
•  liabilities of the spes were not our liabilities or obligations.
during first quarter 2020, we received $ million in proceeds from our final buyer-sponsored spe at maturity. the corresponding $ million in liabilities of this spe was paid in third quarter 2019. during first quarter 2019, we received $ million in proceeds from a buyer-sponsored spe at maturity.
our consolidated statement of operationsincludes interest income on buyer-sponsored spe investments of $ 22million in 2019 and interest expense on monetization spe notes of $ 12million in 2019.
we had minimal interest income on buyer-sponsored spe investments and interest expense on monetization spe notes in
2020.
the weighted average interest rate on our buyer-sponsored spes was percent during 2020 and 2019. the interest rate on the final monetization spe that matured in 2019 was percent.
note 9: pension and other post-employment benefit plans this note provides details about defined benefit and defined contribution plans we sponsor for our employees. the
"pension and other post-employment benefit plans" section of note 1: summary of significant accounting policiesprovides information about how we account for pension and other post-employment plans and benefits.
weyerhaeuser company > 2021 annual report and form 10-k75
table of contents defined benefit plans we sponsor overview of plans the defined benefit pension plans we sponsor in the u.s. and canada differ according to each country's requirements. in the u.s., we have plans that qualify under the internal revenue code (qualified plans), as well as plans for select employees that provide additional benefits not qualified under the internal revenue code
(nonqualified plans). in canada, we have plans that are registered under the income tax act and applicable provincial pension acts (registered plans), as well as nonregistered plans for select employees that provide additional benefits that may not be registered under the income tax act or provincial pension acts (nonregistered plans). we also sponsor other post-employment benefit (opeb) plans in the u.s. and canada, including retiree medical and life insurance plans.
we sponsor various defined contribution plans for our u.s. and canadian salaried and hourly employees. our contributions to these plans were $ million, $ million and $ million in 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.
actions to reduce pension plan obligations as part of our continued efforts to reduce pension plan obligations, we transferred approximately $ billion and $
1.5billion of u.s. qualified pension plan assets and liabilities to insurance companies through the purchase of group annuity contracts in december 2020 (2020 retiree annuity purchase) and january 2019 (2019 retiree annuity purchase), respectively. in connection with these transactions, we recorded noncash pretax settlement charges of $
253million and $ 449million during 2020 and 2019, respectively. these settlement charges accelerated the recognition of previously unrecognized losses in "accumulated other comprehensive loss," that would have been recognized in subsequent periods.
the 2019 retiree annuity purchase triggered a remeasurement of plan assets and liabilities. we updated the discount rate used to measure our projected benefit obligation for the u.s. qualified pension plan as of january 31, 2019, as well as our discount rate used to calculate the related net periodic benefit cost for the remainder of 2019 to percent from percent. all other assumptions remained unchanged. the net effect of the remeasurement was a $ million reduction in funded status, primarily driven by the decrease in discount rate. this change in funded status was reflected on our consolidated balance sheetas of march 31, 2019. given the timing of the 2020 retiree annuity purchase, the plan remeasurement triggered as a result of the transaction was conducted as part of our annual valuation process.
additionally, we settled the assets and liabilities associated with three canadian registered pension plans through the purchase of group annuity contracts in october 2019. as a result of the transaction, we recorded a noncash pretax settlement charge of $ million.

(3)  and prior service costs and credits that are deferred and amortized into periodic benefit costs in future periods. unamortized amounts are recorded in "accumulated other comprehensive loss", which is a component of total equity on our consolidated balance sheet. the "accumulated other comprehensive loss" section of note 15: shareholders' interest details changes in these amounts by component.
for pension plans with a projected benefit obligation exceeding plan assets, the projected benefit obligation and fair value of plan assets were $2.9 billion and $2.5 billion at december 31, 2021,
(4)  respectively, and $3.1 billion and $2.3 billion at december 31, 2020, respectively. for pension plans with an accumulated benefit obligation exceeding plan assets, the accumulated benefit obligation and fair value of plan assets were $2.8 billion and $2.5 billion at december 31, 2021, respectively, and $3.0 billion and

pension assets our investment policies and strategies our investment policies and strategies guide and direct how the funds are managed for the benefit plans we sponsor.
these funds include our:
•  u.s. pension trust - funds our u.s. qualified pension plans;
•  canadian pension trust - funds our canadian registered pension plans and
•  retirement compensation arrangements - fund a portion of our canadian nonregistered pension plans.
u.s. and canadian pension trusts in 2018, we began to shift pension plan assets to an allocation that more closely aligns with our pension plan liability profile. our former investment strategy included investments primarily in hedge funds and private equity funds. these asset classes are now in redemption and run-off mode. however, given the long-term nature of these investments, they will continue to comprise a portion of the plan assets for several years. we expect all investments in redemption to be redeemed at amounts materially consistent with their net asset values (nav). as these investments are redeemed or liquidated, cash proceeds available for investment will be invested in accordance with our revised investment strategy.
the revised investment strategy targets a percentage allocation to growth assets and a percentage allocation to liability hedging assets based on each plan's funded status. we expect to increase the allocation to liability hedging assets over time as the funded status of the pension plan improves. growth assets include investments in global equities, hedge funds (which are in redemption) and private equity assets (which are in run-off mode).
liability hedging assets include corporate credit and government issued fixed income securities as well as treasury futures selected to align with the plan liabilities.
in december 2021, we entered into an agreement to sell certain private equity and hedge fund investments to a third party for $ million (2021 secondary sale) in accordance with our investment strategy. a majority of the assets were transferred to the buyer by year-end 2021. the remaining assets included in the sale are held at the purchase price and are expected to transfer during 2022 in accordance with the agreement.
assets within our u.s. and canadian pension trusts were invested as follows:

cash and short-term investments are valued at cost, which approximates market. the increased cash holding
(1)  at year-end 2021 was a result of the 2021 secondary sale transaction timing. refer to "u.s. and canadian pension trusts" above for further information.
fixed income investments include publicly traded corporate and government issued debt. these bonds have varying maturities, credit quality and sector exposure and are selected to align with the duration of our plan liabilities. additionally, our fixed income portfolio includes repurchase agreements, which represent
(2)  short-term borrowings to hedge against interest rate risk. we have an obligation to return the cash related to these borrowings in accordance with the agreements, which are collateralized by our government bonds. fixed income investments are valued at exit prices quoted in active or non-active markets or based on observable inputs.
weyerhaeuser company > 2021 annual report and form 10-k78
table of contents hedge funds and related investments are privately-offered managed pools primarily structured as limited liability entities. general members or partners of these limited liability entities serve as portfolio
(3)  managers and are thus responsible for the fund's underlying investment decisions. underlying investments within these funds may include long and short public and private equities, corporate, mortgage and sovereign debt, options, swaps, forwards and other derivative positions. these funds have varying degrees of leverage, liquidity and redemption provisions.
these investments are primarily valued based on the navs of the funds. these values represent the per-unit
(4)  price at which new investors are permitted to invest and existing investors are permitted to exit. when navs as of the end of the year have not been received, we estimate fair value by adjusting the most recently reported navs for market events and cash flows between the interim date and the end of the year.
private equity and related investments are investments in private equity, mezzanine, distressed, co-investments and other structures. private equity funds generally participate in buyout and venture
(5)  capital strategies through unlisted equity and debt instruments. these funds may also borrow at the underlying entity level. mezzanine and distressed funds generally invest in the debt of public or private companies with additional participation through warrants or other equity options.
derivative instruments have historically been comprised of swaps, futures, forwards or options. consistent
(6)  with our shift in asset strategy, our positions in derivative instruments have been significantly reduced.
at december 31, 2021, only a small amount of futures remain in our portfolio. derivative instruments are valued based upon valuation statements received from each derivative's counterparty.
retirement compensation arrangements retirement compensation arrangements fund a portion of our canadian nonregistered pension plans. as required by canadian tax rules, approximately 50 percent of these assets are invested into a non-interest bearing refundable tax account held by the canada revenue agency. this portion of the portfolio does not earn returns. the remaining portion is invested in a portfolio of equities.
managing risk investments and contracts are subject to risks including market price, interest rate, credit, currency and liquidity risks. the following provides an overview of these risks and describes governance processes and actions we take to mitigate these risks on our pension plan asset portfolios.

hedge fund investments generally have less liquidity than publicly traded investments.
valuation of our plan assets pension assets are stated at fair value or nav. fair value is based on the amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to settle a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the reporting date. we consider both observable and unobservable inputs that reflect assumptions applied by market participants when setting the exit price of an asset or liability in an orderly transaction within the principal market for that asset or liability.
we value the pension plan assets based upon the observability of exit pricing inputs and classify pension plan assets based upon the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement of the pension plan assets in their entirety. refer to note 1: summary of significant accounting policiesfor details on the fair value hierarchy.

the availability of observable market data is monitored to assess the appropriate classification of financial instruments within the fair value hierarchy. changes in economic conditions or model-based valuation techniques may require the transfer of financial instruments from one fair value level to another. in such instances, the transfer is reported at the beginning of the reporting period. we evaluate the significance of transfers between levels based upon the nature of the financial instrument and size of the transfer relative to total net assets available for benefits.

for the u.s. defined benefit plans, the discount rate assumption was 2.50%, 3.40% and 4.30% for 2021, 2020
and 2019, respectively. for the canadian defined benefit plans, the discount rate assumption was 2.50%,
3.10% and 3.70% for 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. for u.s. opeb plans, the discount rate assumption
(1)  was 2.10%, 3.00% and 4.20%, for 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. for canadian opeb plans, the discount rate assumption was 2.40%, 3.00% and 3.70% for 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. for lump sum distributions (for u.s. qualified salaried and nonqualified plans only), the discount rate assumption was based on the ppa phased table: interest and mortality assumptions as mandated by the pension protection act of 2006.
the discount rate used to estimate our net periodic benefit cost for january 2019 was 4.40%. due to the
(2)  remeasurement triggered by the 2019 retiree annuity purchase, the discount rate was updated to 4.30% for the remainder of the year.
determining our expected return requires a high degree of judgment. we consider actual pension fund asset performance over multiple years, and current and expected valuation levels in the global equity and credit markets. historical fund returns are used as a base and we place added weight on more recent pension plan
(3)  asset performance. as discussed in the "our investment policies and strategies" and "u.s. and canadian pension trusts" sections above, fixed income securities continue to make up a larger portion of our plan assets. as a result, we reduced our assumption of long-term rate of return on plan assets to 5.00% for the year ending december 31, 2022.
for the u.s. defined benefit plans, the rate of compensation increase assumption for 2021, 2020 and 2019
was between 2.00% - 13.00% for salaried and hourly participants and was decreasing with participant age.
(4)  for the canadian defined benefit plans, the rate of compensation increase assumption for salaried participants was 3.25% for 2021, 2020 and 2019. the rate of compensation increase assumption for hourly participants was 3.00% for 2021, 2020 and 2019.
(5)  u.s. qualified salaried and nonqualified plans only.
(6)  for opeb plans during 2021, the assumed weighted healthcare cost trend rate was 6.8%, 4.5% and 5.3% for u.s. pre-medicare participants, u.s. hra participants and canadian opeb plans, respectively.
pension plan contributions and benefit payments established funding standards govern the funding requirements for our qualified and registered pension plans. we fund the benefit payments of our nonqualified and nonregistered plans as benefit payments come due.
during 2021, we made contributions and/or benefit payments of $ million for our u.s. nonqualified pension plans, $
million for our canadian nonregistered pension plans and $ million for our canadian registered plans. additionally, we voluntarily contributed $ million to our u.s. qualified pension plans during 2021, although there was no minimum required contribution for the year.
during 2022, based on estimated year-end asset values and projections of plan liabilities, we expect to make contributions and/or benefit payments of approximately:
•  $13 million for our u.s. nonqualified pension plans,
•  $3 million for the canadian non-registered plans and
•  $2 million for our canadian registered plan (required contribution).
we do not anticipate contributions being required for our u.s. qualified pension plan for 2022.

union-administered multiemployer benefit plans we contribute to multiemployer defined benefit plans under the terms of collective-bargaining agreements. these plans cover a small number of our employees and on an annual basis our contributions are immaterial.
these plans have different risks than single-employer plans. our contributions may be used to fund benefits for employees of other participating employers. if we choose to stop participating, we may be required to pay a withdrawal liability based on the underfunded status of the plan. if another participating employer stops contributing to the plan, we may become responsible for remaining plan unfunded obligations.

to estimate the fair value of long-term debt we used the market approach, which is based on quoted market prices we received for the same types and issues of our debt.
we believe that our variable-rate long-term debt and line of credit instruments have net carrying values that approximate their fair values with only insignificant differences.
the inputs to these valuations are based on market data obtained from independent sources or information derived principally from observable market data. the difference between the fair value and the carrying value represents the theoretical net premium or discount we would pay or receive to retire all debt at the measurement date.
fair value of other financial instruments we believe that our other financial instruments, including cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, mutual fund investments held in grantor trusts, receivables and payables, have net carrying values that approximate their fair values with only insignificant differences. this is primarily due to the short-term nature of these instruments and the allowance for doubtful accounts.
note 14: legal proceedings, commitments and contingencies this note provides details about our:
•  legal proceedings,
•  environmental matters and
•  commitments and other contingencies.
legal proceedings we are party to various legal proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business. we are not currently a party to any legal proceeding that management believes could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated balance sheet, consolidated statement of operationsorconsolidated statement of cash flows.
environmental matters site remediation under the federal comprehensive environmental response, compensation and liability act (cercla) - commonly known as the "superfund" - and similar state laws, we are a party to various proceedings related to the cleanup of hazardous waste sites and have been notified that we may be a potentially responsible party related to the cleanup of other hazardous waste sites for which proceedings have not yet been initiated.
we have received notification from the environmental protection agency (the epa) and have acknowledged that we are a potentially responsible party in a portion of the kalamazoo river superfund site in southwest michigan. our involvement in the remediation site is based on our former ownership of the plainwell, michigan mill located within the remediation site. several other companies also have been deemed potentially responsible parties as past or present owners or operators of facilities within the site, or as arrangers under cercla.
we cooperated with other parties to jointly implement an administrative order issued by the epa on april 14, 2016, with respect to a portion of the site comprising a stretch of the river approximately 1.7 miles long referred to as the otsego township dam area. during third quarter 2018, implementation of this administrative order was completed.
in 2010, the company, along with others, was named as a defendant by georgia-pacific consumer products lp, fort james corporation and georgia-pacific llc in an action seeking contribution under cercla for remediation costs relating to a certain area within the site. on march 29, 2018, the u.s. district court issued an opinion and order assigning the company responsibility for 5 percent of approximately $50 million in past costs incurred by the plaintiffs. the remaining 95 percent of this pool of past costs incurred was allocated to the plaintiffs and other defendants.
weyerhaeuser company > 2021 annual report and form 10-k85
table of contents the opinion and order, which is currently on appeal before the u.s.court of appeals for the sixth circuit, does not establish allocation for future remediation costs, and accordingly, we may incur additional costs in connection with future remediation tasks for other areas of the site.
we have established accruals for estimated remediation costs on the active superfund sites and other sites for which we are a potentially responsible party. these accruals are recorded in "accrued liabilities" and "other liabilities" on our consolidated balance sheet.

we change our accrual to reflect:
•  new information on any site concerning implementation of remediation alternatives,
•  updates on prior cost estimates and new sites and
•  costs incurred to remediate sites.
estimates.we believe it is reasonably possible, based on currently available information and analysis, that remediation costs for all identified sites may exceed our existing accruals by up to $ 126million. this estimate, in which those additional costs may be incurred over several years, is the upper end of the range of reasonably possible additional costs. the estimate:
•  is much less certain than the estimates on which our accruals currently are based and
•  uses assumptions that are less favorable to us among the range of reasonably possible outcomes.
in estimating our current accruals and the possible range of additional future costs, we:
•  assumed we will not bear the entire cost of remediation of every site,
•  took into account the ability of other potentially responsible parties to participate and
•  considered each party's financial condition and probable contribution on a per-site basis.
we have not recorded any amounts for potential recoveries from insurance carriers.
asset retirement obligations we have obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long-lived assets consisting primarily of reforestation obligations related to forest management licenses in canada and obligations to close and cap landfills. some of our sites have asbestos containing materials. we have met our current legal obligation to identify and manage these materials. in situations where we cannot reasonably determine when asbestos containing materials might be removed from the sites, we have not recorded an accrual because the fair value of the obligation cannot be reasonably estimated. as of december 31, 2021, and december 31, 2020, we had an asset retirement obligation of $ million.these obligations are recorded in "accrued liabilities" and "other liabilities" on our consolidated balance sheet.

note 16: share-based compensation this note provides details about:
•  our long-term incentive compensation plan (2013 plan),
•  how we account for share-based awards,
•  tax benefits of share-based awards,
•  types of share-based compensation,
•  unrecognized share-based compensation and
•  deferred compensation stock equivalent units.
share-based compensation expense was:
•  $30 million in 2021,
•  $30 million in 2020 and
•  $30 million in 2019.
our long-term incentive compensation plan our long-term incentive plan provides for share-based awards that include:
•  restricted stock,
•  restricted stock units (rsus),
•  performance shares,
•  performance share units (psus), weyerhaeuser company > 2021 annual report and form 10-k88

•  stock options and
•  stock appreciation rights (sars).
we may issue future grants of up to million shares under the 2013 plan. we also have the right to reissue forfeited and expired grants.
for restricted stock, rsus, performance shares, psus or other equity grants:
•  an individual participant may receive a grant of up to 1 million shares annually.
•  no participant may be granted awards that exceed $10 million earned in a 12-month period.
for stock options and sars:
•  an individual participant may receive a grant of up to 2 million shares in any one calendar year.
•  the exercise price is required to be the market price on the date of the grant.
we have not granted any stock options or sars since 2016 and the remaining liability related to sars is immaterial at december 31, 2021.
the compensation committee of our board of directors annually establishes an overall pool of stock awards available for grants based on performance.
for stock-settled awards we:
•  issue new stock into the marketplace and
•  generally do not repurchase shares in connection with issuing new awards.
our common shares would increase by approximately million shares if all share-based awards were exercised or vested. these include:
•  all options, rsus and psus outstanding at december 31, 2021, and
•  all remaining options, rsus and psus that could be granted under the 2013 plan.
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
how we account for share-based awards when accounting for share-based awards we:
•  use a fair-value-based measurement and
•  recognize the cost of share-based awards in our consolidated financial statements.
we recognize the cost of share-based awards in the consolidated statement of operationsover the required service period - generally the period from the date of the grant to the date when it is fully vested. special situations include:
•  awards that vest upon retirement - the required service period ends on the date an employee is eligible for retirement, including early retirement.
•  awards that continue to vest following job elimination or the sale of a business - the required service period ends on the date the employment from the company is terminated.
in these special situations, compensation expense from share-based awards is recognized over a period that is shorter than the stated vesting period.
tax benefits of share-based awards our total income tax benefit from share-based awards recognized in the consolidated statement of operationsfor the last three years was:
•  $4 million in 2021,
•  $4 million in 2020 and
•  $4 million in 2019.
weyerhaeuser company > 2021 annual report and form 10-k89
table of contents tax benefits from share-based awards are accrued as stock compensation expense and realized when:
•  restricted shares and rsus vest,
•  performance shares and psus vest,
•  stock options are exercised and
•  sars are exercised.
types of share-based compensation our share-based compensation is in the form of:
•  rsus,
•  psus,
•  stock options and
•  sars.
restricted stock units through the 2013 plan, we award rsus - grants that entitle the holder to shares of our stock as the award vests.
the details our rsus granted in 2021, 2020 and 2019 generally:
•  vest ratably over four years;
•  immediately vest in the event of death while employed or disability;
•  continue to vest upon retirement at an age of at least 62, but a portion of the grant is forfeited if retirement occurs before the one-year anniversary of the grant;
•  continue vesting for one year in the event of involuntary termination when retirement has not been met and
•  will be forfeited upon termination of employment in all other situations including early retirement prior to age 62.
our accounting the fair value of our rsus is the market price of our stock on the grant date of the awards.
we generally record share-based compensation expense for rsus over the four-year vesting period. generally, for rsus that continue to vest following the termination of employment, we record the share-based compensation expense over a required service period that is less than the stated vesting period.

(1)  as of december 31, 2021, there were approximately 245 thousand rsus that had met the requisite service period and will be released as identified in the grant terms.
the weighted average grant-date fair value for rsus was:
•  $33.62 in 2021,
•  $30.03 in 2020 and
•  $25.83 in 2019.
the total grant-date fair value of rsus vested was:
•  $25 million in 2021,
•  $19 million in 2020 and
•  $18 million in 2019.
nonvested rsus accrue dividends that are paid out when rsus vest. any rsus forfeited will not receive dividends.
as rsus vest, a portion of the shares awarded is withheld to cover employee taxes. as a result, the number of stock units vested and the number of common shares issued will differ.
weyerhaeuser company > 2021 annual report and form 10-k90
table of contents performance share units through the 2013 plan, we award psus - grants that entitle the holder to shares of our stock as the award vests.
the details the final number of shares granted in 2021 and 2020 will vest between a range of percent to percent of each grant's target, depending upon actual company performance compared against an industry peer group. for psus granted in
2019, company performance is measured against an industry peer group and the s&p 500.
the vesting provisions for psus granted in 2021, 2020 and 2019 were as follows:
•  vest 100 percent on the third anniversary of the grant date as long as the individual remains employed by the company;
•  fully vest in the event the participant dies or becomes disabled while employed;
•  continue to vest upon retirement at an age of at least 62, but a portion of the grant is forfeited if retirement occurs before the one-year anniversary of the grant;
•  continue vesting for one year in the event of involuntary termination when the retirement criteria has not been met and the employee has met the second anniversary of the grant date and
•  will be forfeited upon termination of employment in all other situations including early retirement prior to age 62.
in addition, psus granted in 2021 and 2020 will vest at a maximum of 100 percent of target value in the event of negative absolute company total shareholder return (tsr).
our accounting since the awards contain a market condition, the effect of the market condition is reflected in the grant-date fair value which is estimated using a monte carlo simulation model. this model estimates the tsr ranking of the company over the performance period. compensation expense is based on the estimated probable number of earned awards and recognized over the vesting period on an accelerated basis. generally, compensation expense would not be reversed if the market condition is not achieved, provided the requisite service period has been completed.

note 17: leases we account for leases in accordance with asc topic 842, leases, which we adopted on january 1, 2019 using the modified retrospective transition approach at the beginning of the adoption period through a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings. this adoption resulted in the recognition of right-of-use assets ("rou assets") of
$ million and lease liabilities of $ million, with the difference of $ million recorded to "retained earnings", on our consolidated balance sheeton january 1, 2019.
the majority of our operating leases are related to our office and warehouse space, and the majority of our financing leases are related to vehicles and forklifts. our leases have remaining lease terms of approximately year to years. options to renew, extend or terminate a lease are reflected in our lease terms when we believe it is reasonably certain we will exercise that option. when our leases do not provide an implicit or an explicit interest rate, we use our incremental borrowing rate in determining the present value of lease payments.

insurance recovery during fourth quarter 2021, we received a $ million insurance recovery related to property damage and business interruption for certain of our mills in the southern u.s. as a result of severe winter storm damage in first quarter 2021. this recovery was attributable to our wood products segment and was recorded within "other operating costs, net" in the consolidated statement of operations.
timber casualty loss in september 2020, forest fires in the state of oregon, commonly referred to as the holiday farm, beachie creek, riverside, and archie creek fires, spread from adjacent lands onto portions of our oregon timberland properties.
based on interpretation of satellite imagery and aerial photography, as well as limited on-site assessments, we estimated that the fires affected approximately thousand acres of our oregon timberlands. our assessments indicated that the extent of damage varies from tract to tract based on topographical conditions, rate of fire spread, age of the timber and other circumstances. based on these assessments, we expected that the majority of merchantable timber, even if affected by the fires, is likely salvageable if harvested within a reasonable period of time. we believe the majority of pre-merchantable timber affected by the fires will not be able to be salvaged.
in third quarter 2020, we recorded a timber casualty loss of $ million which represented the estimated book value of timber and related assets that could not be salvaged based on information available at that time. the loss was attributable to our timberlands segment and was recorded within "other operating costs, net" in the consolidated statement of operations. as of december 31, 2021, we have harvested a substantial majority of our planned salvage volume in oregon. the additional information obtained from our salvage operations has not resulted in a change to the estimated loss previously recorded.

table of contents reinvestment of undistributed earnings it is our practice and intention to permanently reinvest approximately percent of the earnings of our canadian subsidiary. our assertion is based on the company's global cash management and planned capital deployment.
accordingly, deferred taxes are provided primarily related to canadian withholding taxes associated with any canadian earnings not considered permanently reinvested. we have no other foreign subsidiaries with undistributed earnings.
unrecognized tax benefits unrecognized tax benefits represent potential future obligations to taxing authorities if uncertain tax positions we have taken on previously filed tax returns are not sustained. in accordance with our accounting policy, we accrue interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as a component of income tax expense (see note

31, 2021 and 2020, as well as the activity during those years, were immaterial.
as of december 31, 2021, none of our u.s. federal income tax returns or foreign jurisdiction income tax returns are under examination. our u.s. federal income tax returns are open to examination for years 2018 forward and foreign jurisdiction income tax returns are open to examination for years 2014 forward. we are undergoing examinations in state jurisdictions for tax years 2016 through 2018, with tax years 2009 forward open to examination. we do not expect that the outcome of any examination will have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements;
however, audit outcomes and the timing of audit settlements are subject to significant uncertainty.

we also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the public company accounting oversight board (united states) (pcaob), the consolidated balance sheets of the company as of december 31, 2021 and 2020, the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income, cash flows, and changes in equity for each of the years in the three-year period ended december 31, 2021, and the related notes (collectively, the consolidated financial statements), and our report dated february 18, 2022 expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements.
basis for opinion the company's management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying management's report on internal control over financial reporting. our responsibility is to express an opinion on the company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. we are a public accounting firm registered with the pcaob and are required to be independent with respect to the company in accordance with the u.s. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the securities and exchange commission and the pcaob.
we conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the pcaob. those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk.
our audit also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. we believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
definition and limitations of internal control over financial reporting a company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. a company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations (md&a) related to the year ended december 31, 2019, refer to this same section in our 2020 annual report on form 10-k as filed with the securities and exchange commission on february 19, 2021.
economic and market conditions affecting our operations overview in march 2020, covid-19 was officially declared a global pandemic by the world health organization, and a national emergency was declared by the united states. the immediate economic effects of the pandemic were severe, as u.s.
gross domestic product (gdp) declined 31 percent in the second quarter of 2020 and the national unemployment rate soared to a record-high of nearly 15 percent in april 2020 driven by the restrictions imposed in response to the pandemic. since that time the unemployment rate has fallen steadily, and u.s. gdp has rebounded significantly as states have continued to reopen their economies and loosen restrictions. although market conditions across our businesses deteriorated rapidly in late first quarter and early second quarter 2020, they quickly rebounded as demand for housing and wood products proved resilient. growth in repair and remodel demand and new residential construction activity resulted in increased demand for wood products. as a result, benchmark prices rose to record levels through may 2021 for most lumber products and into early july for oriented strand board (osb). during the second quarter, lumber prices, followed by osb, began a substantial correction as demand from the repair and remodel segment lessened during the summer months. later in the third quarter, prices bottomed and began to rebound, and increased well above historical norms again by the end of 2021. looking ahead to 2022, our market conditions and the strength of the broader u.s. economy will continue to be influenced by the trajectory of u.s.
housing activity, repair and remodel activity, impacts from covid-related restrictions, inflation trends, interest rates, and the nature and extent of future government stimulus including the recently-passed infrastructure investment and jobs act.
we have taken proactive steps to safeguard the health of our employees and preserve business continuity from the beginning of the pandemic. these actions have included detailed cleaning and disinfecting procedures, strict processes around masking, social distancing and personal hygiene, clear communication with our employees, contractors, vendors and visitors about our safety protocols, comprehensive guidance for response to any covid-19
diagnoses or exposures in our operations, and a directive that employees work from home if feasible. in light of adjustments to federal, state and local health and safety restrictions, we began a phased-in approach to return some of our employees who have been working from home back to their work locations. we remain vigilant about employee safety and will continue to monitor developments, including but not limited to the spread of disease variants and their impact on local health systems.
business outlook the demand for sawlogs within our timberlands segment is directly affected by domestic production of wood-based building products. the strength of the u.s. housing market, especially new residential construction, strongly affects demand in our wood products segment, as does repair and remodeling activity. seasonal weather patterns impact the level of construction activity in the u.s., which in turn affects demand for our logs and wood products.
in the fourth quarter of 2021, weather conditions were favorable for harvest operations in the u.s. south. our timberlands segment, specifically the western region, is also affected by export demand and trade policy. japanese housing starts are a key driver of export log demand in japan. the demand for pulpwood from our timberlands segment is directly affected by the production of pulp, paper and osb as well as the demand for biofuels, such as pellets made from pulpwood. the timberlands segment is also influenced by the availability of harvestable timber. in general, western log markets are highly tensioned while southern log markets have more available supply. however, additional mill capacity being added in the u.s. south has led to tightening of markets in certain geographies.
on a seasonally adjusted annual basis, as reported by the u.s. census bureau, housing starts for fourth quarter
2021 averaged 1.644 million units, a 5.3 percent increase from third quarter 2021. single family starts averaged
1.148 million units and multi-family starts averaged 496
weyerhaeuser company > 2021 annual report and form 10-k43
table of contents thousand units in fourth quarter 2021, which represented increases of4.7 percentand 6.5 percent from the third quarter, respectively.total housing starts of 1.595 million in 2021wereup 15.6 percent from 2020.sales of newly built, single family homes averaged a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 728 thousand units for fourth quarter
2021, which is an increase of 4.2 percent fromthethird quarter.the continued strength of the housing market has been driven by low inventory, underlying demographic fundamentals, and low mortgage rates. builders have struggled to keep pace due to materialshortagesand other constraints, which has contributed to a growing backlog of construction activity.
repair and remodeling expenditures increased by 5.8 percent from third quarter to fourth quarter 2021 and increased by 13.5 percent for the full year compared to 2020 according to the census bureau advance retail spending report. a rebound in do-it-yourself activity and continued strength in projects undertaken by professional contractors contributed to higher sales in the sector.
in u.s. wood product markets, demand was steady during most of fourth quarter 2021 as dealer inventories remained tight. in the second half of the fourth quarter, lumber and osb prices rebounded sharply from lows in the third quarter. in addition to steady demand, floods in british columbia contributed to the increase in prices. the random lengths framing lumber composite price averaged $691/mbf and the osb composite averaged $624/msf in fourth quarter
2021.
western log markets have shown continued strength in response to the increase in lumber prices and limited log supply. douglas fir sawlog prices increased by 4 percent in fourth quarter 2021 compared with third quarter 2021 as reported by risi log lines. the strength in western log prices was supported by multiple factors including continued demand in export markets. in the south, sawlog prices increased by 1 percent from third quarter 2021 and
10 percent from fourth quarter 2020 as reported by timbermart-south. while weather events contributed to some of this increase, transportation constraints and additional mill demand also contributed to more tensioned log markets.
exchange rates, available supply from other countries and trade policy affect our export businesses. during fourth quarter 2021, continued disruptions in global shipping, diversion of european log and lumber supply to other markets, and bans on australian log imports to china generally had a positive impact on china's demand for logs imported from the u.s. in japan, total housing starts increased 5.1 percent year to date through november compared to the same period in 2020, while the key post and beam segment saw an 8.9 percent increase. decreased redwood lumber imports from europe to japan have continued to be favorable to our japanese log export business.
inflation affects our business, especially in increased costs for materials and labor, although there are also offsetting impacts including wood product prices and timberland's effectiveness as an inflation hedge. over the last twelve months, the consumer price index (cpi) increased by 7.0 percent, while the producer price index (final demand) increased by 9.7 percent.
governments and businesses across the globe are taking action on climate change and are making significant commitments towards reducing greenhouse gas emissions to net zero. achieving these commitments will require governments and companies to take major steps to modify operations, invest in low-carbon activities and purchase offsets to reduce environmental impacts. we believe we are uniquely positioned to help entities achieve these commitments through natural climate solutions, including forest carbon sequestration and carbon capture and storage activities.

net sales net sales increased $2,669 million - 35 percent - primarily due to:
•  a $2,431 million increase in wood products net sales to unaffiliated customers, primarily attributable to increased sales realizations across all product lines;
•  a $170 million increase in timberlands net sales to unaffiliated customers, primarily due to increased sales realizations in the western and southern regions and
•  a $68 million increase in real estate & enr net sales to unaffiliated customers, primarily attributable to increases in mitigation bank sales and the average price per real estate acre sold.
costs of sales costs of sales increased $656 million - 12 percent - primarily due to increased freight costs and increased sales volumes across most product lines within our wood products segment, as well as increased freight costs and third-
party log purchases within our timberlands segment.
these increases were partially offset by a decrease in real estate acres sold within our real estate & enr segment.

we are required to pay corporate income taxes on earnings of our trss, which include our wood products segment and portions of our timberlands and real estate & enr segments' earnings. our provision for income taxes is primarily driven by earnings generated by our trss.
our provision for income taxes the last two years was:
•  $709 million in 2021 and
•  $185 million in 2020.
during 2020, we recorded a $60 million tax benefit related to the noncash pretax settlement charge recorded in connection with our u.s. pension plan. refer tonote 20: income taxesandnote 9: pension and other post-employment benefit plansfor further information.

table of contents liquidity and capital resources we are committed to maintaining an appropriate capital structure that provides flexibility and enables us to protect the interests of our shareholders and meet our obligations to our lenders, while also maintaining access to all major financial markets. as of december 31, 2021, we had $1.9 billion in cash and cash equivalents and $1.5
billion of availability on our line of credit, which expires in january 2025. we believe we have sufficient liquidity to meet our cash requirements for the foreseeable future.
cash from operations consolidated net cash from operations was:
•  $3,159 million in 2021 and
•  $1,529 million in 2020.
comparing 2021 with 2020
net cash from operations increased by $1,630 million, primarily due to:
•  increased cash inflows from our business operations, primarily from our wood products segment, and
•  decreased cash used for interest payments.
these changes were partially offset by a $433 million increase in cash paid for income taxes.
pension contributions and benefit payments made and expected during 2021, we contributed a total of $59 million to our pension and post-employment plans, compared to a total of
$30 million during 2020.
for 2022, we expect to contribute approximately $30 million to our pension and post-employment benefit plans. refer to note 9: pension and other post-employment benefit plansfor further information.
investing in our business cash from investing activities includes items such as:
•  acquisitions of property, equipment, timberlands and reforestation and
•  proceeds from sales of assets and operations.
consolidated net cash from investing activities was:
•  $(325) million in 2021 and
•  $185 million in 2020.
comparing2021with2020
net cash from investing activities decreased by $510 million, primarily due to:
•  a $362 million decrease in proceeds received from variable interest entities;
•  a $265 million decrease in proceeds from the sale of timberlands and
•  a $161 million increase in capital expenditures for property and equipment.
these changes were partially offset by a $276 million decrease in cash paid for timberlands acquisitions.

table of contents we expect our capital expenditures for 2022 to be approximately $440 million. the amount we spend on capital expenditures could change due to:
•  future economic conditions,
•  environmental regulations,
•  changes in the composition of our business,
•  weather,
•  timing of equipment purchases and
•  capital needs related to other business opportunities.
financing cash from financing activities includes items such as:
•  issuances and payments of debt,
•  borrowings and payments on our revolving line of credit,
•  proceeds from option exercises and
•  payments for cash dividends and repurchasing stock.
consolidated net cash from financing activities was:
•  $(1,330) million in 2021 and
•  $(1,358) million in 2020.
comparing 2021 with 2020
net cash from financing activities increased $28 million in 2021, primarily due to:
•  a $385 million decrease in net cash used for payments on long-term debt and
•  a $230 million decrease in net cash paid related to borrowings on our line of credit.
these changes were largely offset by the following:
•  a $503 million increase in cash paid for dividends and
•  a $100 million increase in cash used for repurchases of common shares.
long-term debt our consolidated long-term debt (including current portion) was:
•  $5.1 billion as of december 31, 2021 and
•  $5.5 billion as of december 31, 2020.
the decrease in our long-term debt during 2021 is attributable to the repayment of our $225 million variable-rate term loan and our $150 million 9.00 percent notes.
the weighted average interest rate and the weighted average maturity on our long-term debt as of december 31, 2021
were 6.06 percent and 6.7 years, respectively.
see note 12: long-term debt, netfor more information.

purchase obligations include agreements to purchase goods or services that are enforceable and legally
(2)  binding on the company and that specify all significant terms, including: fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed, minimum or variable price provisions and the approximate timing of the transaction.
purchase obligations exclude arrangements that the company can cancel without penalty.
the timing of certain payments within this category will be triggered by retirements or other events.
these payments can include workers' compensation, deferred compensation and banked vacation, among other
(3)  obligations. when the timing of payment is uncertain, the amounts are included in the total column only.
minimum pension funding is required by established funding standards and estimates are not made for 2023
onward. estimated payments of contractually obligated post-employment benefits are not included due to the uncertainty of payment timing.
off-balance sheet arrangements off-balance sheet arrangements have not had - and are not reasonably likely to have - a material effect on our current or future financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. note 8: related partiesandnote 11: line of creditcontain our disclosures of:
•  surety bonds,
•  letters of credit and
•  information regarding variable interest entities.
environmental matters, legal proceedings and other contingencies see note 14: legal proceedings, commitments and contingencies.
accounting matters critical accounting policies in the preparation of our financial statements we follow established accounting policies and make estimates that affect both the amounts and timing of the recording of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. some of these estimates require judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain. accounting policies whose application may have a significant effect on the reported results of operations and financial position are considered critical accounting policies.
in accounting, we base our judgments and estimates on:
•  historical experience and
•  assumptions we believe are appropriate and reasonable under current circumstances.
actual results, however, may differ from the estimated amounts we have recorded.
our most critical accounting policies relate to our:
•  discount rates for pension and post-employment benefit plans;
•  potential impairments of long-lived assets and
•  contingent liabilities.
details about our other significant accounting policies - what we use and how we estimate - are in note 1: summary of significant accounting policies.
weyerhaeuser company > 2021 annual report and form 10-k53
table of contents discount rates for pension and post-employmentbenefit plans discount rates are used to estimate the net present value of our pension and other post-employment plan obligations. these rates are determined at the measurement date by matching current spot rates of high-quality corporate bonds with maturities similar to the timing of expected cash outflows for benefits. the selection of discount rates requires judgment as well as the involvement of actuarial specialists. these specialists assist with selecting yield curves based on published indices for high-quality corporate bonds and projecting the timing and amount of cash flows associated with our obligations to ultimately support our determination of an appropriate discount rate for each plan.
our discount rates as of december 31, 2021 are:
•  2.9 percent for our u.s. pension plans - compared with 2.5 percent at december 31, 2020;
•  2.6 percent for our u.s. post-employment plans - compared with 2.1 percent at december 31, 2020;
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
•  3.1 percent for our canadian pension plans - compared with 2.5 percent at december 31, 2020 and
•  3.0 percent for our canadian post-employment plans - compared with 2.4 percent at december 31, 2020.
pension expenses for 2022 will be based on the 2.9 percent and 3.1 percent assumed discount rates for the u.s.
pension plan and the canadian pension plan, respectively, and the 2.6 percent and 3.0 percent assumed discount rates for the u.s. and canadian post-employment benefit plans, respectively.
our discount rates are important in determining the cost of our plans. a 50 basis point decrease in our discount rate would increase expense or reduce a credit by approximately:
•  $18 million for our u.s. qualified pension plans and
•  $6 million for our canadian registered pension plans.
impairment of long-lived assets we review the carrying value of long-lived assets whenever an event or a change in circumstance indicates that the carrying value of the asset or asset group may not be recoverable through future operations. the carrying value is the original cost, less accumulated depreciation and any past impairments recorded. refer to note 4: timberland acquisitions and divestituresfor information on an impairment recognized in 2019.
if we evaluate recoverability, we are required to estimate future cash flows and residual values of the asset or asset group. key assumptions used in developing these estimates would include probability of alternative outcomes, product pricing, raw material cost and product sales.
an impairment occurs when the carrying value of a long-lived asset is greater than the amount that could be recovered from the estimated future cash flows of the asset and greater than fair market value (the amount we could receive if we were to sell the asset). key assumptions used in developing estimates of fair value would include the estimated future cash flows used to assess recoverability, discount rates and probability of alternative outcomes.
contingent liabilities we are subject to lawsuits, investigations and other claims related to environmental, product and other matters, and are required to assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes to these matters, as well as the amount or range of potential loss.
we record contingent liabilities when:
•  it becomes probable that a loss has been incurred and
•  the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated.
assessing probability of loss and estimating the amount of loss can require analysis of multiple factors, such as:
•  historical experience,
•  evaluations of relevant legal and environmental authorities and regulations,
•  judgments about the potential actions of third-party claimants and courts and
•  consideration of potential environmental remediation methods.
in addition to contingent liabilities recorded for probable losses, we disclose contingent liabilities when there is a reasonable possibility that a loss may have been incurred.
recorded contingent liabilities are based on the best information available and actual losses in any future period are inherently uncertain. if estimated probable future losses or actual losses exceed our recorded liability for such claims, we record additional charges. these exposures and proceedings can be significant and the ultimate negative outcomes could be material to our operating results or cash flows in any given quarter or year. see note
14: legal proceedings, commitments and contingenciesfor more information.

table of contents performance measures we use adjusted ebitda as a key performance measure to evaluate the performance of the consolidated company and our business segments. this measure should not be considered in isolation from, and is not intended to represent an alternative to, our results reported in accordance with u.s. generally accepted accounting principles (u.s. gaap).
however, we believe adjusted ebitda provides meaningful supplemental information for our investors about our operating performance, better facilitates period to period comparisons and is widely used by analysts, lenders, rating agencies and other interested parties. our definition of adjusted ebitda may be different from similarly titled measures reported by other companies. adjusted ebitda, as we define it, is operating income adjusted for depreciation, depletion, amortization, basis of real estate sold and special items.

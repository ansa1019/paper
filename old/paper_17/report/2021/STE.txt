item 1a.risk factors this section describes certain risk factors that could affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. you should consider these risk factors when evaluating the forward-looking statements contained in this annual report on form 10-k, because our actual results and financial condition might differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements should these risks occur. we face other risks besides those highlighted below. these other risks include additional uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently believe are immaterial, but may ultimately have a significant impact. in addition, the impact of the covid-19 pandemic may also exacerbate any of these risks, which could have a material effect on us. although the risks are organized by headings, and each risk is discussed separately, many are interrelated. should any of these risks, described below or otherwise, actually occur, our business, financial condition, performance, prospects, value, or results of operations could be negatively affected.
legal, regulatory and tax risks doing business internationally compliance with multiple, and potentially conflicting, international laws and regulations, import and export limitations, anti-corruption laws, and exchange controls may be difficult, burdensome or expensive.
we are subject to compliance with various laws and regulations, including the u.s. foreign corrupt practices act, the u.k. bribery act, and similar anti-bribery laws, which generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. we are also subject to limitations on trade with persons in sanctioned countries. while our employees and agents are required to comply with these laws, we cannot assure you that our internal policies and procedures will always protect us from violations of these laws, despite our commitment to legal compliance and corporate ethics.
changes in economic climate may adversely affect us.
adverse economic cycles or conditions, and customer, regulatory or government response to those cycles or conditions, have affected and could further affect our results of operations. the onset of these cycles or conditions may not be foreseeable and there can be no assurance when they will begin to improve after they occur. there also can be no assurance as to the strength or length of any recovery from a business downturn or recession. credit and liquidity problems may make it difficult for some businesses to access credit markets and obtain financing and may cause some businesses to curtail spending to conserve cash in anticipation of persistent business slowdowns and liquidity needs. if our customers have difficulty financing their purchases due to tight credit markets or related factors or because of other operational or utilization problems they may be experiencing or otherwise decide to curtail their purchases, our business could be adversely affected. our exposure to bad debt losses could also increase if customers are unable to pay for products previously ordered and delivered.
some of our customers are governmental entities or other entities that rely on government healthcare systems or government funding. if government funding for healthcare becomes limited or restricted in countries in which we operate, including as a result of the impacts of the covid-19 pandemic, our customers may be unable to pay their obligations on a timely basis or to make payment in full and it may become necessary to increase reserves. in addition, there can be no assurance that there will not be an increase in collection difficulties. prospectively, additional adverse effects resulting from these conditions may include decreased healthcare utilization, further pricing pressure on our products and services, and/or weaker overall demand for our products and services, particularly capital products.
our acquisition activity and ability to grow organically may be adversely affected if we are unable to continue to access the financial markets.
our recent acquisitions have been financed largely through cash on hand and borrowings under our bank credit facilities and through public note offerings in early april of fiscal 2022. future acquisitions or other capital requirements will necessitate additional cash. to the extent our existing sources of cash are insufficient to fund these or other future activities, we have and may need to raise additional funds through new or expanded borrowing arrangements or equity. there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain additional funds beyond those available under existing bank credit facilities on terms favorable to us, or at all, or that such facilities can be replaced when they terminate.
the current military conflict between russia and ukraine and its implications on u.s., canadian and european union relations with russia could cause long term geopolitical and economic instability that may impact our future operating results.
in response to the military conflict between russia and ukraine that began in february 2022, the united states, other north atlantic treaty organization member states, as well as non-member states, announced targeted economic sanctions on russia. the long-term impact on our business resulting from the disruption of trade in the region caused by the conflict and associated sanctions and boycotts is uncertain at this time due to the fluid nature of the ongoing military conflict and response. the potential impacts include supply chain and logistics disruptions, financial impacts including volatility in foreign exchange and interest rates, increased inflationary pressure on raw materials and energy, and other risks including an elevated risk of cybersecurity threats and the potential for further sanctions. we have stopped operating in russia and belarus, which includes shipments to customers and purchases of cobalt-60 from our russian supplier. our operations located in the region did not represent a material portion of our consolidated assets or revenues. a long-term disruption in cobalt-60 sourced from russia may negatively impact gamma processing capacity or increase costs in certain portions of our ast operations but these impacts are not expected to be material to our ast segment and its results of operations.
the covid-19 pandemic disrupted our operations and could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition if further significant disruptions occur.
the covid-19 pandemic, along with the response to the pandemic by governmental and other actors, disrupted our operations. we experienced temporary mandatory and voluntary facility closures in certain jurisdictions in which we operate. furthermore, we have experienced less demand for certain of our products and services as a result of deferrals of certain medical procedures, and other factors, which we believe was exacerbated by the impact of stay-at-home orders. additionally, the covid-19 outbreak has caused temporary disruptions and rising costs in our supply chain and distribution network.
long-term facility closures or other restrictions could materially adversely affect our ability to adequately staff, supply or otherwise maintain our operations. such restrictions also may have a substantial impact on our customers and our sales cycles. the covid-19 pandemic may put pressure on overall spending for our products and services, and may cause our customers to modify spending priorities or delay or abandon purchasing decisions. moreover, because a large number of our employees have been and will continue to work from home routinely, we may be subject to increased vulnerability to cyber and other information technology risks. we have modified, and may further modify, our business practices in response to the risks and negative impacts associated with the covid-19 pandemic. however, there can be no assurance that these measures will be temporary or successful.
the impact of the covid-19 pandemic continues to evolve and its ultimate duration, severity and disruption to our business, customers and supply chain, and the related financial impact to us, cannot be accurately forecasted at this time. should such additional significant disruptions occur and continue for an extended period, the adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition could be more severe. additionally, weak economic conditions, the pace for economic recovery, and rising inflation, could result in extended weak demand for our products and services. furthermore, future public health crises are possible and could involve some or all of the risks discussed above.
healthcare laws and reimbursement changes in healthcare laws or government and other third-party payor reimbursement levels to healthcare providers, or failure to meet healthcare reimbursement or other requirements, might negatively impact our business.
we sell many of our products and services to hospitals and other healthcare providers and pharmaceutical manufacturers. many of these customers are subject to or supported by government programs or receive reimbursement for services from third-party payors, such as government programs, including medicare and medicaid in the u.s., private insurance plans, and managed care programs. reimbursement systems vary significantly by country. government-managed healthcare systems control reimbursement for healthcare services in many countries. public budgetary constraints may significantly impact the ability of hospitals, pharmaceutical manufacturers, and other customers supported by such systems to purchase our products. government or other third-party payors may deny or change coverage, reduce their current levels of reimbursement for healthcare services, or otherwise implement measures to regulate pricing or contain costs. in addition, our costs may increase more rapidly than reimbursement levels or permissible pricing increases or we may not satisfy the standards or requirements for reimbursement.
among other provisions, the u.s. patient protection and affordable care act, as amended by the health care and education affordability reconciliation act, imposed an excise tax on medical devices manufactured or offered for sale in the united states. late in 2019, u.s. congress enacted legislation that repealed the excise tax, which had been suspended during calendar years 2016 through 2019. in addition, we have been required to commit significant resources to "sunshine act" compliance. various additional health care reform proposals have emerged at the federal and state level, and we are unable to predict which, if any, of those proposals will be enacted.
product and service related regulations and claims we are subject to extensive regulatory requirements and must receive and maintain regulatory clearance or approval for many products and operations. failure to receive or maintain, or delays in receiving, clearance or approvals may hurt our revenues, profitability, financial condition, or value.
our operations are subject to extensive regulation in the countries where we do business. in the united states, our products and services are regulated by the fda and other regulatory authorities. in many foreign countries, sales of our products and services are subject to extensive regulations that may or may not be comparable to those of the fda. in europe, our products are regulated primarily by country and community regulations of those countries within the european economic area and must conform to the requirements of those authorities.
government regulation applies to nearly all aspects of testing, manufacturing, safety, labeling, storing, recordkeeping, reporting, promoting, distributing, and importing or exporting of medical devices, products, and services. in general, unless an exemption applies, a sterilization, decontamination or medical device or product or service must receive regulatory approval or clearance before it can be marketed or sold. modifications to existing products or the marketing of new uses for existing products also may require regulatory approvals, approval supplements or clearances. if we are unable to obtain any required approvals, approval supplements or clearances for any modification to a previously cleared or approved device, we may be required to cease manufacturing and sale, or recall or restrict the use of such modified device, pay fines, or take other action until such time as appropriate clearance or approval is obtained.
regulatory agencies may refuse to grant approval or clearance, or review and disagree with our interpretation of approvals or clearances, or with our decision that regulatory approval is not required or has been maintained. regulatory submissions may require the provision of additional data and may be time consuming and costly, and their outcome is uncertain. regulatory agencies may also change policies, adopt additional regulations, or revise existing regulations, each of which could prevent or delay approval or clearance of devices, or could impact our ability to market a previously cleared, approved, or unregulated device. our failure to comply with the regulatory requirements of the fda or other applicable regulatory requirements in the united states or elsewhere might subject us to administratively or judicially imposed sanctions. these sanctions include, among others, warning letters, fines, civil penalties, criminal penalties, injunctions, debarment, product seizure or detention, product recalls and total or partial suspension of production, sale and/or promotion.
the covid-19 pandemic may disrupt the operations of regulatory bodies with responsibility for oversight of healthcare and health and medical products. such disruptions could result in the focus and prioritization of regulatory resources on emergent matters, which could divert regulatory resources away from more routine regulatory matters that are not covid-19 related but that have the potential to impact our business. for example, there could be delays in fda review of applications for marketing authorization, including those which may be necessary for or in connection with proposed changes to our products or the changes to the processes by which they are manufactured. it is unknown how long these disruptions could continue, were they to occur. any elongation or de-prioritization or delay in regulatory review resulting from such disruptions could materially affect our ongoing device design, development, and commercialization plans.
our products are subject to recalls and restrictions, even after receiving united states or foreign regulatory clearance or approval.
ongoing medical device reporting regulations require that we report to appropriate governmental authorities in the united states and/or other countries when our products cause or contribute to a death or serious injury or malfunction in a way that would be reasonably likely to contribute to a death or serious injury if the malfunction were to recur. governmental authorities can require product recalls or impose restrictions for product design, manufacturing, labeling, clearance, or other issues. for the same reasons, we may voluntarily elect to recall or restrict the use of a product. any recall or restriction could divert managerial and financial resources and might harm our reputation among our customers and other healthcare professionals who use or recommend our products and services.
we may be adversely affected by product liability claims or other legal actions or regulatory or compliance matters.
we face an inherent business risk of exposure to product liability claims and other legal and regulatory actions. a significant increase in the number, severity, amount, or scope of these claims and actions may, as described above with respect to recalls and restrictions, result in substantial costs and harm our reputation or otherwise adversely affect product sales and our business. product liability claims and other legal and regulatory actions may also distract management from other business responsibilities.
we are also subject to a variety of other types of claims, proceedings, investigations, and litigation initiated by government agencies or third parties and other potential risks and liabilities. these include compliance matters, product regulation or safety, taxes, employee benefit plans, employment discrimination, health and safety, environmental, antitrust, customs, import/export, government contract compliance, financial controls or reporting, intellectual property, allegations of misrepresentation, false claims or false statements, commercial claims, claims regarding promotion of our products and services, or other similar or different matters. any such claims, proceedings, investigations or litigation, regardless of the merits, might result in substantial costs, restrictions on product use or sales, or otherwise injure our business.
administratively or judicially imposed or agreed sanctions might include warning letters, fines, civil penalties, criminal penalties, loss of tax benefits, injunctions, product seizure, recalls, suspensions or restrictions, re-labeling, detention, and/or debarment. we also might be required to take actions such as payment of substantial amounts, or revision of financial statements, or to take, or be subject to, the following types of actions with respect to our products, services, or business: redesign, re-label, restrict, or recall products; cease manufacturing and selling products; seizure of product inventory; comply with a court injunction restricting or prohibiting further marketing and sale of products or services; comply with a consent decree, which could result in further regulatory constraints; dedication of significant internal and external resources and costs to respond to and comply with legal and regulatory issues and constraints; respond to claims, litigation, and other proceedings brought by customers, users, governmental agencies, and others; disruption of product improvements and product launches; discontinuation of certain product lines or services; or other restrictions or limitations on product sales, use or operation, or other activities or business practices.
some product replacements or substitutions may not be possible or may be prohibitively costly or time consuming. the impact of any legal, regulatory, or compliance claims, proceeding, investigation, or litigation, is difficult to predict.
we maintain product liability and other insurance with coverages believed to be adequate. however, product liability or other claims may exceed insurance coverage limits, fines, penalties and regulatory sanctions may not be covered by insurance, or insurance may not continue to be available or available on commercially reasonable terms. additionally, our insurers might deny claim coverage for valid or other reasons or may become insolvent.
our business and financial condition could be adversely affected by difficulties in acquiring or maintaining a proprietary intellectual ownership position.
to maintain our competitive position for our products, we need to obtain patent or other proprietary rights for new and improved products and to maintain and enforce our existing patents and other proprietary rights. we typically apply for patents in the united states and in strategic other countries. we may also acquire patents through acquisitions. we may encounter difficulties in obtaining or protecting patents.
we rely on a combination of patents, trademarks, trade secrets, know-how, and confidentiality agreements to protect the proprietary aspects of our technology. these measures afford only limited protection, and competitors may gain access to our intellectual property and proprietary information. litigation may be necessary to enforce or defend our intellectual property rights, to protect our trade secrets, and to determine the validity and scope of our proprietary rights. litigation may also be brought against us claiming that we have violated the intellectual property rights of others. litigation may be costly and may divert management's attention from other matters. additionally, in some foreign countries with weaker intellectual property rights, it may be difficult to maintain and enforce patents and other proprietary rights or defend against claims of infringement.
tax risks we might be adversely impacted by tax legislation or challenges to our tax positions.
we are subject to the tax laws at the federal, state or provincial, and local government levels in the many jurisdictions in which we operate or sell products or services. tax laws might change in ways that adversely affect our tax positions, effective tax rate and cash flow. the tax laws are extremely complex and subject to varying interpretations. we are subject to tax examinations in various jurisdictions that might assess additional tax liabilities against us. our tax reporting positions might be challenged by relevant tax authorities, we might incur significant expense in our efforts to defend those challenges, and we might be unsuccessful in those efforts. developments in examinations and challenges might materially change our provision for taxes in the affected periods and might differ materially from our historical tax accruals. any of these risks might have a materially adverse impact on our business operations, our cash flows and our financial position or results of operations.
current economic and political conditions make tax rules in any jurisdiction subject to significant change.
the u.s. tax cuts and jobs act ("tcja") was signed into law on december 22, 2017. guidance continues to be issued clarifying the application of this new legislation and new changes have been proposed in the u.s. that could increase our total tax expense. we cannot predict the overall impact that the additional guidance and proposed changes may have on our business. some jurisdictions have raised tax rates and it is reasonable to expect that other global taxing authorities will be reviewing current legislation for potential modifications in reaction to the implementation of the tcja, current economic conditions, and covid-19 response costs.
in addition, further changes in the tax laws of other jurisdictions could arise, including as a result of the base erosion and profit shifting (beps) project undertaken by the organization for economic cooperation and development (oecd). the oecd, which represents a coalition of member countries, has issued recommendations that, in some cases, would make substantial changes to numerous long-standing tax positions and principles. these contemplated changes, to the extent adopted by oecd members and/or other countries, could increase tax uncertainty and may adversely impact our provision for income taxes.
our tax rate is uncertain and may vary from expectations, which could have a material impact on our results of operations and earnings per share.
there can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain any particular worldwide effective corporate tax rate. we cannot give any assurance as to what our effective tax rate will be in the future because of, among other things, uncertainty regarding the tax policies of the jurisdictions in which we and our affiliates operate. our actual effective tax rate may vary from our expectations, and such variance may be material. additionally, tax laws or their implementation and applicable tax authority practices in any particular jurisdiction could change in the future, possibly on a retroactive basis, and any such change could have a material adverse impact on us and our affiliates.
changes in tax treaties and trade agreements could negatively impact our costs, results of operations and earnings per share.
legislative and regulatory action may be taken in the u.s. which, if ultimately adopted, could override or otherwise adversely impact tax treaties upon which we rely or broaden the circumstances under which steris plc would be considered a u.s. resident, each of which could materially and adversely affect our tax obligations. we cannot predict the outcome of any specific legislative or regulatory proposals. however, if proposals were adopted that had the effect of disregarding our organization in ireland or limiting our ability as an irish company to take advantage of tax treaties with the u.s., we could be subject to increased taxation and/or potentially significant expense.
existing free trade laws and regulations provide certain beneficial duties and tariffs for qualifying imports and exports, subject to compliance with the applicable classification and other requirements. changes in laws and regulations or policies governing the terms of foreign trade, and in particular, increased trade restrictions, including as a result of the covid-19 pandemic, tariffs or taxes on imports from countries where we manufacture products could have a material adverse impact on our business and financial results.
proposed legislation relating to the denial of u.s. federal or state governmental contracts to u.s. companies that redomicile abroad could adversely affect our business.
various u.s. federal and state legislative proposals that would deny governmental contracts to redomiciled companies may adversely affect us if adopted into law. we are unable to predict the likelihood that any such proposed legislation might become law, the nature of regulations that may be promulgated under any future legislative enactments, or the effect such enactments or increased regulatory scrutiny could have on our business.
the u.s. internal revenue service (the "irs") may not agree that we are a foreign corporation for u.s. federal tax purposes.
although we are organized under the laws of ireland and are a tax resident in ireland for irish tax purposes, the irs may assert that we should be treated as a u.s. corporation (and, therefore, a u.s. tax resident) for u.s. federal tax purposes pursuant to section 7874 of the internal revenue code of 1986, as amended (the "code" and such section, "section 7874"). for u.s. federal tax purposes, a company generally is considered to be a tax resident in the jurisdiction of its organization. because we are organized under the laws of ireland, we would generally be classified as a non-u.s. corporation (and, therefore, a non-u.s. tax resident) under these rules. section 7874, however, provides an exception to this general rule under which a non-u.s. organized entity may be treated as a u.s. corporation for u.s. federal tax purposes.
if we were to be treated as a u.s. corporation for u.s. federal tax purposes, we could be subject to substantial additional u.s. tax liability. additionally, if we were treated as a u.s. corporation for u.s. federal tax purposes, non-u.s. holders of our ordinary shares would be subject to u.s. withholding tax on the gross amount of any dividends we paid to such shareholders. for irish tax purposes, we are expected, regardless of any application of section 7874, to be treated as an ireland tax resident. consequently, if we are treated as a u.s. corporation for u.s. federal tax purposes under section 7874, we could be liable for both u.s. and ireland taxes, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.
business and operational risks our businesses are highly competitive, and if we fail to compete successfully, our revenues and results of operations may be hurt.
we operate in a highly competitive global environment. our businesses compete with other broad-line manufacturers, as well as many smaller businesses specializing in particular products or services, primarily on the basis of brand, design, quality, safety, ease of use, serviceability, price, product features, warranty, delivery, service, and technical support. we face increased competition from new infection prevention, sterile processing, contamination control, surgical support, cleaning consumables, gastrointestinal endoscopy accessories, contract sterilization, and other products and services entering the market. competitors and potential competitors also are attempting to develop alternate technologies and sterilizing agents, as well as disposable medical instruments and other devices designed to address the risk of contamination.
consolidations among our healthcare and pharmaceutical customers may result in a loss of customers or more significant pricing pressures.
a number of our customers have consolidated. these consolidations are due in part to healthcare cost reduction measures initiated by competitive pressures as well as legislators, regulators and third-party payors. this may result in greater pricing pressures on us and in some cases loss of customers. additional consolidations could result in a loss of customers or more significant pricing pressures.
decreased availability or increased costs of raw materials or energy supplies or other supplies might increase our production costs or limit our production capabilities or curtail our operations.
we purchase raw materials, fabricated and other components, and energy supplies from a variety of suppliers. key materials include stainless steel, organic and inorganic chemicals, fuel, cobalt-60, eo, and plastic components. the availability and prices of raw materials and energy supplies are subject to volatility and are influenced by worldwide economic conditions, speculative action, world supply and demand balances, inventory levels, availability of substitute materials, currency exchange rates, anticipated or perceived shortages, and other factors. also, certain of our key materials and components have a limited number of suppliers. some are single-sourced in certain regions of the world, such as cobalt-60 and eo, which are necessary to our ast operations. changes in regulatory requirements regarding the use of, the unavailability or short supply of these products might disrupt or cause shutdowns of portions of our ast operations or have other adverse consequences. we have developed a plan to expand our irradiation processing capacity with accelerator-based technologies which may reduce the potential supply risk. shortages in supply, increased regulatory or security requirements, or increases in the price of raw materials, components and energy supplies may adversely affect us. in response to the active conflict between russian and ukraine, we have stopped purchasing cobalt-60 from our russian supplier. a long-term disruption in cobalt-60 sourced from russia may negatively impact gamma processing capacity or increase costs in certain portions of our ast operations but these impacts are not expected to be material to our ast segment and its results of operations.
our operations, and those of our suppliers, are subject to a variety of business continuity hazards and risks, any of which could interrupt production or operations or otherwise adversely affect our performance, results, or value.
business continuity hazards and other risks include: explosions, fires, earthquakes, public health crises, inclement weather, and other disasters; utility or other mechanical failures; unscheduled downtime; labor difficulties; inability to obtain or maintain any required licenses or permits; disruption of communications; data security, preservation and redundancy disruptions; inability to hire or retain key management or employees; disruption of supply or distribution; and regulation of the safety, security or other aspects of our operations.
the occurrence of these types of events has disrupted and may in the future disrupt or shut down operations, or otherwise adversely impact the production or profitability of a particular facility, or our operations as a whole. certain casualties also might cause personal injury and loss of life, or severe damage to or destruction of property and equipment, and for casualties occurring at our facilities, result in liability claims against us. although we maintain property and casualty insurance and liability and similar insurance of the types and in the amounts that we believe are customary for our industries, our insurance coverages have limits and we are not fully insured against all potential hazards and risks incident to our business.
we may be adversely affected by global climate change or by legal, regulatory or market responses to such change.
the long-term effects of climate change are difficult to assess and predict. the impacts may include physical risks (such as rising sea levels or frequency and severity of extreme weather conditions), social and human effects (such as population dislocations or harm to health and well-being), compliance costs and transition risks (such as regulatory or technology changes) and other adverse effects. the effects could impair, for example, the availability and cost of certain products, commodities and energy (including utilities), which in turn may impact our ability to procure goods or services required for the operation of our business at the quantities and levels we require. we bear losses incurred as a result of, for example, physical damage to or destruction of our facilities (such as distribution or fulfillment centers), loss or spoilage of inventory, and business interruption due to weather events that may be attributable to climate change could materially adversely affect our business operations, financial position or results of operation.
our operations are subject to regulations and permitting, which may be changed or amended by the relevant authorities, and which may limit or eliminate our current operations or increase the complexity, burden, or expense of compliance and regulated materials or processes that we use in our operations may become the focus of litigation.
our ast segment is a technology-neutral contract sterilization service that offers our customers a wide range of sterilization modalities through a worldwide network of over 50 contract sterilization and laboratory facilities. one of the modalities offered by our ast operations is eo sterilization. in the united states, several regulators, including the epa, fda, and agencies at the state and local level, play a role in regulating the use of eo sterilization. in 2016, the epa changed the cancer risk basis for eo and determined that eo is carcinogenic to humans. recent announcements of the temporary or permanent closure of eo sterilization facilities operated by others have been associated with state and/or local regulatory or other legal action related to eo emissions at those facilities. our ast operations have taken and will continue to take measures to comply with all applicable emissions regulations and to reduce emissions. however, no assurance can be given that current or future legislative or regulatory action, or current or future litigation to which we are or may become a party, will not significantly increase the costs of conducting our eo contract sterilization operations or curtail or eliminate the use of eo in our contract sterilization operations. a significant reduction in our eo contract sterilization activities may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. further, we could be liable for damages and fines as a result of legislative or regulatory action or litigation, and any liability could exceed our insurance and indemnification coverage, if any, and have a material adverse effect on our financial condition. additionally, for many medical devices, eo sterilization may be the only current method of sterilization that effectively sterilizes and does not damage the device during the sterilization process. in the event of regulatory, legislative, or legal action that curtails or eliminates eo sterilization, there could be a shortage of medical devices and consequently a decline in surgical procedures. a decline in surgical procedures could result in a decline in demand for the products and services provided by our healthcare business, which may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.
we engage in acquisitions and affiliations, divestitures, and other business arrangements. our growth may be adversely affected if we are unable to successfully identify, price, and integrate strategic business candidates or otherwise optimize our business portfolio.
our success depends, in part, on strategic acquisitions and joint ventures, which are intended to complement or expand our businesses, divestiture of non-strategic businesses, and other actions intended to optimize our portfolio of businesses. this strategy depends upon our ability to identify, appropriately price, and complete these types of business development transactions or arrangements and to obtain any necessary financing. in the last several fiscal years we have made a number of acquisitions. we also completed several divestitures of non-strategic businesses or product lines during the last several years.
our success with respect to these recent and future acquisitions will depend on our ability to integrate the businesses acquired, retain key personnel, realize identified cost synergies and otherwise execute our strategies. our success will also depend on our ability to develop satisfactory working arrangements with our strategic partners in joint ventures or other affiliations, or to divest or realign businesses. competition for strategic business candidates may result in increases in costs and price for acquisition candidates and market valuation issues may reduce the value available for divestiture of non-strategic businesses. these types of transactions are also subject to a number of other risks and uncertainties, including: delays in realizing or failure to realize anticipated benefits of the transactions; diversion of management's time and attention from other business concerns; difficulties in retaining key employees, customers, or suppliers of the acquired or divested businesses; difficulties in maintaining uniform standards, controls, procedures and policies, or other integration or divestiture difficulties; adverse effects on existing business relationships with suppliers or customers; other events contributing to difficulties in generating future cash flows; risks associated with the assumption of contingent or other liabilities of acquisition targets or retention of liabilities for divested businesses and difficulties in obtaining financing.
if our continuing efforts to create a lean business and in-source production to reduce costs are not successful, our profitability may be hurt or our business otherwise might be adversely affected.
we have undertaken various activities to create a lean business, including in-sourcing. we continue to look for opportunities to in-source production that is currently provided by third parties.these activities may not produce the full efficiencies and cost reduction benefits that we expect or efficiencies and benefits might be delayed. implementation costs also might exceed expectations. increases in costs of doing business may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.
the covid-19 pandemic or similar public health crises could have a material adverse impact on ability to staff our operations.
as supplier to healthcare and life sciences customers, we fall within a "critical infrastructure" sector, and are also considered an essential business and therefore were exempt under various stay at home/shelter in place orders associated with covid-19. accordingly, our employees continued to work because of the importance of our operations to the health and well-being of citizens in the countries in which we operate. we implemented telework policies wherever possible for appropriate categories of employees. however, our employees that are unable to telework continued to work at our facilities and those of our customers, and we implemented appropriate safety measures, such as social distancing and increased cleaning protocols. while we believe that we have developed appropriate measures to ensure the health and well-being of our employees, there can be no assurances that our measures will be sufficient to protect our employees in our workplace or that they may not otherwise be exposed to covid-19 or similar illness outside of our workplace. if a number of our essential employees become ill, incapacitated or are otherwise unable or unwilling to continue working during the current or any future health crises, our operations may be adversely impacted.
our business and results of operations may be adversely affected if we are unable to recruit and retain qualified management and other personnel or other compliance matters adversely impact our personnel.
our continued success depends, in large part, on our ability to hire and retain highly qualified people and if we are unable to do so, our business and operations may be impaired or disrupted. competition for highly qualified people is intense and there is no assurance that we will be successful in attracting or retaining replacements to fill vacant positions, successors to fill retirements or employees moving to new positions, or other highly qualified personnel. in addition, legal, regulatory or compliance matters create significant distraction or diversion of significant or unanticipated resources or attention that could have a material adverse effect on the responsibilities and retention of qualified employees.
we could experience a failure of a key information technology system, process or site or a breach of information security, including a cybersecurity breach or failure of one or more key information technology systems, networks, processes, associated sites or service providers.
we rely extensively on information technology (it) systems to conduct business. in addition, we rely on networks and services, including internet sites, data hosting and processing facilities and tools and other hardware, software and technical applications and platforms, some of which are managed, hosted, provided and/or used by third-parties or their vendors, to assist in conducting our business. while we have been the previous target of cyberattacks and security breaches, none of these attacks or breaches to date have had a material adverse effect on the company. we cannot guarantee that future cyberattacks, if successful, will not have a material effect on our business or financial results. numerous and evolving cybersecurity threats continue to pose potential risks to the security of our it systems, networks and services, as well as the confidentiality, availability and integrity of our data. while we have made investments seeking to address these threats, including monitoring of networks and systems, hiring of experts, employee training and security policies for employees and third-party providers, the techniques used in these attacks change frequently and may be difficult to detect for periods of time and we may face difficulties in anticipating and implementing adequate preventative measures. if our it systems are damaged or cease to function properly, the networks or service providers we rely upon fail to function properly, or we or one of our third-party providers suffer a loss or disclosure of our business or stakeholder information due to any number of causes ranging from catastrophic events or power outages to improper data handling or security breaches and our business continuity plans do not effectively address these failures on a timely basis, we may be exposed to reputational, competitive and business harm as well as litigation and regulatory action. in addition, the covid-19 pandemic may increase the risk of such vulnerability and attacks, including unauthorized access or attacks exploiting the fact that a large number of employees are working remotely during government shutdowns and closures. furthermore, their has also been an increase in cyber incidents that appears to be associated with the ukraine-russia military conflict. enforcement of the general data protection regulation ("gdpr") was effective as of may 2018. the gdpr is focused on the protection of personal data not merely the privacy of personal data. the gdpr creates a range of new compliance obligations and will significantly increase financial penalties for noncompliance (including possible fines of up to 4% of global annual revenues for the preceding financial year or €20 million (whichever is higher) for the most serious infringements).
net sales and profitability of our dental segment are highly dependent on our relationships with a limited number of large distributors.
the distribution network in the u.s. dental industry is concentrated, with relatively few distributors of consumable products accounting for a significant share of the sales volume to dentists. historically, the top three customers of cantel's dental segment accounted for more than 40.0% of its revenues. the loss of a significant amount of business from any of these customers would have a material adverse effect on our dental segment. in addition, because our dental segment products are primarily sold through third-party distributors and not directly to end users, we cannot control the amount and timing of resources that our distributors devote to our products. there can be no assurance that there will not be a loss or reduction in business from one or more of our major customers. in addition, we cannot assure that revenues from customers that have accounted for significant revenues in the past, either individually or as a group, will reach or exceed historical levels in any future period.
risks related to the acquisition of cantel medical the integration of cantel into steris may not be as successful as anticipated.
the integration involves numerous operational, strategic, financial, accounting, legal, tax and other risks; potential liabilities associated with the acquired businesses; and uncertainties related to design, operation and integration of cantel's internal control over financial reporting. difficulties in integrating cantel into steris may result in cantel performing differently than expected, in operational challenges or in the failure to realize anticipated expense-related efficiencies. steris's and cantel's existing businesses could also be negatively impacted by the actions. potential difficulties that may be encountered in the integration process include, among other factors:
•the inability to successfully integrate the business of cantel into steris in a manner that permits steris to achieve the full revenue and cost savings anticipated from the acquisition;
•complexities associated with managing the larger, more complex, integrated business;
•not realizing anticipated operating synergies or incurring unexpected costs to realize such synergies;
•integrating personnel from the two companies while maintaining focus on providing consistent, high-quality products and services;
•potential unknown liabilities and unforeseen expenses associated with the acquisition;
•loss of key employees;
•integrating relationships with customers, vendors and business partners;
•performance shortfalls at one or both of the companies as a result of the diversion of management's attention caused by integrating cantel's operations into steris; and
•the disruption of, or the loss of momentum in, each company's ongoing business or inconsistencies in standards, controls, procedures and policies.
the acquisition of cantel may not be as accretive to steris's earnings per share and cash flow from operations per share, which may negatively affect the market price of steris shares.
the acquisition may not be as accretive to steris's earnings per share and cash flow from operations per share. future events and conditions could decrease or delay any expected accretion, result in dilution or cause greater dilution than is currently expected, including adverse changes in market conditions, production levels, operating results, competitive conditions, laws and regulations affecting steris, capital expenditure obligations, higher than expected integration costs, lower than expected synergies and general economic conditions.
any decrease or delay of any accretion to, steris's earnings per share or cash flow from operations per share could cause the price of the steris's ordinary shares to decline.
steris has incurred and will incur significant transaction and acquisition-related costs in connection with the acquisition, which may be in excess of those anticipated.
steris has incurred substantial expenses in connection with the negotiation and completion of the acquisition of cantel and related transactions.
steris expects to continue to incur a number of non-recurring costs associated with combining the operations of steris and cantel achieving desired synergies. these fees and costs have been, and will continue to be, substantial. the non-recurring expenses include, among others, employee retention costs, fees paid to financial, legal and accounting advisors, and severance and benefit costs.
steris will also incur and has incurred costs related to implementing integration plans, costs to consolidate facilities and systems and employment-related costs. additional unanticipated costs may be incurred in the integration of the two companies' businesses. although steris expects that the elimination of duplicative costs, as well as the realization of other efficiencies related to the integration of the steris and cantel businesses, should allow steris to offset integration-related costs over time, this net benefit may not be achieved in the near term, or at all. see the risk factor titled "the integration of cantel into steris may not be as successful as anticipated" below.
the costs described above, as well as other unanticipated costs and expenses, could have a material adverse effect on the financial condition and operating results.
we incurred a substantial amount of additional debt to complete the acquisition. our debt level may limit our financial and business flexibility.
we funded the cash portion of the acquisition consideration, as well as the refinancing, prepayment, replacement, redemption, repurchase, settlement upon conversion, discharge or defeasance of certain existing indebtedness of cantel and its subsidiaries, transaction expenses, general corporate expenses and working capital needs, through the incurrence of approximately $2.1 billion of new indebtedness, which includes $1.350 billion of senior notes issued april 1, 2021 and a new delayed draw term loan agreement in the amount of $750 million. we also refinanced or settled approximately $1.0 billion of cantel's long-term indebtedness, including convertible debt, outstanding.
as of march 31, 2022, steris had approximately $2.9 billion of long-term indebtedness outstanding. steris's ability to repay all the forgoing obligations will depend on, among other things, steris's financial position and performance, as well as prevailing market conditions and other factors beyond our control.
our increased indebtedness could have important consequences to our shareholders, including increasing steris's vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions, limiting our ability to obtain additional financing to fund future working capital, capital expenditures and other general corporate requirements, requiring the use of a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations for the payment of principal and interest on indebtedness, thereby reducing our ability to use our cash flow to fund working capital, acquisitions, capital expenditures and general corporate matters, including dividend payments and stock repurchases, limiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in its business and our industry and creating a disadvantage compared to our competitors with less indebtedness.
our performance may suffer if we do not effectively manage our expanded operations.
our success will depend, in part, on our ability to manage the expansion, which poses numerous risks and uncertainties, including the need to integrate the operations and business of cantel into our existing business in an efficient and timely manner, to combine systems and management controls and to integrate relationships with customers, vendors and business partners.
we may fail to realize all of the anticipated benefits of the acquisition, or those benefits may take longer to realize than expected.
the success of the acquisition will depend, in part, on our ability to realize the anticipated benefits and cost savings from combining the businesses, including the approximately $110 million in annualized pre-tax cost synergies that we expect to realize within the first four fiscal years after the completion of the acquisition. the anticipated benefits and cost savings of the acquisition may not be realized fully or at all, may take longer to realize than expected, may require more non-recurring costs and expenditures to realize than expected or could have other adverse effects that we do not currently foresee. some of the assumptions that we made such as with respect to anticipated operating synergies or the costs associated with realizing such synergies, significant long-term cash flow generation, and the continuation of our investment grade credit profile, may not be realized. the integration process may result in the loss of key employees, the disruption of ongoing business or inconsistencies in standards, controls, procedures, and policies. there could be potential unknown liabilities and unforeseen expenses associated with the acquisition that were not discovered while performing due diligence.
we have recorded goodwill and other intangible assets that could become impaired and result in material non-cash changes to our results of operation in the future.
the acquisition has been accounted for as an acquisition by steris in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the u.s., which is referred to as u.s. gaap. under the acquisition method of accounting, the assets and liabilities of cantel and its subsidiaries have been recorded at their respective fair values and added to those of steris. our reported financial condition and results of operations for periods after completion of the acquisition reflect cantel balances and results after completion of the acquisition but have not been restated retroactively to reflect the historical financial position or results of operations of cantel and its subsidiaries for periods prior to the acquisition.
under the acquisition method of accounting, the total purchase price has been allocated to cantel's tangible assets and liabilities and identifiable intangible assets based on their fair values as of the date of completion of the acquisition. the excess of the purchase price over those fair values will be recorded as goodwill. to the extent the value of goodwill or intangible becomes impaired, we may be required to incur material non-cash charges relating to such impairment. our operating results may be significantly impacted from both the impairment and the underlying trends in the business that triggered the impairment.
item 7.    management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations introduction in management's discussion and analysis ("md&a"), we explain the general financial condition and the results of operations for steris and its subsidiaries including:
•what factors affect our business;
•what our earnings and costs were;
•why those earnings and costs were different from the year before;
•where our earnings came from;
•how this affects our overall financial condition;
•what our expenditures for capital projects were; and
•where cash will come from to fund future debt principal repayments, growth outside of core operations, repurchase ordinary shares, pay cash dividends and fund future working capital needs.
the md&a also analyzes and explains the annual changes in the specific line items in the consolidated statements of income. as you read the md&a, it may be helpful to refer to information in item 1, "business", part i, item 1a, "risk factors" and note 10 of our consolidated financial statements titled, "commitments and contingencies" for a discussion of some of the matters that can adversely affect our business and results of operations. this information, discussion, and disclosure may be important to you in making decisions about your investments in steris.
financial measures in the following sections of the md&a, we may, at times, refer to financial measures that are not required to be presented in the consolidated financial statements under u.s. gaap. we sometimes use the following financial measures in the context of this report: backlog; debt-to-total capital; and days sales outstanding. we define these financial measures as follows:
•backlog - we define backlog as the amount of unfilled capital equipment purchase orders at a point in time. we use this figure as a measure to assist in the projection of short-term financial results and inventory requirements.
•debt-to-total capital - we define debt-to-total capital as total debt divided by the sum of total debt and shareholders' equity. we use this figure as a financial liquidity measure to gauge our ability to borrow and fund growth.
•days sales outstanding ("dso") - we define dso as the average collection period for accounts receivable. it is calculated as net accounts receivable divided by the trailing four quarters' revenues, multiplied by 365 days. we use this figure to help gauge the quality of accounts receivable and expected time to collect.
we, at times, may also refer to financial measures which are considered to be "non-gaap financial measures" under sec rules. we have presented these financial measures because we believe that meaningful analysis of our financial performance is enhanced by an understanding of certain additional factors underlying that performance. these financial measures should not be considered an alternative to measures required by accounting principles generally accepted in the united states. our calculations of these measures may differ from calculations of similar measures used by other companies and you should be careful when comparing these financial measures to those of other companies. additional information regarding these financial measures, including reconciliations of each non- gaap financial measure, is available in the subsection of md&a titled, "non-gaap financial measures."
revenues- defined as required by regulation s-x, we separately present revenues generated as either product revenues or service revenues on our consolidated statements of income for each period presented. when we discuss revenues, we may, at times, refer to revenues summarized differently than the regulation s-x requirements. the terminology, definitions, and applications of terms that we use to describe revenues may be different from terms used by other companies. we use the following terms to describe revenues:
•revenues - our revenues are presented net of sales returns and allowances.
•product revenues - we define product revenues as revenues generated from sales of consumable and capital equipment products.
•service revenues - we define service revenues as revenues generated from parts and labor associated with the maintenance, repair, and installation of our capital equipment. service revenues also include outsourced reprocessing services and instrument and scope repairs, as well as revenues generated from contract sterilization and laboratory services offered through our applied sterilization technologies segment.
•capital equipment revenues - we define capital equipment revenues as revenues generated from sales of capital equipment, which includes: steam and gas sterilizers, low temperature liquid chemical sterilant processing systems, pure steam/water systems, surgical lights and tables, and integrated or.
•consumable revenues - we define consumable revenues as revenues generated from sales of the consumable family of products, which includes dedicated consumables including v-pro, system 1 and 1e consumables, gastrointestinal endoscopy accessories, sterility assurance products, barrier protection solutions, cleaning consumables, dental and surgical instruments.
•recurring revenues - we define recurring revenues as revenues generated from sales of consumable products and service revenues.
general overview and executive summary steris is a leading global provider of products and services that support patient care with an emphasis on infection prevention. we help our customers create a healthier and safer world by providing innovative healthcare, life sciences and dental products and services. we offer our customers a unique mix of innovative consumable products, such as detergents, gastrointestinal ("gi") endoscopy accessories, barrier product solutions, and other products and services, including: equipment installation and maintenance, microbial reduction of medical devices, dental instruments and tools, instrument and scope repair, laboratory testing services, outsourced reprocessing, and capital equipment products, such as sterilizers and surgical tables, automated endoscope reprocessors, and connectivity solutions such as operating room ("or") integration.
as a result of the acquisition of cantel, we have reassessed the organization of our business and have added a new segment called dental. we now operate and report our financial information in four reportable business segments: healthcare, applied sterilization technologies, life sciences and dental. non-allocated operating costs that support the entire company and items not indicative of operating trends are excluded from segment operating income. we describe our business segments in note 11 to our consolidated financial statements, titled "business segment information."
the bulk of our revenues are derived from the healthcare and pharmaceutical industries. much of the growth in these industries is driven by the aging of the population throughout the world, as an increasing number of individuals are entering their prime healthcare consumption years, and is dependent upon advancement in healthcare delivery, acceptance of new technologies, government policies, and general economic conditions. the pharmaceutical industry has been impacted by increased regulatory scrutiny of cleaning and validation processes, mandating that manufacturers improve their processes. within healthcare, there is increased concern regarding the level of hospital acquired infections around the world; increased demand for medical procedures, including preventive screenings such as endoscopies and colonoscopies; and a desire by our customers to operate more efficiently, all which are driving increased demand for many of our products and services.
acquisitions. on june 2, 2021, we acquired all outstanding equity interests in cantel medical llc ("cantel") through a u.s. subsidiary. cantel, formerly headquartered in little falls, new jersey, with approximately 3,700 employees, is a global provider of infection prevention products and services primarily to endoscopy and dental customers. the total consideration for cantel common stock and stock equivalents was $3.6 billion.
we believe that the acquisition will strengthen steris's leadership in infection prevention by bringing together two complementary businesses able to offer a broader set of customers a more diversified selection of infection prevention, endoscopy and sterilization products and services. cantel's dental business extends our business into a new customer segment where there is an increasing focus on infection prevention protocols and processes. this business is reported as the dental segment. the rest of cantel was integrated into our existing healthcare and life sciences segments. additionally, the acquisition is expected to result in cost savings from optimizing global back-office infrastructure, leveraging best-demonstrated practices across locations and eliminating redundant public company costs.
the results of cantel are only reflected in the results of operations and cash flows from june 2, 2021 forward, which will affect results of comparability to the prior period operations and cash flows.
in addition to the acquisition of cantel, we completed three other tuck-in acquisitions during fiscal 2022, which continued to expand our product and service offerings in the healthcare segment. total aggregate consideration for these transactions was approximately $3.1 million, net of cash acquired and including deferred consideration of $0.1 million.
on january 4, 2021, we purchased the remaining outstanding shares of an entity in which we had initially made an equity investment in fiscal 2019. total consideration was approximately $78.0 million, net of cash acquired and subject to any working capital adjustments. total non-cash consideration for this transaction was $41.8 million, which consisted of the settlement of outstanding principal and interest on a loan receivable, the initial equity investment, and receivables related to capital equipment purchases that existed at the acquisition date. the business has been integrated into our applied sterilization technologies business segment and we funded the transaction through a combination of cash on hand and credit facility borrowings.
on november 18, 2020, we acquired all of the outstanding units and equity of key surgical, llc ("key surgical"). key surgical is a global provider of sterile processing, operating room and endoscopy consumable products serving hospitals and surgical facilities. key surgical has been integrated into our healthcare segment. the total purchase price of the acquisition was $853.2 million, net of cash acquired and remains subject to customary working capital adjustments.
we also completed two other tuck-in acquisitions during fiscal 2021, which continued to expand our product and service offerings in the healthcare segment. total aggregate consideration for these transactions was approximately $20.9 million, net of cash acquired and including deferred consideration of approximately $1.2 million.
divestitures.  in december 2021, we entered into an asset purchase agreement to sell our renal care business to evoqua water technologies corp., for cash consideration of approximately $196.0 million, subject to certain potential adjustments, including a customary working capital adjustment and contingent consideration of $12.3 million. we recognized a gain on the sale of $1.0 million. the transaction closed on january 3, 2022. we acquired the renal care business as part of the cantel transaction, which closed on june 2, 2021, and had been integrated into steris's healthcare segment. the renal care business generated annual revenues of approximately $180.0 million. the proceeds from the sale received at closing were used to repay outstanding debt.
during fiscal 2021, we sold an applied sterilization technologies laboratory that was located in the netherlands. we recorded proceeds of $0.5 million, net of cash divested, and recognized a pre-tax loss on the sale of $2.0 million in the selling, general and administrative expense line of the consolidated statements of income. the business generated annual revenues of approximately $6.0 million.
for more information regarding our recent acquisitions and divestitures see note 2 titled, "business acquisitions and divestitures."
covid-19 pandemic. we do not believe that the covid-19 pandemic has had a material impact on our operations, as we have been able to continue to operate our manufacturing facilities and meet the demand for essential products and services of our customers. in response to the covid-19 pandemic, we implemented several measures that we believe helped us protect the health and safety of our employees, preserve liquidity and enhance our financial flexibility. we have successfully managed our liquidity throughout the covid-19 pandemic and continue to invest in expansion projects as planned. we obtained additional funding in the second half of fiscal 2021 to continue to advance our growth strategy to supplement organic growth with acquisitions. as a result, we do not believe that the covid-19 pandemic or the actions we took in response to the pandemic will negatively impact our long-term ability to generate revenues or meet existing and future financial obligations. for additional information on our risk factors related to the covid-19 pandemic please refer to item 1a. titled, "risk factors."
highlights.  revenues increased $1,477.5 million, or 47.5%, to $4,585.1 million for the year ended march 31, 2022, as compared to $3,107.5 million for the year ended march 31, 2021. these increases reflect added volume from cantel and other recent acquisitions, organic growth in the healthcare, applied sterilization technologies and life sciences segments, and favorable fluctuations in currencies.
our gross profit percentage increased to 44.0% for fiscal 2022 as compared to 43.2% for fiscal 2021. favorable impact from productivity, pricing, and the decline in covid-19 incremental costs, were partially offset by unfavorable impact from our recent acquisitions, material costs, inflation, fluctuations in currencies, and mix and other adjustments.
fiscal 2022 operating income decreased 22.4% to $425.6 million over fiscal 2021 operating income of $548.4 million. this decline was primarily due to additional acquisition and integration expenses and incremental amortization expense primarily related to the acquisition of cantel. unplanned supply chain and inflation of approximately $45.0 million also contributed to the decline in fiscal 2022.
net cash flows from operations were $684.8 million and free cash flow was $399.0 million in fiscal 2022 compared to net cash flows from operations of $689.6 million and free cash flow of $450.9 million in fiscal 2021 (see subsection of md&a titled, "non-gaap financial measures" for additional information and related reconciliation of non-gaap financial measures to the most comparable gaap measures). the fiscal 2022 decrease in free cash flow was anticipated and was primarily due to costs associated with the acquisition and integration of cantel and higher capital expenditures in fiscal 2022.
our debt-to-total capital ratio was 32.1% at march 31, 2022. during the year, we increased our quarterly dividend for the sixteenth consecutive year to $0.43 per share per quarter.
outlook. in fiscal 2023 and beyond, we expect to continue to realize incremental cost synergies as a result of the integration of cantel, manage our costs, grow our business with internal product and service development, invest in greater capacity, and augment these value creating methods with potential acquisitions of additional products and services. we anticipate continued supply chain and inflation pressures in fiscal 2023. please refer to "information with respect to our business in general" in item 1."business" to this annual report on form 10-k.
non-gaap financial measures we, at times, refer to financial measures which are considered to be "non-gaap financial measures" under sec rules. we, at times, also refer to our results of operations excluding certain transactions or amounts that are non-recurring or are not indicative of future results, in order to provide meaningful comparisons between the periods presented.
these non-gaap financial measures are not intended to be, and should not be, considered separately from or as an alternative to the most directly comparable gaap financial measures.
these non-gaap financial measures are presented with the intent of providing greater transparency to supplemental financial information used by management and the board of directors in their financial analysis and operational decision-making. these amounts are disclosed so that the reader has the same financial data that management uses with the belief that it will assist investors and other readers in making comparisons to our historical operating results and analyzing the underlying performance of our operations for the periods presented.
we believe that the presentation of these non-gaap financial measures, when considered along with our gaap financial measures and the reconciliation to the corresponding gaap financial measures, provide the reader with a more complete understanding of the factors and trends affecting our business than could be obtained absent this disclosure. it is important for the reader to note that the non-gaap financial measure used may be calculated differently from, and therefore may not be comparable to, a similarly titled measure used by other companies.
we define free cash flow as net cash provided by operating activities as presented in the consolidated statements of cash flows less purchases of property, plant, equipment, and intangibles plus proceeds from the sale of property, plant, equipment, and intangibles, which are also presented within investing activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows. we use this as a measure to gauge our ability to pay cash dividends, fund growth outside of core operations, fund future debt principal repayments, and repurchase shares. the following table summarizes the calculation of our free cash flow for the years ended march 31, 2022 and 2021:

nm - not meaningful selling, general, and administrative expenses. significant components of total selling, general, and administrative expenses ("sg&a") are compensation and benefit costs, fees for professional services, travel and entertainment, facilities costs, gains or losses from divestitures, and other general and administrative expenses. sg&a increased 105.5% in fiscal 2022 over fiscal 2021. during the fiscal 2022 period we had significant increases in acquisition related costs, which included amortization of acquired intangible assets, "step-up" of plant, property and equipment to fair value, and acquisition and integration expenses, which were primarily related to the acquisition of cantel. the increase also reflects the addition of expenses associated with the operations of cantel and our other recent acquisitions.
research and development. research and development expenses increased $21.6 million during fiscal 2022, as compared to fiscal 2021, primarily due to the addition of cantel and our other recent acquisitions. research and development expenses are influenced by the number and timing of in-process projects and labor hours and other costs associated with these projects. our research and development initiatives continue to emphasize new product development, product improvements, and the development of new technological platform innovations. during fiscal 2022, our investments in research and development continued to be focused on, but were not limited to, enhancing capabilities of sterile processing combination technologies, procedural products and accessories, and devices and support accessories used in gastrointestinal endoscopy procedures.
restructuring expenses. during the third quarter of fiscal 2019, we adopted and announced a targeted restructuring plan (the "fiscal 2019 restructuring plan"), which included the closure of two manufacturing facilities, one in brazil and one in england, as well as other actions including the rationalization of certain products. fewer than 200 positions were eliminated. the company relocated the production of certain impacted products to other existing manufacturing operations during fiscal 2020. these restructuring actions were designed to enhance profitability and improve efficiency. restructuring expenses incurred in fiscal 2022 and fiscal 2021 were not material. for information on our restructuring efforts, refer to our annual report on form 10-k filed with the sec on may 28, 2021.

the effective income tax rate for fiscal 2022 was 22.8% as compared to 23.3% for fiscal 2021. the fiscal 2022 effective tax rate decreased when compared to fiscal 2021, primarily due to a decrease in percentage of profits earned and taxed in jurisdictions with a higher tax rate. the fiscal 2022 effective tax rate was also unfavorably impacted by certain one-time, non-deductible acquisition related costs.
business segment results of operations.
as a result of the acquisition of cantel, we have reassessed the organization of our business and have added a new segment called dental. we now operate and report our financial information in four reportable business segments: healthcare, applied sterilization technologies, life sciences and dental. non-allocated operating costs that support the entire company and items not indicative of operating trends are excluded from segment operating income.
our healthcare segment provides a comprehensive offering for healthcare providers worldwide, focused on sterile processing departments and procedural centers, such as operating rooms and endoscopy suites. our products and services range from infection prevention consumables and capital equipment, as well as services to maintain that equipment; to the repair of re-usable procedural instruments; to outsourced instrument reprocessing services. in addition, our procedural solutions also include single-use devices and capital equipment infrastructure used primarily in operating rooms, ambulatory surgery centers, endoscopy suites, and other procedural areas.
our applied sterilization technologies segment is a third-party service provider for contract sterilization, as well as testing services needed to validate sterility services for medical device and pharmaceutical manufacturers. our technology-neutral offering supports customers every step of the way, from testing through sterilization.
our life sciences segment provides a comprehensive offering of products and services that support pharmaceutical manufacturing, primarily for vaccine and other biopharma customers focused on aseptic manufacturing. these solutions include a full suite of consumable products, equipment maintenance and specialty services, and capital equipment.
our dental segment provides a comprehensive offering for dental practitioners and dental schools, offering instruments, infection prevention consumables and instrument management systems.
we disclose a measure of segment income that is consistent with the way management operates and views the business. the accounting policies for reportable segments are the same as those for the consolidated company.
for more information regarding our segments please refer to note 11 to our consolidated financial statements titled "business segment information," and item 1, "business."

•on march 19, 2021, steris corporation as issuer, and the company, limited and finco, as guarantors, entered into (1) a first amendment to amended and restated note purchase agreement dated march 5, 2019 (which had amended and restated certain note purchase agreements originally dated december 4, 2012) per the 2012 and 2013 senior notes (the "2012 amendment"), and (2) a first amendment to amended and restated note purchase agreement dated march 5, 2019 (which had amended and restated certain note purchase agreements originally dated march 31, 2015) for the 2015 senior notes (the "2015 amendment"). also on march 19, 2021, limited, as issuer, and the company, steris corporation and finco, as guarantors, entered into a first amendment to amended and restated note purchase agreement dated march 5, 2019 (which had amended and restated a certain note purchase agreement originally dated january 23, 2017) for the 2017 senior notes (together with the 2012 amendment and the 2015 amendment, the "npa amendments"). the npa amendments provided, among other things, for the waiver of certain repurchase rights of the note holders and increased the size of certain baskets to more closely align with other current credit agreement baskets.
at march 31, 2022, we were in compliance with all financial covenants associated with our indebtedness. we provide additional information regarding our debt structure and payment obligations in the section of the md&a titled, "liquidity and capital resources" in the subsection titled, "contractual and commercial commitments" and in note 6 to our consolidated financial statements titled, "debt."
capital expenditures our capital expenditure program is a component of our long-term strategy. this program includes, among other things, investments in new and existing facilities, business expansion projects, radioisotope (cobalt-60), and information technology enhancements and research and development advances. during fiscal 2022, our capital expenditures amounted to $287.6 million. we use cash provided by operating activities and our cash and cash equivalent balances to fund capital expenditures. in fiscal 2023, we plan to continue to invest in facility expansions, particularly within the healthcare and applied sterilization technologies segments and in ongoing maintenance for existing facilities.
material future cash obligations and commercial commitments cash requirements. we intend to use our existing cash and cash equivalent balances and cash generated from operations to fund capital expenditures and meet our other liquidity needs. our capital requirements depend on many uncertain factors, including our rate of sales growth, our customers' acceptance of our products and services, the costs of obtaining adequate manufacturing capacities, the timing and extent of our research and development projects, changes in our operating expenses and other factors. to the extent that existing and anticipated sources of cash are not sufficient to fund our future activities, we may need to raise additional funds through additional borrowings or the sale of equity securities. there can be no assurance that our financing arrangements will provide us with sufficient funds or that we will be able to obtain any additional funds on terms favorable to us or at all.
our material future cash obligations and commercial commitments as of march 31, 2022 are presented in the following tables. commercial commitments include standby letters of credit, letters of credit required as security under our self-insured risk retention policies, and other potential cash outflows resulting from events that require us to fulfill commitments.

supplemental guarantor financial information steris plc ("parent") and its wholly-owned subsidiaries, steris limited and steris corporation (collectively "guarantors" and each a "guarantor"), each have provided guarantees of the obligations of steris irish finco unlimited company ("finco", "steris irish finco"), a wholly-owned subsidiary issuer, under senior public notes issued by steris irish finco on april 1, 2021 and of certain other obligations relating to the senior public notes. the senior public notes are guaranteed, jointly and severally, on a senior unsecured basis. the senior public notes and the related guarantees are senior unsecured obligations of steris irish finco and the guarantors, respectively, and are equal in priority with all other unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness of the issuer and the guarantors, respectively, from time to time outstanding, including, as applicable, under the private placement senior notes, borrowings under the revolving credit facility, the term loan and the delayed draw term loan.
all of the liabilities of non-guarantor direct and indirect subsidiaries of steris, other than steris irish finco, steris limited and steris corporation, including any claims of trade creditors, are effectively senior to the senior public notes.
steris irish finco's main objective and source of revenues and cash flows is the provision of short- and long-term financing for the activities of steris plc and its subsidiaries.
the ability of our subsidiaries to pay dividends, interest and other fees to the issuer and ability of the issuer and guarantors to service the senior public notes may be restricted by, among other things, applicable corporate and other laws and regulations as well as agreements to which our subsidiaries are or may become a party.
the following is a summary of these guarantees:
guarantees of senior notes

•subsidiary issuer - steris irish finco unlimited company
•subsidiary guarantor - steris limited
•subsidiary guarantor - steris corporation the guarantee of a guarantor will be automatically and unconditionally released and discharged:
•in the case of a subsidiary guarantor, upon the sale, transfer or other disposition (including by way of consolidation or merger) of such subsidiary guarantor, other than to the parent or a subsidiary of the parent and as permitted by the indenture;
•in the case of a subsidiary guarantor, upon the sale, transfer or other disposition of all or substantially all the assets of such subsidiary guarantor, other than to the parent or a subsidiary of the parent and as permitted by the indenture;
•in the case of a subsidiary guarantor, at such time as such subsidiary guarantor is no longer a borrower under or no longer guarantees any material credit facility (subject to restatement in specified circumstances);
•upon the legal defeasance or covenant defeasance of the notes or the discharge of the issuer's obligations under the indenture in accordance with the terms of the indenture;
•as described in accordance with the terms of the indenture; or
•in the case of the parent, if the issuer ceases for any reason to be a subsidiary of the parent; provided that all guarantees and other obligations of the parent in respect of all other indebtedness under any material credit facility of the issuer terminate upon the issuer ceasing to be a subsidiary of the parent; and
•upon such guarantor delivering to the trustee an officer's certificate and an opinion of counsel, each stating that all conditions precedent provided for in the indenture relating to such transaction or release have been complied with.
the obligations of each guarantor under its guarantee are expressly limited to the maximum amount that such guarantor could guarantee without such guarantee constituting a fraudulent conveyance. each guarantor that makes a payment under its guarantee will be entitled upon payment in full of all guaranteed obligations under the indenture to a contribution from each guarantor in an amount equal to such other guarantor's pro rata portion of such payment based on the respective net assets of all the guarantors at the time of such payment determined in accordance with gaap.

credit ratings steris's senior public notes have been assigned the following credit ratings:
standard &amp; poor's         moody's        fitch credit ratings                bbb-                          baa2           bbb each of the credit rating agencies reviews its rating periodically and there is no guarantee our current credit ratings will remain the same. if our credit ratings were lowered, our ability to access the debt markets, our cost of funds, and other terms for new debt issuances could be adversely impacted.
critical accounting estimates and assumptions the following subsections describe our most critical accounting estimates, and assumptions. our accounting policies and recently issued accounting pronouncements are more fully described in note 1 to our consolidated financial statements titled, "nature of operations and summary of significant accounting policies."
estimates and assumptions.  our discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements that were prepared in accordance with united states generally accepted accounting principles. we make certain estimates and assumptions that we believe to be reasonable when preparing these financial statements. these estimates and assumptions involve judgments with respect to numerous factors that are difficult to predict and are beyond management's control. as a result, actual amounts could be materially different from these estimates. we periodically review these critical accounting policies, estimates, assumptions, and the related disclosures with the audit committee of the company's board of directors.
revenue recognition.  revenue is recognized when obligations under the terms of the contract are satisfied and control of the promised products or services has transferred to the customer. revenues are measured at the amount of consideration that we expect to be paid in exchange for the products or services. product revenue is recognized when control passes to the customer, which is generally based on contract or shipping terms. service revenue is recognized when the customer benefits from the service, which occurs either upon completion of the service or as it is provided to the customer. our customers include end users as well as dealers and distributors who market and sell our products. our revenue is not contingent upon resale by the dealer or distributor, and we have no further obligations related to bringing about resale. our standard return and restocking fee policies are applied to sales of products. shipping and handling costs charged to customers are included in product revenues. the associated expenses are treated as fulfillment costs and are included in cost of revenues. revenues are reported net of sales and value-added taxes collected from customers.
we have individual customer contracts that offer discounted pricing. dealers and distributors may be offered sales incentives in the form of rebates. we reduce revenue for discounts and estimated returns, rebates, and other similar allowances in the same period the related revenues are recorded. the reduction in revenue for these items is estimated based on historical experience and trend analysis to the extent that it is probable that a significant reversal of revenue will not occur. estimated returns are recorded gross on the consolidated balance sheets.
in transactions that contain multiple performance obligations, such as when products, maintenance services, and other services are combined, we recognize revenue as each product is delivered or service is provided to the customer. we allocate the total arrangement consideration to each performance obligation based on its relative standalone selling price, which is the price for the product or service when it is sold separately.
payment terms vary by the type and location of the customer and the products or services offered. generally, the time between when revenue is recognized and when payment is due is not significant. we do not evaluate whether the selling price contains a financing component for contracts that have a duration of less than one year.
we do not capitalize sales commissions as substantially all of our sales commission programs have an amortization period of one year or less.
certain costs to fulfill a contract are capitalized and amortized over the term of the contract if they are recoverable, directly related to a contract and generate resources that we will use to fulfill the contract in the future. at march 31, 2022 assets related to costs to fulfill a contract were not material to our consolidated financial statements.
allowance for doubtful accounts receivable.  we maintain an allowance for uncollectible accounts receivable for estimated losses in the collection of amounts owed by customers. we estimate the allowance based on analyzing a number of factors, including amounts written off historically, customer payment practices, and general economic conditions. we also analyze significant customer accounts on a regular basis and record a specific allowance when we become aware of a specific customer's inability to pay. as a result, the related accounts receivable are reduced to an amount that we reasonably believe is collectible. these analyses require judgment. if the financial condition of our customers worsens, or economic conditions change, we may be required to make changes to our allowance for doubtful accounts receivable.
inventories and reserves. inventories are stated at the lower of their cost and net realizable value determined by the first-in, first-out ("fifo") cost method. inventory costs include material, labor, and overhead.
we review inventory on an ongoing basis, considering factors such as deterioration and obsolescence. we record an allowance for estimated losses when the facts and circumstances indicate that particular inventories will not be usable. if future market conditions vary from those projected, and our estimates prove to be inaccurate, we may be required to write-down inventory values and record an adjustment to cost of revenues.
asset impairment losses.  property, plant, equipment, and identifiable intangible assets are reviewed for impairment when events and circumstances indicate that the carrying value of such assets may not be recoverable. impaired assets are recorded at the lower of carrying value or estimated fair value. we conduct this review on an ongoing basis and, if impairment exists, we record the loss in the consolidated statements of income during that period.
when we evaluate assets for impairment, we make certain judgments and estimates, including interpreting current economic indicators and market valuations, evaluating our strategic plans with regards to operations, historical and anticipated performance of operations, and other factors. if we incorrectly anticipate these factors, or unexpected events occur, our operating results could be materially affected.
purchase accounting and goodwill.  assets and liabilities of the business acquired are accounted for at their estimated fair values as of the acquisition date. any excess of the cost of the acquisition over the fair value of the net tangible and intangible assets acquired is recorded as goodwill. we supplement management expertise with valuation specialists in performing appraisals to assist us in determining the fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed. these valuations require us to make estimates and assumptions, especially with respect to intangible assets. we generally amortize our intangible assets over their useful lives with the exception of indefinite lived intangible assets. we do not amortize goodwill, but we evaluate it annually for impairment. therefore, the allocation of the purchase price to intangible assets and goodwill has a significant impact on future operating results.
we evaluate the recoverability of recorded goodwill amounts annually, or when evidence of potential impairment exists. we may consider qualitative indicators of the fair value of a reporting unit when it is unlikely that a reporting unit has impaired goodwill. we may also utilize a discounted cash flow analysis that requires certain assumptions and estimates be made regarding market conditions and our future profitability. in those circumstances, we test goodwill for impairment by reviewing the book value compared to the fair value at the reporting unit level. we calculate the fair value of our reporting units based on the present value of estimated future cash flows. management's judgment is necessary to evaluate the impact of operating and macroeconomic changes and to estimate future cash flows to measure fair value. assumptions used in our impairment evaluations, such as forecasted growth rates and cost of capital, are consistent with internal projections and operating plans. we believe such assumptions and estimates are also comparable to those that would be used by other marketplace participants.
as a result of our annual impairment review for goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets for fiscal year 2022 no indicators of impairment were identified.
we evaluate indefinite lived intangible assets annually, or when evidence of potential impairment exists. we evaluate several qualitative indicators and assumptions, and trends that influence the valuation of the assets to determine if any evidence of potential impairment exists.
income taxes.  our provision for income taxes is based on our current period income, changes in deferred income tax assets and liabilities, income tax rates, changes in uncertain tax benefits, and tax planning opportunities available to us in the various jurisdictions in which we operate. tax laws are complex and subject to different interpretations by the taxpayer and the respective governmental taxing authorities. we use judgment in determining our annual effective income tax rate and evaluating our tax positions. we prepare and file tax returns based on our interpretation of tax laws and regulations, and we record estimates based on these judgments and interpretations. we cannot be sure that the tax authorities will agree with all of the tax positions taken by us. the actual income tax liability for each jurisdiction in any year can, in some instances, ultimately be determined be several years after the tax return is filed and the financial statements are published.
we evaluate our tax positions using the recognition threshold and measurement attribute in accordance with current accounting guidance. we determine whether it is more-likely-than-not that a tax position will be sustained upon examination, including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes, based on the technical merits of the position. in evaluating whether a tax position has met the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold, we presume that the position will be examined by the appropriate taxing authority and that the taxing authority will have full knowledge of all relevant information. a tax position that meets the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold is measured at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50 percent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement. the appropriate unit of account for determining what constitutes an individual tax position, and whether the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold is met for a tax position, is a matter of judgment based on the individual facts and circumstances of that position evaluated in light of all available evidence. we review and adjust our tax estimates periodically because of ongoing examinations by and settlements with the various taxing authorities, as well as changes in tax laws, regulations and precedent.
we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax basis of assets and liabilities. we regularly review our deferred tax assets for recoverability and establish a valuation allowance based on historical taxable income, projected future taxable income, the expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences, and the implementation of tax planning strategies. if we are unable to generate sufficient future taxable income in certain tax jurisdictions, or if there is a material change in the effective income tax rates or time period within which the underlying temporary differences become taxable or deductible, we could be required to increase our valuation allowance, which would increase our effective income tax rate and could result in an adverse impact on our consolidated financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.
we believe that adequate accruals have been made for income taxes. differences between the estimated and actual amounts determined upon ultimate resolution, individually or in the aggregate, are not expected to have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position, but could possibly be material to our consolidated results of operations or cash flows for any one period.
additional information regarding income taxes is included in note 8 to our consolidated financial statements titled, "income taxes."
self-insurance liabilities.  we record a liability for self-insured risks that we retain for general and product liabilities, workers' compensation, and automobile liabilities based on actuarial calculations. we use our historical loss experience and actuarial methods to calculate the estimated liability. this liability includes estimated amounts for both losses and incurred but not reported claims. we review the assumptions used to calculate the estimated liability at least annually to evaluate the adequacy of the amount recorded. we maintain insurance policies to cover losses greater than our estimated liability, which are subject to the terms and conditions of those policies. the obligation covered by insurance contracts will remain on the balance sheet as we remain liable to the extent insurance carriers do not meet their obligation. estimated amounts receivable under the contracts are included in the "prepaid expenses and other current assets" line, and the "other assets" line of our consolidated balance sheets. our accrual for self-insured risk retention as of march 31, 2022 and 2021 was $26.1 million and $23.3 million, respectively.
we are also self-insured for employee medical claims. we estimate a liability for incurred but not reported claims based upon recent claims experience. our self-insured liabilities contain uncertainties because management must make assumptions and apply judgments to estimate the ultimate cost to settle reported claims and claims incurred but not reported as of the balance sheet date. if actual results are not consistent with these assumptions and judgments, we could be exposed to additional costs in subsequent periods.
contingencies.  we are, and will likely continue to be, involved in a number of legal proceedings, government investigations, and claims, which we believe generally arise in the course of our business, given our size, history, complexity, and the nature of our business, products, customers, regulatory environment, and industries in which we participate. these legal proceedings, investigations and claims generally involve a variety of legal theories and allegations, including, without limitation, personal injury (e.g., slip and falls, burns, vehicle accidents), product liability or regulation (e.g., based on product operation or claimed malfunction, failure to warn, failure to meet specification, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements), product exposure (e.g., claimed exposure to chemicals, asbestos, contaminants, radiation), property damage (e.g., claimed damage due to leaking equipment, fire, vehicles, chemicals), commercial claims (e.g., breach of contract, economic loss, warranty, misrepresentation), financial (e.g., taxes, reporting), employment (e.g., wrongful termination, discrimination, benefits matters), and other claims for damage and relief.
we record a liability for such contingencies to the extent we conclude that their occurrence is both probable and estimable. we consider many factors in making these assessments, including the professional judgment of experienced members of management and our legal counsel. we have made estimates as to the likelihood of unfavorable outcomes and the amounts of such potential losses. in our opinion, the ultimate outcome of these proceedings and claims is not anticipated to have a material adverse affect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. however, the ultimate outcome of proceedings, government investigations, and claims is unpredictable and actual results could be materially different from our estimates. we record expected recoveries under applicable insurance contracts when we are assured of recovery. refer to note 10 of our consolidated financial statements titled, "commitments and contingencies" for additional information.
we are subject to taxation from federal, state and local, and foreign jurisdictions. tax positions are settled primarily through the completion of audits within each individual tax jurisdiction or the closing of a statute of limitation. changes in applicable tax law or other events may also require us to revise past estimates. the irs of the united states routinely conducts audits of our federal income tax returns.
additional information regarding our commitments and contingencies is included in note 10 to our consolidated financial statements titled, "commitments and contingencies."
benefit plans.  we provide defined benefit pension plans for certain employees and retirees. in addition, we sponsor an unfunded post-retirement benefits plan for two groups of united states retirees. benefits under this plan include retiree life insurance and retiree medical insurance, including prescription drug coverage.
employee pension and post-retirement benefits plans are a cost of conducting business and represent obligations that will be settled in the future and therefore, require us to use estimates and make certain assumptions to calculate the expense and liabilities related to the plans. changes to these estimates and assumptions can result in different expense and liability amounts. future actual experience may be significantly different from our current expectations. we believe that the most critical assumptions used to determine net periodic benefit costs and projected benefit obligations are the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets and the discount rate. a summary of significant assumptions used to determine the march 31, 2022 projected benefit obligations and the fiscal 2022 net periodic benefit costs is as follows:

we develop our expected long-term rate of return on plan assets a ssumptions by evaluating input from third-party professional advisors, taking into consideration the asset allocation of the portfolios, and the long-term asset class return expectations. generally, net periodic benefit costs increase as the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets assumption decreases. holding all other assumptions constant, lowering the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets assumption for our funded defined benefit pension plans by 50 basis points would have increased the fiscal 2022 benefit costs by less than $0.1 million.
we develop our discount rate assumptions by evaluating input from third-party professional advisers, taking into consideration the current yield on country specific investment grade long-term bonds which provide for similar cash flow streams as our projected benefit obligations. generally, the projected benefit obligations and the net periodic benefit costs both increase as the discount rate assumption decreases. holding all other assumptions constant, lowering the discount rate assumption for our defined benefit pension plans and for the other post-retirement benefits plan by 50 basis points would have decreased the fiscal 2022 net periodic benefit costs by less than $0.1 million and would have increased the projected benefit obligations by approximately $11.2 million at march 31, 2022.
we have made assumptions regarding healthcare costs in computing our other post-retirement benefit obligation. the assumed rates of increase generally decline ratably over a five year-period from the assumed current year healthcare cost trend rate of 7.0% to the assumed long-term healthcare cost trend rate. a 100 basis point change in the assumed healthcare cost trend rate (including medical, prescription drug, and long-term rates) would have had the following effect at march 31, 2022:
100 basis point

effect on postretirement benefit obligation                 2                          (2)
we recognize an asset for the overfunded status or a liability for the underfunded status of defined benefit pension and post-retirement benefit plans in our balance sheets. this amount is measured as the difference between the fair value of plan assets and the benefit obligation (the projected benefit obligation for pension plans and the accumulated post-retirement benefit obligation for other post-retirement benefit plans). changes in the funded status of the plans are recorded in other comprehensive income in the year they occur. we measure plan assets and obligations as of the balance sheet date. note 9 to our consolidated financial statements titled, "benefit plans," contains additional information about our pension and other post-retirement welfare benefits plans.
share-based compensation. we measure the estimated fair value for share-based compensation awards, including grants of employee stock options, at the grant date and recognize the related compensation expense over the period in which the share-based compensation vests. we selected the black-scholes-merton option pricing model as the most appropriate method for determining the estimated fair value of our share-based stock option compensation awards. this model involves assumptions that are judgmental and affect share-based compensation expense.
share-based compensation expense was $57.7 million in fiscal 2022, $26.0 million in fiscal 2021 and $23.8 million in fiscal 2020. note 14 to our consolidated financial statements titled, "share-based compensation," contains additional information about our share-based compensation plans.

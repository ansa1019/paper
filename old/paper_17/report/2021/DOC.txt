item 1a.    risk factors the section below discusses the most significant risk factors that may materially adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.
as set forth below, we believe that the risks we face generally fall into the following categories:
•risks related to our business and operations;
•risks related to our capital structure and market conditions;
•risks related to the regulatory environment;
•risks related to other events;
•risks related to tax, including reit-related risks; and
•general risks.
risks related to our business and operations the covid pandemic and health and safety measures intended to reduce its spread have adversely affected, and may continue to adversely affect, our business, results of operations and financial condition.
beginning in 2020, global health concerns and efforts to reduce the spread of covid resulted in travel bans, quarantines, "shelter-in-place" and similar orders restricting the activities of individuals outside of their homes, as well as business limitations and shutdowns of businesses deemed "non-essential." although many of these restrictions have been lifted or scaled back over time, ongoing resurgences of covid infections, including due to new and more contagious variants, have resulted in the re-imposition of certain restrictions and may lead to other restrictions being re-implemented to reduce the spread of covid. moreover, as individuals and businesses have adapted to the regulatory and market challenges arising from the pandemic, some potentially permanent changes in traditional economic patterns and arrangements have occurred. for a description of certain of these changes, see "item 7, management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations-covid update." as a result of these regulatory requirements and adaptations to the "new normal," the ability of our tenants, operators and borrowers to conduct their normal businesses operations, to operate profitably and to comply with their rent and other financial obligations to us have in some cases been, or may in the future be, adversely affected.
senior housing facilities have been disproportionately impacted by covid and covid-related fatalities. within our ccrc properties and the properties in our swf sh jv, average occupancy declined from 85.6% and 88.7%, respectively, for the year ended december 31, 2019, to 79.1% and 72.7%, respectively, for the year ended december 31, 2021. recent surges in covid case levels may result in a reduction in, or in some cases prohibitions on, new tenant move-ins, stricter move-in criteria, lower inquiry volumes, and reduced in-person tours, as well as incidences of covid outbreaks at our facilities or the perception that outbreaks may occur. in addition, a lack of available staffing resources at our ccrc properties and the properties in our swf sh jv, including due to labor shortages or outbreaks among the existing staff, could result in admission restrictions or reduced demand if facilities are perceived as understaffed. outbreaks, which directly affect our residents and the employees at our senior housing facilities, have and could continue to materially and adversely disrupt operations. these outbreaks could cause significant reputational harm to us and our operators and, for an extended period, adversely affected demand for senior housing. our senior housing property operators are also facing material cost increases as a result of higher staffing hours and compensation and higher overall levels of inflation. at our ccrc facilities and the facilities in our swf sh jv, we bear these material cost increases. the pandemic has also delayed the deployment of capital improvements and expenditures, which could adversely impact operations at our senior housing facilities. our senior housing borrowers are facing the same impacts of covid, which could impact their ability to meet their financial and other contractual obligations to us.
the impact of the covid pandemic on our ccrc properties and the properties owned by our swf sh jv, all of which are managed in ridea structures, has had and may continue to have a more significant impact on our results of operations on a relative basis because we receive cash flow from the operations of the properties (as compared to receiving only contractual rent from third party tenant-operators under the senior housing triple-net portfolio that we disposed of, as described above under "item 1-business-general overview"), and we also bear all operational risks and liabilities associated with the operation of those properties, other than those arising out of certain actions by our operator, such as gross negligence or willful misconduct. accordingly, impacts from the covid pandemic directly affecting our ccrc properties and the properties owned by our swf sh jv, including lower net operating income caused by decreased revenues that may result from declines in occupancy or otherwise, and increased expenses, have had and are expected to continue to have a direct and immediate impact on our results of operations. in addition, our ridea operators who are adversely affected by the covid pandemic may request revisions to their management agreements and existing fee structures in order to reduce the amount of cash from operations that flows directly to us. we may also be directly adversely impacted by potential lawsuits related to covid outbreaks that have occurred or may occur at our senior housing and ccrc properties, and our insurance coverage may not be sufficient to cover any potential losses.
in 2020, the pandemic adversely impacted certain development, redevelopment and tenant improvement projects as a result of the "shelter-in-place" orders and local, state and federal directives. although these development, redevelopment and tenant improvement projects resumed in 2020 and continued as planned in 2021 with infection control protocols in place, the pandemic, including labor and supply chain disruptions and/or other economic conditions caused by the pandemic, could adversely impact the scheduled completion and/or cost of these projects.
within our medical office portfolio, many physician practices temporarily discontinued outpatient procedures and nonessential surgeries in 2020 due to health and safety measures, which negatively impacted their cash flows. at that time, we implemented a deferred rent program primarily for may and june 2020 that was limited to certain non-health system and non-hospital tenants in good standing, which resulted in reduced cash flow in the periods in which such deferrals were granted, but increased our cash flow in the period in which such deferrals were repaid. we did not offer any rent deferrals in 2021, but if new outbreaks or other conditions result in a similar negative impact on our tenants, we may consider implementation of another deferred rent program for future periods. new leasing slowed down during the government-mandated shutdown in 2020 and returned to normal levels in 2021; new outbreaks or other conditions could result in another slowdown in new leasing. in addition, any reinstatement of restrictions on our tenants' procedures and continuing restrictions on patient visitation could impact our tenants' ability to meet their obligations to us as well as our parking income in our medical office portfolio.
the covid pandemic subjects our business and the businesses of our tenants, operators and borrowers to various risks and uncertainties that have adversely affected and could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition for at least the pendency of the covid pandemic and possibly longer, including the following:
•material cost increases at our ccrc facilities and the facilities in our swf sh jv, for which we are responsible;
•any rent deferrals or delays in rent commencement that we may grant to tenants, which could result in a significant decrease in our cash receipts during the period of the deferrals;
•non-payment of contractual obligations by our tenants or operators, and any limitations on our ability to enforce our lease agreements or management agreements with our tenants or operators, as applicable, as a result of any federal, state or local restrictions on tenant evictions for failure to make contractual rent payments, which may result in higher reserves for bad debt;
•our tenants, operators or borrowers becoming insolvent or initiating bankruptcy or similar proceedings, which would adversely affect our ability to collect rent or interest payments from such tenants or borrowers, as applicable, and result in increased costs to us, as well as decreased revenues;
•the complete or partial closures of, or other operational issues at, one or more of our properties resulting from government action or directives, which may intensify the risk of rent deferrals or non-payment of contractual obligations by our tenants, operators, or borrowers;
•the likelihood that we will amend existing lease agreements and existing rental terms, with our tenants, and management agreements and existing fee structures, with our ridea operators, particularly in our senior housing portfolio, which would have an adverse effect on our revenues and results of operations;
•the likelihood that we will amend existing loan agreements with our senior housing borrowers, which would have an adverse effect on our revenues and results of operations;
•increased costs or delays that may result if we determine to reposition or transition any of our currently-leased properties to another tenant or operator, which could adversely impact our revenues and results of operations;
•the impact on our results of operations and financial condition resulting from (i) delays or increased costs caused by a shortage of construction materials or labor, or suspensions or delays in development and redevelopment activities and tenant improvement projects, including due to local, state and federal orders or guidelines, delays or increased costs caused by slow-downs in construction as a result of implementing social distancing and other health and safety protocols, as well as potential postponement of rent commencement dates due to delays in tenant improvement projects, and (ii) a decrease in acquisitions and dispositions of properties compared to historical levels;
•reduced valuations for properties in our portfolio that we wish to sell, and potential delayed transaction and due diligence timing due to government delays or government mandated covid-related access restrictions;
•the need to provide seller financing in order to dispose of certain properties in our portfolio at acceptable prices;
•the impact on our tenants, operators, or borrowers, particularly in our senior housing portfolio, of lawsuits related to covid outbreaks that have occurred or may occur at our properties and the potential that insurance coverage may not be sufficient to cover any potential losses;
•material increases in our insurance costs and larger deductibles or the inability to obtain insurance at economically reasonable rates;
•significant expenses likely to be incurred if we pursue of creditor rights resulting from operator, tenant, and borrower defaults and insolvency;
•a potential downgrade of our issuer and long-term credit rating, which could increase our cost of capital and any future debt financing;
•refusal or failure by one or more of our lenders under our credit facility to fund their financing commitments to us as a result of lender liquidity and/or viability challenges, which financing commitments we may not be able to replace on favorable terms, or at all;
•the likelihood that conditions related to the covid pandemic may require us to recognize additional impairments of long-lived assets or credit losses related to loans receivable;
•the impact of negative or adverse publicity associated with covid outbreaks at our ccrc properties or the properties in our swf sh jv, the cost of responding to such adverse publicity and the potential for heightened regulatory scrutiny caused by it;
•a deterioration of state and local economic conditions and job losses, particularly in san francisco, san diego and boston, which may decrease demand for and occupancy levels at our life science properties and cause our rental rates and property values to be negatively impacted; and
•the potential for shifts in consumer and business behaviors that fundamentally and adversely affect demand for properties in our portfolio.
additionally, the covid pandemic could increase the magnitude of many of the other risks described herein and elsewhere in this annual report and may have other adverse effects on our operations that we are not currently able to predict. the covid pandemic has also resulted in significant volatility in the local, national and global financial markets, and we may be unable to obtain any required financing on favorable terms or on a timely basis or at all.
the extent of the impact of the covid pandemic on our business and financial results will depend on future developments, including: (i) ongoing resurgences of covid; (ii) health and safety actions taken to contain its spread; (iii) the availability, effectiveness and public usage and acceptance of vaccines and treatments; and (iv) how quickly and to what extent normal economic and operating conditions can resume within the markets in which we operate, each of which are highly uncertain at this time and outside of our control. even after the covid pandemic subsides, we may continue to experience adverse impacts to our business and financial results because of its national and global economic impact and any permanent changes in traditional economic patterns and arrangements. the covid pandemic could have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition.
decreases in our tenants', operators' or borrowers' revenues, or increases in their expenses, could affect their ability to meet their financial and other contractual obligations to us, and could result in amendments to these obligations that have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.
we have limited control over the success or failure of our tenants', operators' and borrowers' businesses, regardless of whether our relationship is structured as a triple-net lease, a ridea lease or as a lender to our borrowers. any of our tenants or our operators under a ridea structure may experience a downturn in their business that materially weakens their financial condition. for example, (i) our operators under a ridea structure and certain of our tenants in our medical office portfolio experienced a significant downturn in their businesses due to the covid pandemic, including as a result of interruptions in their operations, lost revenues, increased costs, financing difficulties and labor shortages, and (ii) our tenants in the life science industry face various risks to their businesses, as discussed below under "-our tenants in the life science industry face high levels of regulation, funding requirements, expense and uncertainty." as a result, our tenants, operators and borrowers may be unable or unwilling to make payments or perform their obligations when due. although we generally have arrangements and other agreements that give us the right under specified circumstances to terminate a lease, evict a tenant or terminate our operator, or demand immediate repayment of outstanding loan amounts or other obligations to us, we may not be able to enforce such rights or we may determine not to do so if we believe that enforcement of our rights would be more detrimental to our business than seeking alternative approaches.
our ccrc segment and our swf sh jv, all of which are under a ridea structure, primarily depend on private sources for their revenues and the ability of their patients and residents to pay fees. costs associated with independent and assisted living services are not generally reimbursable under governmental reimbursement programs such as medicare and medicaid. accordingly, our operators of these properties depend on attracting seniors with appropriate levels of income and assets, which may be affected by many factors, including: (i) prevailing economic and market trends, including general inflationary pressures; (ii) consumer confidence; (iii) demographics; (iv) property condition and safety; (v) public perception about such properties; and (vi) social and environmental factors. consequently, if our operators fail to effectively conduct operations on our behalf, or to maintain and improve our properties, it could adversely affect our business reputation as the owner of the properties, as well as the business reputation of our operators and their ability to attract and retain patients and residents in our properties, which could have a material adverse effect on our and our operators' business, results of operations and financial condition. further, if widespread default or nonpayment of outstanding obligations from a large number of operators occurs at a time when terminating such agreement or replacing such operators may be extremely difficult or impossible, including as a result of the covid pandemic, we may elect instead to amend such agreements with such operators. however, such amendment may be on terms that are less favorable to us than the original agreement and may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.
our ccrc segment and our swf sh jv also rely on reimbursements from governmental programs for a portion of the revenues from certain properties. changes in reimbursement policies and other governmental regulation, such as potential changes to the patient protection and affordable care act, along with the health care and education reconciliation act of 2010 (collectively, the "affordable care act"), that may result from actions by congress or executive orders, may result in reductions in our revenues from our ridea structures, operations and cash flows and affect our financial performance through a ridea structure. in addition, failure to comply with reimbursement regulations or other laws applicable to healthcare providers could result in penalties, fines, litigation costs, lost revenue or other consequences, which could adversely impact our cash flows from operations under a ridea structure.
revenues of our ccrc segment and our swf sh jv are also dependent on a number of other factors, including licensed bed capacity, occupancy, the healthcare needs of residents, the rate of reimbursement, the income and assets of seniors in the regions in which we own properties, and social and environmental factors. for example, due to generally increased vulnerability to illness, covid has resulted in, and another epidemic or pandemic, a severe flu season or any other widespread illness could result in, early move-outs or delayed move-ins during quarantine periods or during periods when actual or perceived risks of such illnesses are heightened, which have reduced, and could continue to reduce, our operators' revenues. additionally, new and evolving payor and provider programs in the united states, including medicare advantage, dual eligible, accountable care organizations, bundled payments and other value-based reimbursement arrangements, have resulted in reduced reimbursement rates, average length of stay and average daily census, particularly for higher acuity patients. if our operators of these properties underperform, our business, results of operations and financial condition would be materially adversely affected.
our tenants and operators have, and may continue to seek to, offset losses by obtaining funds under the cares act or other similar legislative initiatives at the state and local level. receipt of these funds is subject to a detailed application and approval process and in some cases, entails operating restrictions. it is not yet known whether the government funds received by our tenants and operators to date or to be received under any remaining distributions will materially offset the cash flow disruptions experienced by them. if they do not receive sufficient funds to offset their cash flow disruptions, or if the conditions precedent to receiving or retaining these funds are overly burdensome or not feasible, it may substantially affect their ability to make payments or perform their obligations when due to us. see "-our participation in the cares act provider relief fund and other covid-related stimulus and relief programs could subject us to disruptive government and financial audits and investigations, regulatory enforcement actions, civil litigation, and other claims, penalties, and liabilities" below for risks regarding our cares act participation.
increased competition, operating costs and market changes may affect the ability of some of our tenants, operators and borrowers to meet their financial and other contractual obligations to us.
occupancy levels at, and rental income from, our properties are dependent on our ability and the ability of our tenants, operators and borrowers to compete with other tenants and operators on a number of different levels, including the quality of care provided, reputation, price, the range of services offered, the physical appearance of a property, family preference, alternatives for healthcare delivery, the supply of competing properties, physicians, staff, referral sources, location, and the size and demographics of the population in the surrounding area. in addition, our tenants, operators and borrowers face an increasingly competitive labor market, which has been compounded by the covid pandemic. an inability to attract and retain trained personnel could negatively impact the ability of our tenants, operators and borrowers to meet their obligations to us. a shortage of care givers or other trained personnel, union activities, minimum wage laws, or general inflationary pressures on wages may force tenants, operators and borrowers to enhance pay and benefits packages to compete effectively for skilled personnel, or to use more expensive contract personnel, but they may be unable to offset these added costs by increasing the rates charged to residents. any increase in labor costs and other property operating expenses or any failure by our tenants, operators or borrowers to attract and retain qualified personnel could adversely affect our cash flow and have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.
our tenants, operators and borrowers also compete with numerous other companies providing similar healthcare services or alternatives such as home health agencies, life care at home, community-based service programs, retirement communities and convalescent centers. this competition, over-development in some markets in which we invest, covid outbreaks, or the negative public perception that additional outbreaks may occur, has caused the occupancy rate of buildings to slow or decline, and the monthly rate that some properties were able to obtain for their services to decrease. our tenants, operators and borrowers may be unable to achieve and maintain occupancy and rate levels, and to manage their expenses, in a way that will enable them to meet all of their obligations to us. further, many competing companies may have resources and attributes that are superior to those of our tenants, operators and borrowers, which may also allow them to better withstand the impact of covid or other competitive pressures. our tenants, operators and borrowers may encounter increased competition that could limit their ability to maintain or attract residents and employees, to expand their businesses or to manage their expenses, which could materially adversely affect their ability to meet their financial and other contractual obligations to us, potentially decreasing our revenues, impairing our assets and/or increasing collection and dispute costs.
financial deterioration, insolvency or bankruptcy of one or more of our major tenants, operators or borrowers could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.
a downturn in any of our tenants', operators' or borrowers' businesses, including downturns due to the covid pandemic, has led and could continue to lead to voluntary or involuntary bankruptcy or similar insolvency proceedings, including assignment for the benefit of creditors, liquidation, or winding-up. bankruptcy and insolvency laws afford certain rights to a defaulting tenant, operator or borrower that has filed for bankruptcy or reorganization that may render certain of our remedies unenforceable or, at the least, delay our ability to pursue such remedies and realize any related recoveries.
a debtor has the right to assume, or to assume and assign to a third party, or to reject its executory contracts and unexpired leases in a bankruptcy proceeding. if a debtor were to reject its leases with us, obligations under such rejected leases would cease. the claim against the rejecting debtor for remaining rental payments due under the lease would be an unsecured claim, which would be limited by the statutory cap set forth in the u.s. bankruptcy code. this statutory cap may be substantially less than the remaining rent actually owed under the lease. in addition, a debtor may also assert in bankruptcy proceedings that certain leases should be re-characterized as financing agreements, which could result in our being deemed a lender instead of a landlord. a lender's rights and remedies, as compared to a landlord's, generally are materially less favorable, and our rights as a lender may be subordinated to other creditors' rights.
furthermore, the automatic stay provisions of the u.s. bankruptcy code would preclude us from enforcing our remedies unless we first obtain relief from the court having jurisdiction over the bankruptcy case. this would effectively limit or delay our ability to collect unpaid rent or interest payments, and we may ultimately not receive any payment at all. in addition, we would likely be required to fund certain expenses and obligations (e.g., real estate taxes, insurance, debt costs and maintenance expenses) to preserve the value of our properties, avoid the imposition of liens on our properties or transition our properties to a new tenant or operator.
if we are unable to transition affected properties, they would likely experience prolonged operational disruption, leading to lower occupancy rates and further depressed revenues. publicity about the operator's financial condition and insolvency proceeds may also negatively impact their and our reputations, decreasing customer demand and revenues. any or all of these risks could have a material adverse effect on our revenues, results of operations and cash flows. these risks would be magnified where we lease multiple properties to a single operator under a master lease, as an operator failure or default under a master lease would expose us to these risks across multiple properties.
we depend on real estate investments, particularly in the healthcare property sector, making our profitability more vulnerable to a downturn or slowdown in that specific sector than if we were investing in multiple industries and exposing us to the risks inherent in illiquid investments.
we concentrate our investments in the healthcare property sector. a downturn or slowdown in the healthcare property sector, such as the downturn that occurred during the covid pandemic, has had and may continue to have a greater adverse impact on our business than if we had investments in multiple industries and could negatively impact the ability of our tenants, operators and borrowers to meet their obligations to us, as well as the ability to maintain historical rental and occupancy rates, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. in addition, such downturns have had and could continue to have a material adverse effect on the value of our properties and our ability to sell properties at prices or on terms acceptable or favorable to us.
in addition, we are exposed to the risks inherent in concentrating our investments in real estate. our real estate investments are relatively illiquid due to: (i) restrictions on our ability to sell properties under applicable reit tax laws; (ii) other tax-related considerations; (iii) regulatory hurdles; and (iv) market conditions. as a result, we may be unable to recognize full value for any property that we seek to sell for liquidity reasons. our inability to timely respond to investment performance changes could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.
we may have difficulty identifying and securing replacement tenants or operators, and we may be required to incur substantial renovation or tenant improvement costs to make our properties suitable for them.
our tenants may not renew existing leases, and our operators may not renew their management agreements beyond their current terms. if we or our tenants or operators terminate or do not renew the leases or management agreements for our properties, we would attempt to reposition those properties with another tenant or operator. these difficulties may be exacerbated by the covid pandemic, as new operators or tenants may not be willing to take on the increased exposure, especially while active cases are occurring. healthcare properties are typically highly customized, and the improvements generally required to conform a property to healthcare use are costly and at times tenant-specific and are typically subject to regulatory requirements. a new or replacement tenant or operator may require different features in a property, depending on that tenant's or operator's particular business. in addition, infrastructure improvements for life science properties typically are significantly more costly than improvements to other property types due to the highly specialized nature of the properties and the greater lease square footage often required by life science tenants. therefore, if a current tenant or operator is unable to pay rent and/or vacates a property, we may incur substantial expenditures to modify a property and experience delays before we are able to secure another tenant or operator or to accommodate multiple tenants or operators, which may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.
additionally, we may fail to identify suitable replacements or enter into leases, management agreements or other arrangements with new tenants or operators on a timely basis or on terms as favorable to us as our current leases, if at all. furthermore, during transition periods to new tenants or operators, we anticipate that the attention of existing tenants or operators will be diverted from the performance of the properties and there may also be increased errors and delays as a result of the transition, which would cause the financial and operational performance at these properties to decline. following a decline in performance, we may not be able to rehabilitate the property to previous performance levels, which would adversely impact our results of operations. we also may be required to fund certain expenses and obligations, such as real estate taxes, debt costs and maintenance expenses, to preserve the value of, and avoid the imposition of liens on, our properties while they are being repositioned. in addition, we may incur certain obligations and liabilities, including obligations to indemnify the replacement tenant or operator, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.
property development, redevelopment and tenant improvement risks can render a project less profitable or unprofitable and, under certain circumstances, delay or prevent its undertaking or completion.
our healthcare property development, redevelopment, and tenant improvement projects could be canceled, abandoned, or delayed, or, if completed, fail to perform in accordance with expectations, including as a result of the following possibilities:
•we may not proceed with a development or redevelopment project if we are unable to obtain debt and/or equity financing on favorable terms or at all, or if we do not otherwise have the liquidity we deem necessary or appropriate for the project;
•a project may be abandoned after expending significant resources, including due to: (i) legal and regulatory hurdles, including moratoriums on development and redevelopment activities (such as the potential moratorium on office and laboratory buildings in the alewife submarket of boston, massachusetts that the alewife city council is considering) or the failure to obtain necessary zoning, entitlements and permits; or (ii) changes in market and economic conditions, either of which would result in the failure to recover expenses already incurred;
•a project may not be completed on schedule as a result of a variety of factors over which we have limited or no control, including: (i) natural disasters and other catastrophic events; (ii) health crises or other pandemics such as the covid pandemic; (iii) restrictions or moratoriums on development and redevelopment activities; (iv) labor conditions, including a labor shortage or work stoppage; (v) shortages of construction materials; (vi) legal and regulatory hurdles, including necessary permits and entitlements; (vii) environmental conditions at the property; or (viii) civil unrest and acts of war or terrorism; any such delays in project completion would also delay the commencement of rental payments, including increases in rental payments following tenant improvement projects;
•construction or other delays at a project may provide tenants the right to terminate preconstruction leases or cause us to incur additional costs, including through rent abatement;
•project costs could exceed original estimates due to, among other things: (i) increased interest rates; (ii) higher than budgeted costs for materials, transportation, environmental remediation, labor or other inputs, including those caused by a shortage of construction materials or labor; (iii) negligent construction or construction defects; (iv) damage, vandalism or accidents; (v) higher operating costs than we anticipated, including insurance premiums, utilities, real estate taxes, and costs of complying with changes in government regulations or increases in tariffs; (vi) higher requirements for capital improvements than we anticipated for development, redevelopment or tenant improvement projects, particularly in older structures; or (vii) increased costs as a result of unanticipated delay, including delays resulting from the factors noted below;
•demand for a project may decrease prior to completion due to competition or other market and economic conditions, and lease-up rates, rental rates, lease commencement dates and occupancy levels at a development or redevelopment project may fail to meet expectations;
•tenants that have pre-leased at a project may file for bankruptcy or become insolvent, or otherwise elect to terminate their lease prior to delivery; and
•a project may have defects that we do not discover through the inspection processes, including latent defects not discovered until after we put a property in service.
the realization of any of the foregoing risks could result in not achieving our expected returns on investment and have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.
changes within the life science industry may adversely impact our revenues and results of operations.
our life science investments could be adversely affected if the life science industry is impacted by an economic, financial, or banking crisis, a health crisis, such as the covid pandemic, or if the life science industry migrates from the u.s. to other countries or to areas outside of primary life science markets in south san francisco, california, san diego, california, and greater boston, massachusetts. our ability to negotiate contractual rent escalations on future leases and to achieve increases in rental rates will depend upon market conditions and the demand for life science properties at the time the leases are negotiated and the increases are proposed. if economic, financial or industry conditions adversely affect our life science tenants, we may not be able to lease or re-lease our properties in a timely manner or at favorable rates, which would negatively impact our revenues and results of operations. because infrastructure improvements for life science properties typically are significantly more costly than improvements to other property types due to the highly specialized nature of the properties, and life science tenants typically require greater lease square footage relative to medical office tenants, repositioning efforts would have a disproportionate adverse effect on our life science segment performance.
future mergers or consolidations of life science entities could reduce the amount of rentable square footage requirements of our client tenants and prospective client tenants, which may adversely impact our revenues from lease payments and results of operations.
our tenants in the life science industry face high levels of regulation, funding requirements, expense and uncertainty.
the life science industry is subject to volatility, and life science tenants, particularly those involved in developing and marketing pharmaceutical products, are subject to certain risks, including the following:
•significant funding for the research, development, clinical testing, manufacture and commercialization of their products and technologies, as well as to fund their obligations, including rent payments due to us, and our tenants' ability to raise capital depends on the viability of their products and technologies, their financial and operating condition and outlook, and the overall financial, banking and economic environment. if venture capital firms, private investors, the public markets, companies in the life science industry, the government or other sources of funding are difficult to obtain or unavailable to support our tenants' activities, including as a result of general economic conditions, adverse market conditions or government shutdowns that limit our tenants' ability to raise capital, such as those resulting from the covid pandemic, a tenant's business would be adversely affected or could fail;
•the research, development, clinical testing, manufacture and marketing of some of our tenants' products require federal, state and foreign regulatory approvals that may be costly or difficult to obtain, may take several years and be subject to delay, including delays brought on by the covid pandemic, may not be obtained at all, require validation through clinical trials that may face delays or difficulties resulting from the covid pandemic or otherwise, require the use of substantial resources, and may often be unpredictable. if a tenant's products fail to obtain regulatory approvals, a tenant's business would be adversely affected or could fail;
•even after regulatory approval and market acceptance, the product may still present significant regulatory and liability risks, including the possible later discovery of safety concerns and other defects and potential loss of approvals, competition from new products and the expiration of patent protection for the product;
•our tenants with marketable products may be adversely affected by healthcare reform and the reimbursement policies of government or private healthcare payors;
•our tenants with marketable products may be unable to successfully manufacture their drugs economically;
•our tenants depend on the commercial success of certain products, which may be reliant on the efficacy of the product, as well as acceptance among doctors and patients; negative publicity or negative results or safety signals from the clinical trials of competitors may reduce demand or prompt regulatory actions; and
•our tenants may be unable to adapt to the rapid technological advances in the industry and to adequately protect their intellectual property under patent, copyright or trade secret laws and defend against third-party claims of intellectual property violations.
if our tenants' businesses are adversely affected, they may fail to make their rent payments to us, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. if our tenants' businesses fail, or if our tenants fail to make their rent payments to us, we would need to secure replacement tenants. see "-we may have difficulty identifying and securing replacement tenants or operators, and we may be required to incur substantial renovation or tenant improvement costs to make our properties suitable for them" above for risks regarding securing replacement tenants.
the hospitals on whose campuses our mobs are located and their affiliated healthcare systems could fail to remain competitive or financially viable, which could adversely impact their ability to attract physicians and physician groups to our mobs and our other properties that serve the healthcare industry.
the viability of hospitals depends on factors such as: (i) the quality and mix of healthcare services provided; (ii) competition for patients and physicians; (iii) demographic trends in the surrounding community; (iv) market position; and (v) growth potential, as well as the ability of the affiliated healthcare systems to provide economies of scale and access to capital. in addition, in 2020, most hospitals experienced a significant reduction in revenue due to decreased volumes as well as increased costs as they provided care capacity for potential covid patients; there could be additional reductions in revenue in the future if hospitals experience widespread cancellations of elective procedures due to health and safety measures or otherwise. if a hospital whose campus is located near one of our mobs is unable to meet its financial obligations, and if an affiliated healthcare system is unable to support that hospital or goes bankrupt, the hospital may not be able to compete successfully or could be forced to close or relocate, which could adversely impact its ability to attract physicians and other healthcare-related users. because we rely on our proximity to and affiliations with these hospitals to create tenant demand for space in our mobs, their inability to remain competitive or financially viable, or to attract physicians and physician groups, could adversely affect our mob operations and have a material adverse effect on us.
in addition, changes to or replacement of the affordable care act or other reimbursement regulations could result in significant changes to the scope of insurance coverage and reimbursement policies, which could put negative pressure on the operations and revenues of our mobs.
we may be unable to maintain or expand our existing and future hospital and health system client relationships.
we invest significant time in developing relationships with both new and existing hospital and health system clients. if we fail to maintain these relationships, including through a lack of responsiveness, failure to adapt to the current market, or employment of individuals with inadequate experience, our reputation and relationships will be harmed and we may lose business to competitors, which could have a material adverse effect on us.
we assume operational risks with respect to our senior housing properties managed in ridea structures that could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.
as the owner of properties under a ridea structure, our trs is ultimately responsible for all operational risks and other liabilities of the properties, other than those arising out of certain actions by our operator, such as gross negligence or willful misconduct. operational risks include, and our resulting revenues therefore depend on, among other things: (i) occupancy rates; (ii) the entrance fees and rental rates charged to residents; (iii) the requirements of, or changes to, governmental reimbursement programs such as medicare or medicaid, to the extent applicable, including changes to reimbursement rates; (iv) our operators' reputations and ability to attract and retain residents; (v) general economic conditions and market factors that impact seniors, which may be exacerbated by the covid pandemic, including general inflationary pressures; (vi) competition from other senior housing providers; (vii) compliance with federal, state, local and industry-regulated licensure, certification and inspection laws, regulations and standards; (viii) litigation involving our properties or residents/patients, including litigation related to covid; (ix) the availability and cost of general and professional liability insurance coverage or increases in insurance policy deductibles; and (x) the ability to control operating expenses, which have increased and may continue to increase due to the covid pandemic. although the ridea structure gives us certain oversight approval rights (e.g., budgets, material contracts, etc.) and the right to review operational and financial reporting information, our operators are ultimately in control of the day-to-day business of the property. as a result, we have limited rights to direct or influence the business or operations of our properties in the ccrc segment and in the properties owned by our swf sh jv, and we depend on our operators to operate these properties in a manner that complies with applicable law, minimizes legal risk and maximizes the value of our investment. failure by our operators to adequately manage these risks could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.
we are required under ridea to rely on our operators to oversee and direct these aspects of the properties' operations to ensure compliance with applicable laws and regulations. if one or more of our healthcare properties fails to comply with applicable laws and regulations, our trs would be responsible (except in limited circumstances, such as the gross negligence or willful misconduct of our operators, where we would have a contractual claim against them), which could subject our trs to penalties including loss or suspension of licenses, certification or accreditation, exclusion from government healthcare programs (i.e., medicare, medicaid), administrative sanctions and civil monetary penalties. some states also reserve the right to sanction affiliates of a licensee when they take administrative action against the licensee. additionally, when we receive individually identifiable health information relating to residents of our healthcare properties, we are subject to federal and state data privacy and security laws and rules, and could be subject to liability in the event of an audit, complaint, cybersecurity attack or data breach. furthermore, our trs has exposure to professional liability claims that could arise out of resident claims, such as quality of care, and the associated litigation costs.
rents received from the trs in a ridea structure are treated as qualifying rents from real property for reit tax purposes only if (i) they are paid pursuant to a lease of a "qualified healthcare property" and (ii) the operator qualifies as an "eligible independent contractor," as defined in the internal revenue code of 1986, as amended (the "code"). if either of these requirements is not satisfied, then the rents will not be qualifying rents.
economic and other conditions that negatively affect geographic areas from which a greater percentage of our revenue is recognized could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.
we are subject to increased exposure to adverse conditions affecting the geographies in which our properties are located, including: (i) downturns in local economies and increases in unemployment rates; (ii) changes in local real estate conditions, including increases in real estate taxes; (iii) increased competition; (iv) decreased demand; (v) changes in state-specific legislation; and (vi) local climate events and natural disasters and other catastrophic events, such as health pandemics (including the covid pandemic), earthquakes, hurricanes, windstorms, flooding, wildfires and mudslides and other physical climate risks, including water stress and heat stress. these risks could significantly disrupt our businesses in the region, harm our ability to compete effectively, result in increased costs, and divert management attention, any or all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.
in addition, if significant changes in the climate occur in areas where we own property, this could result in extreme weather and changes in precipitation and temperature, all of which could result in physical damage to or a decrease in demand for properties located in these areas or affected by these conditions. if changes in the climate have material effects, such as property destruction, or occur for extended periods, this could have a material adverse effect on business, results of operations and financial condition. in addition, changes in federal, state and local legislation and regulation on climate change could require increased capital expenditures to improve the energy efficiency or resiliency of our existing properties and could also cause increased costs for our new developments without a corresponding increase in revenue.
uninsured or underinsured losses could result in a significant loss of capital invested in a property, lower than expected future revenues, and unanticipated expense.
our insurance coverage does not include damages from business interruptions, loss of revenue or earnings or any related effects caused by health pandemics, including the covid pandemic. we may incur significant out-of-pocket costs associated with legal proceedings or other claims from residents and patients at our properties that relate to the covid pandemic.
generally, insurance coverage for health pandemics has not previously been readily available and, if and when it does become available, may not be on commercially reasonable terms. further, even if such coverage is available on commercially reasonable terms, we cannot assure you that we would receive insurance proceeds that will compensate us fully for our liabilities, costs and expenses in the event of a health pandemic. in addition, a large number of our properties are located in areas exposed to earthquakes, hurricanes, windstorms, flooding, water stress, heat stress and other common natural disasters and physical climate risks. in particular, (i) a significant portion of our life science development projects and approximately 67% of our life science portfolio (based on gross asset value as of december 31, 2021) was concentrated in california, which is known to be subject to earthquakes, wildfires and other natural disasters, and (ii) approximately 69% of our ccrc portfolio (based on gross asset value as of december 31, 2021) was concentrated in florida, which is known to be subject to hurricanes. while we maintain insurance coverage for earthquakes, fires, hurricanes, windstorms, floods and other natural disasters and physical climate risks, we may be unable to purchase the limits and terms we desire on a commercially reasonable basis. in addition, there are certain exposures for which we do not purchase insurance because we do not believe it is economically feasible to do so or there is no viable insurance market. we maintain earthquake insurance for our properties that are located in the vicinity of active earthquake zones in amounts and with deductibles we believe are commercially reasonable. because of our significant concentration in the seismically active regions of south san francisco, california and san diego, california, a damaging earthquake in these areas could significantly impact multiple properties, which may amount to a significant portion of our life science portfolio. similarly, a damaging hurricane in florida could significantly impact multiple properties, which may amount to a significant portion of our ccrc portfolio. as a result, aggregate deductible amounts may be material, and our insurance coverage may be materially insufficient to cover our losses, either of which would adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
if one of our properties experiences a loss that is uninsured or that exceeds policy coverage limits, we could lose our investment in the damaged property as well as the anticipated future cash flows from such property. if the damaged property is subject to recourse indebtedness, we could continue to be liable for the indebtedness even if the property is irreparably damaged. in addition, even if damage to our properties is covered by insurance, a disruption of business caused by a casualty event may result in loss of revenues for us. any business interruption insurance may not fully compensate the lender or us for such loss of revenue. our ccrc and senior housing operators also face various forms of class-action lawsuits from time to time, such as wage and hour and consumer rights actions, which generally are not covered by insurance. these class actions could result in significant defense costs, as well as settlements or verdicts that materially decrease anticipated revenues from a property and can result in the loss of a portion or all of our invested capital.
our use of joint ventures may limit our returns on and our flexibility with jointly owned investments.
we have and may continue to develop, acquire and/or recapitalize properties in joint ventures with other persons or entities when circumstances warrant the use of these structures. our participation in joint ventures is subject to risks that may not be present with other methods of ownership, including:
•our joint venture partners could have investment and financing goals that are inconsistent with our objectives, including the timing, terms and strategies for any investments, and what levels of debt to incur or carry;
•because we do not have sole decision-making authority, we could experience an impasse on certain decisions, including budget approvals, acquisitions, sales of assets, debt financing, execution of lease agreements, and vendor approvals, which impasses could result in delayed decisions and missed opportunities and could require us to expend additional resources on resolving such impasses or potential disputes, including litigation or arbitration;
•our joint venture partners may have competing interests in our markets that could create conflicts of interest;
•our ability to transfer our interest in a joint venture to a third party may be restricted and the market for our interest may be limited and/or valued lower than fair market value;
•our joint venture partners may be structured differently than us for tax purposes, and this could create conflicts of interest and risks to our reit status; and
•our joint venture partners might become insolvent, fail to fund their share of required capital contributions or fail to fulfill their obligations as a joint venture partner, which may require us to infuse our own capital into the venture on behalf of the partner despite other competing uses for such capital.
with respect to our joint ventures, we may be limited in our ability to control or influence operations, and in our ability to exit or transfer our interest in the joint venture to a third party. as a result, we may not receive full value for our ownership interest if we tried to sell it to a third party. in addition, in some instances, we and/or our joint venture partner will have the right to cause us to sell our interest, or acquire our partner's interest, at a time when we otherwise would not have initiated such a transaction. our ability to acquire our partner's interest will be limited if we do not have sufficient cash, available borrowing capacity or other capital resources. this would require us to sell our interest in the joint venture when we would otherwise prefer to retain it. any of the foregoing risks could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.
rent escalators or contingent rent provisions in our leases could hinder our profitability and growth.
we derive a significant portion of our revenues from leasing properties pursuant to leases that generally provide for fixed rental rates, subject to annual escalations. if strong economic conditions result in increases in the consumer price index in excess of the annual escalations, our growth and profitability may be limited.
under certain leases, a portion of the tenant's rental payment to us is based on the property's revenues (i.e., contingent rent). if, as a result of weak economic conditions or other factors that may be outside of our control, the property's revenue declines, our rental revenues would decrease and our results of operations could be materially adversely affected.
additionally, some of our leases provide that annual rent is modified based on changes in the consumer price index or other thresholds (i.e., contingent rent escalators). if the consumer price index does not increase or other applicable thresholds are not met, rental rates may not increase as anticipated or at all, which could hinder our profitability and growth. furthermore, if strong economic conditions result in significant increases in the consumer price index, but the escalations under our leases with contingent rent escalators are capped or the increase in the consumer price index exceeds our tenants' ability to pay, our growth and profitability also may be limited.
competition may make it difficult to identify and purchase, or develop, suitable healthcare properties to grow our investment portfolio, to finance acquisitions on favorable terms, or to retain or attract tenants and operators.
we face significant competition from other reits, investment companies, private equity and hedge fund investors, sovereign funds, healthcare operators, lenders, developers and other institutional investors, some of whom may have greater resources and lower costs of capital than we do. increased competition and resulting capitalization rate compression make it more challenging for us to identify and successfully capitalize on opportunities that meet our business goals and could improve the bargaining power of property owners seeking to sell, thereby impeding our investment, acquisition and development activities. similarly, our properties face competition for tenants and operators from other properties in the same market, which may affect our ability to attract and retain tenants and operators, or may reduce the rents we are able to charge. if we cannot capitalize on our development pipeline, identify and purchase a sufficient quantity of healthcare properties at favorable prices, finance acquisitions on commercially favorable terms, or attract and retain profitable tenants and operators, our business, results of operations and financial condition may be materially adversely affected.
we may be unable to successfully foreclose on the collateral securing our real estate-related loans, and even if we are successful in our foreclosure efforts, we may be unable to successfully operate, occupy or reposition the underlying real estate, which may adversely affect our ability to recover our investments.
if a borrower defaults under one of our mortgages or mezzanine loans, we may have to foreclose on the loan or take additional actions, including acquiring title to the collateral via statutory or judicial foreclosure or commencing collection litigation. we may determine that substantial improvements or repairs to the property are necessary in order to maximize the property's investment potential. in some cases, because our collateral consists of the equity interests in an entity that directly or indirectly owns the applicable real property or interests in other operating properties, we may not have full recourse with respect to assets of that entity, or that entity may have incurred unexpected liabilities, either of which would preclude us from fully recovering our investment. borrowers may contest enforcement of foreclosure or other remedies, seek bankruptcy protection against our exercise of enforcement or other remedies and/or bring claims for lender liability in response to actions to enforce mortgage obligations. foreclosure or collections-related costs, high loan-to-value ratios or declines in the value of the property may prevent us from realizing an amount equal to our mortgage or mezzanine loan balance upon foreclosure or conclusion of litigation, and we may be required to record a valuation allowance for such losses. even if we are able to successfully foreclose on the collateral securing our real estate-related loans, we may inherit properties for which we may be unable to expeditiously secure tenants or operators, if at all, or we may acquire equity interests that we are unable to immediately resell or otherwise liquidate due to limitations under the securities laws, either of which would adversely affect our ability to fully recover our investment.
from time to time we have made, and we may seek to make, one or more material acquisitions, which may involve the expenditure of significant funds.
we regularly review potential transactions in order to maximize stockholder value. our review process may require significant management attention and a potential transaction could be abandoned or rejected by us or the other parties involved after we expend significant resources and time. in addition, future acquisitions may require the issuance of securities, incurrence of debt, assumption of contingent liabilities or incurrence of significant expenditures, each of which could materially adversely impact our business, financial condition or results of operations. in addition, the financing required for acquisitions may not be available on commercially favorable terms or at all.
if we are unable to successfully integrate our acquisitions, our business, results of operations and financial condition may be materially adversely affected.
successful integration of acquired companies depends primarily on our ability to consolidate operations, systems, procedures, properties and personnel, and to eliminate redundancies and reduce costs. we may encounter difficulties in these integrations. potential difficulties associated with acquisitions include: (i) our ability to effectively monitor and manage our expanded portfolio of properties; (ii) the loss of key employees; (iii) the disruption of our ongoing business or that of the acquired entity; (iv) possible inconsistencies in standards, controls, procedures and policies; and (v) the assumption of unexpected liabilities, including:
•liabilities relating to the cleanup or remediation of undisclosed environmental conditions;
•unasserted claims of vendors, residents, patients or other persons dealing with the seller;
•liabilities, claims and litigation, whether or not incurred in the ordinary course of business, relating to periods prior to our acquisition;
•claims for indemnification by general partners, directors, officers and others indemnified by the seller;
•claims for return of government reimbursement payments; and
•liabilities for taxes relating to periods prior to our acquisition.
in addition, acquired companies and their properties may fail to perform as expected, including in respect of estimated cost savings. inaccurate assumptions regarding future rental or occupancy rates could result in overly optimistic estimates of future revenues. similarly, we may underestimate future operating expenses or the costs necessary to bring properties up to standards established for their intended use or for property improvements.
if we have difficulties with any of these areas, or if we later discover additional liabilities or experience unforeseen costs relating to our acquired companies, we may not achieve the anticipated economic benefits from our acquisitions, and this may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.
unfavorable litigation resolution or disputes could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and that of our tenants, operators and borrowers, and we and our tenants, operators and borrowers may experience rising liability and insurance costs.
our tenants, operators and borrowers are from time to time parties to litigation, including disputes regarding the quality of care at healthcare properties. the effect of litigation may materially increase the costs incurred by our tenants, operators and borrowers, including costs to monitor and report quality of care compliance. in addition, the cost of professional liability, medical malpractice, property, business interruption, and insurance policies that may provide only partial coverage for covid and other environmental or infectious disease outbreaks, epidemics and pandemics can be significant and may increase or not be available at a reasonable cost or at all. cost increases could cause our tenants and borrowers to be unable to make their lease or mortgage payments or fail to purchase the appropriate liability and malpractice insurance, or cause our borrowers to be unable to meet their obligations to us, potentially decreasing our revenues and increasing our collection and litigation costs. furthermore, with respect to our ccrc properties and the properties in our swf sh jv, all of which are operated in ridea structures, we directly bear the costs of any such increases in litigation, monitoring, reporting and insurance due to our direct exposure to the cash flows of such properties.
from time to time, we are involved in legal proceedings, lawsuits and other claims. we may also be named as defendants in lawsuits arising out of our alleged actions or the alleged actions of our tenants and operators for which such tenants and operators have agreed to indemnify us. furthermore, we could experience a material increase in legal proceedings, lawsuits and other claims related to the covid pandemic. unfavorable resolution of any such litigation or negative publicity as a result of such litigation may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. regardless of the outcome, litigation or other legal proceedings may result in substantial costs, disruption of our normal business operations, and the diversion of management attention. we may be unable to prevail in, or achieve a favorable settlement of, any pending or future legal action against us.
in particular, as a result of our ownership of healthcare properties, we may be named as a defendant in lawsuits arising from the alleged actions of our tenants or operators. with respect to our triple-net leases, our tenants generally have agreed to indemnify us for various claims, litigation and liabilities in connection with their leasing and operation of our triple-net leased properties. however, if any tenant fails to indemnify us pursuant to the terms of its agreement with us, we would have to incur the costs that should have been covered by the tenant and to determine whether to expend additional resources to seek the contractually owed indemnity from that tenant, including potentially through litigation or arbitration. in some instances, we may decide not to enforce our indemnification rights if we believe that enforcement of such rights would be more detrimental to our business than alternative approaches. regardless, such an event would divert management attention and may result in a disruption to our normal business operations, any or all of which could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition.
with respect to our ridea structured properties, we are responsible for these claims, litigation and liabilities, with limited indemnification rights against our operator typically based on the gross negligence or willful misconduct by the operator. although our leases provide us with certain information rights with respect to our tenants, one or more of our tenants may be or become party to pending litigation or investigation of which we are unaware or in which we do not have a right to participate or evaluate. in such cases, we would be unable to determine the potential impact of such litigation or investigation on our tenants or our business or results. moreover, negative publicity of any of our operators' or tenants' litigation, other legal proceedings or investigations may also negatively impact their and our reputation, resulting in lower customer demand and revenues, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flow.
risks related to our capital structure and market conditions an increase in our borrowing costs could materially adversely impact our ability to refinance existing debt, sell properties and conduct acquisition, investment and development activities, and could cause our stock price to decline.
an increase in our borrowing costs reduces the amount investors are willing to pay for our common stock. because reit stocks are often perceived as high-yield investments, investors may perceive less relative benefit to owning reit stocks as borrowing costs increase.
additionally, we have existing debt obligations that have variable interest rates and related payments that vary with the movement of certain indices. if interest rates increase, so would our interest costs for any variable rate debt and for new debt. this increased cost would make the financing of any acquisition and development activity more costly. in addition, an increase in interest rates could decrease the amount third parties are willing to pay for our properties, thereby limiting our ability to reposition our portfolio promptly in response to changes in economic or other conditions.
rising borrowing costs could limit our ability to refinance existing debt when it matures, or cause us to pay higher interest rates upon refinancing and increase interest expense on refinanced indebtedness. if our prevailing borrowing costs are higher than the interest rates of our senior notes at their maturity, we will incur additional interest expense upon any replacement debt.
we manage a portion of our exposure to interest rate risk by accessing debt with staggered maturities and through the use of derivative instruments, primarily interest rate cap and swap agreements. these agreements involve risk, including that counterparties may fail to honor their obligations under these arrangements, that these arrangements may not be effective in reducing our exposure to interest rate changes, that the amount of income we earn from hedging transactions may be limited by federal tax provisions governing reits and that these arrangements may cause us to incur higher debt service costs than would otherwise be the case. failure to hedge effectively against interest rate risk could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.
cash available for distribution to stockholders may be insufficient to make dividend distributions at expected levels and are made at the discretion of our board of directors.
decreases in cash available for distributions, including decreases related to the covid pandemic, may result in us being unable to make dividend distributions at expected levels. our failure to make distributions commensurate with market expectations would likely result in a decrease in the market price of our common stock. further, all distributions are made at the discretion of our board of directors in accordance with maryland law and depend on: (i) our earnings; (ii) our financial condition; (iii) debt and equity capital available to us; (iv) our expectations for future capital requirements and operating performance; (v) restrictive covenants in our financial or other contractual arrangements, including those in our credit facility agreement; (vi) maintenance of our reit qualification; and (vii) other factors as our board of directors may deem relevant from time to time.
if access to external capital is unavailable on acceptable terms or at all, it could have a material adverse effect on our ability to meet commitments as they become due or make future investments necessary to grow our business.
we may be unable to fund all future capital needs, including capital expenditures, debt maturities and other commitments, from cash retained from operations and dispositions. if we are unable to obtain enough internal capital, we may need to rely on external sources of capital (including debt and equity financing) to fulfill our capital requirements, which depends upon a number of factors, some of which we have little or no control over, including:
•general availability of capital, including less favorable terms, rising interest rates and increased borrowing costs;
•the market price of the shares of our equity securities and the credit ratings of our debt and any preferred securities we may issue;
•the market's perception of our growth potential and our current and potential future earnings and cash distributions;
•our degree of financial leverage and operational flexibility;
•the financial integrity of our lenders, which might impair their ability to meet their commitments to us or their willingness to make additional loans to us, and our inability to replace the financing commitment of any such lender on favorable terms, or at all;
•the stability of the market value of our properties;
•the financial performance and general market perception of our tenants and operators;
•changes in the credit ratings on u.s. government debt securities or default or delay in payment by the united states of its obligations;
•issues facing the healthcare industry, including healthcare reform, changes in government reimbursement policies and the unique challenges posed by the covid pandemic; and
•the performance of the national and global economies generally, including any economic downturn and volatility in the financial markets as a result of the covid pandemic.
if access to capital is unavailable on acceptable terms or at all, it could have a material adverse impact on our ability to fund operations, repay or refinance our debt obligations, fund dividend payments, acquire properties and make the investments in development and redevelopment activities, as well as capital expenditures, needed to grow our business.
our level of indebtedness may increase and materially adversely affect our future operations.
our outstanding indebtedness as of december 31, 2021 was approximately $6.2 billion. we may incur additional indebtedness, which may be substantial. any significant additional indebtedness would likely negatively affect the credit ratings of our debt and require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow to interest and principal payments. greater demands on our cash resources may reduce funds available to us to pay dividends, conduct development activities, make capital expenditures and acquisitions, or carry out other aspects of our business strategy. increased indebtedness can also make us more vulnerable to general adverse economic and industry conditions and create competitive disadvantages for us compared to other companies with comparatively lower debt levels. increased future debt service obligations may limit our operational flexibility, including our ability to finance or refinance our properties, contribute properties to joint ventures or sell properties as needed.
covenants in our debt instruments limit our operational flexibility, and breaches of these covenants could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.
the terms of our current secured and unsecured debt instruments require us to comply with a number of customary financial and other covenants, such as maintaining leverage ratios, minimum tangible net worth requirements, reit status and certain levels of debt service coverage. our continued ability to incur additional debt and to conduct business in general is subject to compliance with these covenants, which limits our operational flexibility. for example, mortgages on our properties contain customary covenants such as those that limit or restrict our ability, without the consent of the lender, to further encumber or sell the applicable properties, or to replace the applicable tenant or operator. breaches of certain covenants may result in defaults under the mortgages on our properties and cross-defaults under certain of our other indebtedness, even if we satisfy our payment obligations to the respective obligee. covenants that limit our operational flexibility as well as defaults resulting from the breach of any of these covenants could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.
volatility, disruption or uncertainty in the financial markets may impair our ability to raise capital, obtain new financing or refinance existing obligations and fund real estate and development activities.
increased or prolonged market disruption, volatility or uncertainty, including disruption caused by the covid pandemic, could materially adversely impact our ability to raise capital, obtain new financing or refinance our existing obligations as they mature, and fund real estate and development activities. for example, as a result of the potential or perceived impact of the pandemic on our business, lenders and other financial institutions could require us to agree to more restrictive covenants, grant liens on our assets as collateral and/or accept other terms that are not commercially beneficial to us in order to obtain financing. one or more of our lenders under our credit facility could refuse or fail to fund their financing commitment to us as a result of lender liquidity and/or viability challenges, which financing commitments we may not be able to replace on favorable terms, or at all. market volatility could also lead to significant uncertainty in the valuation of our investments and those of our joint ventures, which may result in a substantial decrease in the value of our properties and those of our joint ventures. as a result, we may be unable to recover the carrying amount of such investments and the associated goodwill, if any, which may require us to recognize impairment charges in earnings.
risks related to the regulatory environment laws or regulations prohibiting eviction of our tenants, even on a temporary basis, could have a material adverse effect on our revenues if our tenants fail to make their contractual rent payments to us.
various federal, state and local governments have enacted, and may continue to enact, laws, regulations and moratoriums or take other actions that could limit our ability to evict tenants until such laws, regulations or moratoriums are reversed or lifted. in particular, many state and local governments have implemented eviction moratoriums as a result of the covid pandemic that apply to both residential and commercial tenants. although many of these moratoriums have been temporary in nature to date, and may have expired, they may be revised, reinstated and/or extended for a significant period of time until the covid pandemic subsides. although we generally have arrangements and other agreements that give us the right under specified circumstances to terminate a lease or evict a tenant for nonpayment of contractual rent, such laws, regulations and moratoriums may prohibit our ability to begin eviction proceedings even where no rent or only partial rent is being paid for so long as such law, regulation or moratorium remains in effect. further, under current laws and regulations, eviction proceedings for delinquent tenants are already costly and time-consuming, and, if there are existing backlogs or backlogs develop in courts due to higher than normal eviction proceedings, whether or not due to an increase in eviction proceedings after the covid pandemic, we may incur significant costs and it may take a significant amount of time to ultimately evict any tenant who is not meeting their contractual rent obligations. if we are restricted, delayed or prohibited from evicting tenants for failing to make contractual rent payments, our business, results of operations and financial condition may be materially adversely impacted.
tenants, operators and borrowers that fail to comply with federal, state, local and international laws and regulations, including resident health and safety requirements, as well as licensure, certification and inspection requirements, may cease to operate or be unable to meet their financial and other contractual obligations to us.
our tenants, operators and borrowers in all of our segments are subject to or impacted by extensive, frequently changing federal, state and local laws and regulations. see "item 1-business-government regulation, licensing and enforcement-healthcare licensure and certificate of need" for a discussion of certain of these laws and regulations. our tenants', operators' or borrowers' failure to comply with any of the laws, regulations or requirements applicable to them could result in: (i) loss of accreditation; (ii) denial of reimbursement; (iii) imposition of fines; (iv) suspension or decertification from government healthcare programs; (v) civil liability; and (vi) in certain instances, criminal penalties, loss of license or closure of the property and/or the incurrence of considerable costs arising from an investigation or regulatory action, which may have an adverse effect on properties that we own and lease to a third party tenant in our life science and mob segments, that we own and operate through a ridea structure in our ccrc segment or our swf sh jv, or on which we hold a mortgage, and therefore may materially adversely impact us.
required regulatory approvals can delay or prohibit transfers of our senior housing properties.
transfers of senior housing properties, including ccrcs, to successor owners or operators are typically subject to regulatory approvals or ratifications, including change of ownership approvals for licensure and medicare / medicaid (if applicable) that are not required for transfers of other types of commercial operations and other types of real estate. the sale of, or replacement of any operator at, our ccrc and senior housing facilities could be delayed by the regulatory approval process of any federal, state or local government agency necessary for the transfer of the property or the replacement of the operator licensed to manage the property, during which time the property may experience performance declines. the continuing effects of the covid pandemic may materially delay necessary approvals, thereby lengthening the period of performance deterioration, which could have a material adverse effect of our business, results of operations and financial condition. we may also elect to use an interim licensing structure to facilitate such transfers, which structure expedites the transfer by allowing a third party to operate under our license until the required regulatory approvals are obtained but could subject us to fines or penalties if the third party fails to comply with applicable laws and regulations and then fails to indemnify us for such fines or penalties pursuant to the terms of its agreement with us.
compliance with the americans with disabilities act and fire, safety and other regulations may require us to make expenditures that adversely affect our cash flows.
our properties must comply with applicable ada and any similar state and local laws. these laws may require removal of barriers to access by persons with disabilities in public areas of our properties. noncompliance could result in the incurrence of additional costs associated with bringing the properties into compliance, the imposition of fines or an award of damages to private litigants in individual lawsuits or as part of a class action. while the tenants to whom we lease our properties are obligated to comply with the ada and similar state and local provisions, and typically under tenant leases are obligated to cover costs associated with compliance, if required changes involve greater expenditures than anticipated, or if the changes must be made on a more accelerated basis than anticipated, the ability of these tenants to cover costs could be adversely affected. as a result, we could be required to expend funds to comply with the provisions of the ada and similar state and local laws on behalf of tenants, which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. additionally, with respect to the properties owned by our swf sh jv under a ridea structures, the swf sh jv is ultimately responsible for such litigation and compliance costs, and at our ccrcs, we are responsible for such litigation and compliance costs.
in addition, we are required to operate our properties in compliance with fire and safety regulations, building codes and other land use regulations. new and revised regulations and codes may be adopted by governmental agencies and bodies and become applicable to our properties. for example, new safety laws for senior housing properties were adopted following the particularly damaging 2018 hurricane season. compliance could require substantial capital expenditures, both for significant upgrades and for tenant relocations that may be necessary depending on the scope and duration of upgrades, and may restrict our ability to renovate our properties. these expenditures and restrictions could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and cash flows.
the requirements of, or changes to, governmental reimbursement programs such as medicare or medicaid may adversely affect our tenants', operators' and borrowers' ability to meet their financial and other contractual obligations to us.
certain of our tenants, operators and borrowers are affected, directly or indirectly, by a complex set of federal, state and local laws and regulations pertaining to governmental reimbursement programs, including the cares act and other similar relief legislation enacted as a result of the covid pandemic. these laws and regulations are subject to frequent and substantial changes that are sometimes applied retroactively. see "item 1-business-government regulation, licensing and enforcement." for example, to the extent that our tenants, operators or borrowers receive a significant portion of their revenues from governmental payors, primarily medicare and medicaid, they are generally subject to, among other things:
•statutory and regulatory changes;
•retroactive rate adjustments;
•recovery of program overpayments or set-offs;
•federal, state and local litigation and enforcement actions;
•administrative proceedings;
•policy interpretations;
•payment or other delays by fiscal intermediaries or carriers;
•government funding restrictions (at a program level or with respect to specific properties);
•reduced reimbursement rates under managed care contracts;
•interruption or delays in payments due to any ongoing governmental investigations and audits at such properties; and
•reputational harm of publicly disclosed enforcement actions, audits or investigations related to billing and reimbursements.
the failure to comply with the extensive laws, regulations and other requirements applicable to their business and the operation of our properties could result in, among other challenges: (i) becoming ineligible to receive reimbursement from governmental reimbursement programs, including under the cares act; (ii) becoming subject to prepayment reviews or claims for overpayments; (iii) bans on admissions of new patients or residents; (iv) civil or criminal penalties; and (v) significant operational changes, including requirements to increase staffing or the scope of care given to residents. these laws and regulations are enforced by a variety of federal, state and local agencies and can also be enforced by private litigants through, among other things, federal and state false claims acts, which allow private litigants to bring qui tam or "whistleblower" actions.
we are unable to predict future changes to or interpretations of federal, state and local statutes and regulations, including the medicare and medicaid statutes and regulations, or the intensity of enforcement efforts with respect to such statutes and regulations. any changes in the regulatory framework or the intensity or extent of governmental or private enforcement actions could have a material adverse effect on our tenants and operators.
sometimes, governmental payors freeze or reduce payments to healthcare providers, or provide annual reimbursement rate increases that are smaller than expected, due to budgetary and other pressures. in addition, the federal government periodically makes changes in the statutes and regulations relating to medicare and medicaid reimbursement that may impact state reimbursement programs, particularly medicaid reimbursement and managed care payments. we cannot make any assessment as to the ultimate timing or the effect that any future changes may have on our tenants', operators' and borrowers' costs of doing business and on the amount of reimbursement by government and other third-party payors. the failure of any of our tenants, operators or borrowers to comply with these laws and regulations, and significant limits on the scope of services reimbursed, reductions in reimbursement rates and fees, or increases in provider or similar types of taxes, could materially adversely affect their ability to meet their financial and contractual obligations to us.
furthermore, executive orders and legislation may amend the affordable care act and related regulations in whole or in part. we also anticipate that congress, state legislatures, and third-party payors may continue to review and assess alternative healthcare delivery and payment systems and may propose and adopt legislation or policy changes or implementations effecting additional fundamental changes in the healthcare system. for example, the department of health and human services has focused on tying medicare payments to quality or value through alternative payment models, which generally aim to make providers attentive to the total costs of treatments. medicare no longer reimburses hospitals for care related to certain preventable adverse events and imposes payment reductions on hospitals for preventable readmissions. these punitive approaches could be expanded to additional types of providers in the future. additionally, the patient driven payment model utilized by the centers for medicare and medicaid services to calculate reimbursement rates for patients in skilled nursing properties (which is among the unit types in our ccrcs) could result in decreases in payments to our operators and tenants or increase our operators' and tenants' costs. if any such changes significantly and adversely affect our tenants' profitability, they could in turn negatively affect our tenants' ability and willingness to comply with the terms of their leases with us and/or renew their leases with us upon expiration, which could impact our business, prospects, financial condition or results of operations.
legislation to address federal government operations and administration decisions affecting the centers for medicare and medicaid services could have a material adverse effect on our tenants', operators' and borrowers' liquidity, financial condition or results of operations.
congressional consideration of legislation pertaining to the federal debt ceiling, the affordable care act, tax reform, and entitlement programs, including reimbursement rates for physicians, could have a material adverse effect on our tenants', operators' and borrowers' liquidity, financial condition or results of operations. in particular, reduced funding for entitlement programs such as medicare and medicaid would result in increased costs and fees for programs such as medicare advantage plans and additional reductions in reimbursements to providers. amendments to the affordable care act in whole or in part and decisions by the centers for medicare and medicaid services could impact the delivery of services and benefits under medicare, medicaid or medicare advantage plans and could affect our tenants and operators and the manner in which they are reimbursed by such programs. any such material adverse effect on our tenants, operators or borrowers could adversely affect their ability to satisfy their obligations to us and could have a material adverse effect on us.
our participation in the cares act provider relief fund and other covid-related stimulus and relief programs could subject us to disruptive government and financial audits and investigations, regulatory enforcement actions, civil litigation, and other claims, penalties, and liabilities.
under the cares act and subsequent relief legislation, congress has allocated more than $178 billion to eligible hospitals, physicians, and other health care providers through the public health and social services emergency fund (the "provider relief fund" or "prf"). the u.s. department of health and human services ("hhs") has distributed prf awards through various general and targeted distributions, including certain distributions that were paid automatically to providers, and others that required providers to submit requested data or applications. we and our senior housing operators (including operators of senior housing facilities that we have subsequently disposed of) have received funds through several prf distributions, both via automatic payments and also as a result of applications or other filings we submitted for prf funds.
prf funds are intended to reimburse eligible providers for unreimbursed health care-related expenses and lost revenues attributable to covid and must be used only to prevent, prepare for or respond to covid. prf funds received under certain targeted distributions, including the nursing home infection control distribution, are further limited to specific uses. additionally, the prf program imposes certain distribution-specific eligibility criteria and requires recipients to comply with various terms and conditions. hhs has stated that compliance with prf program terms and conditions is material to hhs's decision to disburse prf payments to recipients. prf program terms and conditions include limitations and requirements governing use of prf funds, implementation of controls, retention of records relating to prf funds, audit and reporting to governmental authorities, and other prf program requirements. prf regulatory guidance regarding eligibility, use of funds, audit, reporting, and other prf terms and conditions continues to evolve and there is a high degree of uncertainty surrounding interpretation and implementation, particularly among more complex corporate, transactional and contractual relationships, including ridea structures and for organizations with multiple recipient subsidiaries. in addition, in light of the evolving laws and guidance related to prf, there is no assurance that prf guidance will not change in ways that adversely impact the prf funding we receive, our ability to retain prf funding, or our eligibility to participate in the prf program.
changing prf program requirements could reduce the amount of prf funds we receive or are permitted to retain and could render us or our operators ineligible for future or previously received prf funds. prf reporting obligations and monitoring and compliance efforts could impose substantial costs, become overly burdensome and require significant attention from leadership, disrupting our business and impeding our operations. further, our current and former operators may not consistently use, account for or document prf and other relief funds, which may adversely impact availability of data and consistency in our reporting, including among current and former operators and across reporting periods. ultimately, as prf program requirements continue to evolve, we may determine that we are unable to comply with certain terms and conditions, or that we are no longer eligible for some or all of the prf payments we or our operators previously received. if we are unable to fully comply with applicable prf terms and conditions, we may be required to return some or all prf funds received and may be subject to further enforcement action.
due to our and our operators' participation in the prf program, we may be subject to government and other audits and investigations related to our receipt and use of prf funds. these audits and investigations also may impose substantial costs and disruptions. if the government determines that we failed to comply with prf terms and conditions, related interpretative guidance or applicable federal award requirements, or that our prf applications and submissions were defective, prf funds that we or our operators have received may be subject to recoupment and further enforcement actions could result. this could occur even if our interpretation of prf program requirements was reasonable under the present or then-existing prf guidance. government audits and investigations also could result in other regulatory penalties or enforcement actions, including actions under the false claims act ("fca"), which prohibits false claims for payments to, or improper retention of overpayments from, the government. fca litigation could be asserted directly by the federal government, or on its behalf by private litigants as "whistleblowers." even if not meritorious, fca litigation could impose significant costs and result in reputational damage and a disruption of our business.
risks related to other events we are subject to certain provisions of maryland law and our charter relating to business combinations that may prevent a transaction that may otherwise be in the interest of our stockholders.
the maryland business combination act (the "mbca") provides that unless exempted, a maryland corporation may not engage in business combinations, including a merger, consolidation, share exchange or, in circumstances specified in the statute, an asset transfer or issuance or reclassification of equity securities with an "interested stockholder" or an affiliate of an interested stockholder for five years after the most recent date on which the interested stockholder became an interested stockholder, and thereafter unless specified criteria are met. an interested stockholder is generally a person owning or controlling, directly or indirectly, 10% or more of the voting power of the outstanding voting stock of a maryland corporation. unless our board of directors takes action to exempt us from the mbca, it will be applicable to business combinations between us and other persons. in addition to the restrictions on business combinations contained in the mbca, our charter also requires that, except in certain circumstances, "business combinations," including a merger or consolidation, and certain asset transfers and issuances of securities, with a "related person," including a beneficial owner of 10% or more of our outstanding voting stock, be approved by the affirmative vote of the holders of at least 90% of our outstanding voting stock. these restrictions on business combinations may delay, defer or prevent a change of control or other transaction even if such transaction involves a premium price for our common stock or our stockholders believe that such transaction is otherwise in their best interests.
environmental compliance costs and liabilities associated with our real estate-related investments may be substantial and may materially impair the value of those investments.
federal, state and local laws, ordinances and regulations may require us, as a current or previous owner of real estate, to investigate and clean up certain hazardous or toxic substances released at a property. we may be held liable to a governmental entity or to third parties for injury or property damage and for investigation and cleanup costs incurred in connection with the contamination. the costs of cleanup and remediation could be substantial. in addition, some environmental laws create a lien on the contaminated site in favor of the government for damages and the costs it incurs in connection with the contamination, and/or impose fines and penalties on the property owner with respect to such contamination.
although we currently carry environmental insurance on our properties in an amount that we believe is commercially reasonable and generally require our tenants and operators to indemnify us for environmental liabilities they cause, such liabilities could exceed the amount of our insurance, the financial ability of the tenant or operator to indemnify us, or the value of the contaminated property. as the owner of a site, we may also be held liable to third parties for damages and injuries resulting from environmental contamination emanating from the site. we may also experience environmental costs and liabilities arising from conditions not known to us or disrupted during development. the cost of defending against these claims, complying with environmental regulatory requirements, conducting remediation of any contaminated property, or paying personal injury or other claims or fines could be substantial and could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. in addition, the presence of contamination or the failure to remediate contamination may materially adversely affect our ability to use, develop, sell or lease the property or to borrow using the property as collateral.
risks related to tax, including reit-related risks loss of our tax status as a reit would substantially reduce our available funds and would have materially adverse consequences for us and the value of our common stock.
qualification as a reit involves the application of numerous highly technical and complex provisions of the code, for which there are limited judicial and administrative interpretations, as well as the determination of various factual matters and circumstances not entirely within our control. we intend to continue to operate in a manner that enables us to qualify as a reit. however, our qualification and taxation as a reit depend upon our ability to meet, through actual annual operating results, asset diversification, distribution levels and diversity of stock ownership, the various qualification tests imposed under the code.
for example, to qualify as a reit, at least 95% of our gross income in any year must be derived from qualifying sources, and we must make distributions to our stockholders aggregating annually to at least 90% of our reit taxable income, excluding net capital gains. rents we receive from a trs in a ridea structure are treated as qualifying rents from real property for reit tax purposes only if (i) they are paid pursuant to a lease of a "qualified healthcare property," and (ii) the operator qualifies as an "eligible independent contractor," as defined in the code. if either of these requirements is not satisfied, then the rents will not be qualifying rents. furthermore, new legislation, regulations, administrative interpretations or court decisions could change the tax laws or interpretations of the tax laws regarding qualification as a reit, or the federal income tax consequences of that qualification, in a manner that is materially adverse to our stockholders. accordingly, there is no assurance that we have operated or will continue to operate in a manner so as to qualify or remain qualified as a reit.
if we lose our reit status, we will face serious tax consequences that will substantially reduce the funds available to make payments of principal and interest on the debt securities we issue and to make distributions to stockholders. if we fail to qualify as a reit:
•we will not be allowed a deduction for distributions to stockholders in computing our taxable income;
•we will be subject to corporate-level income tax on our taxable income at regular corporate rates;
•we will be subject to increased state and local income taxes; and
•unless we are entitled to relief under relevant statutory provisions, we will be disqualified from taxation as a reit for the four taxable years following the year during which we fail to qualify as a reit.
as a result of all these factors, our failure to qualify as a reit could also impair our ability to expand our business and raise capital and could materially adversely affect the value of our common stock.
further changes to u.s. federal income tax laws could materially and adversely affect us and our stockholders.
the present federal income tax treatment of reits may be modified, possibly with retroactive effect, by legislative, judicial or administrative action at any time, which could affect the federal income tax treatment of an investment in us. the federal income tax rules dealing with u.s. federal income taxation and reits are constantly under review by persons involved in the legislative process, the u.s. internal revenue service (the "irs") and the u.s. treasury department, which results in statutory changes as well as frequent revisions to regulations and interpretations. we cannot predict how changes in the tax laws might affect our investors or us. revisions in federal tax laws and interpretations thereof could significantly and negatively affect our ability to qualify as a reit, as well as the tax considerations relevant to an investment in us, or could cause us to change our investments and commitments.
potential deferred and contingent tax liabilities from corporate acquisitions could limit or delay future property sales.
if, during the five-year period beginning on the date we acquire certain companies, we recognize a gain on the disposition of any property acquired, then, to the extent of the excess of (i) the fair market value of such property as of the acquisition date over (ii) our adjusted income tax basis in such property as of that date, we will be required to pay a corporate-level federal income tax on this gain at the highest regular corporate rate. there can be no assurance that these triggering dispositions will not occur, and these requirements could limit or delay future property sales. in addition, the irs may assert liabilities against us for corporate income taxes for taxable years prior to the time that we acquire certain companies, in which case we will owe these taxes plus interest and penalties, if any.
there are uncertainties relating to the calculation of non-reit tax earnings and profits ("e&p") in certain acquisitions, which may require us to distribute e&p.
in order to remain qualified as a reit, we are required to distribute to our stockholders all of the accumulated non-reit e&p of certain companies that we acquire, prior to the close of the first taxable year in which the acquisition occurs. failure to make such e&p distributions would result in our disqualification as a reit. the determination of the amount to be distributed in such e&p distributions is a complex factual and legal determination. we may have less than complete information at the time we undertake our analysis, or we may interpret the applicable law differently from the irs. we currently believe that we have satisfied the requirements relating to such e&p distributions. there are, however, substantial uncertainties relating to the determination of e&p, including the possibility that the irs could successfully assert that the taxable income of the companies acquired should be increased, which would increase our non-reit e&p. thus, we might fail to satisfy the requirement that we distribute all of our non-reit e&p by the close of the first taxable year in which the acquisition occurs. moreover, although there are procedures available to cure a failure to distribute all of our e&p, we cannot now determine whether we will be able to take advantage of these procedures or the economic impact on us of doing so.
our charter contains ownership limits with respect to our common stock and other classes of capital stock.
our charter contains restrictions on the ownership and transfer of our common stock and preferred stock that are intended to assist us in preserving our qualification as a reit. under our charter, subject to certain exceptions, no person or entity may own, actually or constructively, more than 9.8% (by value or by number of shares, whichever is more restrictive) of the outstanding shares of our common stock or any class or series of our preferred stock.
additionally, our charter has a 9.9% ownership limitation on the direct or indirect ownership of our voting shares, which may include common stock or other classes of capital stock. our board of directors, in its sole discretion, may exempt a proposed transferee from either ownership limit. the ownership limits may delay, defer or prevent a transaction or a change of control that might involve a premium price for our common stock or might otherwise be in the best interests of our stockholders.
general risk factorsthe loss or limited availability of our key personnel could disrupt our operations and have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition, and the value of our common stock.
we depend on the efforts of our executive officers for the success of our business. although they are covered by our executive severance plan and change in control plan, which provide many of the benefits typically found in executive employment agreements, none of our executive officers have employment agreements with us. the loss or limited availability of the services of any of our executive officers, or our inability to recruit and retain qualified personnel, could, at least temporarily, have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition and the value of our common stock.
we rely on information technology in our operations, and any material failure, inadequacy, interruption or security failure of that technology could harm our business.
we rely on information technology networks and systems, including the internet, to process, transmit and store electronic information, and to manage or support a variety of business processes, including financial transactions and records, and to maintain personal identifying information and tenant and lease data. we utilize software and cloud-based technology from vendors, on whom our systems depend. we rely on commercially available systems, software, tools and monitoring to provide security for the processing, transmission and storage of confidential tenant and customer data, including individually identifiable information relating to financial accounts. although we have taken steps to protect the security of our information systems, with multiple layers of controls around the data maintained in those systems, it is possible that our safety and security measures will not prevent the systems' improper functioning or damage, or the improper access or disclosure of personally identifiable information such as in the event of cyber-attacks. the risk of security breaches has generally increased as the number, intensity and sophistication of attacks and intrusions have increased, and we have seen a significant increase in cyber phishing attacks since the onset of the covid pandemic. the risk of security breaches has also increased with our increased dependence on the internet while our employees continue to work remotely due to our health and safety policies during the covid pandemic and will continue to work remotely under our planned hybrid model. furthermore, because our operators also rely on the internet, information technology networks, systems and software, some of our data may be vulnerable to cyber-attacks on our operators.
security breaches of our or our operators' networks and systems, including those caused by physical or electronic break-ins, computer viruses, malware, worms, attacks by hackers or foreign governments, disruptions from unauthorized access and tampering, including through social engineering such as phishing attacks, coordinated denial-of-service attacks and similar breaches, could result in, among other things: (i) system disruptions; (ii) shutdowns; (iii) unauthorized access to or disclosure of confidential information; (iv) misappropriation of our or our business partners' proprietary or confidential information; (v) breach of our legal, regulatory or contractual obligations; (vi) inability to access or rely upon critical business records or systems; or (vii) other delays in our operations. in some cases, it may be difficult to anticipate or immediately detect such incidents and the damage they cause. we may be required to expend significant financial resources to protect against or to remediate such security breaches. in addition, our technology infrastructure and information systems are vulnerable to damage or interruption from natural disasters, power loss and telecommunications failures. any failure to maintain proper function, security and availability of our and our operators' information systems and the data maintained in those systems could interrupt our operations, damage our reputation, subject us to liability claims or regulatory penalties, harm our business relationships or increase our security and insurance costs, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
adverse changes in our credit ratings could impair our ability to obtain additional debt and equity financing on favorable terms, if at all, and negatively impact the market price of our securities, including our common stock.
our credit ratings affect the amount and type of capital, as well as the terms of any financing we may obtain. the credit ratings of our senior unsecured debt are based on, among other things, our operating performance, liquidity and leverage ratios, overall financial position, level of indebtedness, and pending or future changes in the regulatory framework applicable to our operators and our industry. if we are unable to maintain our current credit ratings, we would likely incur higher borrowing costs, which would make it more difficult or expensive to obtain additional financing or refinance existing obligations and commitments. for example, as a result of the potential impact of the covid pandemic, in march 2020, moody's changed its outlook on our long-term issuer and senior unsecured debt ratings from "stable" to "negative." although moody's subsequently upgraded our outlook to "stable," any future adverse change in our outlook may ultimately lead to a downgrade in our credit ratings, which would trigger additional borrowing costs or other potentially negative consequences under our current credit facilities and debt instruments. also, if our credit ratings are downgraded, or general market conditions were to ascribe higher risk to our ratings, our industry, or us, our access to capital and the cost of any future debt financing will be further negatively impacted. in addition, the terms of future debt agreements could include more restrictive covenants, or require incremental collateral, which may further restrict our business operations or be unavailable due to our covenant restrictions then in effect. there is no guarantee that debt or equity financings will be available in the future to fund future acquisitions or general operating expenses, or that such financing will be available on terms consistent with our historical agreements or expectations.
item 7.    management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the information set forth in this item 7 is intended to provide readers with an understanding of our financial condition, changes in financial condition and results of operations. this section generally discusses the results of our operations for the year ended december 31, 2021 compared to the year ended december 31, 2020. for a discussion of the year ended december 31, 2020 compared to the year ended december 31, 2019, please refer to part ii, item 7. "management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations" in our annual report on form 10-k for the fiscal year ended december 31, 2020 filed with the sec on february 10, 2021.
we will discuss and provide our analysis in the following order:
•covid update
•overview of transactions
•dividends
•results of operations
•liquidity and capital resources
•non-gaap financial measure reconciliations
•critical accounting estimates
•recent accounting pronouncements covid update our tenants, operators, and borrowers have experienced significant cost increases as a result of increased health and safety measures, staffing shortages, increased governmental regulation and compliance, vaccine mandates, and other operational changes necessitated either directly or indirectly by the covid pandemic. we anticipate that many of these expenses will remain at these higher levels even after the pandemic passes, and may reduce margins in the business.
the impact of covid on the ability of our tenants to pay rent in the future is currently unknown. we have monitored, and will continue to monitor, the credit quality of each of our tenants and write off straight-line rent and accounts receivable, as necessary. in the event we conclude that substantially all of a tenant's straight-line rent or accounts receivable is not probable of collection in the future, such amounts will be written off, which could have a material impact on our future results of operations.
senior housing facilities have been disproportionately impacted by covid and covid-related fatalities compared to our life science and medical office segments. within our ccrc properties and the properties in our swf sh jv, average occupancy declined from 85.6% and 88.7%, respectively, for the year ended december 31, 2019, to 79.1% and 72.7%, respectively, for the year ended december 31, 2021. although the wide availability of the vaccine has reduced the negative impacts of the pandemic in our ccrc communities and the senior housing facilities owned by our swf sh jv, we do not yet know the full, long-term economic impact of the covid pandemic and whether or when occupancy and revenue will return to pre-pandemic levels. the increase in covid cases caused by recent variants has evidenced the fact that the course of the pandemic is highly uncertain and that unexpected surges or other factors could materially impact recovery from the pandemic, adversely disrupt operations, and/or cause significant reputational harm to us, our tenants, our operators, or our borrowers. labor costs in particular have increased as a result of higher staffing hours, increased hourly wages and bonuses, greater overtime, and increased usage of contract labor. in addition, the pandemic has resulted in some potentially long-term changes in traditional economic patterns and arrangements, including that (i) seniors may not seek out senior housing at the same level that they did pre-pandemic; (ii) recent legislation that favors delivery of services at home rather than in an institutional setting could negatively impact the segment; (iii) qualified employees may view employment at senior housing facilities less attractively than they did pre-pandemic; (iv) the number of people who have not returned to the workforce could create long-term staffing shortages; (v) changing expectations around the protection required for residents in senior housing facilities may increase costs; (vi) senior housing operators are undertaking numerous adaptations in response to these changes, the success of which adaptations is uncertain; and (vii) the inflationary environment could permanently alter behavior in unpredictable ways.
all development, redevelopment, and tenant improvement projects that were previously delayed have been allowed to restart with infection control protocols in place, although future local, state, or federal orders could cause work to be suspended, and individual projects may be affected by outbreaks.
we believe we remain well-positioned to navigate economic changes resulting from the pandemic, with approximately $2.2 billion of liquidity available, including $1.81 billion of borrowing capacity under our bank line of credit facility, $313 million of net proceeds expected from the future settlement of shares issued through our atm forward contracts (as defined below), and approximately $117 million of cash and cash equivalents as of february 7, 2022.
we have taken, and will continue to take, proactive measures to provide for the well-being of our employees. we have implemented systems and processes that have allowed us to work effectively and efficiently in the remote environment. the steps taken to protect our employees and afford them a safe working environment continue to evolve along with authoritative guidance on best practices.
see "item 1a, risk factors" in this report for additional discussion of the risks posed by the covid pandemic and uncertainties we and our tenants, operators, and borrowers may face as a result.

results of operations we evaluate our business and allocate resources among our reportable business segments: (i) life science, (ii) medical office, and (iii) ccrc. under the life science and medical office segments, we invest through the acquisition and development of life science facilities, mobs, and hospitals, which generally requires a greater level of property management. our ccrcs are operated through ridea structures. we have other non-reportable segments that are comprised primarily of: (i) an interest in our unconsolidated swf sh jv and (ii) debt investments. we evaluate performance based upon property adjusted net operating income ("adjusted noi" or "cash noi") in each segment. the accounting policies of the segments are the same as those described in the summary of significant accounting policies in note 2 to the consolidated financial statements.
non-gaap financial measures net operating income noi and adjusted noi are non-u.s. generally accepted accounting principles ("gaap") supplemental financial measures used to evaluate the operating performance of real estate. noi is defined as real estate revenues (inclusive of rental and related revenues, resident fees and services, income from direct financing leases, and government grant income and exclusive of interest income), less property level operating expenses; noi excludes all other financial statement amounts included in net income (loss) as presented in note 16 to the consolidated financial statements. adjusted noi is calculated as noi after eliminating the effects of straight-line rents, dfl non-cash interest, amortization of market lease intangibles, termination fees, actuarial reserves for insurance claims that have been incurred but not reported, and the impact of deferred community fee income and expense. noi and adjusted noi include our share of income (loss) generated by unconsolidated joint ventures and exclude noncontrolling interests' share of income (loss) generated by consolidated joint ventures. adjusted noi is oftentimes referred to as "cash noi." management believes noi and adjusted noi are important supplemental measures because they provide relevant and useful information by reflecting only income and operating expense items that are incurred at the property level and present them on an unlevered basis. we use noi and adjusted noi to make decisions about resource allocations, to assess and compare property level performance, and to evaluate our same-store ("ss") performance, as described below. we believe that net income (loss) is the most directly comparable gaap measure to noi and adjusted noi. noi and adjusted noi should not be viewed as alternative measures of operating performance to net income (loss) as defined by gaap since they do not reflect various excluded items. further, our definitions of noi and adjusted noi may not be comparable to the definitions used by other reits or real estate companies, as they may use different methodologies for calculating noi and adjusted noi. for a reconciliation of noi and adjusted noi to net income (loss) by segment, refer to note 16 to the consolidated financial statements.
operating expenses generally relate to leased medical office and life science properties, as well as ccrc facilities. we generally recover all or a portion of our leased medical office and life science property expenses through tenant recoveries. we present expenses as operating or general and administrative based on the underlying nature of the expense.
same-store same-store noi and adjusted (cash) noi information allows us to evaluate the performance of our property portfolio under a consistent population by eliminating changes in the composition of our consolidated portfolio of properties. same-store adjusted noi excludes amortization of deferred revenue from tenant-funded improvements and certain non-property specific operating expenses that are allocated to each operating segment on a consolidated basis.
properties are included in same-store once they are stabilized for the full period in both comparison periods. newly acquired operating assets are generally considered stabilized at the earlier of lease-up (typically when the tenant(s) control(s) the physical use of at least 80% of the space and rental payments have commenced) or 12 months from the acquisition date. newly completed developments and redevelopments are considered stabilized at the earlier of lease-up or 24 months from the date the property is placed in service. properties that experience a change in reporting structure are considered stabilized after 12 months in operations under a consistent reporting structure. a property is removed from same-store when it is classified as held for sale, sold, placed into redevelopment, experiences a casualty event that significantly impacts operations, a change in reporting structure or operator transition has been agreed to, or a significant tenant relocates from a same-store property to a non same-store property and that change results in a corresponding increase in revenue. we do not report same-store metrics for our other non-reportable segments. for a reconciliation of same-store to total portfolio adjusted noi and other relevant disclosures by segment, refer to our segment analysis below.
funds from operations ("ffo")
ffo encompasses nareit ffo and ffo as adjusted, each of which is described in detail below. we believe ffo applicable to common shares, diluted ffo applicable to common shares, and diluted ffo per common share are important supplemental non-gaap measures of operating performance for a reit. because the historical cost accounting convention used for real estate assets utilizes straight-line depreciation (except on land), such accounting presentation implies that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time. since real estate values instead have historically risen and fallen with market conditions, presentations of operating results for a reit that use historical cost accounting for depreciation could be less informative. the term ffo was designed by the reit industry to address this issue.
nareit ffo. ffo, as defined by the national association of real estate investment trusts ("nareit"), is net income (loss) applicable to common shares (computed in accordance with gaap), excluding gains or losses from sales of depreciable property, including any current and deferred taxes directly associated with sales of depreciable property, impairments of, or related to, depreciable real estate, plus real estate and other real estate-related depreciation and amortization, and adjustments to compute our share of nareit ffo and ffo as adjusted (see below) from joint ventures. adjustments for joint ventures are calculated to reflect our pro-rata share of both our consolidated and unconsolidated joint ventures. we reflect our share of nareit ffo for unconsolidated joint ventures by applying our actual ownership percentage for the period to the applicable reconciling items on an entity by entity basis. for consolidated joint ventures in which we do not own 100%, we reflect our share of the equity by adjusting our nareit ffo to remove the third party ownership share of the applicable reconciling items based on actual ownership percentage for the applicable periods. our pro-rata share information is prepared on a basis consistent with the comparable consolidated amounts, is intended to reflect our proportionate economic interest in the operating results of properties in our portfolio and is calculated by applying our actual ownership percentage for the period. we do not control the unconsolidated joint ventures, and the pro-rata presentations of reconciling items included in nareit ffo do not represent our legal claim to such items. the joint venture members or partners are entitled to profit or loss allocations and distributions of cash flows according to the joint venture agreements, which provide for such allocations generally according to their invested capital.
the presentation of pro-rata information has limitations, which include, but are not limited to, the following: (i) the amounts shown on the individual line items were derived by applying our overall economic ownership interest percentage determined when applying the equity method of accounting and do not necessarily represent our legal claim to the assets and liabilities, or the revenues and expenses and (ii) other companies in our industry may calculate their pro-rata interest differently, limiting the usefulness as a comparative measure. because of these limitations, the pro-rata financial information should not be considered independently or as a substitute for our financial statements as reported under gaap. we compensate for these limitations by relying primarily on our gaap financial statements, using the pro-rata financial information as a supplement.
nareit ffo does not represent cash generated from operating activities in accordance with gaap, is not necessarily indicative of cash available to fund cash needs and should not be considered an alternative to net income (loss). we compute nareit ffo in accordance with the current nareit definition; however, other reits may report nareit ffo differently or have a different interpretation of the current nareit definition from ours.
ffo as adjusted. in addition, we present nareit ffo on an adjusted basis before the impact of non-comparable items including, but not limited to, transaction-related items, other impairments (recoveries) and other losses (gains), restructuring and severance related charges, prepayment costs (benefits) associated with early retirement or payment of debt, litigation costs (recoveries), casualty-related charges (recoveries), foreign currency remeasurement losses (gains), deferred tax asset valuation allowances, and changes in tax legislation ("ffo as adjusted"). transaction-related items include transaction expenses and gains/charges incurred as a result of mergers and acquisitions and lease amendment or termination activities. prepayment costs (benefits) associated with early retirement of debt include the write-off of unamortized deferred financing fees, or additional costs, expenses, discounts, make-whole payments, penalties or premiums incurred as a result of early retirement or payment of debt. other impairments (recoveries) and other losses (gains) include interest income associated with early and partial repayments of loans receivable and other losses or gains associated with non-depreciable assets including goodwill, dfls, undeveloped land parcels, and loans receivable. management believes that ffo as adjusted provides a meaningful supplemental measurement of our ffo run-rate and is frequently used by analysts, investors, and other interested parties in the evaluation of our performance as a reit. at the same time that nareit created and defined its ffo measure for the reit industry, it also recognized that "management of each of its member companies has the responsibility and authority to publish financial information that it regards as useful to the financial community." we believe stockholders, potential investors, and financial analysts who review our operating performance are best served by an ffo run-rate earnings measure that includes certain other adjustments to net income (loss), in addition to adjustments made to arrive at the nareit defined measure of ffo. ffo as adjusted is used by management in analyzing our business and the performance of our properties and we believe it is important that stockholders, potential investors, and financial analysts understand this measure used by management. we use ffo as adjusted to: (i) evaluate our performance in comparison with expected results and results of previous periods, relative to resource allocation decisions, (ii) evaluate the performance of our management, (iii) budget and forecast future results to assist in the allocation of resources, (iv) assess our performance as compared with similar real estate companies and the industry in general, and (v) evaluate how a specific potential investment will impact our future results. other reits or real estate companies may use different methodologies for calculating an adjusted ffo measure, and accordingly, our ffo as adjusted may not be comparable to those reported by other reits. for a reconciliation of net income (loss) to nareit ffo and ffo as adjusted and other relevant disclosure, refer to "non-gaap financial measures reconciliations" below.
adjusted ffo ("affo"). affo is defined as ffo as adjusted after excluding the impact of the following: (i) amortization of stock-based compensation, (ii) amortization of deferred financing costs, net, (iii) straight-line rents, (iv) deferred income taxes, and (v) other affo adjustments, which include: (a) amortization of acquired market lease intangibles, net, (b) non-cash interest related to dfls and lease incentive amortization (reduction of straight-line rents), (c) actuarial reserves for insurance claims that have been incurred but not reported, and (d) amortization of deferred revenues, excluding amounts amortized into rental income that are associated with tenant funded improvements owned/recognized by us and up-front cash payments made by tenants to reduce their contractual rents. also, affo is computed after deducting recurring capital expenditures, including second generation leasing costs and second generation tenant and capital improvements, and includes adjustments to compute our share of affo from our unconsolidated joint ventures. more specifically, recurring capital expenditures, including second generation leasing costs and second generation tenant and capital improvements ("affo capital expenditures") excludes our share from unconsolidated joint ventures (reported in "other affo adjustments"). adjustments for joint ventures are calculated to reflect our pro-rata share of both our consolidated and unconsolidated joint ventures. we reflect our share of affo for unconsolidated joint ventures by applying our actual ownership percentage for the period to the applicable reconciling items on an entity by entity basis. we reflect our share for consolidated joint ventures in which we do not own 100% of the equity by adjusting our affo to remove the third party ownership share of the applicable reconciling items based on actual ownership percentage for the applicable periods (reported in "other affo adjustments"). see ffo for further disclosure regarding our use of pro-rata share information and its limitations. other reits or real estate companies may use different methodologies for calculating affo, and accordingly, our affo may not be comparable to those reported by other reits. although our affo computation may not be comparable to that of other reits, management believes affo provides a meaningful supplemental measure of our performance and is frequently used by analysts, investors, and other interested parties in the evaluation of our performance as a reit. we believe affo is an alternative run-rate earnings measure that improves the understanding of our operating results among investors and makes comparisons with: (i) expected results, (ii) results of previous periods, and (iii) results among reits more meaningful. affo does not represent cash generated from operating activities determined in accordance with gaap and is not necessarily indicative of cash available to fund cash needs as it excludes the following items which generally flow through our cash flows from operating activities: (i) adjustments for changes in working capital or the actual timing of the payment of income or expense items that are accrued in the period, (ii) transaction-related costs, (iii) litigation settlement expenses, and (iv) restructuring and severance-related charges. furthermore, affo is adjusted for recurring capital expenditures, which are generally not considered when determining cash flows from operations or liquidity. affo is a non-gaap supplemental financial measure and should not be considered as an alternative to net income (loss) determined in accordance with gaap. for a reconciliation of net income (loss) to affo and other relevant disclosure, refer to "non-gaap financial measures reconciliations" below.

(1)for the reconciliation of non-gaap financial measures, see "non-gaap financial measure reconciliations" below.
net income (loss) applicable to common shares increased primarily as a result of the following:
•an increase in noi generated from our life science and medical office segments, which related to: (i) 2020 and 2021 acquisitions of real estate, (ii) development and redevelopment projects placed in service during 2020 and 2021, and (iii) new leasing and renewal activity during 2020 and 2021 (including the impact to straight-line rents);
•an increase in income from discontinued operations, primarily due to: (i) decreased impairments of depreciable real estate as a result of fewer assets being impaired under the held for sale model and (ii) decreased depreciation and amortization expense, partially offset by: (i) decreased noi from dispositions of real estate during 2020 and 2021, (ii) decreased gain on sales of real estate from senior housing dispositions in 2021, and (iii) a goodwill impairment charge related to our senior housing triple-net and shop asset sales in 2021;
•an increase in gains on sale of depreciable real estate related to mob asset sales during 2021;
•a reduction in operating expenses related to our ccrcs primarily as a result of the management termination fee paid to brookdale in connection with transitioning management of 13 ccrcs to life care services llc ("lcs") during the first quarter of 2020;
•an increase in our share of net income from our unconsolidated swf sh jv;
•a reduction in interest expense, primarily as a result of senior unsecured notes repurchases and redemptions in 2021;
•an increase in interest income, primarily as a result of: (i) seller financing issued in 2020 and 2021 and (ii) the accelerated recognition of a mark-to-market discount resulting from prepayments on loans receivable, partially offset by principal repayments on loans receivable;
•a reduction in impairment charges related to: (i) real estate held for sale and (ii) loan loss reserves, primarily as a result of principal repayments on loans receivable in 2021, loans receivable sales in 2021, and a more positive economic outlook; and
•a reduction in transaction costs, primarily as a result of costs associated with the transition of 13 ccrcs from brookdale to lcs in the first quarter of 2020.
the increase in net income (loss) applicable to common shares was partially offset by:
•a reduction in other income, net as a result of: (i) a gain upon change of control related to the acquisition of the outstanding equity interest in 13 ccrcs from brookdale during the first quarter of 2020, (ii) a gain on sale related to the sale of a hospital underlying a dfl during the first quarter of 2020, and (iii) a decline in government grant income received under the cares act;
•an increase in loss on debt extinguishments related to our repurchase and redemption of certain outstanding senior notes in the first and second quarters of 2021;
•an increase in depreciation, primarily as a result of: (i) 2020 and 2021 acquisitions of real estate, (ii) accelerated depreciation related to the change in estimated useful lives on certain of our densification projects in 2021, (iii) development and redevelopment projects placed into service during 2020 and 2021, and (iv) the above-mentioned acquisition of the outstanding equity interest and consolidation of 13 ccrcs from brookdale during the first quarter of 2020;
•a reduction in noi related to mob assets sold during 2020 and 2021; and
•a decrease in income tax benefit, primarily as a result of the tax benefits recognized in the first quarter of 2020 related to the above-mentioned acquisition of the outstanding equity interest in 13 ccrcs from brookdale and the management termination fee expense paid to brookdale in connection with transitioning management to lcs, partially offset by the income tax expense recognized during the third quarter of 2020 from the establishment of a deferred tax asset valuation allowance related to deferred tax assets that were no longer expected to be realized as a result of our plan to dispose of our shop portfolio.
nareit ffo decreased primarily as a result of the aforementioned events impacting net income (loss) applicable to common shares, except for the following, which are excluded from nareit ffo:
•net gain on sales of depreciable real estate;
•the gain upon change of control related to the acquisition of brookdale's interest in 13 ccrcs;
•depreciation and amortization expense; and
•impairment charges related to depreciable real estate.
ffo as adjusted decreased primarily as a result of the aforementioned events impacting nareit ffo, except for the following, which are excluded from ffo as adjusted:
•the loss on debt extinguishment;
•the management termination fee paid to brookdale in connection with our acquisition of their interest in 13 ccrcs;
•net gain on sales of assets underlying dfls;
•the transaction costs associated with transition of 13 ccrcs from brookdale to lcs;
•a goodwill impairment charge related to senior housing triple-net and shop asset sales;
•loan loss reserves; and
•the accelerated recognition of a mark-to-market discount resulting from prepayments on loans receivable.
affo decreased primarily as a result of the aforementioned events impacting ffo as adjusted, except for the impact of straight-line rents, which is excluded from affo. the decrease was further impacted by higher affo capital expenditures.
segment analysis the following tables provide selected operating information for our same-store and total property portfolio for each of our reportable segments. for the year ended december 31, 2021, our same-store consists of 347 properties representing properties acquired or placed in service and stabilized on or prior to january 1, 2020 and that remained in operations under a consistent reporting structure through december 31, 2021. our total property portfolio consisted of 484 and 457 properties at december 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.
in conjunction with classifying our senior housing triple-net and shop portfolios as discontinued operations as of december 31, 2020, the results of operations related to those portfolios are no longer presented in reportable business segments. accordingly, results of operations of those portfolios are not included in the reportable business segment analysis below. refer to note 5 to the consolidated financial statements for further information regarding discontinued operations.

(3)represents average occupied units as reported by the operators for the twelve-month period.
same-store adjusted noi decreased primarily as a result of the following:
•lower occupancy due to covid;
•decreased government grant income received under the cares act; and
•higher labor costs; partially offset by
•lower covid-related expenses; and
•increased rates for resident fees.
total portfolio adjusted noi decreased primarily as a result of the aforementioned decreases to same-store, which are also applicable to our properties not yet included in same-store.

interest income interest income increased for the year ended december 31, 2021 primarily as a result of: (i) seller financing issued in 2020 and 2021 and (ii) the accelerated recognition of a mark-to-market discount resulting from prepayments on loans receivable. the increase was partially offset by principal repayments on loans receivable.
interest expense interest expense decreased for the year ended december 31, 2021 primarily as a result of senior unsecured notes repurchases and redemptions in the first and second quarters of 2021.
depreciation and amortization expense depreciation and amortization expense increased for the year ended december 31, 2021 primarily as a result of: (i) acquisitions of real estate during 2020 and 2021, (ii) accelerated depreciation related to the change in estimated useful lives on certain of our densification projects in 2021, (iii) development and redevelopment projects placed into service during 2020 and 2021, and (iv) the acquisition of brookdale's interest in and consolidation of 13 ccrcs during the first quarter of 2020. the increase was partially offset by dispositions of real estate throughout 2020 and 2021.
general and administrative expense general and administrative expenses increased for the year ended december 31, 2021 primarily as a result of higher compensation costs and increased restructuring and severance related charges.
transaction costs transaction costs decreased for the year ended december 31, 2021 primarily as a result of costs associated with the transition of 13 ccrcs from brookdale to lcs in january 2020.
impairments and loan loss reserves (recoveries), net the impairment charges recognized in each period vary depending on facts and circumstances related to each asset and are impacted by negotiations with potential buyers, current operations of the assets, and other factors.
impairments and loan loss reserves (recoveries), net decreased for the year ended december 31, 2021 primarily as a result of: (i) fewer assets impaired under the held for sale impairment model and (ii) a decrease in loan loss reserves under the current expected credit losses model, partially offset by: (i) increased impairment charges related to assets that we intend to demolish for future development projects and (ii) impairment charges on loans sold. the reduction in loan loss reserves during the year ended december 31, 2021 is primarily due to: (i) principal repayments on loans receivable during 2021, (ii) loans receivable sales in 2021, and (iii) a more positive economic outlook. the reduction in loan loss reserves during the year ended december 31, 2021 is partially offset by the loan loss reserve recognized related to new seller financing issued in the first quarter of 2021.
gain (loss) on sales of real estate, net gain on sales of real estate, net increased during the year ended december 31, 2021 primarily as a result of the sale of: (i) 10 mobs and a portion of 1 mob land parcel for $68 million and (ii) 1 hospital for $226 million during the year ended december 31, 2021 resulting in total gain on sale of $191 million, compared to the sale of: (i) 11 mobs for $136 million, (ii) 2 mob land parcels for $3 million, and (iii) 1 asset from other non-reportable segments for $1 million during the year ended december 31, 2020 resulting in total gain on sale of $90 million.
gain (loss) on debt extinguishments refer to note 11 to the consolidated financial statements for information regarding senior unsecured note repurchases and redemptions and the associated loss on debt extinguishment recognized.
other income (expense), net other income, net decreased for the year ended december 31, 2021 primarily as a result of: (i) a gain upon change of control related to the acquisition of the outstanding equity interest in 13 ccrcs from brookdale during the first quarter of 2020, (ii) a gain on sale related to the sale of a hospital underlying a dfl during the first quarter of 2020, and (iii) a decline in government grant income received under the cares act.
income tax benefit (expense)
income tax benefit decreased for the year ended december 31, 2021 primarily as a result of the tax benefits recognized in the first quarter of 2020 related to the following: (i) the purchase of brookdale's interest in 13 of the 15 communities in the ccrc jv, including the management termination fee expense paid to brookdale in connection with transitioning management of 13 ccrcs to lcs and (ii) the extension of the net operating loss carryback period provided by the cares act. the decrease in income tax benefit during the year ended december 31, 2021 was partially offset by the establishment of a deferred tax asset valuation allowance during the third quarter of 2020 related to deferred tax assets that were no longer expected to be realized as a result of our plan to dispose of our shop portfolio.
equity income (loss) from unconsolidated joint ventures equity income from unconsolidated joint ventures increased for the year ended december 31, 2021 primarily as a result of a decrease in amortization expense due to fully amortized intangible assets related to our unconsolidated swf sh jv. the increase in equity income from unconsolidated joint ventures for the year ended december 31, 2021 was partially offset by our share of a gain on sale of one asset in an unconsolidated joint venture during the first quarter of 2020.
income (loss) from discontinued operations income from discontinued operations increased for the year ended december 31, 2021 primarily as a result of: (i) decreased impairments of depreciable real estate as a result of fewer assets being impaired under the held for sale impairment model and (ii) decreased depreciation and amortization expense due to assets being classified as held for sale throughout 2021. the increase in income from discontinued operations during the year ended december 31, 2021 was partially offset by: (i) decreased noi from dispositions of real estate during 2020 and 2021, (ii) decreased gain on sales of real estate from senior housing dispositions in 2021, and (iii) a goodwill impairment charge related to our senior housing triple-net and shop asset sales in 2021.
noncontrolling interests' share in continuing operations noncontrolling interests' share in continuing operations increased for the year ended december 31, 2021 primarily as a result of our partner's share of a gain on sale of one asset in a consolidated joint venture during 2021.
noncontrolling interests' share in discontinued operations noncontrolling interests' share in discontinued operations increased for the year ended december 31, 2021 primarily as a result of our partner's share of gains on sale of senior housing assets in downreit (as defined below) partnerships during 2021.
liquidity and capital resources we anticipate that our cash flow from operations, available cash balances, and cash from our various financing activities will be adequate for the next 12 months and for the foreseeable future for purposes of: (i) funding recurring operating expenses; (ii) meeting debt service requirements; and (iii) satisfying funding of distributions to our stockholders and non-controlling interest members. distributions are made using a combination of cash flows from operations, funds available under our bank line of credit and commercial paper program, proceeds from the sale of properties, and other sources of cash available to us.
in addition to funding the activities above, our principal liquidity needs for the next 12 months are to:
•fund capital expenditures, including tenant improvements and leasing costs, and
•fund future acquisition, transactional and development and redevelopment activities.
our longer term investing liquidity needs include the items listed above as well as meeting debt service requirements.
we anticipate satisfying these future needs using one or more of the following:
•cash flow from operations;
•sale of, or exchange of ownership interests in, properties or other investments;
•borrowings under our bank line of credit and commercial paper program;
•issuance of additional debt, including unsecured notes, term loans, and mortgage debt; and/or
•issuance of common or preferred stock or its equivalent.
our ability to access the capital markets impacts our cost of capital and ability to refinance maturing indebtedness, as well as our ability to fund future acquisitions and development through the issuance of additional securities or secured debt. credit ratings impact our ability to access capital and directly impact our cost of capital as well. for example, our bank line of credit accrues interest at a rate per annum equal to libor plus a margin that depends upon our credit ratings for our senior unsecured long-term debt. our bank line of credit includes customary libor replacement language, including, but not limited to, the use of rates based on the secured overnight financing rate administered by the federal reserve bank of new york. we also pay a facility fee on the entire revolving commitment that depends upon our credit ratings. as of february 7, 2022, we had long-term credit ratings of baa1 from moody's and bbb+ from s&p global and fitch, and short-term credit ratings of p-2, a-2, and f2 from moody's, s&p global, and fitch, respectively.
a downgrade in credit ratings by moody's, s&p global, and fitch may have a negative impact on the interest rates and facility fees for our bank line of credit and may negatively impact the pricing of notes issued under our commercial paper program and senior unsecured notes. while a downgrade in our credit ratings would adversely impact our cost of borrowing, we believe we would continue to have access to the unsecured debt markets, and we could also seek to enter into one or more secured debt financings, issue additional securities, including under our atm program (as defined below), or dispose of certain assets to fund future operating costs, capital expenditures, or acquisitions, although no assurances can be made in this regard. refer to "covid update" above for a more comprehensive discussion of the potential impact of covid on our business.
material cash requirements our material cash requirements include the following contractual and other obligations.
debt. as of december 31, 2021, we had total debt of $6.2 billion, including borrowings under our bank line of credit and commercial paper program, senior unsecured notes, and mortgage debt. future interest payments associated with such debt total $1.4 billion, $162 million of which are payable within twelve months. of our total debt, the total amount payable within twelve months is comprised of $5 million of mortgage debt. commercial paper borrowings are backstopped by our bank line of credit. as such, we calculate the weighted average remaining term of our commercial paper borrowings using the maturity date of our bank line of credit. see note 11 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.
development and redevelopment commitments. our development and redevelopment commitments represent construction and other commitments for developments and redevelopments in progress and includes certain allowances for tenant improvements that we have provided as a lessor. as of december 31, 2021, we had $387 million of development and redevelopment commitments, $279 million of which we expect to spend within the next twelve months.
lease and other contractual commitments. our lease and other contractual commitments represent our commitments, as lessor, under signed leases and contracts for operating properties and include allowances for tenant improvements and leasing commissions. these commitments exclude allowances for tenant improvements related to developments and redevelopments in progress for which we have executed an agreement with a general contractor to complete the tenant improvements, which are recognized as development and redevelopment commitments and are discussed further above. as of december 31, 2021, we had total lease and other contractual commitments of $83 million, $74 million of which we expect to spend within the next twelve months.
construction loan commitments. we have certain loan commitments to fund senior housing redevelopment and capital expenditure projects. as of december 31, 2021, we had $58 million of construction loan commitments, which extend through 2024.
ground and other operating lease commitments. our ground and other operating lease commitments represent our commitments as lessee under signed operating leases. as of december 31, 2021, we had total ground and other operating lease commitments of $549 million, $16 million of which are payable within twelve months. see note 7 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.
redeemable noncontrolling interests. certain of our noncontrolling interest holders have the ability to put their equity interests to us upon specified events or after the passage of a predetermined period of time. each put option is subject to changes in redemption value in the event that the underlying property generates specified returns for us and meets certain promote thresholds pursuant to the respective agreements. as of december 31, 2021, we had $87 million of redeemable noncontrolling interests, none of which meet the conditions for redemption as of the balance sheet date. see note 13 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.
distribution and dividend requirements. our dividend policy on our common stock is to distribute a percentage of our cash flow to ensure that we meet the dividend requirements of the code, relative to maintaining our reit status, while still allowing us to retain cash to fund capital improvements and other investment activities. under the code, reits may be subject to certain federal income and excise taxes on undistributed taxable income. we paid quarterly cash dividends of $0.30 per common share in 2021. our future common dividends, if and as declared, may vary and will be determined by the board based upon the circumstances prevailing at the time, including our financial condition.
off-balance sheet arrangements we own interests in certain unconsolidated joint ventures as described in note 9 to the consolidated financial statements. two of these joint ventures have mortgage debt of $87 million, of which our share is $40 million. except in limited circumstances, our risk of loss is limited to our investment in the joint venture. we have no other material off-balance sheet arrangements that we expect would materially affect our liquidity and capital resources.
inflation a significant portion of our revenues are derived from leases that generally provide for fixed rental rates, subject to annual escalations. a period of high inflation could result in increases in the consumer price index in excess of our fixed annual escalations. certain of our leases provide that annual rent is modified based on changes in the consumer price index or other thresholds.
most of our mob leases require the tenant to pay a share of property operating costs such as real estate taxes, insurance, and utilities. substantially all of our life science leases require the tenant or operator to pay all of the property operating costs or reimburse us for all such costs.
labor costs, interest, costs of construction materials, and other operating costs may increase during periods of inflation. inflationary increases in expenses will generally be offset, in whole or in part, by the tenant expense reimbursements and contractual rent increases described above.
cash flow summary the following summary discussion of our cash flows is based on the consolidated statements of cash flows and is not meant to be an all-inclusive discussion of the changes in our cash flows for the periods presented below.
the following table sets forth changes in cash flows (in thousands):

operating cash flows operating cash flow increased $37 million between the years ended december 31, 2021 and 2020 primarily as the result of: (i) 2020 and 2021 acquisitions, (ii) annual rent increases, (iii) new leasing and renewal activity, and (iv) developments and redevelopments placed in service during 2020 and 2021. the increase in operating cash flow is partially offset by a decrease in income related to assets sold during 2020 and 2021. our cash flow from operations is dependent upon the occupancy levels of our buildings, rental rates on leases, our tenants' performance on their lease obligations, the level of operating expenses, and other factors.

at december 31, 2021, non-managing members held an aggregate of five million units in seven limited liability companies ("downreits") for which we are the managing member. the downreit units are exchangeable for an amount of cash approximating the then-current market value of shares of our common stock or, at our option, shares of our common stock (subject to certain adjustments, such as stock splits and reclassifications). at december 31, 2021, the outstanding downreit units were convertible into approximately seven million shares of our common stock.

at december 31, 2021, $1.18 billion of our common stock remained available for sale under the atm program. actual future sales of our common stock will depend upon a variety of factors, including but not limited to market conditions, the trading price of our common stock, and our capital needs. we have no obligation to sell any of the remaining shares under our atm program.
see note 13 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information about our atm program.

________________________________
(1)this amount can be reconciled by combining the balances from the corresponding line of the consolidated statements of operations and the detailed financial information for discontinued operations in note 5 to the consolidated financial statements.
(2)for the year ended december 31, 2020, includes a $170 million gain upon consolidation of 13 ccrcs in which we acquired brookdale's interest and began consolidating during the first quarter of 2020. for the year ended december 31, 2019, includes a $161 million gain upon deconsolidation of 19 previously consolidated senior housing assets that were contributed into a new unconsolidated senior housing joint venture with a sovereign wealth fund. gains and losses upon change of control are included in other income (expense), net in the consolidated statements of operations.
(3)for the year ended december 31, 2020, includes the termination fee and transition fee expenses related to terminating the management agreements with brookdale for 13 ccrcs and transitioning those communities to life care services llc, partially offset by the tax benefit recognized related to those expenses. the expenses related to terminating management agreements are included in operating expenses in the consolidated statements of operations.
(4)for the year ended december 31, 2021, includes a $29 million goodwill impairment charge in connection with our senior housing triple-net and shop asset sales, which are reported in income (loss) from discontinued operations in the consolidated statements of operations. the year ended december 31, 2021 also includes $6 million of accelerated recognition of a mark-to-market discount, less loan fees, resulting from prepayments on loans receivable, which is included in interest income in the consolidated statements of operations. for the year ended december 31, 2020, includes a $42 million gain on sale of a hospital that was in a dfl, which is included in other income (expense), net in the consolidated statements of operations. the remaining activity for the years ended december 31, 2021 and 2020 includes reserves for loan losses and land impairments recognized in impairments and loan loss reserves (recoveries), net in the consolidated statements of operations. for the year ended december 31, 2019, represents the impairment of 13 senior housing triple-net facilities under dfls recognized as a result of entering into sales agreements.
(5)in conjunction with establishing a plan during the year ended december 31, 2020 to dispose of all of our shop assets and classifying such assets as discontinued operations, we concluded it was more likely than not that we would no longer realize the future value of certain deferred tax assets generated by the net operating losses of our taxable reit subsidiary entities. accordingly, during the year ended december 31, 2020, we recognized an associated valuation allowance and corresponding income tax expense.
(6)for the year ended december 31, 2020, represents the tax benefit from the cares act, which extended the net operating loss carryback period to five years.
(7)in connection with the acquisition of the remaining 51% interest in the ccrc jv in january 2020, we consolidated the 13 communities in the ccrc jv and recorded the assets and liabilities at their acquisition date relative fair values, including the ccrc contract liabilities associated with previously collected non-refundable entrance fees. in conjunction with increasing those ccrc contract liabilities to their fair value, we concluded that we will no longer adjust for the timing difference between non-refundable entrance fees collected and amortized as we believe the amortization of these fees is a meaningful representation of how we satisfy the performance obligations of the fees. as such, upon consolidation of the ccrc assets, we no longer exclude the difference between ccrc entrance fees collected and amortized from the calculation of affo. for comparative periods presented, the adjustment continues to represent our 49% share of non-refundable entrance fees collected by the ccrc jv, net of reserves and net of ccrc jv entrance fee amortization.
critical accounting estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with u.s. gaap requires our management to use judgment in the application of critical accounting estimates and assumptions. we base estimates on the best information available to us at the time, our experience and on various other assumptions believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. these estimates affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting periods. if our judgment or interpretation of the facts and circumstances relating to various transactions or other matters had been different, it is possible that different accounting would have been applied, resulting in a different presentation of our consolidated financial statements. from time to time, we re-evaluate our estimates and assumptions. in the event estimates or assumptions prove to be different from actual results, adjustments are made in subsequent periods to reflect more current estimates and assumptions about matters that are inherently uncertain. below is a discussion of accounting estimates that we consider critical in that they may require complex judgment in their application or require estimates about matters that are inherently uncertain. for a more detailed discussion of our significant accounting policies, see note 2 to the consolidated financial statements.
real estate we make estimates as part of our process for allocating a purchase price to the various identifiable assets and liabilities of an acquisition based upon the relative fair value of each asset or liability. the most significant components of our allocations are typically buildings as-if-vacant, land, and lease intangibles. in the case of allocating fair value to buildings and intangibles, our fair value estimates will affect the amount of depreciation and amortization we record over the estimated useful life of each asset acquired. in the case of allocating fair value to in-place leases, we make our best estimates based on our evaluation of the specific characteristics of each tenant's lease. factors considered include estimates of carrying costs during hypothetical expected lease-up periods, market conditions, and costs to execute similar leases. our assumptions affect the amount of future revenue and/or depreciation and amortization expense that we will recognize over the remaining useful life for the acquired in-place leases.
impairment of long-lived assets we assess the carrying value of our real estate assets and related intangibles ("real estate assets") when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. recoverability of real estate assets is measured by comparing the carrying amount of the real estate assets to the respective estimated future undiscounted cash flows. the expected future undiscounted cash flows reflect external market factors and are probability-weighted to reflect multiple possible cash-flow scenarios, including selling the assets at various points in the future. additionally, the estimated future undiscounted cash flows are calculated utilizing the lowest level of identifiable cash flows that are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities. in order to review our real estate assets for recoverability, we make assumptions regarding external market conditions (including capitalization rates and growth rates), forecasted cash flows and sales prices, and our intent with respect to holding or disposing of the asset. if our analysis indicates that the carrying value of the real estate assets is not recoverable on an undiscounted cash flow basis, we recognize an impairment charge for the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the real estate asset.
determining the fair value of real estate assets, including assets classified as held for sale, involves significant judgment and generally utilizes market capitalization rates, comparable market transactions, estimated per unit or per square foot prices, negotiations with prospective buyers, and forecasted cash flows (lease revenue rates, expense rates, growth rates, etc.). our ability to accurately predict future operating results and resulting cash flows, and estimate fair values, impacts the timing and recognition of impairments. while we believe our assumptions are reasonable, changes in these assumptions may have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.

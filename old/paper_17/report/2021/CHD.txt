item 1a.
risk factors the following risks and uncertainties, as well as other factors described elsewhere in this annual report or in our other filings with the commission, could, individually and collectively, have a material adverse impact on our business, reputation, financial results, financial condition and/or the trading price of our common stock:
business and operational risks
•   we face intense competition in our markets.

we face intense competition from consumer products companies, both in the u.s. and in international markets.  most of our products compete with other widely-advertised promoted and merchandised brands within each product category and from retailers, including supermarkets, mass merchandisers, wholesale clubs, drugstores, convenience stores, home stores, dollar and other discount stores, pet and other specialty stores and websites and other e-commerce channels, which are increasingly offering private label and retailer-branded brands and generic non-branded products in certain categories, which typically are sold at lower prices.  in china, in particular we face strong competition from local manufacturers offering both generic and branded products. the use of evolving technology to develop more complex pricing models by retailers has led and may continue to lead to pricing pressures in some categories. in addition, during times of economic uncertainty, consumers may purchase more "private label" or other lower price brands. these developments have increased competition in certain product categories in particular, including dietary supplements, diagnostic kits and oral analgesics. in addition to competition across all our product categories, there continues to be significant product competition in the gummy dietary supplement category, which has grown from six brands to over 170 in the last nine years.  shifting consumer behavior, including accelerated shifts to online shopping which has been accelerated by the covid-19 pandemic, have also increased competition in e-commerce in many of our categories, from our larger legacy competitors and newer digitally native brands which have increasingly moved into consumer products and staples.
many of our competitors are large companies, including, among others, the proctor & gamble company, the clorox company, colgate-palmolive company, henkel, reckitt benckiser group plc, johnson & johnson, nestle purina petcare company and nestle health science, ansell limited, alere inc., pfizer inc., bayer ag, s.c. johnson & son, inc., pharmavite llc, koninklijke philips n.v., unilever plc, sanofi and nbty, inc. many of these companies have greater financial resources than we do, and, therefore, have the capacity to outspend us on advertising and promotional activities and introduce competing products more quickly and respond more effectively to changing business and economic conditions than we can.
our products generally compete on the basis of performance, brand recognition, price, value or other benefits to consumers. significant price competition may require us to reduce the prices for some of our products or price levels that do not offset manufacturing cost increases, to respond to competitive and customer pressures and to maintain market share. increases to our prices, as a result of inflationary pressures or otherwise, could cause sales of those products to decline. we have recently raised prices on many of our products and expect to take pricing actions on 80% of our global portfolio of brands by the end of february 2022. advertising, promotion, merchandising and packaging also have a significant impact on retail customer decisions regarding the brands and product lines they sell and on consumer purchasing decisions.  a newly introduced consumer product (whether improved or newly developed) usually encounters intense competition requiring substantial expenditures for advertising, sales promotion and trade merchandising.  if a product gains consumer acceptance, it normally requires continued advertising, promotional support and product improvements to maintain its relative market position.  if our advertising, marketing and promotional programs are not effective, our sales growth may decline.
•   loss of any of our principal customers could significantly decrease our sales and profitability.

a limited number of customers account for a large percentage of our net sales and/or net sales of specific product lines.  walmart is our largest customer, accounting for approximately 24% of net sales in 2021, 23% of net sales in 2020 and 24% of net sales in 2019.  our top three customers accounted for approximately 37% of net sales in 2021 and 36% of net sales each year in 2020 and 2019.  we expect that a significant portion of our net sales will continue to be derived from a small number of customers and that these percentages may increase if the growth of mass merchandisers continues.  as a result, changes in the strategies of walmart or any of our other largest customers, including a reduction in the number of brands they carry or of shelf space they dedicate to private label products, could materially harm our net sales and profitability. changes in consumer behavior, including continued shifting to online shopping instead of physical retail shopping as a result of the covid-19 pandemic and other trends, could also impact our sales to our largest customers.  some of our retail customers have been forced to shut down or reduce their hours, which has impacted and may continue to impact their orders. some of our retail customers have experienced and may experience in the future declining financial performance, which could affect their ability to pay amounts due to us on a timely basis or at all. if these impacts are prolonged, they can further increase the difficulty of planning for operations. moreover, the use of evolving technology by our customers to develop more complex pricing models may lead to category pricing pressures.  we could also lose a significant customer due to customer service levels or real or perceived product quality or appearance issues.  as our business is based primarily upon individual sales orders rather than long-term contracts and most customer agreements include customer termination rights after short notice, many of our customers could reduce their purchasing levels or cease buying products from us at any time and for any reason.
15
•   decreases in demand for our products would decrease our sales and profitability.

factors that can affect demand include competitors' products, advertising and pricing actions, rates of unemployment, consumer confidence, health care costs, including increased costs as a result of changes in federal regulations, significant shifts in government policies, the deterioration of economic or trade relations between countries or regions, commodity costs, fuel and other energy costs and other economic factors affecting consumer spending behavior, including gasoline and home heating oil pricing, reduced unemployment benefits in periods of high unemployment, including the historically high unemployment rates resulting from the covid-19 pandemic, inflationary pressures, restrictions on travel and access to public spaces, and changes in tax policies, other effects of governmental shutdowns or a lapse of appropriations or fear of exposure to or actual impacts of a widespread disease outbreak, such as, covid-19.  in particular, we derive a substantial percentage of our revenues from sales of laundry detergent, and the continued customer demand for these products are critical to our future success. some products have seen decreasing demand in recent years, including condoms, as a result of demographic and other changes. an increasing number of our products are more durable in nature and, therefore are more likely to be affected by consumer decisions to control spending.
changes resulting from the covid-19 impact may also impact demand for our vitamin and supplement products. the vitamins and supplements and cold remedy categories have seen increased demand as trends in health and wellness focus have accelerated. however, demand for these products has typically increased during winter months when consumers have increased rates of flu and cold infection and increased social distancing and flu vaccination rates may have a negative impact.
•   a continued change in the retail environment and changing consumer preferences could cause our sales to decline.

despite increasing shifts to e-commerce, sales of our products remain strongest in the traditional mass merchandiser, food and drug retail stores, and our products are also sold in club stores and dollar stores channels.  however, alternative retail channels, including e-commerce retailers, hard discounters, subscription services and buying clubs, have become more prevalent and the volume of consumer products that are sold through such alternative retail channels is continuing to increase, which may affect customer and consumer preferences, including in response to the covid-19 pandemic and market dynamics, including any pricing pressures for consumer goods as retailers face added costs to build their e-commerce capacity.  further, consumer preferences continue to evolve due to a number of factors, including fragmentation of the consumer market and changes in consumer demographics, including the aging of the general population and the emergence of millennials and generation z who have different spending, consumption and purchasing habits; evolving consumer concerns or perceptions regarding esg practices of manufacturers, including, packaging materials, such as plastic packaging, and their environmental impact; greenhouse gas emissions; waste disposal practices; a growing demand for natural or organic products and ingredients; changing consumer sentiment toward non-local products or sources among millennials and other demographic groups; evolving consumer concerns or perceptions regarding the effects of ingredients or substances present in certain consumer products; and concerns regarding human capital practices, including dei.
the movement of consumers to online purchases of consumer products has greatly accelerated as a result of the covid-19 pandemic, as store closures, quarantine and gathering restrictions, and social distancing efforts have reduced physical retail shopping. we and many of our competitors have increased our online sales as a result, benefiting from scale, brand recognition, and other factors. however, as consumers continue to shift their behavior, retailers may incur higher e-commerce operating costs and will seek to recover those costs by passing them onto customers and manufacturers.   additionally, we cannot predict the extent to which our increased e-commerce demand will continue as pandemic conditions change, including as a result of vaccines, reduced rates of infection or modified consumer outlook and behaviors.
•   we rely on the policies of our key retailer customers.

larger and increasingly consolidated retailers have increasing influence, and have sought to obtain lower pricing, special packaging inventory practices, logistics or other changes to the customer-supplier relationship as a result of this influence.  to the extent we provide concessions or better trade terms to those customers, our profit margins are reduced.  further, if we are unable to effectively respond to the demands of our customers, these customers could reduce their purchases of our products and increase their purchases of products from competitors.  reductions in inventory by our customers, including as a result of consolidation in the retail industry, or these customers managing their working capital requirements, could result in reduced orders for our products and adversely affect our results of operations and cash flows for financial periods affected by such reductions.
protracted unfavorable market conditions, including those caused by the covid-19 pandemic, have caused many of our customers to more critically analyze the number of brands they sell, and reduce or discontinue certain of our product lines, particularly those products that were not number one or two in their category.
in addition, private label and retail-branded products sold by retail trade chains are typically sold at lower prices than branded products.  as consumers look for opportunities to decrease discretionary spending, our customers have discontinued or reduced distribution of some of our products to encourage those consumers to purchase the customers' less expensive and, in some cases, more profitable private label and retail-branded products (primarily in the dietary supplements, diagnostic kits and oral analgesics categories).
16
•   we have pursued and may continue to pursue strategic acquisitions and divestures.

we may continue to pursue and consummate additional acquisitions or substantial investments in complementary businesses or products in the future.  those acquisitions may be significantly larger than the ones completed in the past and may require us to increase our levels of debt, potentially resulting in us being assigned a lower credit rating.  however, we may not be able to identify and successfully negotiate suitable strategic acquisition at attractive valuations, obtain financing for future acquisitions on satisfactory terms or otherwise complete future acquisitions.  in recent periods, competition from other consumer products companies that are seeking similar opportunities has been particularly strong, and valuations for potential acquisition assets have been high, which has placed pressure on our ability to identify, structure and execute transactions.  in addition, acquisitions and investments entail various risks, including the difficulty of entering new markets or product categories, the challenges of integrating the operations and personnel of the acquired businesses or products, the potential disruption of our ongoing business and the ongoing business of the acquired company, the need to review and, if necessary, upgrade processes and systems of the acquired company to conform to our own processes and systems and applicable legal and regulatory requirements, managing an increasingly broad and complex range of businesses and products, and, generally, our potential inability to obtain the desired financial and strategic benefits from the acquisition or investment. any of these risks may divert management and other resources, require us to incur unanticipated costs or delay the anticipated positive impact on our business and results of the acquisition.  the risks associated with assimilation are increased to the extent we acquire businesses that have stand-alone operations or businesses that are in new categories that cannot easily be integrated or operations or sources of supply outside of the u.s. and canada, for which products are manufactured locally by third parties.
acquired companies or operations or newly-created ventures may not be profitable or may not achieve sales levels and profitability that justify the investments made.  in addition, future acquisitions or investments could result in substantial cash expenditures, the potentially dilutive issuances of new equity by us or the incurrence of additional debt or business acquisition liabilities.
•   market category declines and changes to our product and geographic mix may impact the achievement of our sales growth targets, planned pricing and financial results.

a significant percentage of our revenues come from mature markets that are subject to high levels of competition.  during 2021, approximately 82% of our sales were generated in u.s. markets.  u.s. markets for consumer products are considered mature and commonly characterized by high household penetration, particularly with respect to our most significant product categories, such as laundry detergents, deodorizers, household cleaning products, toothpastes, dietary supplements, antiperspirants and deodorants. our ability to quickly innovate to adapt our products to meet changing consumer demands is essential, especially in light of e-commerce significantly reducing the barriers for even small competitors to quickly introduce new brands and products directly to consumers. even if we are successful in increasing sales within our product categories, a continuing or accelerating decline in the overall markets for our products could have a negative impact on our financial results.
the covid-19 pandemic continues to impact most of our businesses.  as certain government restrictions were reduced or removed, we have experienced increased demand for certain product categories, mainly in the united states, including arm & hammer® cat litter, vitafusion® and l'il critters® gummy vitamins, and batiste® dry shampoo, that had been negatively impacted by the temporary and permanent closures of certain retailers earlier during the pandemic, reduced consumer foot traffic at retailers, and covid-19 related precautionary measures. overall, we have continued to experience increased online sales.  potential recessionary economic conditions, including after the direct impact of the pandemic has subsided, may continue to impact consumer demand for certain of our products and put downward pressure on product prices.
•   new products and product line extensions may not gain widespread customer acceptance, may be otherwise discontinued, or cause sales of existing products to decline.

our future performance and growth depend on our ability to successfully identify, develop and introduce new products, product line extensions, products in adjacent categories to our current products, and anticipate changes in consumer preferences.  in addition, some of our products have shorter product life spans and depend heavily on our ability to continuously and timely introduce innovative new products to the marketplace.  the successful development and introduction of new products involves substantial research, development, marketing and promotional expenditures, which we may be unable to recover if the new products do not gain widespread market acceptance.  new product development and marketing efforts, including efforts to enter markets or product categories in which we have limited or no prior experience, have inherent risks.  these risks include product development or launch delays, competitor actions, regulatory approval hurdles and the failure of new products and line extensions to achieve anticipated levels of market acceptance.  in addition, if sales generated by new products could result in a concomitant decline in sales of existing products.
each year, we introduce new products, including launches into new "white space" categories, across the majority of our marketed brands.  however, there is no assurance that our new products will continue to have widespread acceptance.  from time to time, we have discontinued certain products and product lines, which resulted in returns from customers, asset write-offs and shutdown costs.  we may suffer similar adverse consequences in the future to the extent we discontinue products that do not meet retailer or consumer expectations or no longer satisfy consumer demand.
17
•   we are subject to cost overruns and delays, regulatory requirements, and miscalculations in capacity needs with respect to our expansion projects and our manufacturing facilities, as well as disruptions to our manufacturing facilities and those of our contract manufacturers and other suppliers.

from time to time, we initiate planned and unplanned expansion projects with respect to our facilities and those of our contract manufacturers and other suppliers which are subject to risks of, and we have from time to time experienced, delay or cost overruns resulting from numerous factors, including the following: shortages of equipment, materials or skilled labor; work stoppages; unscheduled delays in the delivery of ordered materials and equipment; unanticipated cost increases; difficulties in obtaining necessary permits or in meeting permit conditions; difficulties in meeting regulatory or quality requirements or obtaining regulatory approvals; availability of suppliers to certify equipment for existing and enhanced regulations; design and engineering problems; failure or delay of third party service providers; and civil unrest, labor disputes, natural disasters and pandemics. if we were to experience delays or cost overruns in the future it could result in product allocation and retailer frustration, the loss of a significant customer or customers and the material decrease of the sales of one or more of our products. in addition, we could miscalculate our anticipated capacity needs in any of our categories, such as our laundry detergent, cat litter and dietary supplement categories, including as a result of meeting the anticipated demand of our customers, or expansion into new product lines or into new markets.
additionally, the supply of our products depends on the uninterrupted efficient operation of our manufacturing facilities and those of our contract manufacturers and other suppliers and our ability to meet customer service levels. the manufacturing of certain of our products is concentrated in one or more of our plants, contract manufacturers or other suppliers, with limited alternate qualified facilities available.  many of our manufacturing processes and those of our contract manufacturers and other suppliers are complex and present difficult technical challenges to obtain the manufacturing yields necessary to operate profitably and may require complex and specialized equipment which can be expensive to repair or replace with required lead times of up to a year.
any event that disrupts or otherwise negatively impacts manufacturing facilities, manufacturing systems or equipment, or contract manufacturers or other suppliers could result in the delivery of inferior products or our ability to meet customer requirements or service levels.  as the covid-19 pandemic continues, we could face challenges and retailer penalties in continuing to operate our facilities and delivery of on time and in full product shipments as a result of employee absenteeism or sickness, additional governmental or regulatory actions, closures or other restrictions that limit or close our operating and manufacturing facilities or those of our suppliers.
•   we rely on a limited number of contract manufacturers and suppliers, including sole source contract manufacturers and suppliers for certain products, and supply chain issues may result in product shortages or disruptions to the company's business.

we rely on a limited number of contract manufacturers and suppliers for certain of our commodities and raw materials, including sole source suppliers for certain of our raw materials, packaging, product components, finished products and other necessary supplies.  new suppliers must be qualified pursuant to our standards and may also have to be qualified under governmental and industry standards and any other standards of our customers, which can require additional investment and time.  we could experience material disruptions in production and other supply chain issues, largely because of shortages in supplier labor which continues to impact the availability of many raw and packaging materials, which continues to result in out-of-stock conditions.  in addition, continued out-of-stock supplies or products due to supply chain issues may cause our customers to switch to competitors' products that are more available.  moreover, our relationships with customers could be adversely affected if new or existing suppliers are unable to meet any standards set by us, government or industry regulations, or our  customers, if we are unable to contract with suppliers at the quantity, quality and price levels needed for our business, if any of our key suppliers becomes insolvent, ceases or significantly reduces its operations or experiences financial distress, as a result of the covid-19 pandemic or otherwise, or if any environmental, economic or other outside factors impact its operations.  we may be unable to qualify any needed new contract manufacturers or suppliers or maintain supplier arrangements and relationships based on a variety of factors; we may be unable to contract with suppliers at the quantity, quality and price levels needed for our business; certain of our suppliers may not meet the standards of our customers or licensors; or certain of our key contract manufacturers or suppliers may become insolvent or experience other financial distress or face closure or suspension of operations.  if any of these events occurs and we have failed to identify and qualify an alternative vendor, then we may be unable to meet our contractual obligations and customer expectations, which could damage our reputation and result in lost customers and sales, or the incurrence of fines or higher than expected expenses.  further, the covid-19 pandemic has caused worldwide increases in demand for some products and reduced demand for other products, which has caused strain on our supply chain network and its ability to meet such demand.
•   volatility and increases in the price of raw and packaging materials or energy costs could erode our profit margins.

the principal raw materials and packaging used by us and certain of our suppliers and contract manufacturers include surfactants (cleaning agents), paper products and resin-based molded components.  volatility and increases in the price of raw materials, disruptions in production or transportation, or increases in the costs of energy, labor, shipping and other necessary services, could significantly affect our profit margins if we are unable to pass along any higher costs in the form of price increases or otherwise achieve cost efficiencies, such as in manufacturing and distribution.  significant inflation of material, component and co-packer costs impacted our gross margin in 2021.  there is no assurance that we will be able to fully offset any price increases, through cost reduction programs or price increases of our products or enter locked-in price arrangements or hedge agreements, especially given the competitive environment. sustained price increases may lead to declines in volume as competitors may not adjust their prices or customers may decide not to pay the higher prices, which could lead to sales
18
declines and loss of market share. while we seek to project tradeoffs between price increases and volume, our projections may not accurately predict the volume impact of price increases.  in addition, volatility in certain commodity markets could significantly affect our production cost.
from time to time, we use hedge agreements to mitigate the volatility of commodities and diesel fuel prices.  the hedge agreements are designed to add stability to product costs, enabling us to make pricing decisions and lessen the economic impact of abrupt changes in prices over the term of the contract.  however, in periods of declining fuel or other commodity prices, the hedge agreements can have the effect of locking us in at above-market prices.
•   reduced availability of transportation or disruptions in our transportation network could adversely affect us.

we distribute our products and receive raw materials and packaging components primarily by truck, rail and ship and through various ports of entry.  reduced availability of trucking, rail or shipping capacity due to adverse weather conditions, natural disasters, including climatic events (including any potential effect of climate change), allocation of assets to other industries or geographies or otherwise, work stoppages, closure of operations due to government restrictions or sick employees or other impacts of pandemics, strikes or shutdowns of ports of entry or such transportation sources, could lead to inflationary cost pressures, cause us to incur unanticipated expenses and impair our ability to distribute our products or receive our raw materials or packaging components in a timely manner, which could disrupt our operations, strain our customer relationships and competitive position.
•   damage to the reputation of one or more of our leading brands could adversely affect us.

our financial success is directly dependent on the reputation and success of our brands, particularly the arm & hammer, batiste, first response, nair, orajel, oxiclean, trojan, l'il critters and vitafusion, spinbrush, waterpik, xtra, flawless, zicam and therabreath brands.  the effectiveness of these brands could suffer if our marketing plans or product initiatives do not have the desired impact on a brand's image or its ability to attract consumers.  our brands could suffer damage to their reputations due to real or perceived, sustainability, quality or safety issues, including as a result of, among other things, significant product recalls, product-related litigation, defects or impurities in our products, product misuse, changing consumer perceptions of certain ingredients or environmental impacts (including packaging, energy and water use and waste management), or allegations of product tampering.  in addition, as our sales on various e-commerce platforms grow, we may be unable to prevent sales of counterfeit, pirated, or stolen goods, unlawful or unethical sales, unauthorized resellers online, or sales in violation of our policies.
additionally, claims made in our marketing campaigns may become subject to litigation alleging false advertising and could cause us to alter our marketing plans and may affect sales or result in the imposition of significant damages against us.
widespread use of social media and networking sites by consumers has greatly increased the accessibility and speed of dissemination of negative information.  negative online consumer reviews or inaccurate posting or comments about us or our brands in the media or on any social networking website, whether accurate or inaccurate, or the disclosure of non-public sensitive information through social media, could generate adverse publicity that could damage the reputation of our brands.  in addition, given the association of our individual products with us, an issue with one of our products could negatively affect the reputation of our other products, or us as a whole.
•   we are subject to risks related to our expansion and international operations that could adversely affect our results of operations.

our ability to continue to grow our sales and profits is dependent on expanding in the locations in which we already do business and entering into new geographic locations, both of which require significant resources and investments which would affect our risk profile.  further, our international operations subject us to risks customarily associated with foreign operations, including:
•   currency fluctuations;

•   widespread health emergencies, such as covid-19 or other pandemics or epidemics;

•   import and export license and taxation requirements and restrictions;

•   trade restrictions, including local investment or exchange control regulations;

•   changes in tariffs and taxes;

•   the effect of foreign income taxes, value-added taxes and withholding taxes, including the inability to recover amounts owed to us by foreign governments, and the determination of the u.s. internal revenue service (the "i.r.s.") regarding the applicability of certain regulations, including the foreign account tax compliance act, to our international transactions;

•   the possibility of expropriation, confiscatory taxation or price controls;

•   restrictions on or the costs related to repatriating foreign profits back to the u.s.;

•   political or economic instability, and civil unrest;

•   disruptions in the global transportation network, such as work stoppages, strikes or shutdowns of ports of entry or such other transportation sources, or other labor unrest;

•   compliance with laws and regulations concerning ethical business practices, including without limitation, the u.s. foreign corrupt practices act and united kingdom bribery act;

19
•   the impact of the united kingdom's exit from the european union;

•   difficulty in enforcing contractual and intellectual property rights;

•   regulatory and quality system requirements for certain products; and

•   difficulties in staffing and managing international operations.

the covid-19 pandemic has had and may continue to have a negative impact on regional and global economies, with reduced international travel, restrictions and social distancing measures, and recessionary conditions in many countries. major developments in trade relations, including the imposition of new or increased tariffs by the u.s. and/or other countries, and any emerging nationalist trends in specific countries could alter the trade environment and consumer purchasing.  all the foregoing risks could have a significant impact on our ability to commercialize our products on a competitive basis in international markets.
in addition, changes as result of the united kingdom's decision and subsequent negotiations to exit the eu could subject us to heightened risks in that region, including disruptions to trade and free movement of goods, services and people to and from the united kingdom, increased foreign exchange volatility with respect to the british pound and additional legal and economic uncertainty.  additional costs have been incurred in 2020 and 2021 because of measures implemented to address or mitigate risks.   moreover, in all foreign jurisdictions in which we operate, we are subject to laws and regulations that govern foreign investment, foreign trade and currency exchange transactions.  the recent imposition of tariffs on products imported from certain countries has introduced greater uncertainty with respect to trade policies and government regulations affecting trade between the u.s. and other countries. major developments in trade relations, including the imposition of new or increased tariffs by the u.s. and/or other countries, and any emerging nationalist trends in specific countries could alter the trade environment and consumer purchasing behavior which, in turn, could have a material effect on our balance sheet and results of operations.  all the foregoing risks could have a significant impact on our ability to commercialize our products on a competitive basis in international markets and may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows or financial position.
•   failure to effectively utilize or successfully assert intellectual property rights, and the loss or expiration of such rights, could materially adversely affect our competitiveness. infringement by us of third-party intellectual property rights could result in costly litigation and/or the modification or discontinuance of our products.

the market for our products depends to a significant extent upon the value associated with our trademarks and brand names.  we own the material trademarks and brand names used in connection with the marketing and distribution of our major products both in the u.s. and in other countries.  while we hold several valuable patents on our products, they may not serve as an effective barrier to entry for new competitors.  accordingly, we rely on trademark, trade secret, patent and copyright laws to protect our intellectual property rights.  although most of our material intellectual property is registered in the u.s. and in certain foreign countries in which we operate, we cannot be sure that our intellectual property rights will be sufficient or effectively utilized or, if necessary, successfully asserted.  there is a risk that we will not be able to obtain and perfect our own intellectual property rights, or, where appropriate, license from others intellectual property rights necessary to support new product introductions.  we cannot be sure that these rights, if obtained, will not be invalidated, circumvented or challenged in the future, and we could incur significant costs in connection with legal actions relating to such rights.  in addition, even if such rights are obtained in the u.s., the laws of some of the other countries in which our products are or may be sold do not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the u.s.  if other parties infringe our intellectual property rights, they may dilute the value of our brands in the marketplace, which could diminish the value that consumers associate with our brands and harm our sales.  our failure to perfect or successfully assert intellectual property rights could make us less competitive and could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition.
in addition, if our products are found to infringe intellectual property rights of others, the owners of those rights could bring legal actions against us claiming substantial damages for past infringement and seeking to enjoin manufacturing and marketing of the affected products.  if these legal actions are successful, in addition to any potential liability for damages from past infringement, we could be required to obtain a license in order to continue to manufacture or market the affected products, potentially adding significant costs.  we might not prevail in any action brought against us or we may be unsuccessful in securing any license for continued use and therefore have to discontinue the marketing and sale of a product.
•   impairment of our goodwill and other long-lived intangible and tangible assets may result in a reduction in net income.

we have a material amount of goodwill, trademarks and other intangible assets, as well as other long-lived tangible assets, which are periodically evaluated for impairment in accordance with current accounting standards.  declines in our profitability and/or estimated cash flows related to specific intangible assets, as well as potential changes in market valuations for similar assets and market discount rates, has resulted in impairment charges from time to time, and may result in future impairment charges.
20
regulatory and litigation risks
•   we may be subject to product liability claims, withdrawals or recalls or other legal proceedings and from time to time we are involved in litigation, arbitration or regulatory matters where the outcome is uncertain and which could entail significant expense.

from time to time, we are subject to product liability or other product-related claims.  we may be required to pay for losses or injuries actually or purportedly caused by our products, including losses or injuries caused by raw materials or other components provided by third party suppliers that are included in our products.  claims could be based on allegations that, among other things, our products contain contaminants, are improperly tested, labeled or designed, or provide inadequate instructions regarding their use or inadequate warnings of potential dangers related to their use.  whether or not successful, product liability claims could result in negative publicity that could harm our sales and operating results and the reputation of our brands.  in addition, if one of our products is found to be defective or non-compliant with applicable rules or regulations, we could be required to withdraw or recall it, which could result in adverse publicity and significant expenses.  although we maintain product liability and product recall insurance coverage, potential product liability or other product-related damages claims and/or withdrawal and recall costs may exceed the amount of insurance coverage or may be excluded under the terms of the policy.
•   litigation, arbitration or regulatory matters where the outcome is uncertain could entail significant expense.

from time to time, we are the subject of, or party to, various pending or threatened legal actions (including class actions), government investigations and proceedings, including, without limitation, those relating to, commercial transactions, product liability, consumer, employment, antitrust, environmental, health, safety and compliance-related matters.  such proceedings are subject to many uncertainties and the outcome of certain pending or threatened legal actions, investigations and proceedings may not be reasonably predictable and any related damages, injunctions and/or settlements may not be estimable.
•   environmental matters create potential liability risks.

we must comply with various environmental laws and regulations in the jurisdictions in which we operate, including those relating to the handling and disposal of solid and hazardous wastes and the remediation of contamination associated with the use and disposal of hazardous substances.  a release of such substances due to accident or an intentional act could result in substantial liability to governmental authorities or to third parties.  we have incurred, and will continue to incur, capital and operating expenditures and other costs in complying with environmental laws and regulations.
•   we are subject to increasing focus and sensitivity by governmental, non-governmental organizations, customers, consumers and investors to esg issues, including those related to climate change.

as climate change, land use, water use, deforestation, recyclability or recoverability of packaging, plastic waste, ingredients and other esg concerns become more prevalent, federal, state and local governments, non-governmental organizations and our customers, consumers and investors are increasingly concerned about these issues. their requirements and preferences could negatively impact the company's ability to obtain raw materials or could increase its acquisition and compliance costs or cause the company to contribute funds to recycling and other waste management infrastructure, thus making our products more costly, less competitive than other competitive products or reduce consumer demand. this increased focus on esg may result in new laws, regulations and requirements that could cause disruptions in or increased costs associated with manufacturing our products. this could cause us to incur additional costs or to make changes to our operations to comply with any of the foregoing. we could also lose revenue if our consumers change brands or our customers move business from us because we have not complied with their esg requirements and esg-conscious investors may choose not to invest in our common stock if we do not comply with their business expectations.
we have recognized that our customers and consumers are increasingly demanding transparency regarding our efforts to mitigate our impacts on climate change. for example, during 2021, some of our major customers requested we respond to various questionnaires, including the climate disclosure project ("cdp") climate change and forests questionnaires and use our responses and cdp grades to evaluate us.  efforts to meet these standards could impact our costs, and failure to meet our customers' expectations could impact our sales.
certain of our business activities and the production of some of the materials used in our products and certain of our business activities, including petroleum based, agricultural and forest materials, and the growing global demand for livestock products which is a focus of our animal and food production business, contribute to deforestation and climate change and reduction in biodiversity, and can adversely impact water quality and availability, people and communities.  climate change is, in turn, a threat to each of those activities.  while we strive to minimize the environmental impact of our global operations, a potential loss in business could result from reduced demand for our products and loss of customers if we do not meet their expectations related to our efforts towards sustainability and fighting climate change.
21
•   current and future laws and regulations in the countries in which we and our suppliers operate could expose us to increased costs and other adverse consequences.

the development, manufacturing, processing, formulation (including stability), packaging, labeling, marketing, distribution and sale of our products are subject to regulation by federal agencies, including the fda, the ftc, the epa and the cpsc and foreign regulators and agencies.  in addition, our and our suppliers' operations are subject to the oversight of the occupational safety and health administration and the national labor relations board.  our activities are also regulated by various agencies of the states, localities and foreign countries in which our products and their constituent materials and components are manufactured and sold.
in particular, the fda and foreign counterparts regulate the formulation, safety, development, manufacturing, packaging, labeling and distribution of condoms, home pregnancy and ovulation test kits, vaginal lubricants, electric and battery powered medical devices, over-the-counter pharmaceuticals and dietary supplements, including vitamins, minerals, and homeopathic products.  the fda or a similar foreign agency also exercises oversight over cosmetic products such as depilatories.  in addition, under a memorandum of understanding between the fda and the ftc, the ftc has jurisdiction with regard to the promotion and advertising of these products, and the ftc regulates the promotion and advertising of our other products as well.  as part of its regulatory authority, the fda may periodically conduct inspections of the physical facilities, machinery, processes and procedures that we and our suppliers use to manufacture regulated products and may identify compliance issues that would require us and our suppliers to make certain changes in our manufacturing facilities and processes.  the failure of a facility to be in compliance may lead to regulatory action against the products made in that facility, including seizure, injunction or recall, as well as to possible action against the owner of the facility/manufacturer.  we may be required to make additional expenditures to address these issues or possibly stop selling certain products until the compliance issue has been remediated.
likewise, any future determination by the fda or a similar foreign agency, or by us in reviewing our compliance with applicable rules and regulations, that our products or quality systems do not comply with applicable regulations could result in future compliance activities, including product withdrawals or recalls, import detentions, injunctions preventing the shipment of products, or other enforcement actions.  for example, the fda may determine that a particular claim that we use to support the marketing of a product is not substantiated, may not accept the evidence of safety for a new product that we may wish to market, may challenge the safety or effectiveness of existing products based on, among other things, changes in formulations, inadequate stability or "shelf-life," consumer complaints, or improper labeling, and may determine that our dietary supplement business manufacturing, packaging, labeling and holding operations do not comply with cgmps.  similarly, we may identify these or other issues in internal compliance reviews of our operations and the operations and products of vendors and acquired companies.  these other issues may include the identification of contaminants or non-compliant levels of particular ingredients.  any of the foregoing could subject us to adverse publicity, force us to incur unanticipated costs and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.  additionally, delays in the acceptance, review and approval of products by the fda, or other required governmental approvals, may result from government shutdowns due to the failure by congress to enact regular appropriations.
in 2019, our vitafusion brand launched cbd full spectrum hemp extract gummies, a new product line made with full spectrum hemp extract containing cannabidiol ("cbd").  hemp was exempted from federal regulation as a controlled substance under the agriculture improvement act of 2018 (the "2018 farm bill").  the 2018 farm bill did not eliminate or affect regulation of hemp and its derivatives by the fda, ftc, or state governments. we believe that our new product line complies with applicable fda requirements, although the fda takes the position that cbd products cannot be marketed as dietary supplements and that cbd cannot be added to food. to date, the fda's enforcement activity has focused primarily on cbd products that bear express or implied claims suggesting that the products are intended to treat, cure, prevent, or mitigate a disease.  the ftc has similarly focused on disease claims. our products do not bear disease claims.
the fda has not confirmed whether it will engage in rulemaking to permit the marketing of cbd products as dietary supplements.  in the interim, there has been discussion of legislative changes.  for example, s 1698 was introduced in may 2021. s 1698 would amend the fdc act to include hemp-derived cbd in the definition of a dietary supplement. although state laws have been evolving in the wake of the 2018 farm bill, we do not intend to sell our products in states that continue to prohibit sales of certain hemp-based cbd products.  in 2021, our nair brand is launching one depilatory cosmetic product that contains broad spectrum hemp extract. fda's position that cbd products cannot be marketed as dietary supplements and that cbd cannot be added to food does not extend to cosmetic products. we do not intend to sell our nair product in states that continue to prohibit sales of certain hemp-based cbd products. the fda and certain states and local governments may enact regulations or change their enforcement priorities in a manner that further limits the marketing and use of cbd products. we do not know what the impact of such regulatory activities would be on our products, and what costs, requirements, and possible prohibitions may be associated with such regulatory activities. our failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements or fda's or any other state's disagreeing with our interpretation of applicable fda or state requirements could result in, among other things, administrative, civil, or criminal penalties or fines; product seizure, mandatory or voluntary product recalls; warning or untitled letters; cease and desist orders against operations that are not in compliance; closure of facilities or operations; the loss, revocation, or modification of any existing licenses, permits, registrations, or approvals; or the failure to obtain additional licenses, permits, registrations, or approvals in new jurisdictions where we intend to do business. these laws and regulations may change in the future and we may incur material costs in our efforts to comply with current or future laws and regulations or in any product recalls.
we are subject to regulations regarding the transportation, storage or use of certain chemicals to protect the environment, as well as the commission's rules with respect to "conflict minerals." the new administration and congress in the united states may seek to pass more stringent regulations in these areas, or more aggressively enforce existing regulations. recent trade policies, tariffs and government
22
regulations affecting trade between the u.s. and other countries, have introduced greater uncertainty and volatility. in addition, any additional or renewed significant governmental actions pertaining to the covid-19 pandemic, including lockdowns, quarantines or other restrictions on the ability of our employees to travel or perform necessary business functions or our  ability to develop, manufacture, distribute, market or sell our products, or the ability of our suppliers, customers or third-party partners to effectively run their operations, may negatively impact our ability to manufacture, distribute, market and sell our products.  we are not able to predict the nature of these changes or of such future laws, regulations, repeals or interpretations or to predict the effect additional or shifting governmental regulation, when and if it occurs, would have on our business in the future.  such developments could require reformulation of certain products to meet new standards, recalls or discontinuance of certain products not able to be reformulated, additional record-keeping requirements, increased documentation of the properties of certain products, additional or different labeling, additional scientific substantiation, expanded adverse event reporting or other new requirements.
there is also an increased risk of fraud or corruption in certain foreign jurisdictions and related difficulties in maintaining effective internal controls. additionally, we could be subject to future inquiries or investigations by governmental and other regulatory bodies, which may be delayed or disrupted due to any government furlough. we could also be adversely affected by violations, or allegations of violations, of the foreign corrupt practices act and similar international anti-bribery laws. the foreign corrupt practices act and similar international anti-bribery laws generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to government officials or other third parties for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business.
•   we are subject to increasingly stringent privacy and security regulation.

we collect, use and store personal data of our employees, customers and other third parties in the ordinary course of business, and we are required to comply with increasingly complex and changing data privacy and security laws and regulations, that apply to the collection, storage, use, transmission and protection of personal information and other consumer and employee data, including particularly the transfer of personal data between or among countries. recent high-profile security breaches of the information systems of a number of government agencies and u.s. companies may result in increased regulations and new security laws. the new administration and congress in the united states may seek to pass more stringent regulations in these areas, or more aggressively enforce existing regulations.
numerous local, municipal, state, federal and international law and regulations address privacy and security including the california online privacy protection act, the personal information protection and electronic documents act, the controlling the assault of non-solicited pornography and marketing (can-spam) act, the telephone consumer protection act of 1991, the health insurance portability and accountability act of 1996 (hipaa), section 5(c) of the federal trade commission act, and, effective as of january 1, 2020 the california consumer privacy act (ccpa).  these privacy and security laws and regulations change frequently, and new legislation continues to be introduced such as the virginia consumer data protection act and the colorado privacy act which will become effective in 2023.  in particular, the ccpa requires new disclosures to california consumers, gives california consumers new rights with respect to their data, and permits california consumers to opt-out of certain sales of personal information. the ccpa provides for fines of up to $7,500 per violation.
in europe, the european union ("eu") has adopted strict data privacy regulations. following the passage of the eu's general data protection regulation ((eu) 2016/679) ("gdpr") and the regulation on privacy and electronic communications (the "eprivacy regulation"), data privacy and security compliance in the eu are increasingly complex and challenging. the gdpr in particular has broad extraterritorial effect and imposes a strict data protection compliance regime with significant penalties for non-compliance (up to 4% of worldwide annual turnover or €20 million, whichever is higher). it is also important to note that many countries are following the eu in producing a broad omnibus law in relation to privacy protection. for instance, brazil has just published a gdpr-like law. in general, the gdpr and eprivacy regulation, ccpa, and other local privacy laws, could also require adaptation of our technologies or practices, increased costs and changes to operations to satisfy local privacy requirements and standards.
we may also face audits or investigations by one or more domestic or foreign government agencies relating to our compliance with these regulations. an adverse outcome under any such investigation or audit could subject us to fines, penalties or orders to cease, delay or modify collection, use or transfers of personal data. we could also face rights requests, complaints, claims, or litigation from those persons whose data we collect, use and store as well as government investigations and fines. any of these events or other circumstances related to our collection, use and transfer of personal data could also lead to negative media attention, damage to our reputation in the market or otherwise adversely affect our business.
•   changes in tax laws and regulations or in our operations may impact our effective tax rate and may adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results.

our future effective tax rate could be affected by changes in tax laws and regulations or their interpretation, changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates, or changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities.  in addition, we evaluate our deferred income tax assets and record a valuation allowance if it is "more likely than not" that all or a portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized.  if the actual amount of our future taxable income is less than the amount we are currently projecting with respect to specific tax jurisdictions, or if there is a change in the time period within which the deferred tax asset becomes deductible, we could be required to record a valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets.  the recording of a valuation allowance would result in an increase in our effective tax rate and would have an adverse effect on our operating results. in addition, changes in statutory tax rates may change our
23
deferred tax assets or liability balances, which would also impact our effective tax rate.  the biden administration has introduced greater uncertainty with respect to tax policies in the united states and major developments in tax policy could impact our business.
•   resolutions of tax disputes may adversely affect our earnings and cash flow.

significant judgment is required in determining our effective tax rate and in evaluating our tax positions.  we provide for uncertain tax positions with respect to tax positions that do not meet the recognition thresholds or measurement standards mandated by applicable accounting guidance.  fluctuations in federal, state, local and foreign taxes or changes to uncertain tax positions, including related interest and penalties, may impact our effective tax rate and our financial results.  we are regularly under audit by tax authorities, and although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable, the final outcome of tax audits and related litigation could be materially different than that reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals.  in addition, when particular tax matters arise, a number of years may elapse before such matters are audited and finally resolved.  favorable resolution of such matters could be recognized as a reduction to our effective tax rate in the year of resolution.  unfavorable resolution of any tax matter could increase the effective tax rate.  any resolution of a tax issue may require the use of cash in the year of resolution.
•   our amended and restated bylaws include an exclusive forum provision.

our amended and restated bylaws include an "exclusive forum provision, which may limit the ability of our stockholders to bring a claim in a judicial forum that such stockholders find favorable for disputes with us or our directors or officers, which may discourage such lawsuits against us and our directors and officers. if a court outside of delaware were to find this exclusive forum provision inapplicable to, or unenforceable in respect of, one or more of the specified types of actions or proceedings described above, we could incur additional costs associated with resolving such matters in other jurisdictions, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations or cash flows.
financial risks
•   we have substantial indebtedness and we may incur substantially more debt in the future.

as of december 31, 2021, we had approximately $2,563 million of total consolidated indebtedness, net of debt issuance costs.  this amount of indebtedness could have important consequences, including:
•   making it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations;

•   limiting our ability to fund potential acquisitions;

•   requiring us to dedicate a portion of our cash flow from operations to payments on our indebtedness, which would reduce the availability of cash flow to fund capital expenditures and other general corporate purposes;

•   limiting our flexibility in reacting to general adverse economic conditions or changes in our business and the industry in which we operate;

•   limiting our ability to repurchase our common stock; and

•   placing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less debt.

additionally, our credit facility is subject to certain financial and other customary covenants.  in the event of a breach of those covenants, our lenders under the credit facility may be entitled to accelerate the related debt (and any lenders in respect of any other debt to which a cross-default provision applies may be entitled to accelerate such other debt), and we could be required to seek amendments or waivers under the debt instruments or to refinance the debt.  we may incur substantial additional indebtedness in the future to fund acquisitions, to repurchase shares or to fund other activities for general business purposes.  if additional new debt is added to the current debt levels, the related risks that we now face could intensify.  a substantial increase in our indebtedness could also have a negative impact on our credit ratings. in this regard, a deterioration in our credit ratings could adversely affect the interest rate available to us in future financings, as well as our liquidity, competitive position and access to capital markets.  any decision regarding future borrowings will be based on the facts and circumstances existing at the time, including market conditions and impact to our credit ratings.
libor, the interest rate benchmark used as a reference rate on our variable rate debt, including our revolving credit facility, term loan, and interest rate swaps was expected to be fully phased out by the end of 2021, when private-sector banks are no longer required to report the information used to set the rate. however, in late 2020, ice benchmark administration ("iba"), the organization responsible for administering libor, announced its intention to extend the publication of certain usd libor tenors until june 30, 2023.  the alternative
24
reference rates committee ("arrc"), a group convened for the purpose of ensuring a successful transition away from usd libor, has identified the secured overnight financing rate ("sofr") as its preferred alternative rate.  given the inherent differences between libor and sofr or any other alternative benchmark rate that may be established, there are additional uncertainties regarding a transition from libor, including but not limited to the need to amend all contracts with libor as the reference rate and how this will impact our cost of variable rate debt and certain derivative financial instruments. we will also need to consider new contracts and if they should reference an alternative benchmark rate or include suggested fallback language, as published by the arrc from time to time.
•   our business is exposed to domestic and foreign currency fluctuations.

we are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk (both transaction and translation) with respect to our sales, profits, assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the u.s. dollar.  outside of the u.s., sales and costs are denominated in a variety of currencies, including the canadian dollar, euro, pound, mexican peso and australian dollar, among others.  a weakening of the currencies in which sales are generated relative to the currencies in which costs are denominated would decrease operating profits and cash flow.  changes in currency exchange rates may also affect the relative prices at which we purchase materials and services in foreign markets.  although we, from time to time, enter into forward exchange contracts to reduce the impact of foreign exchange rate fluctuations related to anticipated but not yet committed sales or purchases denominated in the u.s. dollar, canadian dollar, pound, euro, mexican peso and australian dollar, foreign currency fluctuations could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
general risks
•   we must successfully manage the demand, supply, and operational challenges associated with the actual or perceived effects of the covid-19 pandemic.

our business and financial results have been, and may continue to be, negatively impacted by the fear of exposure to or actual effects of the covid-19 pandemic, such as, but not limited to:
•   negative impact on the global and u.s. domestic economy, significant unemployment, and market volatility;

•   reduced travel or recommendations or mandates from governmental authorities to avoid various sized gatherings, close facilities, suspend operations, or reduce hours, or to self-quarantine:

•   the impact of the laws or regulations, employee-quarantines or similar other restrictions on our business operations or those of our customers;

•   significant increases in or reductions in demand or significant volatility in demand for one or more of our products, resulting in pressure on our operations and supply chain networks and the ability to meet such demand;

•   inability to meet our retailer orders and customers' needs due to disruptions in our manufacturing and distribution network, supply chain, or capacity constraints or those of our finished goods, raw materials, or transportation suppliers;

•   continued shifts in consumer demand, including accelerated shifts to online shopping and increased competition in e-commerce in many of our categories from our larger legacy competitors and newer digitally native brands which have increasingly moved into consumer products and staples;

•   pricing pressures on our products as retailers face added costs to build their e-commerce capacity;

•   retailer fines related to our underperformance with respect to on time and in full shipments due to restrictions on our ability to produce and deliver products as a result of employee absenteeism or sickness, a tight trucking market or reduced shipping capacity, additional governmental or regulatory actions, closures or other restrictions that limit or close our operating and manufacturing facilities or those of our suppliers;

•   closures or reduced hours by our customers; and

•   the impact of ongoing government orders and the need to protect our workforce.

despite our efforts to manage and remedy these impacts, their ultimate impact also depends on factors beyond our knowledge or control, including the duration and severity of any such outbreak as well as third-party or governmental actions taken to contain its spread and mitigate its public health effects. while the vast majority of our products are consumer staples that generally are less vulnerable to decreases in discretionary spending than other products, some of our products, particularly waterpik and some other personal care brands, are more discretionary in nature and, are more likely to be affected by consumer decisions to control spending and the impact and duration of recessionary economic conditions.
the impact of covid-19, including the impact of restrictions imposed to combat its spread, could result in additional businesses being shut down, additional work restrictions and supply chains being interrupted, slowed, or rendered inoperable, in particular as new covid-19 variants such as the delta and omicron and other new variants spread. as a result, it may be even more challenging to obtain and process raw
25
materials to support our business needs, and more individuals could become ill, quarantined or otherwise unable to work and/or travel due to health reasons or governmental restrictions. also, governments may impose other laws, regulations or taxes which could adversely impact our business, financial condition or results of operations. further, as some of our customers' businesses are similarly affected, they might delay or reduce purchases from us, which could adversely affect our results of our business, financial condition or results of operations. the potential effects of covid-19 also could impact many of the other risk factors described herein, but given the evolving health, economic, social and governmental environments, such potential impact remains uncertain. while we expect the impacts of covid-19 to continue to have an effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations and cash flows, we are unable to predict the extent or nature of these impacts at this time.
•   our operating results have been, and could be in the future, adversely affected by natural disasters, public health crises, political crises, or other catastrophic events, or unfavorable worldwide, regional and local economic and financial market conditions.

our operations, as well as the operations of our third-party manufacturers, suppliers and customers, may be subject to disruption from a variety of causes, including a protracted economic downturn, material shortages, financial difficulties, work stoppages, cyberattacks, and other disruptions in information technology systems, demonstrations, political instability or uncertainty in the u.s. or abroad, rising geopolitical tensions and hostilities (for example between russia and ukraine and china and taiwan), disease outbreaks or pandemics (for example, an outbreak of a virus such as covid-19), acts of war, terrorism, fire, earthquakes, flooding or other natural disasters, disruptions in logistics, loss or impairment of key manufacturing sites, supplier capacity constraints, raw material and product quality or safety issues, industrial accidents or other occupational health and safety issues. if a major disruption were to occur, it could result in harm to people or the natural environment, delays in shipments of products to customers or suspension of operations.
the global economy and the economies in regions in which we conduct business have experienced substantial economic downturns as a result of the covid-19 pandemic. we are currently experiencing reduced demand for certain of our consumer products and may in the future be adversely affected in a material way by lower consumer demand as a result of recessionary economic conditions, including after the direct impact of the covid-19 pandemic has subsided. in addition, ongoing political uncertainty in many countries, including the ongoing political transition in hong kong, and the exit of the united kingdom from the european union have created additional economic uncertainty and volatility in the financial markets.
•   we rely significantly on information technology. any inadequacy, interruption, theft or loss of data, malicious attack, integration failure, failure to maintain the security, confidentiality or privacy of sensitive data residing on our systems or other security failure of that technology could harm our ability to effectively operate our business and damage the reputation of our brands.

we rely extensively on information technology systems, some of which are managed by third-party service providers, to conduct our business.  these systems include, but are not limited to, programs and processes relating to internal communications and communications with other parties, ordering and managing materials from suppliers, converting materials to finished products, shipping product to customers, billing customers and receiving and applying payment, processing transactions, summarizing and reporting results of operations, complying with regulatory, legal or tax requirements, collecting and storing customer, consumer, employee, investor, and other stakeholder information and personal data, and other processes necessary to manage our business.  we sell certain of our products directly to consumers online and through websites, mobile apps and connected devices, and we offer promotions, rebates, customer loyalty and other programs through which it may receive personal information, and we or our vendors could experience cyber-attacks, privacy breaches, data breaches or other incidents that may result in unauthorized access, disclosure and misuse of consumer, customer, employee, vendor or company information.
increased information technology security threats and more sophisticated computer crime, including ransomware, denial of service and phishing attacks and advanced persistent threats, pose a potential risk to the security of our information technology systems, networks, and services, and those of our customers and other business partners, as well as the confidentiality, availability, and integrity of our data, and the data of our customers and other business partners.  as a result, our information technology systems, networks or service providers could be damaged or cease to function properly or we could suffer a loss or disclosure of business, personal or stakeholder information, due to any number of causes, including catastrophic events, power outages and security breaches.  although we have business continuity plans in place and have implemented a breach response plan to address service interruptions, if these plans do not provide effective alternative processes on a timely basis, we may suffer interruptions in our ability to manage or conduct our operations which may adversely affect our business. in addition, if our service providers, suppliers or customers experience a breach or unauthorized disclosure or system failure, their businesses could be disrupted or otherwise negatively affected, which may result in a disruption in our supply chain or reduced customer orders or other business operations.  moreover, any costs related to a breach may exceed the amount of insurance coverage or be excluded under the terms of our cybersecurity policy.   recently, there have been high profile security breaches of the information systems of a number of government agencies and u.s. companies, resulting in significant disruptions.
our information technology systems and, our third-party providers' systems, have been, and will likely continue to be, subject to advanced computer viruses or other malicious codes, ransomware, unauthorized access attempts, denial of service attacks, phishing, social engineering, hacking and other cyberattacks. such attacks may originate from nation states or attempts by outside parties, hackers, criminal organizations or other threat actors.  in addition, insider actors-malicious or otherwise-could cause technical disruptions and/or confidential
26
data leakage. to date, we have seen no material impact on our business or operations from these attacks; however, we cannot guarantee that our security efforts will prevent attacks and resulting breaches or breakdowns of our, or our third-party service providers' databases or systems.  in addition, although we have policies and procedures in place governing the secure storage of personal information collected by us or our third-party service providers, data breaches due to human error or intentional or unintentional conduct may occur in the future.
we continuously perform enterprise-wide upgrades to our systems and will continue to monitor and upgrade systems as appropriate, legacy systems may be vulnerable to increased risk. additionally, if a new system does not function properly, it could affect our ability to order supplies, process and deliver customer orders and process and receive payments for our products. this could adversely impact our results of operations and cash flows.  upgraded or new technology may not function as designed and any such upgrades may not go as planned. moreover, because the techniques, tools and tactics used in cyberattacks frequently change and may be difficult to detect for periods of time, we may face difficulties in anticipating and implementing adequate preventative measures or fully mitigating harms after such an attack. as such, we may need to expend additional resources and incur additional costs in the future to continue to protect against or address problems caused by any business interruptions or data security breaches.
•   we may not be able to attract, retain and develop key personnel.

the labor market in the united states is very competitive.  our future performance depends in significant part upon the continued service of our executive officers and other key personnel, including at our plants. competition for qualified plant personnel has been intense. the loss of the services of one or more executive officers or other key employees, including as a result of illness to themselves or their families due to the covid-19 pandemic or otherwise, could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations.  this effect could be exacerbated if any officers or other key personnel left as a group or at the same time.  our success also depends, in part, on our continuing ability to attract, retain and develop highly qualified and diverse personnel.  competition for such personnel is intense, and there can be no assurance that we can retain our key employees or attract, assimilate and retain other highly qualified personnel in the future.  factors that may affect our ability to attract and retain sufficient numbers of key employees include employee morale, our reputation, competition from other employers and the availability of qualified personnel in a tightening labor market. we have experienced increased levels of personnel turnover in recent years, increasing from an employee turnover rate of 14.9% in 2020 to an employee turnover rate of 20.6% in 2021. we may continue to experience increased personnel turnover in the future compared to prior years, either as a result of our business operations, or as a result of the covid-19 pandemic or other broad-based economic or cultural factors.
•   our continued growth and expansion, reliance on third-party service providers and implementation of new accounting standards could adversely affect our internal control over financial reporting.

our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the u.s. because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting cannot provide absolute assurance that a misstatement of our financial statements would be prevented or detected. our continuing growth and expansion in domestic and globally dispersed markets, such as our acquisition of waterpik, flawless, passport, zicam, therabreath and others, may place significant additional pressure on our system of internal control over financial reporting and require us to update our internal control over financial reporting to integrate such acquisitions. moreover, we engage the services of third parties to assist with business operations and financial reporting processes, which injects additional monitoring obligations and risk into the system of internal control. when we are required to comply with new or revised accounting standards, we must make any appropriate changes to our internal control over financial reporting to fully implement the standards, which may require significant effort and judgment. any failure to maintain an effective system of internal control over financial reporting could limit our ability to report our results of operations accurately and on a timely basis, or to detect and prevent fraud and could expose us to regulatory enforcement action and stockholder claims.
•   our business could be negatively impacted as a result of stockholder activism, an unsolicited takeover proposal or a proxy contest or short sellers.

in recent years, proxy contests, unsolicited takeovers and other forms of stockholder activism have been directed against numerous companies in our industry, including us. if such a campaign or proposal were to be made against us, we would likely incur significant costs. stockholder activists may also seek to involve themselves in the governance, strategic direction and operations of our business through stockholder proposals or otherwise disrupting our business and diverting the attention of our management and employees, and any perceived uncertainties as to our future direction resulting from such a situation could result in the loss of potential business opportunities, the perception that we need a change in the direction of our business, or the perception that we are unstable or lack continuity, which may be exploited by our competitors, cause concern to our current or potential customers, and may make it more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified personnel and business partners. actions of activist stockholders may cause significant fluctuations in our stock price based on temporary or speculative market perceptions or other factors that do not necessarily reflect the underlying fundamentals and prospects of our business.  we may also be the target of short sellers who engage in negative publicity campaigns that may use selective information that may be presented out of context or that may misrepresent facts and circumstances.

item 7.   management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations

management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements.
overview our business we develop, manufacture and market a broad range of consumer household, personal care and specialty products focused on animal and food production, chemicals and cleaners.  we focus our consumer products marketing efforts principally on our 14 "power brands."  these well-recognized brand names include arm & hammer®, used in multiple product categories such as baking soda, cat litter, carpet deodorization and laundry detergent; trojan® condoms, lubricants and vibrators; oxiclean® stain removers, cleaning solutions, laundry detergent and bleach alternatives; spinbrush® battery-operated and manual toothbrushes;  first response® home pregnancy and ovulation test kits; nair® depilatories; orajel® oral analgesic; xtra® laundry detergent; l'il critters® and vitafusion® gummy dietary supplements; batiste® dry shampoos; waterpik® water flossers and replacement showerheads; flawless® products;  zicam® cold shortening and relief products and therabreath® oral care products.
we sell our consumer products under a variety of brands through a broad distribution platform that includes supermarkets, mass merchandisers, wholesale clubs, drugstores, convenience stores, home stores, dollar, pet and other specialty stores and websites and other e-commerce channels, all of which sell the products to consumers. we sell our specialty products to industrial customers, livestock producers and through distributors.
we operate our business in three segments: consumer domestic, consumer international and the specialty products division ("spd").  the segments are based on differences in the nature of products and organizational and ownership structures.  in 2021, the consumer domestic, consumer international and spd segments represented approximately 76%, 18% and 6%, respectively, of our consolidated net sales.
covid-19 pandemic and other recent developments the covid-19 pandemic continues to impact most of our businesses.  as certain government restrictions were reduced or removed, we have experienced increased demand for certain product categories, mainly in the united states, including arm & hammer cat litter, vitafusion and l'il critters gummy vitamins, and batiste dry shampoo, that had been negatively impacted by the temporary and permanent closures of certain retailers, reduced consumer foot traffic at retailers, and covid-19 related precautionary measures. overall, we have continued to experience increased online sales.
we continue to experience challenges to meet customer demand, largely because of broad-based shortages in suppliers' labor which impact the availability of many critical components in our supply chain and distribution. additionally, we and our suppliers are experiencing significant broad-based inflation of manufacturing and distribution costs as well as transportation challenges.  we expect shortages to continue at least through the first half of 2022 and input cost inflation to continue at least throughout 2022.
to attempt to offset some of these cost pressures, we have recently enacted and continue to evaluate price increases. in addition, to address challenges meeting customer demand, we have taken steps to increase our short-term manufacturing capacity for many of our products (including laundry detergent, baking soda, cleaners and vitamins) as well as our raw material and packaging capacity, and continue to work closely with our suppliers, contract manufacturers and retail partners to increase capacity and ensure sustained supply to keep pace with increased demand.  we have also made investments in the expansion of long-term, in-house and third-party manufacturing capacity and are working to enlist additional suppliers that meet our quality specifications.  while we expect supply availability issues to start improving in the second half of 2022 for most of our brands, there is no assurance that these challenges will abate in the foreseeable future or that our customers will accept all or a portion of any price increases, or that the other measures we have or may implement will mitigate the impact of supply disruptions or rising costs.
looking forward, the extent that covid-19 and other recent developments' have on our operational and financial performance will depend on future developments, including the duration, spread and intensity of the pandemic, the spread and severity of new variants such as omicron, the impact of vaccines, and our continued ability to manufacture and distribute our products, as well as any future government actions affecting employers, consumers and the economy generally, all of which are uncertain and difficult to predict considering the rapidly evolving landscape. our priorities during the covid-19 pandemic continue to be protecting the health and safety of our employees; maximizing the availability of products that help consumers with their health, hygiene and cleaning needs; and using our employees' talents and our resources to help society meet and overcome the current challenges.

we are monitoring the impact of both inflation and the covid-19 pandemic, including the effect of corresponding government actions on consumer demand, and how these factors will potentially influence future cash flows for the short and long term.  while we expect that many of these effects will not be permanent, it is impossible to predict their duration.
2021 financial highlights key 2021 financial results include:
•   2021 net sales grew 6.0% over 2020, with gains in all three of our segments. the gains are primarily due to favorable pricing/product mix in the consumer domestic and spd segments, partially offset by unfavorable pricing/product mix in consumer international, as well as favorable volumes in the consumer international and spd segments, partially offset by slightly decreased sales volumes in the consumer domestic segment. changes in foreign exchange rates and acquisitions also contributed to 2021 sales growth.

•   gross margin decreased 160 basis points to 43.6% in 2021 from 45.2% in 2020, primarily due to higher manufacturing costs including labor, raw materials and components, as well as higher transportation costs, and higher tariffs, partially offset by favorable volumes/price/product mix, the impact of productivity programs, and business acquisition benefits.

•   operating margin decreased 20 basis points to 20.8% in 2021 from 21.0% in 2020, reflecting a lower gross margin percentage, partially offset by lower marketing costs and selling general and administrative costs as a percentage of sales (including the higher favorable impact of the flawless business acquisition liability adjustments.)

•   we reported diluted net earnings per share in 2021 of $3.32, an increase of approximately 6.4% from 2020 diluted net earnings per share of $3.12.

•   cash provided by operations was $993.8 in 2021, a $3.5 increase from the prior year, as higher cash earnings (net income adjusted for non-cash items) were partially offset by higher working capital.

•   we returned $747.5 in 2021 to our stockholders through dividends and share repurchases.

strategic goals, challenges and initiatives our ability to generate sales depends on consumer demand for our products and retail customers' decisions to carry our products, which are, in part, affected by general economic conditions in our markets. while a vast majority of our products are consumer staples and less vulnerable to decreases in discretionary spending than other products, an increasing number of our products, particularly those from our recent acquisitions, are more likely to be affected by consumer decisions to control spending.  some customers have responded to economic conditions by increasing their private label offerings (primarily in the dietary supplements, diagnostic kits and oral analgesics categories), launching their own brands, and consolidating the product selections they offer to the top few leading brands in each category.  in addition, an increasing portion of our product categories are being sold by club stores, dollar stores, mass merchandisers and internet-based retailers.  these factors have placed downward pressure on our sales and gross margins.
we intend to continue to aggressively pursue several key strategic initiatives: maintain competitive marketing and trade spending, tightly control our cost structure, continue to develop and launch new and differentiated products, and pursue strategic acquisitions.  we also intend to continue to grow our product sales globally and maintain an offering of premium and value brand products to appeal to a wide range of consumers.
we derive a substantial percentage of our revenues from sales of liquid laundry detergent. as a result, any delays or reduction of sales of these products, in the event that our product category diversification efforts discussed below are not successful, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results and cash flows. condom usage has declined over the last decade.  however, after a large decline in condom sales during 2020 due to social distancing, the condom category began to recover in 2021 with fewer social restrictions leading to an increase in sexual activity. however, there is no assurance the category will not decline in the future and that we will be able to offset any such decline.
we are continuously focused on strengthening our key brands through the launch of innovative new products, which span various product categories, including premium and value household products supported by increased marketing and trade spending.  there can be no assurance that these measures will be successful.
in the domestic business, six out of 13 "power brands" met or exceeded category growth for the full year 2021. with the acquisition of therabreath, we now have 14 "power brands".  our global product portfolio consists of both premium (60% of total worldwide consumer revenue in 2021) and value (40% of total worldwide consumer revenue in 2021) brands, which we believe enables us to succeed in a range of economic environments.  we intend to continue to develop a portfolio of appealing new products to build loyalty among cost-conscious consumers.

over the past two decades, we have diversified from an almost exclusively u.s. business to a global company with approximately 18% of sales derived from countries outside of the united states in 2021.  we have subsidiary operations in seven countries (canada, mexico, u.k., france, germany, china and australia) and sell into over 130 other countries.  in 2021, we benefited from our expanded global footprint and expect to continue to focus on selectively expanding our global business.  if we are unable to expand our business internationally at the rate that we expect, we may not realize our anticipated growth targets.
although we believe ongoing international expansion represents a significant opportunity to grow our business, our increasing activity in global markets exposes us to additional complexity and uncertainty.  sales generated outside of the u.s. are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations as well as political uncertainty which could impact future operating results.  moreover, the current domestic and international political environment, including existing and potential changes to u.s. policies related to global trade and tariffs, have resulted in uncertainty regarding the global economy. the impact of u.s. tariffs on certain products was a component of increased cost of sale during the year ended december 31, 2021. the implementation of more restrictive trade policies, such as higher tariffs or new barriers to entry, in countries in which we manufacture or sell large quantities of products could negatively impact our business, cash flows, results of operations and financial condition.
we also continue to focus on controlling our costs.  historically, we have been able to mitigate the effects of cost increases primarily by implementing cost reduction programs and, to a lesser extent, by passing along cost increases to customers.  we have also entered into set pricing and pre-buying arrangements with certain suppliers and hedge agreements for diesel fuel and other commodities. additionally, our focus on tight cost controls has enabled us to effectively navigate recent challenging economic conditions.  in 2021, due to the significant increase in input costs, we have not been able to fully mitigate the impact of these increases with cost control measures and productivity programs.  we have, and will continue to, implement price increases to address cost inflation.  however, we cannot be certain that these price increases will be accepted by customers.
the identification and integration of strategic acquisitions are an important component of our overall strategy and product category diversification.  acquisitions have added significantly to our sales and profits and product category diversification over the last decade.  this is evidenced by our 2015 acquisition of certain assets of varied industries corporation (the "vi-cor acquisition"), the 2016 acquisitions of spencer forrest, inc., the maker of toppik (the "toppik acquisition"), and the anusol and rectinol businesses from johnson & johnson (the "anusol acquisition"), the 2017 acquisitions of viviscal from lifes2good holdings limited (the "viviscal acquisition"), agro biosciences, inc. (the "agro acquisition"), and waterpik from pik holdings, inc. (the "waterpik acquisition"),  the 2018 acquisition of passport food safety solutions, inc. (the "passport acquisition"), the 2019 acquisition of flawless; the 2020 acquisition of zicam from consumer health holdco llc and the 2021 acquisition of therabreath from dr. harold katz, llc and hk-ip international, inc.  the failure to effectively identify or integrate any acquisition or achieve expected synergies may cause us to incur material asset write-downs.  we actively seek acquisitions that fit our guidelines, and our strong financial position provides us with flexibility to take advantage of acquisition opportunities.  in addition, our ability to quickly integrate acquisitions and leverage existing infrastructure has enabled us to establish a strong track record in making accretive acquisitions.  since 2001, we have acquired 13 of our 14 "power brands".
we believe we are positioned to meet the ongoing challenges described above due to our strong financial condition, experience operating in challenging environments and continued focus on key strategic initiatives.  our focus is to maintain competitive marketing and trade spending, manage our cost structure, continue to develop and launch new and differentiated products, while pursuing strategic acquisitions.  this focus, together with the strength of our portfolio of premium and value brands, has enabled us to succeed in a range of economic environments.  moreover, the generation of a significant amount of cash from operations combined with an investment grade credit rating, provides us with the financial flexibility to pursue acquisitions, drive new product development, make capital expenditures to support organic growth and gross margin improvements, return cash to stockholders through dividends and share buy backs, and reduce outstanding debt.  these factors position us to continue to increase stockholder value over the long-term.
for information regarding risks and uncertainties that could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition and cash flows, see "risk factors" in item 1a of this annual report.
recent developments therabreath acquisition on december 24, 2021, we acquired all of the outstanding equity of dr. harold katz, llc and hk-ip international, inc., the owners of the therabreath brand of oral care products business (the "therabreath acquisition").  we paid $556.0, net of cash acquired, at closing and deferred an additional cash payment of $14.0 related to certain indemnity obligations provided by the seller.  the additional amount, to the extent not used in satisfaction of such indemnity obligations, is payable in installments between two and four years from the closing.  therabreath's annual net sales for the year ended december 31, 2021 were approximately $100.  the acquisition was financed by the proceeds from a $400.0 three-year term loan and an underwritten public offering of $400.0 aggregate principal senior notes due on december 15, 2031 (as defined below) completed on december 10, 2021.  the therabreath business is managed in the consumer domestic and consumer international segments.

dividend increase on january 28, 2022, the board declared a 4% increase in the regular quarterly dividend from $0.2525 to $0.2625 per share, equivalent to an annual dividend of $1.05 per share payable to stockholders of record as of february 15, 2022.  the increase raises the annual dividend payout from $248.0 to approximately $255.0.
accelerated share repurchase program in december 2021, we entered into an asr contract with a commercial bank to purchase common stock.  we paid $200.0 to the bank, inclusive of fees, and received an initial delivery of shares equal to $180.0, or 1.8 million shares.  we used cash on hand and short-term borrowings to fund the initial purchase price.  upon the completion of the asr, which ended in february 2022, the bank delivered an additional 0.2 million shares to us.  the final shares delivered to us were determined by the average price per share paid by the bank during the purchase period.  all 2.0 million shares were purchased under the 2021 share repurchase program.
as a result of our recent stock repurchases, there remains $729.7 of share repurchase availability under the 2021 share repurchase program as of december 31, 2021.

critical accounting policies and estimates our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the u.s. (gaap).  the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities.  by their nature, these judgments are subject to uncertainty.  they are based on our historical experience, our observation of trends in industry, information provided by our customers and information available from other outside sources, as appropriate.  our significant accounting policies and estimates are described below.
revenue recognition and promotional and sales return reserves virtually all of our revenue represents sales of finished goods inventory and is recognized when received or picked up by our customers.  the reserves for consumer and trade promotion liabilities and sales returns are established based on our best estimate of the amounts necessary to settle future and existing claims on products sold as of the balance sheet date.  promotional reserves are provided for sales incentives, such as coupons to consumers, and sales incentives provided to customers (such as slotting, cooperative advertising, incentive discounts based on volume of sales and other arrangements made directly with customers).  all such costs are netted against sales.  slotting costs are recorded when the product is delivered to the customer.  cooperative advertising costs are recorded when the customer places the advertisement for our products.  discounts relating to price reduction arrangements and coupons are recorded when the related sale takes place.  costs associated with end-aisle or other in-store displays are recorded when product that is subject to the promotion is sold.  we rely on historical experience and forecasted data to determine the required reserves.  for example, we use historical experience to project coupon redemption rates to determine reserve requirements.  based on the total face value of consumer domestic coupons redeemed over the past several years, if the actual rate of redemptions were to deviate by 0.1% from the rate for which reserves are accrued in the financial statements, a difference of approximately $0.1 in the reserve required for coupons would result.  with regard to other promotional reserves and sales returns, we use experience-based estimates, customer and sales organization inputs and historical trend analysis in arriving at the reserves required.  if our estimates for promotional activities and sales returns reserves were to change by 10% the impact to promotional spending and sales return accruals would be approximately $11.3.  while management believes that its promotional and sales returns reserves are reasonable and that appropriate judgments have been made, estimated amounts could differ materially from actual future obligations.
impairment of goodwill, trade names and other intangible assets carrying values of goodwill and indefinite-lived trade names are reviewed periodically for possible impairment.  finite intangible assets are assessed when there are business triggering events.  our impairment analysis is based on a discounted cash flow approach that requires significant judgment with respect to unit volume, revenue and expense growth rates, and the selection of an appropriate discount rate and royalty rate.  management uses estimates based on expected trends in making these assumptions.  with respect to goodwill, impairment occurs when the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds the discounted present value of cash flows for that reporting unit.  for trade names and other intangible assets, an impairment charge is recorded for the difference between the carrying value and the net present value of estimated future cash flows, which represents the estimated fair value of the asset.  judgment is required in assessing whether assets may have become impaired between annual valuations.  indicators such as unexpected adverse economic factors, unanticipated technological change, distribution losses, or competitive activities and acts by governments and courts may indicate that an asset has become impaired.  the result of our annual goodwill impairment test determined that the estimated fair value substantially exceeded the carrying values of all reporting units.  in addition, there were no goodwill impairment charges for each of the years in the three-year period ended december 31, 2021.
fair value for indefinite lived intangible assets was estimated based on a "relief from royalty" or "excess earnings" discounted cash flow method, which contains numerous variables that are subject to change as business conditions change, and therefore could impact fair values in the future.  we determined that the fair value of all intangible assets for each of the years in the three-year period ended december 31, 2021 exceeded their respective carrying values based upon the forecasted cash flows and profitability. however, in recent years our trojan business, specifically the condom category, has not grown and competition has increased resulting in a reduction in expected future cash flows.  in addition, the covid-19 pandemic has further negatively impacted condom sales due to social distancing.  as a result, the trojan business has experienced sales and profit declines that has eroded a significant portion of the excess between the fair and carrying value of the tradename, which, if these trends continue, could potentially result in an impairment.  however, the condom category began to recover in 2021 as fewer social restrictions led to an increase in sexual activity with less shutdowns and governmental restrictions.  while management can and has implemented strategies to address the risk, significant changes in operating plans or adverse changes in the future could reduce the underlying cash flows used to estimate fair values and could result in a decline in fair value that could trigger future impairment charges of these assets.
it is possible that our conclusions regarding impairment or recoverability of goodwill or other intangible assets could change in future periods if, for example, (i) the businesses or brands do not perform as projected, (ii) overall economic conditions in future years vary from current assumptions (including changes in discount rates), (iii) business conditions or strategies change from current assumptions, (iv) investors require higher rates of return on equity investments in the marketplace or (v) enterprise values of comparable publicly traded

companies, or actual sales transactions of comparable companies, were to decline, resulting in lower multiples of revenues and ebitda.  a future impairment charge for goodwill or intangible assets could have a material effect on our consolidated financial position or results of operations.
income taxes income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method.  deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized to reflect the future tax consequences attributable to the differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases, and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards.  deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which the differences are expected to be recovered or settled.  management provides a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets for amounts which are not considered "more likely than not" to be realized.  we record liabilities for potential assessments in various tax jurisdictions under u.s. gaap guidelines.  the liabilities relate to tax return positions that, although supportable by us, may be challenged by the tax authorities and do not meet the minimum recognition threshold required under applicable accounting guidance for the related tax benefit to be recognized in the income statement.  we adjust this liability as a result of changes in tax legislation, interpretations of laws by courts, rulings by tax authorities, changes in estimates and the expiration of the statute of limitations.  many of the judgments involved in adjusting the liability involve assumptions and estimates that are highly uncertain and subject to change.  in this regard, settlement of any issue, or an adverse determination in litigation, with a taxing authority could require the use of cash and result in an increase in our annual tax rate.  conversely, favorable resolution of an issue with a taxing authority would be recognized as a reduction to our annual tax rate.

(1)   on december 24, 2021, we acquired all of the outstanding equity of dr. harold katz, llc and hk-ip international, inc., the owners of the therabreath brand of oral care products (the "therabreath acquisition"). on december 1, 2020, we acquired all of the outstanding equity of consumer health holdco llc, the owner of the zicam brand and cold remedy products business (the "zicam acquisition"). the results of these acquisitions are included in our results since the date of acquisition.

the volume change reflects increased product sales in the consumer international and spd segments, partially offset by slightly decreased sales in the consumer domestic segment. price/mix was favorable in the consumer domestic and spd segments, but was partially offset by slightly unfavorable price/mix in the consumer international segment.
our gross profit for 2021 was $2,263.5, a $49.3 increase compared to 2020.  gross margin was 43.6% in 2021 compared to 45.2% in 2020, a 160 basis points ("bps") decrease.  the decrease is due to the impact of higher manufacturing costs including labor and commodities of 400 bps, higher transportation costs of 80 bps, and higher costs of 30 bps as a result of incremental tariffs, partially offset by favorable price/volume/mix of 200 bps, the impact of productivity programs of 130 bps and business acquisition benefits of 20 bps.
operating costs marketing expenses for 2021 were $577.7, a decrease of $13.5 compared to 2020.  we reduced marketing spending, mainly in household products, as supply shortages impacted our ability to meet customer demand.  marketing expenses as a percentage of net sales decreased 100 bps to 11.1% in 2021 as compared to 2020 due to 70 bps of leverage on higher net sales and 30 bps on lower expenses.

(dollars in millions, except share and per share data)
sg&a expenses for 2021 were $606.7, an increase of $13.4 or 2.3% compared to 2020.  the increase is primarily due to higher expenses related to the zicam acquisition (including amortization), asset impairment charges of $11.3 associated with the passport business acquired in 2018, and the prior year gain on the sale of perl weiss®, partially offset by lower incentive compensation and litigation costs.  sg&a as a percentage of net sales decreased 40 bps to 11.7% in 2021 compared to 12.1% in 2020.  the decrease is due to 70 bps of leverage associated with higher sales offset by 30 bps on higher expenses.  the favorable adjustment to the fair value of the flawless business acquisition liability, which is recognized as a reduction in expense, was $98.0 in 2021 compared to $94.0 in 2020.
other income and expenses other expense increased nominally in 2021 as compared to 2020.
interest expense in 2021 was $54.5, a decrease of $6.5. the decrease is primarily due to lower interest rates.
taxation the 2021 u.s. federal effective income tax rate was 19.8% compared to 19.3% in 2020. the increase of 50 basis points was impacted by a favorable tax settlement in 2020.

(4)   2021 results include a $98.0 reduction in sg&amp;a expenses to reduce the flawless business acquisition liability, of which $83.2 was recorded to consumer domestic and $14.8 was recorded to consumer international.

(5)   2020 results include a $94.0 reduction of sg&amp;a expenses to reduce the flawless business acquisition liability, of which $79.9 was recorded to consumer domestic and $14.1 was recorded to consumer international. during 2020, we sold our perl weiss toothpaste brand in germany resulting in a reduction in sg&amp;a expenses of $3.0 recorded in consumer international.

(6)   2019 results include an sg&amp;a charge associated with selling our consumer business in brazil of $7.6 recorded in consumer international and a $10.0 sg&amp;a charge to adjust the flawless business acquisition liability, of which $8.5 was recorded to consumer domestic and $1.5 was recorded to consumer international. these charges were partially offset by a $7.3 adjustment to the passport business acquisition liability and a $1.5 adjustment to the agro business acquisition liability, both of which reduced sg&amp;a expenses in spd.

consumer domestic
2021 compared to 2020
consumer domestic net sales in 2021 were $3,941.9, an increase of $174.3 or 4.6% compared to net sales of $3,767.6 in 2020.  the components of the net sales change are the following:
net sales - consumer domestic    december 31, 2021

product volumes sold                           (0.3   %)
pricing/product mix                             3.9    %
acquired product lines (1)                      1.0    %
net sales increase                              4.6    %
(1)   includes the therabreath and zicam acquisitions since the date of acquisition.

the increase in net sales for 2021 reflects the impact of the therabreath and zicam acquisitions, higher net sales in arm & hammer clumping cat litter, waterpik oral care products, vitafusion and l'il critters gummy vitamins, batiste dry shampoo, arm & hammer scent booster, and oxiclean powder.
in recent years our trojan business, specifically the condom category, had not grown and competition has increased.  social distancing requirements due to the covid-19 pandemic had further negatively impacted the business.  as a result, the trojan business had experienced stagnant sales and profits resulting in a reduction in expected future cash flows which eroded a portion of the excess between the fair and carrying value of the tradename.  this indefinite-lived intangible asset may be susceptible to impairment risk and a continued decline in fair value could trigger a future impairment charge of the trojan tradename.  while management can and has implemented strategies to address the risk, including lowering our production costs, investing in new product ideas, and developing new creative advertising, significant changes in operating plans or adverse changes in the future could reduce the underlying cash flows used to estimate fair value.  in 2021, trojan experienced a recovery in sales and profits as it is benefiting from an easing of covid-19 social restrictions leading to an increase in sexual activity. we expect this trend will continue into next year with the continued adoption of vaccines, the reduction of social distancing restrictions and the benefit of management strategies to improve sales and profitability.
consumer domestic income before income taxes for 2021 was $861.4, a $29.0 increase as compared to 2020.  the increase is due primarily to favorable price/mix of $135.6, a $31.0 benefit from higher sales volumes, lower marketing expenses of $18.6, lower sg&a expenses of $10.3 (including a $3.3 favorable year-over-year fair value adjustment to the flawless business acquisition liability), and lower interest and other expenses of $5.8, mostly offset by unfavorable manufacturing and distribution expenses of $171.9.
consumer international
2021 compared to 2020
consumer international net sales in 2021 were $912.2, an increase of $84.0 or 10.1% as compared to 2020.  the components of the net sales change are the following:
net sales - consumer international    december 31, 2021

product volumes sold                                 5.3    %
pricing/product mix                                 (0.3   %)
foreign exchange rate fluctuations                   5.1    %
net sales increase                                  10.1    %
excluding the impact of foreign exchange rates, higher sales were driven primarily by femfresh® feminine hygiene products, vitafusion and l'il critters gummy vitamins, sterimar nasal spray, and nair depilatories in the gmg business.
consumer international income before income taxes was $127.3 in 2021, an increase of $22.3 compared to 2020 due to a $26.4 benefit from higher sales volumes, favorable foreign exchange rates of $8.8, lower marketing expenses of $1.9 and lower interest expense of $0.2, offset by unfavorable manufacturing and commodity costs of $11.4, higher sg&a costs of $2.4 (partially due to the prior year gain on the sale of perl weiss of $3.0), and unfavorable price/product mix of $1.2.

2021 compared to 2020
spd net sales were $336.0 for 2021, an increase of $36.0, or 12.0% compared to 2020.  the components of the net sales change are the following:
net sales - spd       december 31, 2021

product volumes sold                   4.6   %
pricing/product mix                    7.4   %
net sales increase                    12.0   %
net sales increased due to higher volumes across all categories, higher pricing for our dairy segment products and reduced competitive imports due to a constrained transportation market.
spd income before income taxes was $33.6 in 2021, an increase of $3.9 compared to 2020.  the increase in income before income taxes for 2021 is due primarily to favorable price/product mix of $22.4 and a $3.8 benefit from higher sales volumes, which were partially offset by unfavorable manufacturing costs of $17.6, higher sg&a costs of $4.0 primarily due to asset impairments in the passport business of $11.3, and higher marketing expenses of $0.8.
corporate corporate includes administrative costs of the production, planning and logistics functions which are allocated to the operating segments in sg&a expenses but are elements of cost of sales in our consolidated statements of income.  such amounts were $47.1, $59.8 and $48.2 for 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.
also included in corporate are the equity in earnings of affiliates from armand and armakleen, totaling $9.4, $6.7 and $6.6 for the three years ended december 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.
liquidity and capital resources on may 1, 2019, we amended the credit agreement (the "credit agreement") that provides for our $1,000.0 unsecured revolving credit facility (the "revolving credit facility") to extend the term of the revolving credit facility from march 29, 2023 to march 29, 2024.  we continue to have the ability to increase our borrowing up to an additional $600.0, subject to lender commitments and certain conditions as described in the credit agreement.  borrowings under the credit agreement are available for general corporate purposes.
as of december 31, 2021, we had $240.6 in cash and cash equivalents, and approximately $746.0 available through the revolving facility under our credit agreement and our commercial paper program.  to preserve our liquidity, we invest cash primarily in government money market funds, prime money market funds, short-term commercial paper and short-term bank deposits.
on december 22, 2021, we entered into a $400.0 unsecured term loan facility with various banks.  the loan was fully drawn at closing. unless prepaid, the loan is due on december 22, 2024.  the interest rate is libor plus an applicable margin based on our credit rating, which can range from 60 basis points ("bps") to 125 bps.  the proceeds of the loan were used to partially fund the therabreath acquisition, with the remaining proceeds used for the repayment of commercial paper.
additionally, we financed the therabreath acquisition with a portion of the proceeds from an underwritten public offering of $400.0 aggregate principal amount senior notes due 2031 (the "2031 notes").  these notes bear interest at 2.3% and were issued in an underwritten transaction under an indenture with deutsche bank trust company americas, as trustee.  interest on the 2031 notes is payable semi-annually, on each june 15 and december 15.  the 2031 notes will mature on december 15, 2031, unless earlier retired or redeemed.
we financed the waterpik acquisition with a portion of the proceeds from an underwritten public offering of $1,425.0 aggregate principal amount of senior notes completed on july 25, 2017, consisting of $300.0 aggregate principal amount of floating rate senior notes that were due in 2019 and have been fully repaid, $300.0 aggregate principal amount of 2.45% senior notes due 2022, $425.0 aggregate principal amount of 3.15% senior notes due 2027 and $400.0 aggregate principal amount of 3.95% senior notes due 2047 (collectively with the 2031 notes, the "senior notes").  the $300.0 floating rate senior notes, which matured and were repaid in full with cash on hand and commercial paper on january 25, 2019, bore interest at a rate, reset quarterly, equal to three-month libor plus 0.15%.

(dollars in millions, except share and per share data)
on september 26, 2012, we issued $400.0 aggregate principal amount of 2.875% senior notes due 2022 (the "2022 notes").  the 2022 notes were issued under the second supplemental indenture, dated september 26, 2012 (the "bny mellon second supplemental indenture") to the indenture dated december 15, 2010 (the "bny mellon base indenture") between us and the bank of new york mellon trust company, n.a., as trustee.  these notes will mature on october 1, 2022, unless earlier retired or redeemed pursuant to the terms of the bny mellon second supplemental indenture.
in 2021, we repaid the $300.0 term loan due may 1, 2022 that was used to partially fund the flawless acquisition in 2019, with proceeds from commercial paper borrowings and cash on hand.
in 2015, we initiated a supply chain finance program ("scf program").  under the scf program, qualifying suppliers may elect to sell their receivables from us for early payment. participating suppliers negotiate their receivables sales arrangements directly with a third party. we are not party to those agreements and do not have an economic interest in the supplier's decision to sell their receivables.  the scf program may allow suppliers more favorable terms than they could secure on their own.  the terms of our payment obligations are not impacted by a supplier's participation in the scf program.   our payment terms with suppliers are consistent between suppliers that elect to participate in the scf program and those that do not participate.  as a result, the program does not have an impact to our average days outstanding.
all amounts outstanding to suppliers participating in the scf program are recorded within accounts payable in our consolidated balance sheets, and the associated payments are included in operating activities within our consolidated statements of cash flows.
the current economic environment presents risks that could have adverse consequences for our liquidity.  see the discussion of this and other risks under "risk factors" in item 1a of this annual report.  although there is uncertainty related to the impact of the covid-19 pandemic on our future results, we believe our efficient business model and strong balance sheet position us to manage our business through this crisis. we continue to manage all aspects of our business including, but not limited to, monitoring the financial health of our customers, suppliers and other third-party relationships, implementing gross margin enhancement strategies and developing new opportunities for growth.  we do not anticipate that current economic conditions will adversely affect our ability to comply with the financial covenant in the credit agreement because we currently are, and anticipate that we will continue to be, in compliance with the maximum leverage ratio requirement under the credit agreement.
in december 2020, we entered into an accelerated share repurchase ("asr") contract with a commercial bank to purchase common stock.  we paid $300.0 to the bank, inclusive of fees, and received an initial delivery of shares equal to $270.0, or 3.1 million shares.  we used cash on hand and short-term borrowings to fund the initial purchase price.  upon the completion of the asr, which ended in february 2021, the bank delivered to us an additional 0.4 million shares.  the final shares delivered to us were determined by the average price per share paid by the bank during the purchase period.  all 3.5 million shares were purchased under our evergreen program.
in august 2021, we executed an agreement to purchase up to $200.0 of our common stock through october 31, 2021.  we purchased 1.6 million shares for approximately $130.0 through october, inclusive of fees, all of which was purchased under the 2017 share repurchase program.
on october 28, 2021, the board authorized a new share repurchase program under which we may purchase up to $1,000.0 in shares of common stock (the "2021 share repurchase program").  the 2021 share repurchase program does not have an expiration and replaces our 2017 share repurchase program.  all remaining dollars authorized for repurchase under the 2017 share repurchase plan have been cancelled.  the 2021 share repurchase program does not modify our evergreen share repurchase program, authorized by the board on january 29, 2014, under which we may repurchase, from time to time, common stock to reduce or eliminate dilution associated with issuances of common stock under our incentive plans.
in december 2021, we executed open market purchases of 1.8 million shares for $170.3, inclusive of fees, of which $100.0 was purchased under the evergreen share repurchase program and $70.3 was purchased under the 2021 share repurchase program.  in december 2021, we also entered into an asr contract with a commercial bank to purchase common stock.  we paid $200.0 to the bank, inclusive of fees, and received an initial delivery of shares equal to $180.0, or 1.8 million shares.  we used cash on hand and short-term borrowings to fund the initial purchase price.  upon the completion of the asr, which ended in february 2022, the bank delivered an additional 0.2 million shares to us.  the final shares delivered to us were determined by the average price per share paid by the bank during the purchase period.  all 2.0 million shares were purchased under our 2021 share repurchase program.
as a result of our recent stock repurchases, there remains $729.7 of share repurchase availability under the 2021 share repurchase program as of december 31, 2021.
on january 28, 2022, the board declared a 4% increase in the regular quarterly dividend from $0.2525 to $0.2625 per share, equivalent to an annual dividend of $1.05 per share payable to stockholders of record as of february 15, 2022.  the increase raises the annual dividend payout from $248.0 to approximately $255.0.

we anticipate that our cash from operations, together with our current borrowing capacity, will be sufficient to fund our share repurchase programs to the extent implemented by management, pay debt and interest as it comes due and pay dividends at the latest approved rate, and meet our capital expenditure program costs, which are expected to be approximately $216.0 in 2022 primarily for manufacturing capacity investments in laundry, litter and vitamins to support expected future sales growth.  cash, together with our current borrowing capacity, may be used for acquisitions that would complement our existing product lines or geographic markets.

2021 compared to 2020
net cash provided by operating activities - our primary source of liquidity is our cash flow provided by operating activities, which is dependent on the level of net income and changes in working capital.  our net cash provided by operating activities in 2021 increased by $3.5 to $993.8 as compared to $990.3 in 2020 as higher cash earnings (net income adjusted for non-cash items) were mostly offset by higher working capital.  the increase in working capital is primarily related to lower obligations for incentive compensation and marketing.  we measure working capital effectiveness based on our cash conversion cycle.  the following table presents our cash conversion cycle information for the quarters ended december 31, 2021 and 2020:
as of

december 31, 2021           december 31, 2020   change days of sales outstanding in accounts receivable ("dso")                    28                          28           -

our cash conversion cycle (defined as the sum of dso plus dio less dpo) at december 31, 2021, which is calculated using a two period average method, decreased 4 days from the prior year due to an increase in dpo of 6 days due to payable term extensions partially offset by an increase in dio of 2 days.  we continue to focus on reducing our working capital requirements.
net cash used in investing activities - net cash used in investing activities during 2021 was $682.0, primarily reflecting $556.0 for the therabreath acquisition and $118.8 for property, plant and equipment additions.  net cash used in investing activities during 2020 was $608.1, primarily reflecting $512.7 for the zicam acquisition, $98.9 for property, plant and equipment additions, partially offset by cash proceeds of $7.0 from the sale of the perl weiss toothpaste brand in germany.
net cash used in financing activities - net cash used in financing activities during the twelve months of 2021 was $252.1, reflecting $500.0 of repurchases of our common stock, $247.5 of cash dividend payments and $3.9 of financing costs, partially offset by $400.7 of net debt borrowings, and $98.7 of proceeds from stock option exercises. net cash used in financing activities during the twelve months of 2020 was $360.1, reflecting $300.0 of repurchases of our common stock, $237.3 of cash dividend payments, and $14.5 for the agro business acquisition liability settlement, partially offset by $99.0 of short-term debt borrowings, net of repayments, and $93.0 of proceeds from stock option exercises.

other items market risk concentration of risk a group of three customers accounted for approximately 37% of consolidated net sales in 2021 and 36% in 2020 and 2019, respectively, of which a single customer, walmart, accounted for approximately 24%, 23% and 24% in 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.
interest rate risk we had outstanding total debt at december 31, 2021, of $2,562.9, net of debt issuance costs, of which approximately 75% has a fixed weighted average interest rate of 3.0% and the remaining 25% was constituted of commercial paper issued by us that currently has a weighted average interest rate of approximately 0.30% and the term loan due 2024 with a current rate of approximately 0.80%  in 2019, we entered into interest rate swap lock agreements to hedge the risk of changes in the interest payments attributable to changes in the benchmark libor interest rate associated with anticipated issuances of debt.  the notional amount of the interest rate swap locks is $300.0. these interest rate swap lock agreements have been designated as hedges of the changes in fair value of the underlying debt obligation attributable to changes in interest rates and are accounted for as fair value hedges.  the fair value of the interest rate swap lock agreements is $41.6 and is reflected in the consolidated balance sheet included in this annual report within accounts payable and accrued expenses as it will be settled in 2022.
other market risks we are also subject to market risks relating to our diesel and other commodity costs, fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, and changes in the market price of the common stock.  refer to note 3 to the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report for a discussion of these market risks and the derivatives used to manage the risks associated with changing diesel fuel and other commodity prices, foreign exchange rates and the price of our common stock.

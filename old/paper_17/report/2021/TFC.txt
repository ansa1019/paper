the following discussion sets forth some of the more important risk factors that could materially affect truist's financial condition and operations. when a risk factor spans several risk categories, the risks have been listed by their primary risk category. the risks described are not all inclusive. additional risks that are not presently known or risks deemed immaterial may have a material adverse effect on truist's financial condition, results of operations, business, and prospects.
merger-related risks truist may not be able to successfully integrate the companies or to realize the anticipated benefits of the merger.
the company was formed by the merger of bb&t and suntrust on december 6, 2019. since the closing of the merger, truist has expended significant time and resources, and incurred substantial expenses, in the integration of systems, operations, and teammates of bb&t and suntrust. although many integration milestones have been achieved, important integration steps remain to be completed. in addition, the core bank conversion of heritage suntrust clients occurred in february 2022. conversion activities remain subject to validation, and issues related to this and other conversions may not be discovered until a later date. additionally, systems that are no longer being used may still need to be retained for a period of time.
20 truist financial corporation truist may encounter difficulties as it completes integration activities, such as:
•the loss of key teammates and clients;
•the disruption of operations and businesses;
•loan, deposit, and revenue attrition;
•inconsistencies in standards, control procedures and policies;
•unexpected issues with planned branch and other facilities closures;
•unexpected issues with costs, operations, teammates, technology; and
•problems with the assimilation of new operations, sites, or teammates.
integration activities have and will continue to divert resources from regular operations. in addition, general market and economic conditions or governmental actions affecting the financial industry may inhibit the company's continued integration of the heritage entities.
bb&t and suntrust merged with the expectation that the merger would result in various synergies, including benefits relating to enhanced revenues, a strengthened and expanded market position for the combined organization, technology efficiencies, cost savings, and operating efficiencies. achieving the anticipated benefits of the merger is subject to a number of uncertainties, including whether the company continues the integration of the institutions in an efficient and effective manner, as well as general competitive factors in the marketplace. failure to achieve or delays in achieving these anticipated benefits could result in a share price reduction as well as increased costs, decreases in the amount of expected revenues, and diversion of management's time and energy and could materially and adversely affect the company's financial condition, results of operations, business and prospects.
truist will continue to incur substantial expenses related to the merger and the integration.
there continue to be processes, policies, procedures, operations, technologies, and systems that must be integrated or decommissioned. in addition, the merger may increase the company's compliance and legal risks, including increased litigation or regulatory actions such as fines or restrictions related to the business practices or operations of the combined business.
while the company has assumed that a certain level of expenses would be incurred, there are many factors beyond the company's control that could affect the total amount or the timing of the integration expenses. moreover, many of the expenses that will be incurred are, by their nature, difficult to estimate accurately. the amount and timing of future charges to earnings as a result of merger or integration expenses remain uncertain.
covid-19 risks the effects of covid-19 have adversely impacted the company's operations; the duration and impact of these effects is still unknown.
although the global economy has begun to recover from the covid-19 pandemic, as many health and safety restrictions have been lifted and vaccine distribution has increased, certain adverse consequences of the pandemic continue to impact the macroeconomic environment and may persist, including labor shortages and disruptions of global supply chains. the growth in economic activity and demand for goods and services, alongside labor shortages and supply chain complications, has also contributed to rising inflationary pressures.
since the onset of the pandemic, the majority of the company's workforce has been working remotely, which may increase cybersecurity risks to the company. commercial clients are experiencing varying levels of disruptions or restrictions on their business activity and supply chains, closures of facilities or decreases in demand for their products and services. consumer clients are experiencing interrupted income or unemployment. certain industries have been particularly susceptible to the effects of the pandemic, including industries where truist has outstanding loans to clients. the duration of this severe economic disruption and its related financial impact cannot be reasonably estimated at this time.
the effects of the pandemic initially resulted in an increase in the allowance for credit losses, a reduction of fee income, a reduction of net interest margin, a decrease in demand for certain types of loans, and an increase in expenses. a resurgence of the pandemic could reintroduce or continue to worsen these impacts and also affect the company's capital and liquidity position, impair the ability of borrowers to repay outstanding loans, impair the value of collateral securing loans, cause an outflow of deposits, influence the recognition of credit losses on loans and securities and further increase the allowance for credit losses, result in additional lost revenue, cause additional increases in expenses, result in goodwill impairment charges, result in the impairment of other financial and nonfinancial assets, and increase the company's cost of capital.

since the inception of the covid-19 pandemic governmental authorities enacted regulations, and protocols, including governmental programs to provide economic relief to businesses and individuals. the application of forbearance and payment deferral policies beyond any statutory requirements may impact truist's interest income. truist participated in the sba's ppp as an eligible lender with the benefit of a government guaranty of loans to small business clients, many of whom may face difficulties even after being granted such a loan. the company faces increased risks, in terms of credit, fraud risk, and litigation, in light of participation in this program.
the extent to which the consequences of the covid-19 pandemic affect the company's financial condition, results of operation, and liquidity and capital position will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted, including the rate of distribution and administration of vaccines globally, the severity and duration of any resurgence of covid-19 variants, future actions taken by governmental authorities, central banks and other third parties in response to the pandemic, and the effects on customers, counterparties, employees and third-party service providers. moreover, the effects of the covid-19 pandemic will heighten the other risks described in this annual report on form 10-k.
climate risks physical, transition, or other risks associated with climate change have the potential to negatively impact operations, business results, and clients.
there is an increasing concern over the risks of climate change and related environmental sustainability matters. climate change presents (i) physical risks from the direct impacts of changing climate patterns and acute weather events, such as damage to physical assets and service disruptions, and (ii) transition risks from changes in regulations, disruptive technologies, and shifting market dynamics towards a lower carbon economy. the physical risks of climate change include discrete events, such as flooding, hurricanes, tornadoes, and wildfires, and longer-term shifts in climate patterns, such as extreme heat, sea level rise, and more frequent and prolonged drought. physical risks may alter the company's strategic direction in order to mitigate certain financial risks. such events could also disrupt the company's operations or those of its clients or third parties the company relies on, not only through direct damage to assets, but also from indirect impacts due to supply chain disruption and market volatility. while material impact from climate change is expected to occur over a longer time horizon, the acceleration of a transition to a low-carbon economy could present idiosyncratic risks for individual companies. additionally, transitioning to a low-carbon economy will entail extensive policy, legal, technology, and market initiatives.
transition risks, including changes in consumer preferences, additional regulatory requirements or taxes and additional counterparty or customer requirements, could have a material adverse impact on asset values and the financial performance of truist's businesses, and those of its clients. climate change could also present incremental risks to the execution of the company's long-term strategy.
additionally, the company faces potential reputational risks as a result of its practices related to climate change, including as a result of the company's direct or indirect involvement in certain industries, as well as any decisions management makes in response to managing climate risk. as climate risk is interconnected with all key risk types, truist continues to embed climate risk considerations into risk management strategies. due to the level of uncertainty around the future path of climate change, the company's risk management strategies may not be effective in fully mitigating climate risk exposures.
market risks changes in interest rates could adversely affect revenue and expenses, the value of assets and liabilities, as well as the availability and cost of capital, and liquidity.
truist's balance sheet can be sensitive to movements in market interest rates and spreads. in addition to the impact of the general economy, changes in interest rates or in valuations in the debt or equity markets could directly impact the company in one or more of the following ways:
•the yield on earning assets and rates paid on interest-bearing liabilities may change in disproportionate ways; or
•the value of financial instruments held could change adversely.
regional and local economic conditions, competitive pressures and the policies of regulatory authorities affect interest income and interest expense. when interest rates rise, funding costs may rise faster than the yield the company earns on assets, causing interest margin to contract. higher interest rates may also result in lower mortgage production income and elevated charge-offs in certain categories of the loan portfolio. conversely, when interest rates fall, the yield the company earns on assets may fall faster than the company's ability to lower rates paid on deposits or borrowings.
22 truist financial corporation certain investment securities, notably mbs, are very sensitive to changes in rates. generally, when rates rise, prepayments will decrease and the duration of mbs will increase. conversely, when rates fall, prepayments of principal and interest will increase and the duration of mbs will decrease.
the monetary and fiscal policies of the u.s. federal government could have a material adverse effect on profitability.
changes in monetary and fiscal policies, including frb policies, can adversely affect profitability and cannot be controlled or predicted by the company. frb policies can:
•significantly impact the cost of funds, as well as the return on assets, both of which can have an impact on interest income;
•materially affect the value of financial assets and liabilities;
•adversely affect borrowers through higher debt servicing costs and potentially increase the risk that they may fail to repay their loan obligations; and
•artificially inflate asset values during prolonged periods of accommodative policy, which could in turn cause volatile markets and rapidly declining collateral values during times of restrictive monetary and fiscal policies.
while interest rates remain low, the frb is expected to begin raising interest rates during 2022. truist cannot predict the nature or timing of future changes in monetary policies or the precise effects that they may have on the company's activities and financial results.
elevated inflation and expectations for elevated future inflation can adversely impact economic growth, consumer and business confidence, and the company's financial condition and results. in addition, elevated inflation may cause unexpected changes in monetary policies and actions which may adversely affect confidence, the economy, and the company's financial condition and results.
financial results, lending or other business activities could be materially affected by a deterioration of economic conditions.
a prolonged period of slow growth in the u.s. economy as a whole or in any regional markets that truist serves, or any deterioration in economic conditions or the financial markets may disrupt or dampen the economy, which could materially adversely affect the company's financial condition and results.
if economic conditions deteriorate, the company may see lower demand for loans by creditworthy clients, reducing the company's interest income. in addition, if unemployment levels increase or if real estate prices decrease, the company would expect to incur higher charge-offs and may incur higher expenses in connection with adjustments to the reasonable and supportable forecasts used to estimate the allowance for credit losses in accordance with cecl requirements. these conditions may adversely affect not only consumer loan performance but also commercial and industrial and commercial real estate loans, especially for those businesses that rely on the health of industries or properties that may suffer from deteriorating economic conditions. the ability of these borrowers to repay their loans may be reduced, causing the company to incur higher credit losses.
the deterioration of economic conditions also could adversely affect financial results for the company's fee-based businesses. truist earns fee income from, among other activities, managing assets for clients, and providing brokerage and other investment advisory and wealth management services. investment management fees are often based on the value of assets under management and a decrease in the market prices of those assets could reduce the company's fee income. changes in stock or fixed income market prices or client preferences could affect the trading activity of investors, reducing commissions and other fees earned from the company's brokerage business. poor economic conditions and volatile or unstable financial markets would likely adversely affect the company's capital markets-related businesses.
instability in global economic conditions and geopolitical matters, as well as volatility in financial markets, could have a material adverse effect on the company's results of operations and financial condition.
instability in global economic conditions and geopolitical matters, as well as volatility in financial markets, could have a material adverse effect on the company's results of operations and financial condition. the macroeconomic environment in the united states is susceptible to global events and volatility in financial markets. for example, trade negotiations between the u.s. and other nations remains uncertain and could adversely impact economic and market conditions for the company and its clients and counterparties. in addition, global demand for products may exceed supply during the economic recovery from the covid-19 pandemic, and such shortages may cause inflation, adversely impact consumer and business confidence, and adversely affect the economy as well as the company's financial condition and results.

the replacement of libor could adversely affect truist's profitability and financial condition.
libor and certain other interest rate benchmarks are the subject of recent national, international, and other regulatory guidance and proposals for reform. these reforms have caused and may continue to cause such benchmarks to perform differently than in the past, disappear entirely, or have other consequences which cannot be predicted.
a transition away from the widespread use of libor to alternative rates and other potential interest rate benchmark reforms will continue over the course of the next few years. the publication of the one-week and two-month u.s. dollar libor settings ceased as of december 31, 2021, while certain u.s. dollar libor tenors are expected to continue to be published until june 30, 2023. the u.s. federal banking agencies have encouraged banks to cease entering into new contracts that use u.s. dollar libor by december 31, 2021.
a group of market participants convened by the frb, the arrc, has selected sofr as its recommended alternative to u.s. dollar libor. truist offers sofr-based lending solutions to wholesale and consumer clients, and enters into sofr-based derivative contracts. truist will also support "credit sensitive" alternatives, such as bloomberg short term bank yield and other alternatives as they develop in the market. at this time, it is impossible to predict whether sofr will become an accepted alternative to libor.
sofr or other alternative reference rates may perform differently than libor in response to changing market conditions. for example, sofr could experience greater decreases during times of economic stress, which could require the company to lend at lower rates at times when the company's borrowing costs are increasing.
the market transition away from libor to alternative reference rates is complex and could have a range of adverse effects on the company's business, financial condition, and results of operations. in particular, any such transition could:
•adversely affect the interest rates received or paid on the revenue and expenses associated with or the value of the company's libor-based assets and liabilities;
•adversely affect the interest rates received or paid on the revenue and expenses associated with or the value of other securities or financial arrangements, given libor's role in determining market interest rates globally;
•prompt inquiries or other actions from regulators in respect of the company's preparation and readiness for the replacement of libor with an alternative reference rate; and
•result in disputes, litigation, or other actions with borrowers or counterparties about the interpretation and enforceability of certain fallback language in libor-based contracts and securities.
the transition away from libor to an alternative reference rate or rates will require the transition to or development of appropriate systems, models, and analytics to effectively transition the company's risk management and other processes from libor-based products to those based on the applicable alternative reference rate, such as sofr. truist has developed a libor transition team and project plan that outlines timelines and priorities to prepare its processes, systems, and people to support this transition. there can be no guarantee that these efforts will successfully mitigate the operational risks associated with the transition away from libor to an alternative reference rate.
the manner and impact of the transition from libor to an alternative reference rate, as well as the effect of these developments on the company's funding costs, loan, investment and trading securities portfolios, and alm, is uncertain.
credit risks the company is subject to credit risk by lending or committing to lend money, or entering into a letter of credit or other types of contracts with counterparties.
truist incurs credit risk, which is the risk of loss if the company's borrowers or counterparties fail to perform according to the terms of their contracts. a number of products expose the company to credit risk, including loans and leases, lending commitments, derivatives, trading assets and investment securities. changes in credit quality can have a significant impact on the company's earnings and capital position. the company estimates and establishes contractual lifetime reserves for credit risks and credit losses inherent in its determination of credit exposure. this process, which is critical to the company's financial results and condition, requires complex calculations and extensive use of judgment, considering both external and borrower-specific factors that might impair the ability of borrowers to repay their loans. as is the case with any such assessments, there is always the chance that the company will fail to identify all pertinent factors or that the company will fail to accurately estimate the impacts of factors identified.
credit losses may exceed the amount of the company's reserves as a result of changing economic conditions, including falling real estate or commodity prices and higher unemployment or other factors such as changes in borrower behavior. there is no assurance that reserves will be sufficient to cover all credit losses. in the event of significant deterioration in current or projected future economic conditions, the company may be required to increase reserves in future periods, which would reduce the company's earnings and potentially impact its capital.
24 truist financial corporation the company may have more credit risk and higher credit losses to the extent that loans are concentrated by loan type, industry segment, borrower type, or location of the borrower or collateral.
the company's credit risk and credit losses can increase if the company's loans are concentrated in borrowers engaged in the same or similar activities or in borrowers who as a group may be uniquely or disproportionately affected by economic, market conditions, or climate change.
deterioration in economic conditions, housing conditions, or real estate values, including as a result of climate change or natural disasters, in the markets in which the company operates could result in materially higher credit losses. the company is also subject to physical risks of climate change, which could manifest in the form of asset quality deterioration and could be exacerbated by specific portfolio concentrations, and transition risks of climate change, which could manifest through longer-term shifts in market dynamics and consumer preferences and could be exacerbated in specific industries that may be more sensitive or vulnerable to a transition to a low carbon economy.
liquidity risks loss of deposits or a change in deposit mix could increase truist's funding costs.
deposits are a low cost and stable source of funding. truist competes with banks and other financial institutions for deposits and as a result, could lose deposits in the future or see an increase in costs associated with maintaining deposits. clients may shift their deposits into higher cost products or the company may need to raise interest rates to avoid deposit attrition. funding costs may also increase if deposits lost are replaced with wholesale funding. higher funding costs reduce truist's net interest margin, net interest income, and net income.
truist's liquidity could be impaired by an inability to access short-term funding, an unforeseen outflow of cash, or the inability to monetize liquid assets.
liquidity is essential to truist's businesses. when volatility or disruptions occur in the wholesale funding markets, the company's ability to access short-term liquidity could be materially impaired. in addition, idiosyncratic factors, as well as other factors outside of the company's control, such as a general market disruption or an operational problem that affects third parties, could impair the company's ability to access short-term funding or create an unforeseen outflow of cash due to, among other factors, draws on unfunded commitments or deposit attrition. the company's inability to monetize liquid assets or to access short-term funding or capital markets could constrain the company's ability to make new loans or meet existing lending commitments and could ultimately jeopardize the company's overall liquidity and capitalization.
truist relies on the mortgage secondary market and gses for some of the company's liquidity.
truist sells a portion of the mortgage loans that it originates to reduce the company's retained credit risk and to provide funding capacity for originating additional loans. gses could limit their purchases of conforming loans due to capital constraints or other changes in their criteria for conforming loans (e.g., maximum loan amount or borrower eligibility). this potential reduction in purchases could limit the company's ability to fund new loans.
proposals have been presented to reform the housing finance market in the u.s., including the role of the gses in the housing finance market. the extent and timing of any such regulatory reform of the housing finance market and the gses, as well as any effect on the company's business and financial results, are uncertain.
any reduction in the company's credit ratings could increase the company's cost of funding or reduce its access to the capital markets.
credit ratings are influenced by many factors, including the company's profitability, asset quality, capital levels, liquidity, business mix, operations, and risk management practices. credit ratings may also be influenced by other factors, some of which are outside the company's control, such as recent and anticipated economic trends, geopolitical risk, legislative and regulatory developments, including implied levels of government support during a crisis, environmental, social, and governance considerations, and litigation, as well as changes to the rating agencies' methodologies, among others. truist's failure to maintain credit ratings could adversely affect funding costs and increase the company's cost of capital. a downgrade to truist's credit ratings might also adversely impact the company's ability to conduct derivatives business with certain clients and counterparties and could trigger obligations to make cash or collateral payments to certain clients and counterparties. additionally, a ratings downgrade could affect the company's ability to attract or retain funding, including deposits from commercial and corporate clients.
truist financial corporation 25
the parent company could have less access to funding sources and its liquidity could be constrained if the bank becomes unable to pay dividends during a time of stress.
the parent company relies upon capital markets access and dividends from affiliates for funding and has less access to contingent funding sources than the bank. if the bank were subject to a financial stress, its dividends to the parent company could be reduced or eliminated in order to support bank capital ratios or other regulatory requirements. this would increase the parent company's reliance on capital markets at a time when spreads and funding costs are likely elevated due the stress impacting the bank.
compliance risks truist is subject to extensive and evolving government regulation and supervision, which could increase the cost of doing business, limit truist's ability to make investments and generate revenue, and lead to costly enforcement actions.
the banking and financial services industries are highly regulated. truist is subject to supervision, regulation, and examination by regulators, including the frb, fdic, nccob, sec, cftc, cfpb, finra, nfa, and various state regulatory agencies. the statutory and regulatory framework governing truist is generally intended to protect depositors, the dif, clients, and the u.s. financial system as a whole, and not truist's debt holders or shareholders. reform of the financial services industry resulting from the dodd-frank act, including the egrrcpa and other legislative, regulatory, and technological changes, affect the company's operations.
these laws and regulations and truist's inability to act in certain instances without receiving prior regulatory approval affect truist's lending practices, capital structure, investment practices, dividend policy, ability to repurchase common stock and ability to pursue strategic acquisitions, among other activities. changes to statutes, regulations or regulatory policies or their interpretation or implementation and the continued heightening of regulatory requirements could affect truist in substantial and unpredictable ways. federal and state banking regulators also possess broad powers to take supervisory actions as they deem appropriate. these supervisory actions may result in higher capital requirements, higher deposit insurance premiums, and limitations on the company's activities that could have a material adverse effect on operations or profitability.
in recent years, both congress and the federal banking regulators have engaged in a rebalancing of the post financial crisis legal and regulatory framework, particularly by tailoring enhanced prudential standards to the size, risk profile, and complexity of the banking organization. under the current presidential administration and congress, the company and other large financial institutions are becoming subject to increased scrutiny, more intense supervision and regulation, and a higher risk of enforcement action. truist expects that its businesses will remain subject to extensive regulation and supervision. any potential new regulations or modifications to existing regulations would likely necessitate changes to truist's existing regulatory compliance and risk management infrastructure. compliance with new regulations and supervisory initiatives may increase costs. in addition, concerns over climate change may prompt changes in regulations that, in turn, could have a material adverse impact on asset values and the financial performance of truist's businesses and its clients.
truist is subject to heightened requirements under the enhanced prudential standards and expects increased supervisory scrutiny, including, for example, single counterparty credit limits, heightened expectations with respect to governance, risk management and internal controls and additional capital and liquidity requirements.
financial regulators' prudential and supervisory authority gives them broad power and discretion to direct truist's actions, and they have assumed an active oversight, examination, and enforcement role across the financial services industry on both the federal and state levels. areas of focus in the recent past have been with respect to mortgage-related practices, student lending practices, auto lending practices, sales practices and related incentive compensation programs, consumer privacy, fair banking, overdraft fees, and other consumer compliance matters. during november 2019, suntrust bank entered into a consent order with the frb, relating to certain identified legacy compliance issues, and requiring certain remediation actions and the verification of such actions regarding the identified issues. in june 2021, the fdic terminated this consent order. truist continues to be subject to examinations and ongoing monitoring to assess compliance with bsa/aml laws and regulations, as well as sanctions compliance administered by the ofac. additionally, misconduct by teammates, including unethical, fraudulent, improper, or illegal conduct, or other unfair, deceptive, abusive, or discriminatory practices, can result in litigation, or government investigations and enforcement actions, and cause significant reputational harm. see additional disclosures in the "regulatory considerations" section.
26 truist financial corporation the company is subject to laws, rules, and regulations regarding compliance with privacy policies and the disclosure, collection, use, sharing and safeguarding of personal identifiable information of certain parties. there has recently been an increase in legislative and regulatory efforts to protect the privacy of consumer data. truist will likely be subject to new and evolving data privacy laws in the u.s. and abroad, which could result in additional costs of compliance, litigation, regulatory fines, and enforcement actions. these laws may limit how companies can use customer data and may increase compliance complexity and related costs, result in significant financial penalties for compliance failures, and limit the company's ability to develop new products or respond to technological changes. truist also relies upon third parties who may expose the company to compliance and legal risk. new or existing legal requirements also could heighten the reputational impact of perceived misuses of customer data by the company and third parties.
heightened regulatory scrutiny or the results of an investigation or examination may lead to additional regulatory investigations or enforcement actions. there is no assurance that those actions will not result in regulatory settlements or other enforcement actions against truist. furthermore, a single event involving a potential violation of law or regulation may give rise to numerous and overlapping investigations and proceedings, either by multiple federal and state agencies and officials in the united states or, in some instances, regulators and other governmental officials in foreign jurisdictions. in addition, if another financial institution is found to have violated a law or regulation relating to certain business activities, this could lead to investigations by regulators or other governmental agencies of the same or similar activities by other financial institution, including truist. responding to inquiries, investigations, lawsuits, and proceedings is time-consuming and expensive and can divert senior management attention from truist's business. the outcome of such proceedings, which may last a number of years, may be difficult to predict or estimate.
federal law grants substantial enforcement powers to federal banking regulators and law enforcement agencies. this enforcement authority includes, among other things, the ability to assess significant civil or criminal monetary penalties, fines, or restitution; to issue cease and desist or removal orders; and to initiate injunctive actions against banking organizations and institution-affiliated parties. these enforcement actions may be initiated for violations of laws and regulations and unsafe or unsound practices.
a failure to comply with regulatory requirements and expectations could expose the company to fines, regulatory penalties, other costs, reputational damage and regulatory or enforcement actions, such as limitations on engaging in new activities or expanding geographically. in some cases, governmental authorities have required criminal pleas or other extraordinary terms as part of such settlements, which could have significant consequences for a financial institution, including loss of clients, restrictions on the ability to access the capital markets and the inability to operate certain businesses or offer certain products for a period of time. violations of laws and regulations or deemed deficiencies in risk management practices also may be incorporated into truist's confidential supervisory ratings. a downgrade in these ratings or these or other regulatory actions and settlements, could limit truist's ability to conduct expansionary activities for a period of time and require new or additional regulatory approvals before engaging in certain other business activities. any future enforcement action could have a material adverse impact.
truist could become subject to future legislation and regulatory requirements beyond those currently proposed, adopted, or contemplated, including policies and rulemaking related to dodd-frank act, limits on acquisitions, the covid-19 pandemic, and climate change. the cumulative effect of such legislation and regulations on truist's' business, operations, and profitability remains uncertain. such regulatory changes may reduce truist's revenues, limit the types of financial services and products it may offer, alter the investments it makes, affect the manner in which it operates its businesses, increase its litigation and regulatory costs should it fail to appropriately comply with new or modified laws and regulatory requirements and increase the ability of non-banks to offer competing financial services and products.
truist is subject to regulatory capital and liquidity standards that affect the company's business, operations, and ability to pay dividends, or otherwise return capital to shareholders.
truist is subject to regulatory capital and liquidity requirements established by the frb and the fdic. these regulatory capital and liquidity requirements are typically developed at an international level by the bcbs and then applied, with adjustments, in each country by the appropriate domestic regulatory bodies. domestic regulatory agencies have the ability to apply stricter capital and liquidity standards than those developed by the bcbs. in several instances, the u.s. banking agencies have done so with respect to u.s. banking organizations.
requirements to maintain specified levels of capital and liquidity and regulatory expectations as to the quality of the company's capital and liquidity may prevent the company from taking advantage of opportunities in the best interest of shareholders or force the company to take actions contrary to their interests. for example, truist may be limited in its ability to pay or increase dividends or otherwise return capital to shareholders. in addition, these requirements may impact the amount and type of loans the company is able to make. truist may be constrained in its ability to expand, either organically or through mergers and acquisitions. these requirements may cause the company to sell or refrain from acquiring assets where the capital requirements appear inconsistent with the assets' underlying risks. in addition, liquidity standards require the company to maintain holdings of highly liquid investments, thereby reducing the company's ability to invest in less liquid assets, even if more desirable from a balance sheet or interest rate risk management perspective. as a category iii banking organization, truist is subject to additional capital and liquidity requirements.
truist financial corporation 27
the liquidity standards applicable to large u.s. banking organizations have been supplemented in recent years. the nsfr rule, which is designed to ensure that banking organizations maintain a stable funding profile in relation to their asset composition and off-balance sheet activities, became effective on july 1, 2021. public disclosure of the nsfr will begin in 2023.
in addition to the regulatory capital and liquidity requirements applicable to truist and truist bank, the company's broker-dealer subsidiaries are subject to capital requirements established by the sec.
regulatory capital and liquidity requirements receive periodic review and revision by the bcbs and the u.s. banking agencies. changes to capital and liquidity requirements may require truist or truist bank to maintain more or higher quality capital or greater liquidity and could increase some of the potential adverse effects described above.
truist is subject to certain risks related to originating and selling mortgages and may be required to repurchase mortgage loans or indemnify mortgage loan purchasers.
truist is required to make customary representations and warranties to the purchaser about the mortgage loans and the manner in which they were originated when selling mortgage loans or loan securitizations. an increase in the number of repurchase and indemnity demands from purchasers related to representations and warranties on loans sold could result in an increase in the amount of losses for loan repurchases. truist also bears a risk of loss from borrower defaults for multi-family commercial mortgage loans sold to fnma.
in addition to repurchase claims from gses, truist could be subject to indemnification claims from non-gse purchasers of the company's loans. claims could be made if truist fails to conform to statements about the quality of the mortgage loans sold, the manner in which the loans were originated and underwritten or their compliance with state and federal law.
truist faces risks as a servicer of loans.
the company acts as servicer and master servicer for mortgage loans included in securitizations and for unsecuritized mortgage loans owned by investors. as a servicer or master servicer for those loans, the company has certain contractual obligations to the securitization trusts, investors, or other third parties. as a servicer, truist's obligations include foreclosing on defaulted mortgage loans or, to the extent consistent with the applicable securitization or other investor agreement, considering alternatives to foreclosure such as loan modifications or short sales. in the company's capacity as a master servicer, obligations include overseeing the servicing of mortgage loans by the servicer. generally, the company's servicing obligations are set by contract, for which the company receives a contractual fee. however, gses can amend their servicing guidelines, which can increase the scope or costs of the services required without any corresponding increase in the company's servicing fee. further, the cfpb has implemented national servicing standards which have increased the scope and costs of services which the company is required to perform. in addition, there has been a significant increase in state laws that impose additional servicing requirements that increase the scope and cost of the company's servicing obligations. as a servicer, the company also advances expenses on behalf of investors which it may be unable to collect.
a material breach of the company's obligations as servicer or master servicer may result in contract termination if the breach is not cured within a specified period of time following notice, which can generally be given by the securitization trustee or a specified percentage of security holders, causing the company to lose servicing income. in addition, the company may be required to indemnify the securitization trustee against losses from any failure by the company, as a servicer or master servicer, to perform the company's servicing obligations or any act or omission on the company's part that involves willful misfeasance, bad faith, or gross negligence. for certain investors and certain transactions, truist may be contractually obligated to repurchase a mortgage loan or reimburse the investor for credit losses incurred on the loan as a remedy for servicing errors with respect to the loan. the company may be subject to increased repurchase obligations as a result of claims made that the company did not satisfy its obligations as a servicer or master servicer. the company may also experience increased loss severity on repurchases, which may require a material increase to the company's repurchase reserve.
the company has and may continue to receive indemnification requests related to the company's servicing of loans owned or insured by other parties, primarily gses. typically, such a claim seeks to impose a compensatory fee on the company for departures from gse service levels. in most cases, this is related to delays in the foreclosure process. additionally, the company has received indemnification requests where an investor or insurer has suffered a loss due to a breach of the servicing agreement. while the number of such claims has been small, these could increase in the future.
28 truist financial corporation strategic risks truist may face the risk of financial loss or negative impact resulting from ineffective strategy setting and execution, adverse business decisions, or lack of responsiveness to changes in the external environment.
embedded within strategic risks are risks associated with:
•maintaining a level of earnings appropriate to support growth objectives and the ability to maintain dividends in various economic cycles,
•successful delivery of innovation and technology strategies that transform the client experience as well as the way truist conducts business,
•changes and events within the external environment, including geopolitical, macroeconomic, social, cultural, competitive, and regulatory factors, and
•implementation and execution of climate risk management related programs.
any of the foregoing may impact the successful execution of truist's strategy.
competition may reduce truist's client base or cause truist to modify pricing for products and services.
truist operates in a highly competitive industry that could become even more competitive with growth in areas such as neo-banks, fintechs, and other non-bank platforms. increased competition could arise from technological advancements, legislative and regulatory changes, as well as competition from other financial services companies, some of which may be subject to less extensive regulation than truist. the company's success depends, in part, on the company's ability to adapt its offering of products and services to evolving industry standards and client expectations. the widespread adoption of new technologies has required and will continue to require substantial investments to modify existing products and services or to develop new products and services. in addition, there is increasing pressure to provide products and services at lower prices further reducing contribution margins. the company may not be successful in introducing new products and services in response to industry trends or developments in technology or those new products may not achieve market acceptance.
truist also competes with nonbank companies inside and outside of the company's market area and, in some cases, with companies other than those traditionally considered financial sector participants. in particular, technology companies are increasingly focusing on the financial sector, either in partnership with competitor banking organizations or on their own. these companies generally are not subject to the same regulatory oversight as main street financial institutions and may accordingly realize certain cost strategies and offer products and services at more favorable rates and with greater convenience to the client. this competition could result in the loss of clients and revenue in areas where fintechs are operating. as the pace of technology and change advance, continuous innovation is expected to exert long-term pressure on the financial services industry.
the adoption of new technologies by competitors, including internet banking services, mobile applications, advanced atm functionality and cryptocurrencies could require the company to make substantial investments to modify or adapt the company's existing products and services or even radically alter the way truist conducts business. these and other capital investments in the company's business may not produce expected growth in earnings anticipated at the time of the expenditure.
truist may not be able to complete future mergers or acquisitions.
the company must generally satisfy a number of meaningful conditions before completing an acquisition of another bank or bhc, including federal and state regulatory approvals. in determining whether to approve a proposed bank or bhc acquisition, bank regulators will consider, among other factors, the effect of the acquisition on competition; financial condition and future prospects, including current and projected capital ratios and levels; the competence, experience and integrity of management; record of compliance with laws and regulations; the convenience and needs of the communities to be served, including the acquiring institution's record of compliance under the cra; the effectiveness of the acquiring institution in combating money laundering activities; and protests from various stakeholders. in addition, u.s. regulators must take systemic risk to the u.s. financial system into account when evaluating whether to approve a potential acquisition transaction involving a large financial institution like truist. there is no certainty as to when or if or on what terms and conditions, any required regulatory approvals will be granted for any potential acquisition. in specific cases, truist may be required to sell banks or branches or take other actions as a condition to receiving regulatory approval. an inability to satisfy other conditions necessary to consummate an acquisition transaction, such as third party litigation, a judicial order blocking the transaction or lack of shareholder approval, could also prevent the company from completing an announced acquisition. there has been increased scrutiny of bank and financial institution acquisitions from regulators and government entities in recent years. refer to the "acquisitions" section within item 1 "business" for additional discussion.
truist financial corporation 29
truist has businesses other than banking that are subject to a variety of risks.
truist is a diversified financial services company and this diversity subjects the company's earnings to a broader variety of risks and uncertainties. other businesses in addition to banking that the company operates include insurance, investment banking, securities underwriting and market making, loan syndications, investment management and advice and retail and wholesale brokerage services offered through the company's subsidiaries. these businesses entail significant market, operational, credit, compliance, technology, legal and other risks that could materially adversely impact the company's results of operations.
reputational risks negative public opinion could damage the company's reputation and adversely impact business and revenues.
truist's earnings and capital are subject to risks associated with negative public opinion. negative public opinion could result from the company's actual or alleged conduct in any number of activities, including lending, sales and other operating practices, corporate governance, acquisitions, a breach of client or teammate information, the failure of any product or service sold to meet clients' expectations or applicable regulatory requirements. negative public opinion could also result from an increase in the level of social and environmental activism surrounding truist or other financial services companies. negative public opinion could adversely affect the company's ability to attract and retain clients and teammates and can result in litigation and regulatory actions. actual or alleged conduct by one of the company's businesses can result in negative public opinion about the company's other businesses. actual or alleged conduct by another financial services company can result in negative public opinion about the financial services industry in general and, as a result, adversely affect truist.
scrutiny of the company's sales, training, and incentive compensation practices could damage the company's reputation and adversely impact business and revenues.
the company may face increased scrutiny of the company's sales and other business practices, training practices, incentive compensation design and governance, and quality assurance and client complaint resolution practices. there can be no assurance that the company's processes and actions will meet regulatory standards or expectations. findings from self-identified or regulatory reviews may require responsive actions, including increased investments in compliance systems and teammates or the payment of fines, penalties, increased regulatory assessments or client redress and may increase legal or reputational risk exposures.
operational risks litigation may adversely affect the company's results.
the company is subject to litigation in the ordinary course of business. claims and legal actions, including class action lawsuits and enforcement actions by the company's regulators, which are becoming more common in the current regulatory environment, could involve large monetary amounts, significant defense costs, and result in settlements, judgments, penalties, fines, injunctions, or other forms of relief that are adverse to the company. the outcome of litigation and regulatory matters as well as the timing of ultimate resolution are inherently difficult to predict.
actual legal and other costs arising from claims and legal actions may be greater than the company's legal reserves. the ultimate resolution of a pending legal proceeding could materially adversely affect the company's results of operations and financial condition.
in addition, governmental authorities have, at times, sought criminal penalties against companies in the financial services sector for violations, and, at times, have required an admission of wrongdoing from financial institutions in connection with resolving such matters. criminal convictions or admissions of wrongdoing in a settlement with the government can lead to greater exposure in civil litigation and reputational harm.
substantial legal liability or significant regulatory or government action against the company could have material adverse financial effects or cause significant reputational harm, which adversely impact the company's business prospects. further, the company may be exposed to substantial uninsured liabilities, which could adversely affect the company's results of operations and financial condition.
30 truist financial corporation the company may incur fines, penalties and other negative consequences from regulatory violations, including inadvertent or unintentional violations.
truist maintains systems and procedures designed to ensure that it complies with applicable laws and regulations, but there can be no assurance that these will be effective. in addition to fines and penalties, the company may suffer other negative consequences from regulatory violations including restrictions on certain activities, such as the company's mortgage business, which may affect the company's relationship with the gses and may also damage the company's reputation and this in turn might materially affect the company's business and results of operations.
further, some legal frameworks provide for the imposition of fines or penalties for noncompliance even when the noncompliance was inadvertent or unintentional and even when there were systems and procedures in place designed to ensure compliance. for example, truist is subject to regulations issued by ofac that prohibit financial institutions from participating in the transfer of property belonging to the governments of certain foreign countries and designated nationals of those countries. ofac may impose penalties for inadvertent or unintentional violations even if reasonable processes are in place to prevent the violations. courts may uphold significant additional penalties on financial institutions, even where the financial institution had already reimbursed the government or other counterparties for actual losses.
truist relies on other companies to provide key components of the company's business infrastructure.
third parties provide key components of the company's business infrastructure, such as banking services, data processing, business processes, internet connections, and network access. any disruption in such services provided by these third parties or any failure of these third parties to handle current or higher volumes of use could adversely affect the company's ability to deliver products and services to clients, to support teammates and otherwise to conduct business. technological or financial difficulties of a third party service provider could adversely affect the company's business to the extent those difficulties result in the interruption or discontinuation of services provided by that party. further, in some instances, the company may be responsible for failures of such third parties to comply with government regulations. the company is not insured against all types of losses as a result of third party failures, and the insurance coverage that does exist may be inadequate to protect the company from all losses resulting from system failures or other disruptions. failures in the company's business infrastructure could interrupt the operations or increase the costs of doing business.
truist depends on the expertise of key teammates. if these individuals leave or change their roles without effective replacements, operations may suffer.
the company's success depends, to a large degree, on the continued services of executive officers and other key teammates who have extensive experience in the industry. the company's business could be adversely impacted from the loss of key persons or failure to manage a smooth transition to new teammates. these risks may be exacerbated as the company continues to integrate processes and systems subsequent to the merger.
the company may not be able to hire or retain additional qualified teammates and recruiting and compensation costs may increase as a result of changes in the marketplace, which may increase costs and adversely impact the company's ability to implement business strategies.
the company's success depends upon the ability to attract and retain high performing, diverse and well-qualified teammates. the company faces significant competition in the recruitment of highly motivated teammates who can deliver truist's purpose, mission, and values, which has recently intensified as a result of changes in the labor market caused by covid-19. the company's ability to execute its business strategy and provide high quality service may suffer if the company is unable to recruit or retain a sufficient number of qualified teammates or if the costs of employee compensation or benefits increase substantially. the u.s. banking agencies have jointly issued comprehensive guidance designed to ensure that incentive compensation policies do not undermine the safety and soundness of banking organizations by encouraging teammates to take imprudent risks. this guidance significantly affects the amount, form, and context of incentive compensation to teammates. the frb, fdic, sec, and other federal regulatory agencies have jointly proposed rules, which would affect incentive compensation. these rules were included on the sec's regulatory agenda in 2021 for proposed rulemaking. if finalized, these rules may result in additional costs and restrictions on the form of the company's incentive compensation. these risks may be intensified in the increased work-from-home environment caused by the covid-19 pandemic as job opportunities may be less constrained by physical geography.
truist financial corporation 31
the company's framework for managing risks may not be effective.
the company's risk management framework seeks to mitigate risk and loss. truist has established policies, processes, and procedures intended to identify, measure, monitor, report, and analyze the types of risk to which the company is subject, including liquidity, credit, market, operational, technology, reputational, legal, model, and compliance risk, among others. however, the company's risk management measures may not be fully effective in identifying and mitigating the company's risk exposure in all market environments or against all types of risk, including risks that are unidentified or unanticipated, even if the models for assessing risk are properly designed and implemented. some of the company's methods of managing risk are based upon the company's use of observed historical market behavior and management's judgment. these methods may not accurately predict future exposures, which could be significantly greater than historical measures indicate. if the company's risk management framework proves ineffective, it could suffer unexpected losses and could be materially adversely affected.
there are risks resulting from the extensive use of models in truist's business, which may impact decisions made by management and regulators.
truist relies on quantitative models to measure risks and to estimate certain financial values. models may be used in such processes as determining the pricing of various products, grading loans and extending credit, measuring interest rate and other market risks, predicting or estimating losses, assessing capital adequacy and calculating economic and regulatory capital levels, as well as estimating the value of financial instruments and balance sheet items.
poorly designed or implemented models present the risk that truist's business decisions based on information incorporating model output would be adversely affected due to the inadequacy of that information. also, information truist provides to the public or to its regulators based on poorly designed or implemented models could be inaccurate or misleading. some of the decisions that the regulators make, including those related to capital distributions to truist's shareholders, could be adversely affected due to the perception that the quality of the models used to generate the relevant information is insufficient.
the company is at risk of increased losses from fraud.
criminals committing fraud increasingly are using more sophisticated techniques and in some cases, are a part of larger criminal organizations, which allow them to be more effective. fraudulent activity has taken many forms and escalates as more tools for accessing financial services emerge, such as real-time payments. fraud schemes are broad and continuously evolving and include such things as debit card/credit card fraud, check fraud, mechanical devices attached to atm machines, social engineering, and phishing attacks to obtain personal information or impersonation of the company's clients through the use of falsified or stolen credentials.
in addition, individuals or business entities may properly identify themselves, yet seek to establish a business relationship for the purpose of perpetrating fraud. increased deployment of technologies, such as chip card technology, defray and reduce aspects of fraud; however, criminals are turning to other sources to steal personally identifiable information, such as unaffiliated healthcare providers and government entities, in order to impersonate the consumer to commit fraud. further, as a result of the increased sophistication of fraud activity, the company has increased spending on systems, resources and controls to detect and prevent fraud, as well as increased spending to provide certain credit monitoring and identity theft protection services to the company's consumer clients. this will result in continued ongoing investments in the future.
the company's operational or security systems or infrastructure or those of third parties, could fail or be breached, which could disrupt the company's business and adversely impact the company's results of operations, liquidity and financial condition, as well as cause legal or reputational harm.
the potential for operational risk exposure exists throughout the company's business and, as a result of the company's interactions with and reliance on third parties, is not limited to the company's own internal operational functions. the company's operational and security systems and infrastructure, including computer systems, data management and internal processes, as well as those of third parties, are integral to the company's performance. truist teammates and third parties may expose the company to risk as a result of human error, misconduct, malfeasance, or a failure or breach of systems and infrastructure. for example, the company's ability to conduct business may be adversely affected by any significant disruptions, including to third parties with whom the company interacts or relies upon.
32 truist financial corporation natural disasters and other catastrophic events, which may increase in frequency and intensity due to climate change, could have a material adverse impact on the company's operations or the company's financial condition and results.
the occurrence of catastrophic weather events or pandemics could adversely affect the company's financial condition or results of operations. truist has significant operations and clients along the gulf and atlantic coasts as well as other regions of the u.s., which could be adversely impacted by hurricanes, tornadoes and other severe weather in those areas. truist and its clients could also be disrupted by the physical effects of climate change, which may become more frequent and severe. natural and other types of disasters, including as a result of climate change, could have an adverse impact on truist's businesses in that such events could materially disrupt the company's operations or the ability or willingness of the company's clients to access the financial services offered by truist, including adverse impacts on the company's borrowers to timely repay their loans and the value of any collateral held. these events could reduce the company's earnings and cause volatility in the company's financial results for any fiscal quarter or year and have a material adverse effect on the company's financial condition and results of operations.
although truist has business continuity plans and other safeguards in place, the company's operations and communications may be adversely affected by natural disasters or other catastrophic events, and there can be no assurance that such business continuity plans will be effective.
truist may be impacted by the soundness of other financial institutions.
the company's ability to engage in routine funding transactions could be adversely affected by the actions and commercial soundness of other financial institutions. financial services institutions are interrelated as a result of trading, clearing, counterparty and other relationships. truist has exposure to many different industries and counterparties and routinely executes transactions with counterparties in the financial industry, including brokers and dealers, central counterparties, commercial banks, investment banks, mutual and hedge funds and other institutional investors and clients. as a result, defaults by, or even rumors or questions about, one or more financial services institutions or the financial services industry generally, in the past have led to market-wide liquidity problems and could lead to losses or defaults by truist or by other institutions. many of these transactions expose the company to credit risk in the event of default of the company's counterparty or client. in addition, the company's credit risk may be exacerbated when the collateral held by truist cannot be liquidated or is liquidated at prices not sufficient to recover the full amount of the company's exposure. any such losses could materially and adversely affect the company's results of operations and financial condition.
truist depends on the accuracy and completeness of information about clients and counterparties.
in deciding whether to extend credit or enter into other transactions with clients and counterparties, truist relies on the completeness and accuracy of representations made by and information furnished by or on behalf of clients and counterparties, including financial statements and other financial information. if the information provided is not accurate or complete, the company's decisions about extending credit or entering into other transactions with clients or counterparties could be adversely affected and the company could suffer defaults, credit losses or other negative consequences as a result.
the company's accounting policies and processes are critical to how the company reports its financial condition and results of operations and require management to make estimates about matters that are uncertain.
accounting policies and processes are fundamental to how the company records and reports its financial condition and results of operations. some of these policies require the use of estimates and assumptions that may affect the value of the company's assets or liabilities and financial results. several of the company's accounting policies are critical because they require management to make difficult, subjective, and complex judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain and because it is likely that materially different amounts would be reported under different conditions or using different assumptions. if assumptions or estimates underlying the company's financial statements are incorrect or are adjusted periodically, the company may experience material losses.
management has identified certain accounting policies as being critical because they require management's judgment to ascertain the valuations of assets, liabilities, commitments, and contingencies. a variety of factors could affect the realization of income and expense or the recognition of assets and liabilities in the company's financial statements. truist has established detailed policies and control procedures that are intended to ensure these critical accounting estimates and judgments are well controlled and applied consistently. in addition, the policies and procedures are intended to ensure that the process for changing methodologies occurs in an appropriate manner. due to the uncertainty surrounding the company's judgments and the estimates pertaining to these matters, the company cannot guarantee that adjustments to accounting policies or restatement of prior period financial statements will not be required.
truist financial corporation 33
further, from time to time, the fasb and sec change the financial accounting and reporting standards that govern the preparation of the company's financial statements. in addition, accounting standard setters and those who interpret the accounting standards may change or even reverse their previous interpretations or positions on how these standards should be applied. changes in financial accounting and reporting standards and changes in current interpretations may be beyond the company's control, can be hard to predict and could materially affect how the company reports its financial results and condition. in some cases, the company could be required to apply a new or revised standard retroactively, resulting in the restatement of prior period financial statements.
depressed market values for the company's stock and adverse economic conditions sustained over a period of time may require the company to write down all or some portion of the company's goodwill.
goodwill is periodically tested for impairment by comparing the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying amount. if the fair value is greater than the carrying amount, then the reporting unit's goodwill is deemed not to be impaired. the fair value of a reporting unit is impacted by the reporting unit's expected financial performance and susceptibility to adverse economic, regulatory, and legislative changes. future adverse changes in economic conditions or expected financial performance may cause the fair value of a reporting unit to be below its carrying amount, resulting in goodwill impairment. the estimated fair values of the individual reporting units are assessed for reasonableness by reviewing a variety of indicators, including comparing these estimated fair values to the company's market capitalization over a reasonable period of time. while this comparison provides some relative market information about the estimated fair value of the reporting units, it is not determinative and needs to be evaluated in the context of the current economic environment. however, significant and sustained declines in the company's market capitalization could be an indication of potential goodwill impairment. refer to the "critical accounting policies" section for additional details related to the company's intangible assets policy.
certain banking laws and certain provisions of the company's articles of incorporation may have an anti-takeover effect.
provisions of federal banking laws, including regulatory approval requirements, could make it difficult for a third party to acquire the company, even if doing so would be perceived to be beneficial to the company's owners. acquisition of certain amounts of any class of voting stock of a bhc or depository institution, including shares of the company's common stock, may create a rebuttable presumption that the acquirer "controls" the bhc or depository institution and thus, unless the acquirer is able to rebut this presumption, it would be subject to various laws and regulations applicable to a bhc. also, a bhc must obtain the prior approval of the frb before, among other things, acquiring direct or indirect ownership or control of more than 5% of the voting shares of any bank, including truist bank.
there also are provisions in the company's amended and restated articles of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws, such as limitations on the ability to call a special meeting of the company's shareholders, that may be used to delay or block a takeover attempt. in addition, the company's board will be authorized under the company's amended and restated articles of incorporation to issue shares of the company's preferred stock and to determine the rights, terms, conditions and privileges of such preferred stock, without shareholder approval. these provisions may effectively inhibit a non-negotiated merger or other business combination.
technology risks the company faces cybersecurity risks, including denial of service, hacking, and malware or ransomware attacks, which could result in the disclosure of confidential information, adversely affect the company's operations or reputation, and create significant legal and financial exposure.
the company's computer systems and network infrastructure and those of third parties are frequently targeted in cyber-attacks, such as denial of service attacks, hacking, malware or ransomware intrusion, data corruption attempts, terrorist activities, or identity theft. the company's business relies on the secure processing, transmission, storage, and retrieval of confidential, proprietary, and other information in the company's information systems and that of third parties. in addition, to access the company's network, products, and services, the company's clients and other third parties may use personal mobile devices or computing devices that are outside of the company's network environment and can introduce added cybersecurity risks.
truist and truist's clients, regulators and other third parties, including other financial services institutions and companies engaged in data processing, have been subject to and are likely to continue to be the target of, cyber-attacks and similar incidents. cyber-attacks may expose security vulnerabilities in the company's systems or the systems of third parties or other security measures that could result in the unauthorized gathering, monitoring, misuse, release, loss, or destruction of confidential, proprietary, or sensitive information. a cyber-attack could also damage the company's systems by introducing material disruptions to the company's or the company's clients' or other third parties' network access or business operations. as cyber threats continue to evolve, the company may be required to expend significant additional resources to continue to modify or enhance the company's protective measures or to investigate and remediate any information security vulnerabilities or incidents. despite efforts to ensure the integrity of the company's systems and implement controls, processes, policies and other protective measures, the company may not be able to anticipate all security breaches, nor may the company be able to implement sufficient preventive measures against such security breaches, which may result in material losses or consequences to truist.
34 truist financial corporation cybersecurity risks for financial institutions have significantly increased in recent years in part because of the proliferation of new technologies to facilitate and conduct financial transactions. for example, cybersecurity risks may increase in the future as truist continues to evolve its internal and external digital offerings and capabilities. in addition, cybersecurity risks have significantly increased in recent years in part due to the increased sophistication and activities of organized crime affiliates, terrorist organizations, hostile foreign governments, disgruntled teammates or vendors, activists and other external parties, including those involved in corporate espionage. even the most advanced internal control environment may be vulnerable to compromise. persistent attackers may succeed in penetrating defenses given enough resources, time, and motive. the techniques used by cyber criminals change frequently, and may not be recognized until launched or well after a breach has occurred. in addition, the existence of cyber-attacks or security breaches at third party vendors with access to the company's data may not be disclosed in a timely manner.
the company also faces indirect technology, cybersecurity and other operational risks relating to clients and other third parties that the company relies upon to facilitate or enable business activities, including, financial counterparties, regulators, and providers of critical infrastructure such as internet access and electrical power. in addition, truist faces cybersecurity and other operational risks relating to the merger, including increased phishing attacks on teammates, increased network perimeter scanning by attackers searching for vulnerabilities and domain name squatting. further, as a result of increasing consolidation, interdependence, and complexity of financial entities and technology systems, a technology failure, cyber-attack or other information or security breach that significantly degrades, deletes, or compromises the systems or data of one or more financial entities could have a material impact on counterparties or other market participants. this consolidation, interconnectivity, and complexity increases the risk of operational failure, on both individual and industry-wide bases, as disparate systems need to be integrated, often on an accelerated basis. any third party technology failure, cyber-attack, other information or security breach, termination, or constraint could, among other things, adversely affect the company's ability to conduct transactions, service the company's clients, manage the company's exposure to risk or expand the company's business.
the public perception that a cyber-attack on the company's systems has been successful, whether or not this perception is correct, may damage the company's reputation with clients and third parties with whom the company does business. the compromise of personal information, in particular, could result in identify theft and cause serious reputational harm. a successful penetration or circumvention of system security could cause serious negative consequences, including loss of clients and business opportunities; costs associated with maintaining business relationships after an attack or breach; significant disruption to the company's operations and business; misappropriation, exposure or destruction of the company's confidential information, intellectual property, funds and those of the company's clients; damage to the company's or the company's clients' or third parties' computers or systems; or a violation of applicable privacy laws and other laws. this could result in litigation exposure, regulatory fines, penalties, loss of confidence in the company's security measures, reputational damage, reimbursement or other compensatory costs, and additional compliance costs, which could adversely impact the company's results of operations, liquidity, and financial condition. in addition, the company may not have adequate insurance coverage to compensate for losses from a cybersecurity event.
truist will continually encounter technological change and must effectively anticipate, develop, and implement new technology.
the financial services industry is undergoing rapid technological change with frequent introductions of new technology-driven products and services. truist has invested in technology to automate functions previously performed manually, to facilitate the ability of clients to engage in financial transactions and otherwise to enhance the client experience with respect to the company's products and services. truist expects to make additional investments in innovation and technology to address technological disruption in the industry and improve client offerings and service. these changes allow the company to better serve the company's clients and to reduce costs.
the company's continued success depends, in part, upon the company's ability to address clients' needs by using technology to provide products and services that satisfy client demands, including demands for faster and more secure payment services, to create efficiencies in the company's operations and to integrate those offerings with legacy platforms or to update those legacy platforms. a failure to maintain or enhance the company's competitive position with respect to technology, whether because of a failure to anticipate client expectations, a failure in the performance of technological developments or an untimely roll out of developments, may cause the company to lose market share or incur additional expense.
the company faces risks associated with quality, availability and retention of key data for operational, strategic, and compliance purposes.
the company's financial and regulatory reporting and key business decisions are reliant on the quality, availability and retention of data. while truist has implemented a robust data management control framework to mitigate the risks associated with data while at rest, in motion, and in use, a control failure may lead to data loss, data misuse, and data quality risks. these failures may ultimately result in inaccuracies in financial and regulatory reports, inhibited management decision-making, financial loss, reputational risk, and regulatory compliance risk, including privacy compliance risks to the extent that the company has ineffective or flawed consumer data management processes and monitoring.

44 truist financial corporation provision for credit losses
2021 compared to 2020
the provision for credit losses was a benefit of $813 million for the year ended december 31, 2021, compared to a cost of $2.3 billion for the prior year. the prior year included significant uncertainty related to the economic impacts resulting from the pandemic, whereas the current year includes reserve releases due to the improving economic outlook. net charge-offs for the year ended december 31, 2021 totaled $697 million compared to $1.1 billion in the prior year. net charge-offs for 2020 included $97 million of charge-offs related to the implementation of cecl as more fully discussed in the "acl" section of md&a. the net charge-off ratio for the current year of 0.24% was down 12 basis points compared to the prior year, primarily driven by lower losses across the majority of portfolios, partially driven by additional losses on pcd loans taken in 2020, combined with higher recoveries.
noninterest income noninterest income is a significant contributor to truist's financial results. management focuses on diversifying its sources of revenue to reduce truist's reliance on traditional spread-based interest income, as certain fee-based activities are a relatively stable revenue source during periods of changing interest rates.

in the fourth quarter of 2021, the company reclassified certain structured real estate activity from commercial mortgage income to investment banking trading income and certain lihtc activity from commercial mortgage income to other income. prior periods were reclassified to conform to the current presentation.
2021 compared to 2020
noninterest income for the year ended december 31, 2021 increased $411 million, or 4.6%, compared to the prior year. other income for the year ended december 31, 2021 includes a $37 million gain from the divestiture of certain businesses, whereas noninterest income for the year ended december 31, 2020 included $402 million of securities gains on available-for-sale securities. excluding securities gains and a gain on the divestiture of certain businesses, noninterest income was up $776 million, or 9.2%, compared to the prior year. insurance income increased $434 million due to acquisitions, as well as organic growth. investment banking and trading income increased $431 million due to strong investment banking income from loan syndications and merger and acquisition fees, and structured real estate income, and the impact from cva recoveries in the current year compared to losses in the earlier year. other income increased $140 million primarily due to $96 million related to increased investment income (primarily valuations gains) from the company's sbic and truist ventures investments and higher valuations of $46 million for assets held for certain post-retirement benefits, which is primarily offset by higher benefits expense included in personnel expense. wealth management increased $115 million due to higher valuations of assets under management, partially offset by the divestiture of the record keeping business. card and payment related fees and service charges on deposits increased $113 million and $40 million, respectively, due to increased economic activity. lending related fees increased $34 million due to higher noninterest loan fees, primarily unused line fees. residential mortgage banking income decreased $445 million primarily due to lower production related revenues as a result of lower gain on sale margins and volumes, partially offset by higher servicing income due to an increase in the valuation of mortgage servicing rights. operating lease income decreased $47 million due to declines in the lease portfolio.

2021 compared to 2020
noninterest expense for the year ended december 31, 2021 was up $219 million, or 1.5%, compared to the earlier year. merger-related and restructuring charges decreased $38 million and other incremental operating expenses related to the merger increased $237 million, primarily reflected in professional fees and outside processing expense. the current year also includes $200 million for charitable contributions to the truist foundation and the truist charitable fund (other expense), $36 million of expense associated with an acceleration of loss recognition related to certain terminated cash flow hedges, a $30 million professional fee expense, and a small gain on the early extinguishment of debt, whereas the earlier year included a $235 million loss on the early extinguishment of debt and a $50 million charitable contribution. excluding the aforementioned items and a decrease of $111 million for amortization of intangibles, noninterest expense increased $154 million, or 1.2%, compared to the earlier year. personnel expense increased $486 million primarily driven by higher incentive expenses due to variable compensation from higher revenues and improved overall performance relative to targets, higher medical insurance claims, higher other employee benefits due to the previously mentioned increase in noninterest income, and personnel cost related to acquired companies. these increases in personnel expense were partially offset by lower salaries due to fewer ftes. software expense increased $83 million due to higher spending on certain projects. other expense includes a decrease of $167 million for non-service-related pension cost components. there was also a decrease of $140 million from net occupancy expense primarily due to branch and property consolidations and a decrease in operating lease depreciation of $68 million due to valuation adjustments taken in the prior year.

consumer banking and wealth consumer banking and wealth had 2,517 banking offices at december 31, 2021, a decrease of 264 offices compared to december 31, 2020. the decrease in offices was driven primarily by the consolidation of 226 branches in the first quarter leveraging the blended branch program strategy, as well as closure of 39 branches in non-overlapping markets in the third quarter.
consumer banking and wealth net income was $3.2 billion for 2021, an increase of $192 million, or 6.3%, compared to 2020. segment net interest income decreased $533 million primarily due to reduced funding credit on deposits, lower purchase accounting accretion, and a decline in average loans. the allocated provision for credit losses decreased $853 million primarily due to allowance releases in the current year as the economic outlook improved as well as lower net charge offs in the auto, home equity, card, and mortgage portfolios and lower loan balances compared to reserve builds in 2020 due to uncertainty regarding the pandemic. noninterest income decreased $206 million, due to lower residential mortgage income driven by lower gain on sale margins and volumes, partially offset by increased revenues in wealth management and card and payment related activities resulting from improving economic conditions as well as gains from the divestiture of certain businesses. noninterest expense decreased $131 million primarily due to lower salary expense, pension costs, amortization of intangibles, and occupancy expenses, partially offset by increased incentives tied to performance and related benefits expense in the current year.

corporate and commercial banking corporate and commercial banking net income was $4.3 billion for 2021, an increase of $1.9 billion, or 84%, compared to 2020. segment net interest income decreased $421 million primarily due to reduced funding credit on deposits, lower purchase accounting accretion, and a decline in average loans partially offset by higher margin fees tied to ppp loan forgiveness. the allocated provision for credit losses decreased $2.2 billion which reflects allowance releases in the current year driven by an improving economic outlook compared to allowance builds in 2020 due to uncertainty regarding the pandemic as well as lower net charge offs primarily in the commercial and industrial portfolio and lower loan balances. noninterest income increased $572 million due to strong investment banking and trading income, increased lending related fees, income from sbic equity investments, and increased service charges on deposits slightly offset by lower operating lease income. noninterest expense decreased $196 million primarily due to lower operating lease depreciation, lower allocated corporate expenses and reduced salary and equity based compensation expense, partially offset by higher incentives tied to performance.
corporate and commercial banking average loans and leases hfi decreased $13.5 billion, or 8.1%, compared to 2020 driven primarily by lower client revolver utilization, lower dealer floor plan levels, and lower ppp.
corporate and commercial banking average total deposits increased $12.8 billion, or 9.3%, compared to 2020 driven primarily by ongoing impacts of fiscal and monetary stimulus. average noninterest-bearing deposits increased $12.3 billion, or 21%, while interest bearing deposits increased $460 million, or 0.6%.
insurance holdings insurance holdings net income was $508 million in 2021, an increase of $101 million, or 25%, compared to 2020. noninterest income increased $423 million primarily due to organic growth as well as acquisitions. impact from organic growth was $238 million, or 11%, and impact from acquisitions was $185 million, or 8%. noninterest expense increased $295 million primarily due to commissions on higher production in the current year along with higher amortization of intangibles and operating expenses related to acquisitions.
other, treasury, and corporate other, treasury, and corporate generated a net loss of $1.6 billion in 2021, compared to a net loss of $1.3 billion in 2020. segment net interest income increased $142 million due to lower expense on borrowings and growth in the securities portfolio. the allocated provision for credit losses decreased $101 million which primarily reflects changes in the reserve for unfunded commitments as well as an allowance release in the current year resulting from the improving economic outlook. noninterest income decreased $378 million primarily due to a gain on the sale of non-agency mbs in the same period of the prior year, partially offset by income from assets held for certain post-employment benefits. noninterest expense increased $251 million primarily due to charitable contributions to the truist foundation and the truist charitable fund, as well as higher incremental operating expenses related to the merger and higher restructuring charges in the current year, partially offset by the loss on early extinguishment of long-term debt in the same period of the prior year.

lending activities truist strives to meet the credit needs of its clients while pursuing a balanced strategy of loan profitability, loan growth, and loan quality. management believes that this purpose can best be accomplished by building strong client relationships over time and developing in-depth local market knowledge. the company employs strict underwriting criteria governing the degree of risk assumed and the diversity of the loan portfolio in terms of type, industry, and geographical concentration.
truist lends to a diverse client base that is geographically dispersed to mitigate concentration risk arising from local and regional economic downturns. international loans were immaterial as of december 31, 2021 and 2020. the following discussion provides additional information on the company's loan and lease portfolios. refer to the "risk management" section for a discussion of the credit risk management policies used to manage the portfolios.
50 truist financial corporation commercial loan and lease portfolio commercial loans and leases represent the largest category of the company's loan and lease portfolio. commercial community banking generally targets small-to-middle market businesses with annual sales between $2 million and $500 million, while cib provides lending solutions to large corporate clients. the commercial loan and lease portfolio consists of lending to public and private business clients and is composed of commercial and industrial, owner occupied, equipment leasing and financing, commercial real estate, and government and institutional financing.
in accordance with the company's lending policy, each commercial loan undergoes a detailed underwriting process. commercial loans are typically priced with an interest rate tied to market indices, such as the prime rate, libor, or sofr and are individually monitored and reviewed for deterioration in the ability of the client to repay the loan. the majority of truist's commercial loans are secured by real estate, business equipment, inventories, and other types of collateral.
residential mortgage loan portfolio truist primarily originates conforming mortgage loans, loans under fha, u.s. department of veterans affairs, or u.s. department of agriculture programs, and higher quality jumbo and construction-to-permanent loans for 1-4 family residential properties. conforming loans are loans that are underwritten in accordance with the underwriting standards set forth by fnma and fhlmc. they are generally collateralized by one-to-four-family residential real estate, typically have loan-to-collateral value ratios of 80% or less at origination, or have mortgage insurance as required by investors and are made to borrowers in good credit standing.
risks associated with mortgage lending include interest rate risk, which is mitigated through the sale of a substantial portion of conforming fixed-rate loans in the secondary mortgage market and an effective msr hedging process. credit risk is managed through rigorous underwriting procedures and mortgage insurance. the right to service the loans and receive servicing income is generally retained when conforming loans are sold. management believes that the retention of mortgage servicing diversifies income while enabling truist to build long-term client relationships and offer high quality client service. truist also purchases residential mortgage loans from correspondent originators. the loans purchased from third party originators are subject to substantially the same underwriting and risk-management criteria as loans originated internally.
residential home equity and direct loan portfolio the residential home equity and direct loan portfolio is composed of a wide variety of secured and unsecured loans offered through truist's branch network, as well as loans originated by lightstream, truist's national online consumer lending division. loans originated through the truist branch network include revolving home equity lines of credit secured by first or second liens on residential real estate and certain other secured and unsecured lending marketed to qualifying clients and other creditworthy candidates in truist's market areas. lightstream provides fixed-rate, unsecured lending to consumers with strong credit through its proprietary online loan origination system.
indirect auto loan portfolio the indirect auto portfolio primarily includes secured indirect installment loans to consumers for the purchase of new and used automobiles. the indirect auto portfolio also includes nonprime and near prime automobile finance. such loans are originated through approved franchised and independent dealers throughout the truist market area and nationally through regional acceptance corporation. these loans are relatively homogeneous and no single loan is individually significant in terms of its size and potential risk of loss. indirect auto loans are subject to rigorous lending policies and procedures and are underwritten with note amounts and credit limits that are consistent with the company's risk philosophy. in addition to its normal underwriting due diligence, truist uses application systems and scoring systems to help underwrite and manage the credit risk in its indirect auto portfolio.
indirect other loan portfolio the indirect other portfolio includes secured indirect installment loans to consumers for the purchase of new and used boats and recreational vehicles. the indirect other portfolio also includes small ticket consumer lending related to the purchase of power sports equipment. these loans are relatively homogeneous and no single loan is individually significant in terms of its size and potential risk of loss. these loans are subject to similar rigorous lending policies and procedures as the indirect auto loan portfolio. the indirect other loan portfolio also includes other indirect and point-of-sale lending to consumers to finance home improvements, furniture purchases, certain elective health-care services, power sports, trailer, and other consumer products segments. these loans are originated in accordance with strict underwriting criteria as determined by truist.
truist financial corporation 51
student loan portfolio the student loan portfolio is primarily composed of government guaranteed student loans and additionally includes certain private student loans originated by third parties. the government guarantee mitigates substantially all of the risk related to principal and interest repayment for this component of the portfolio. private student loans were purchased from third party originators with credit enhancements that partially mitigate the company's credit exposure.
credit card loan portfolio the credit card portfolio consists of the outstanding balances on credit cards. truist markets credit cards to its existing client base and does not solicit cardholders through nationwide programs or other forms of mass marketing. such balances are generally unsecured and actively managed.

in the fourth quarter of 2021, the company reclassified the lease financing portfolio to the commercial and industrial portfolio. prior periods were reclassified to conform to the current presentation.
loans and leases hfi were $289.5 billion at december 31, 2021, down $10.2 billion compared to 2020.
commercial loans decreased $9.0 billion during 2021 primarily due to a decline of $8.7 billion in ppp loans (commercial and industrial). the carrying value of ppp loans was $2.1 billion and $10.8 billion as of december 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. excluding ppp loans, commercial and industrial loans were up $3.8 billion, or 2.9%, while cre and commercial construction declined $2.6 billion, or 10%, and $1.5 billion, or 23%, respectively.
consumer loans decreased $1.2 billion during 2021 primarily due to refinance activity resulting in a $998 million decline in residential home equity and direct loans and a $772 million decline in student loans due to paydowns on government guaranteed loans. this was partially offset by a $580 million increase in residential mortgages due to the strategy to put certain correspondent channel production onto the balance sheet and lower prepayments.

at december 31, 2021, the allowance for loan and lease losses was 4.07 times nonperforming loans and leases held for investment, compared to 4.39 times at december 31, 2020. at december 31, 2021, the allowance for loan and lease losses was 6.36 times annualized net charge-offs, compared to 5.21 times at december 31, 2020.
net charge-offs during 2021 totaled $697 million, down $422 million compared to the prior year, reflecting truist's prudent risk culture, portfolio diversification, improving economic conditions, and the ongoing effects of government stimulus. as a percentage of average loans and leases, annualized net charge-offs were 0.24%, down 12 basis points compared to the prior year. prior year net charge-offs include $97 million of charge-offs related to the implementation of cecl, which required a gross-up of loan carrying values in connection with the establishment of an allowance on pcd loans. management performed a comprehensive review of pcd assets during the year and concluded in certain situations that a charge-off was required. excluding these additional charge-offs, net charge-offs would have been an annualized 0.33% of average loans and leases for 2020.

truist monitors the performance of its home equity loans and lines secured by second liens similarly to other consumer loans and utilizes assumptions specific to these loans in determining the necessary alll. truist also receives notification when the first lien holder, whether truist or another financial institution, has initiated foreclosure proceedings against the borrower. when notified that the first lien is in the process of foreclosure, truist obtains valuations to determine if any additional charge-offs or reserves are warranted. these valuations are updated at least annually thereafter.
truist has limited ability to monitor the delinquency status of the first lien, unless the first lien is held or serviced by truist. truist estimates second lien loans where the first lien is delinquent based on historical experience; the increased risk of loss on these credits is reflected in the alll. as of december 31, 2021, truist held or serviced the first lien on 30% of its second lien positions.

funding activities deposits are the primary source of funds for the company's lending and investing activities. scheduled payments and maturities from portfolios of loans and investment securities also provide a stable source of funds. fhlb advances, other secured borrowings, federal funds purchased and other short-term borrowed funds, as well as long-term debt issued through the capital markets, all provide supplemental liquidity sources. funding activities are monitored and governed through truist's overall alm process under the governance and oversight of the mrlcc, which is further discussed in the "market risk management" section in md&a. the following section provides a brief description of the various sources of funds.

deposits deposits are obtained principally from individuals and businesses within truist's geographic area and include noninterest-bearing checking accounts, interest-bearing checking accounts, savings accounts, money market deposit accounts, cds and iras. deposit account terms vary with respect to the minimum balance required, the time period the funds must remain on deposit and service charge schedules. interest rates paid on specific deposit types are determined based on (i) competitor deposit rates, (ii) the anticipated amount and timing of funding needs, (iii) the availability and cost of alternative sources of funding, and (iv) anticipated future economic conditions and interest rates. deposits are attractive sources of funding because of their stability and relative cost.

risk management truist maintains a comprehensive risk management framework supported by people, processes, and systems to identify, measure, monitor, manage, and report significant risks arising from its exposures and business activities. effective risk management involves optimizing risk and return while operating in a safe and sound manner, and promoting compliance with applicable laws and regulations. the company's risk management framework promotes the execution of business strategies and objectives in alignment with its risk appetite.
truist financial corporation 61
truist has developed and employs a risk taxonomy that further guides business functions in identifying, measuring, responding to, monitoring, and reporting on possible exposures to the organization. the risk taxonomy drives internal risk conversations and enables truist to clearly and transparently communicate to stakeholders the level of potential risk the company faces, both presently and in the future, and the company's position on managing risk to acceptable levels.
truist is committed to fostering a culture that supports identification and escalation of risks across the organization. all teammates are responsible for upholding the company's purpose, mission, and values, and are encouraged to speak up if there is any activity or behavior that is inconsistent with the company's culture. the truist code of ethics guides the company's decision making and informs teammates on how to act in the absence of specific guidance.
truist seeks an appropriate return for the risk taken in its business operations. risk-taking activities are evaluated and prioritized to identify those that present attractive risk-adjusted returns, while preserving asset value and capital.
compensation decisions take into account a teammate's adherence to and successful implementation of truist's risk values and associated policies and procedures. the company's compensation structure supports its core values and sound risk management practices in an effort to promote judicious risk-taking behavior.
truist employs a comprehensive change management program to manage the risks associated with integrating heritage bb&t and heritage suntrust. the board and executive leadership oversee the change management program, which is designed to ensure key decisions are reviewed and that there is appropriate oversight of integration activities.
truist's purpose, mission, and values are the foundation for the risk management framework utilized at truist and therefore serve as the basis on which the risk appetite and risk strategy are built. truist's rmo provides independent oversight and guidance for risk-taking across the enterprise. in keeping with the belief that consistent values drive long-term behaviors, truist's rmo has established the following risk values which guide teammates' day-to-day activities:
•managing risk is the responsibility of every teammate.
•proactively identifying risk and managing the inherent risks of their businesses is the responsibility of the business units.
•managing risk with a balanced approach which includes quality, profitability, and growth.
•measuring what is managed and managing what is measured.
•utilizing sound and consistent risk management practices.
•thoroughly analyzing risk quantitatively and qualitatively.
•realizing lower cost of capital from high quality risk management.
truist places significant emphasis on risk management oversight and maintains a separate board-level risk committee, which assists the board in its oversight of the company's risk management function. the committee is responsible for approving and periodically reviewing the company's risk management framework and risk management policies as well as monitoring the company's risk profile, approving risk appetite statements, and providing input to management regarding truist's risk appetite and risk profile.
the rmo is led by the cro and is responsible for overseeing the identification, measurement, monitoring, management, and reporting of risk. the cro has direct access to the board to communicate any risk issues (current or emerging) as well as the performance of the risk management activities throughout the enterprise.
as illustrated below, the risk management framework is supported by three lines of defense. the following figure describes the roles of the three lines of defense:
62 truist financial corporation truist's risk governance framework is designed to provide comprehensive board and executive leadership risk oversight, maintaining a committee governance structure that is designed to ensure alignment and execution of the risk management framework. the committee structure provides a mechanism to allow for efficient aggregation and escalation of risk information from the business units up to the risk programs, executive leadership and ultimately the board.
the executive level committees include the erc, ecrc, mrlcc, ebpcc, tmc, and dc, each of which is chaired by a member of executive leadership. these committees provide oversight of each of the primary risk types.
the erc establishes a fully integrated view of risks across the company, provides broad strategic oversight of all risk types, and oversees corporate-wide strategies for identifying, assessing, controlling, measuring, monitoring, and reporting risk at the enterprise level. the erc is responsible for maintaining an effective risk management framework and monitoring its adoption and execution across the enterprise. the erc is chaired by the cro and its membership includes all members of executive leadership and the general auditor.

the principal types of inherent risk include climate, market, credit, liquidity, compliance, strategic, reputational, operational, and technology risks. the following is a discussion of these risks.
climate risk climate risk includes the risks arising from a changing climate and the economic activities or trends resulting from the mitigation of climate change. these risks are classified into two categories, physical risks, resulting from acute weather events and chronic changes in climate conditions; as well as, transition risks, related to the changing economic conditions resulting from the transition to a low-carbon economy.
during 2021, truist expanded its risk management teams and created a dedicated climate risk management function that seeks to identify and evaluate climate risks and opportunities, and integrate them into the company's risk management framework and strategic plans. truist has conducted initial assessments of its exposure to various forms of climate risk including flooding, hurricane wind, and wildfire risks facing the real estate secured portfolios. transition risks facing truist's commercial clients have also been evaluated against key risk drivers including, stakeholders, legal, regulatory, and technology. these risk assessments and broader climate scenario analysis will continue to be refined while climate risk related metrics are developed and incorporated into risk monitoring processes across the company.
market risk market risk is the risk to current or anticipated earnings, capital, or economic value arising from changes in the market value of portfolios, securities, or other financial instruments. market risk results from changes in the level, volatility, or correlations among financial market risk factors or prices, including interest rates, credit spreads, foreign exchange rates, equity, and commodity prices.
effective management of market risk is essential to achieving truist's strategic financial objectives. truist's most significant market risk exposure is to interest rate risk in its balance sheet; however, market risk also results from underlying product liquidity risk, price risk, and volatility risk in truist's business units. interest rate risk results from differences between the timing of rate changes and the timing of cash flows associated with assets and liabilities (re-pricing risk); from changing rate relationships among different yield curves affecting bank activities (basis risk); from changing rate relationships across the spectrum of maturities (yield curve risk); and from interest-related options inherently embedded in bank products (options risk).
the primary objectives of effective market risk management are to minimize adverse effects from changes in market risk factors on net interest income, net income, and capital, and to offset the risk of price changes for certain assets and liabilities recorded at fair value. at truist, market risk management also includes the enterprise-wide ipv function.
interest rate market risk as a financial institution, truist is exposed to interest rate risk from assets, liabilities, and off-balance sheet positions. to keep net interest margin as stable as possible, truist actively manages its interest rate risk exposure through the strategic repricing of its assets and liabilities, taking into account the volumes, maturities, and mix. truist primarily uses three methods to measure and monitor its interest rate risk: (i) simulations of possible changes to net interest income over the next two years based on gradual changes in interest rates; (ii) analysis of interest rate shock scenarios; and (iii) analysis of economic value of equity based on changes in interest rates.
the company's simulation model takes into account assumptions related to prepayment trends, using a combination of market data and internal historical experiences for deposits and loans, as well as scheduled maturities and payments, and the expected outlook for the economy and interest rates. these assumptions are reviewed and adjusted monthly to reflect changes in current interest rates compared to the rates applicable to truist's assets and liabilities. the model also considers truist's current and prospective liquidity position, current balance sheet volumes, projected growth and/or contractions, accessibility of funds for short-term needs and capital maintenance.
deposit betas (the sensitivity of deposit rate changes relative to market rate changes) are an important assumption in the interest rate risk modeling process. truist applies deposit beta assumptions to non-maturity interest-bearing deposit accounts when determining its interest rate sensitivity. non-maturity, interest-bearing deposit accounts include interest checking accounts, savings accounts, and money market accounts that do not have a contractual maturity. truist utilizes a tiered deposit beta assumption framework that accounts for historically observed behaviors of clients and the company. the deposit beta assumptions are reduced when interest rates are exceptionally low and competition for interest-bearing deposits is commensurately low. as interest rates rise, the deposit beta assumptions also rise to reflect increasing competition among banks as well as increased client demand for interest-bearing deposits. truist applies an average deposit beta of approximately 25% for the first 100 basis point increase in the federal funds rate, approximately 35% for the second 100 basis point increase, and approximately 50% for any additional increases. truist also regularly conducts sensitivity analyses on other key variables, including noninterest-bearing deposits, to determine the impact these variables could have on the company's interest rate risk position. the predictive value of the simulation model depends upon the accuracy of the assumptions, but management believes that it provides helpful information for the management of interest rate risk.

truist has established parameters related to interest rate sensitivity measures that prescribe a maximum negative impact on net interest income under different interest rate scenarios that would result in an escalation to the board. the following parameters and interest rate scenarios are considered truist's primary measures of interest rate risk:
•maximum decrease in net interest income of 7.5% for the next 12 months assuming a 25 basis point change in interest rates each quarter for four quarters; and a
•maximum decrease in net interest income of 10% for the next 12 months assuming an immediate 100 basis point parallel shock change in interest rates. this interest rate shock analysis is designed to create an outer bound of acceptable interest rate risk.
management considers how the interest rate risk position could be impacted by changes in balance sheet mix. liquidity in the banking industry has been very strong during the current economic cycle. much of this liquidity increase has resulted in growth in noninterest-bearing demand deposits. consistent with the industry, truist has seen a significant increase in this funding source. the behavior of these deposits is one of the most important assumptions used in determining the interest rate risk position of truist. a decrease in the amount of these deposits in the future would reduce the asset sensitivity of truist's balance sheet because the company may increase interest-bearing funds to offset the loss of this advantageous funding source. alternatively, the company may reduce the size of its investment portfolio to offset the loss of noninterest-bearing demand deposits to limit the impact on the balance sheet's asset sensitivity.
the following table shows the results of truist's interest-rate sensitivity position assuming the loss of demand deposits and an associated increase in managed rate deposits under various scenarios. for purposes of this analysis, truist modeled the incremental beta of managed rate deposits for the replacement of the demand deposits at 100%.

libor transition libor in its current form will no longer be available after 2021. for most tenors of u.s. dollar libor, the administrator of libor extended publication until june 30, 2023. tenors used infrequently by truist, including one week and two month u.s. dollar libor and all non-u.s. dollar libor, ceased publication at december 31, 2021, based on the october 20, 2021 interagency joint statement on managing the libor transition. to prepare for the transition to an alternative reference rate, management formed a cross-functional project team to address the libor transition. the project team performed an assessment to identify the potential risks related to the transition from libor to a new index or multiple indices and provides updates to executive leadership and the board. as of december 2021, truist had outstanding libor-based instruments that mature after june 30, 2023, including: loan and lease exposures totaling approximately $151 billion, notional derivative exposure totaling approximately $131 billion, long-term debt of $1.1 billion, and preferred stock of $1.5 billion. these amounts are inclusive of remediated contracts, which contain adequate fallback language for the transition.
contract fallback language for existing loans and leases has largely been reviewed and certain contracts will require amendments to support the transition away from libor. for impacted lines of business, the company has started remediating these contracts to include standardized fallback language. current fallback language used for new, renewed, and modified contracts is generally consistent with arrc recommendations and includes use of "hardwired fallback" language, where appropriate.
the progress and approach to remediation will vary based on the type of contract and existing language used in the agreement. for commercial lending and general consumer lending, a significant number of remaining libor contracts will require client outreach and remediation. efforts to amend and remediate contracts, excluding mortgage and student loans, that mature post june 30, 2023 ($141 billion) will be accelerated in 2022. truist has determined that adjustable rate mortgage products ($4.3 billion) have consistent and adequate fallback language to transition away from libor in line with industry expectations; therefore, these contracts will not require remediation. remediation of student loans ($6.1 billion) will depend on guidance from the department of education and recent guidance from the cfpb to allow transition to "comparable rates," including sofr or prime. derivatives will utilize recent new york legislation to support transition of trades to follow the isda protocol (where counterparties have not already adhered to the protocol). truist will evaluate legislation being considered in 2022 to further support the transition away from libor. this legislation may provide additional administrative benefit for a small portion of the commercial and consumer lending portfolios where contracts do not contain fallback language.
training has been provided for impacted teammates and will continue during 2022. truist will continue to provide timely notices and information to impacted clients about the transition during 2022 and the first half of 2023. truist continues to manage the impact of these contracts and other financial instruments, systems implications, hedging strategies, and related operational and market risks on established project plans for business and operational readiness to support the transition.
as of december 31, 2021, truist ceased entering into new contracts with a libor reference rate for all product offerings, except on a limited basis, as permissible. market risks associated with this change are dependent on the alternative reference rates available and market conditions as of the transition. the company is actively using sofr as a reference rate and has originated approximately $18.3 billion of loans, issued $5.0 billion of long-term debt, and has $44.9 billion in notional derivative exposure using this alternative reference rate as of december 31, 2021. truist expects sofr to become a more commonly-used pricing benchmark across the industry and will continue to offer additional sofr based products during 2022. additional alternative reference rates, such as bloomberg short term bank yield will be supported based on market demand. other emerging credit sensitive rates will be evaluated as additional alternatives for libor based on market developments. for a further discussion of the various risks associated with the potential cessation of libor and the transition to alternative reference rates, refer to the section titled "item1a. risk factors."
market risk from trading activities as a financial intermediary, truist provides its clients access to derivatives, foreign exchange and securities markets, which generate market risks. trading market risk is managed using a comprehensive risk management approach, which includes measuring risk using var, stress testing, and sensitivity analysis. risk metrics are monitored against a suite of limits on a daily basis at both the trading desk level and at the aggregate portfolio level, which is intended to ensure that exposures are in line with truist's risk appetite.
truist is also subject to risk-based capital guidelines for market risk under the market risk rule.
66 truist financial corporation covered trading positions covered positions subject to the market risk rule include trading assets and liabilities, specifically those held for the purpose of short-term resale or with the intent of benefiting from actual or expected short-term price movements or to lock in arbitrage profits. truist's trading portfolio of covered positions results primarily from market making and underwriting services for the company's clients, as well as associated risk mitigating hedging activity. the trading portfolio, measured in terms of var, consists primarily of four sub-portfolios of covered positions: (i) credit trading, (ii) fixed income securities, (iii) interest rate derivatives, and (iv) equity derivatives. as a market maker across different asset classes, truist's trading portfolio also contains other sub-portfolios, including foreign exchange, loan trading, and commodity derivatives; however, these portfolios do not generate material trading risk exposures.
valuation policies and methodologies exist for all trading positions. additionally, these positions are subject to independent price verification. see "note 19. derivative financial instruments," "note 18. fair value disclosures," and "critical accounting policies" herein for discussion of valuation policies and methodologies.
securitizations as of december 31, 2021, the aggregate market value of on-balance sheet securitization positions subject to the market risk rule was $51 million, all of which were non-agency asset backed securities positions. consistent with the market risk rule requirements, the company performs pre-purchase due diligence on each securitization position to identify the characteristics including, but not limited to, deal structure and the asset quality of the underlying assets, that materially affect valuation and performance. securitization positions are subject to truist's comprehensive risk management framework, which includes daily monitoring against a suite of limits. there were no off-balance sheet securitization positions during the reporting period.
correlation trading positions the trading portfolio of covered positions did not contain any correlation trading positions as of december 31, 2021.
var-based measures var measures the potential loss of a given position or portfolio of positions at a specified confidence level and time horizon. truist utilizes a historical var methodology to measure and aggregate risks across its covered trading positions. for risk management purposes, the var calculation is based on a historical simulation approach and measures the potential trading losses using a one-day holding period at a one-tail, 99% confidence level. for market risk rule purposes, the company calculates var using a 10-day holding period and a 99% confidence level. due to inherent limitations of the var methodology, such as the assumption that past market behavior is indicative of future market performance, var is only one of several tools used to measure and manage market risk. other tools used to actively manage market risk include stress testing, scenario analysis, and stop loss limits.
the trading portfolio's var profile is influenced by a variety of factors, including the size and composition of the portfolio, market volatility, and the correlation between different positions. a portfolio of trading positions is typically less risky than the sum of the risk from each of the individual sub-portfolios, because, under normal market conditions, risk within each category partially offsets the exposure to other risk categories. the following table summarizes certain var-based measures for the twelve months ended december 31, 2021 and 2020. during 2021, average one and ten day var measures declined from last year as heightened market volatility experienced during march 2020 aged out of the 12-month var look-back window.

stressed var-based measures stressed var, another component of market risk capital, is calculated using the same internal models as used for the var-based measure. stressed var is calculated over a ten-day holding period at a one-tail, 99% confidence level and employs a historical simulation approach based on a continuous twelve-month historical window selected to reflect a period of significant financial stress for the company's trading portfolio. the following table summarizes stressed var-based measures:

compared to the prior year, stressed var measures increased in 2021 primarily due to the normalization of market making inventory levels this year compared to 2020 when inventory levels were lower due to the market volatility.
specific risk measures specific risk is a measure of idiosyncratic risk that could result from risk factors other than broad market movements (e.g. default, event risks). the market risk rule provides fixed risk weights under a standardized measurement method while also allowing a model-based approach, subject to regulatory approval. truist utilizes the standardized measurement method to calculate the specific risk component of market risk regulatory capital. as such, incremental risk capital requirements do not apply.
var model backtesting in accordance with the market risk rule, the company evaluates the accuracy of its var model through daily backtesting by comparing aggregate daily trading gains and losses (excluding fees, commissions, reserves, net interest income, and intraday trading) from covered positions with the corresponding daily var-based measures generated by the model. as illustrated in the following graph, there were no company-wide var backtesting exceptions during the twelve months ended december 31, 2021. the total number of company-wide var backtesting exceptions over the preceding twelve months is used to determine the multiplication factor for the var-based capital requirement under the market risk rule. the capital multiplication factor increases from a minimum of three to a maximum of four, depending on the number of exceptions. all company-wide var backtesting exceptions are thoroughly reviewed in the context of var model use and performance. there was no change in the capital multiplication factor over the preceding twelve months.
68 truist financial corporation model risk management mrm is responsible for the independent model validation of all decision tools and models including trading market risk models. the validation activities are conducted in accordance with mrm policy, which incorporates regulatory guidance related to the evaluation of model conceptual soundness, ongoing monitoring, and outcomes analysis. as part of ongoing monitoring efforts, the performance of all trading risk models are reviewed regularly to preemptively address emerging developments in financial markets, assess evolving modeling approaches, and to identify potential model enhancement.
stress testing the company uses a comprehensive range of stress testing techniques to help monitor risks across trading desks and to augment standard daily var and other risk limits reporting. the stress testing framework is designed to quantify the impact of extreme, but plausible, stress scenarios that could lead to large unexpected losses. stress tests include simulations for historical repeats and hypothetical risk factor shocks. all trading positions within each applicable market risk category (interest rate risk, equity risk, foreign exchange rate risk, credit spread risk, and commodity price risk) are included in the company's comprehensive stress testing framework. management reviews stress testing scenarios on an ongoing basis and makes updates, as necessary, which is intended to ensure that both current and emerging risks are captured appropriately. management also utilizes stress analyses to support the company's capital adequacy assessment standards. see the "capital" section of md&a for additional discussion of capital adequacy.
credit risk credit risk is the risk to current or anticipated earnings or capital arising from the default, inability or unwillingness of a borrower, obligor, or counterparty to meet the terms of any financial obligation to truist or otherwise perform as agreed. credit risk exists in all activities where success depends on the performance of a borrower, obligor, or counterparty. credit risk arises when truist funds are extended, committed, invested, or otherwise exposed through actual or implied contractual agreements, whether on or off-balance sheet. credit risk increases when the credit quality of an issuer whose securities or other instruments the bank holds deteriorates.
truist has established the following general practices to manage credit risk:
•limiting the amount of credit that individual lenders may extend to a borrower;
•establishing a process for credit approval accountability;
•careful initial underwriting and analysis of borrower, transaction, market and collateral risks;
•ongoing servicing and monitoring of individual loans and lending relationships;
•continuous monitoring of the portfolio, market dynamics and the economy; and
•periodically reevaluating the company's strategy and overall exposure as economic, market and other relevant conditions change.
the following discussion describes the underwriting procedures and overall risk management of truist's lending function.
underwriting approach the loan portfolio is a primary source of profitability and risk; therefore, proper loan underwriting is critical to truist's long-term financial success. truist's underwriting approach is designed to define acceptable combinations of specific risk-mitigating features that promote credit relationships that conform to truist's risk philosophy. provided below is a summary of the most significant underwriting criteria used to evaluate new loans and loan renewals:
•cash flow and debt service coverage - cash flow adequacy is a necessary condition of creditworthiness, meaning that loans must either be clearly supported by a borrower's cash flow or, if not, must be justified by secondary repayment sources.
•secondary sources of repayment - alternative repayment funds are a significant risk-mitigating factor as long as they are liquid, can be easily accessed, and provide adequate resources to supplement the primary cash flow source.
•value of any underlying collateral - loans are generally secured by the asset being financed. because an analysis of the primary and secondary sources of repayment is the most important factor, collateral, unless it is liquid, does not justify loans that cannot be serviced by the borrower's normal cash flows.
•overall creditworthiness of the client, taking into account the client's relationships, both past and current, with truist and other lenders - truist's success depends on building lasting and mutually beneficial relationships with clients, which involves assessing their financial position and background.
•level of equity invested in the transaction - in general, borrowers are required to contribute or invest a portion of their own funds prior to any loan advances.
refer to the "lending activities" section in md&a for a discussion of each loan and lease portfolio.

liquidity risk liquidity risk is the risk that (i) truist will be unable to meet its obligations as they come due because of an inability to obtain adequate funding (funding liquidity risk), or (ii) truist cannot easily unwind or offset specific exposures without significantly lowering market prices because of inadequate market depth or market disruptions (market liquidity risk). refer to the "liquidity" section in md&a for additional discussion.
compliance risk compliance risk is the risk to current or anticipated earnings or capital arising from violations of laws, rules, or regulations, or from non-conformance with prescribed practices, internal policies and procedures or ethical standards. this risk exposes truist to fines, civil monetary penalties, payment of damages, and the voiding of contracts. compliance risk can result in diminished reputation, reduced franchise or enterprise value, limited business opportunities and lessened expansion potential.
strategic risk strategic risk is the risk of financial loss, diminished stakeholder confidence, or negative impact to human capital resulting from ineffective strategy setting and execution, adverse business decisions, or lack of responsiveness to changes in the banking industry and operating environment. truist is committed to fulfilling its overall strategic objectives by selecting business strategies and operating businesses in a manner consistent with achieving profitability/earnings growth and maintaining strong confidence and trust with its key stakeholder constituencies.
reputation risk reputation risk is the risk to current or anticipated earnings, capital, enterprise value, the truist brand, and public confidence arising from negative publicity or public opinion, whether real or perceived, regarding truist's business practices, products, services, transactions, or other activities undertaken by truist, its representatives, or its partners. a negative reputation may impair truist's relationship with clients, teammates, communities, or shareholders, and it is often a residual risk that arises when other risks are not managed properly.
operational risk operational risk is the risk to current or anticipated earnings or capital arising from inadequate or failed internal processes, people, and systems or from external events. it includes legal risk, which is the risk of loss arising from defective transactions, litigation or claims made, or the failure to adequately protect company-owned assets. an operational loss occurs when an event results in a loss or reserve originating from operational risk.
model risk model risk is the risk to current or anticipated earnings or capital from decisions based on incorrect or misused model outputs. truist uses models for many purposes, including the valuation of financial positions, estimation of credit losses, and the measurement of risk. valuation models are used to value certain financial instruments for which quoted prices may not be readily available. valuation models are also used as inputs for var, the estimation of var itself, regulatory capital, stress testing, and the acl. models are owned by the applicable bus, who are responsible for the development, implementation, and use of their models. oversight of these functions is performed by the mrm, which is a component of the rmo. once models have been approved, model owners are responsible for the maintenance of an appropriate operating environment and must monitor and evaluate the performance of the models on a recurring basis. models are updated in response to changes in portfolio composition, industry and economic conditions, technological capabilities and other developments.
mrm manages model risk in a holistic manner through a suite of model governance and model validation activities. the risk of each model is assessed and classified into various risk tiers. additionally, mrm maintains an enterprise-wide model inventory containing relevant model information. regarding model validation, mrm utilizes internal validation analysts and managers with skill sets in predictive modeling to perform detailed reviews of model development, implementation, and conceptual soundness. on certain occasions, the mrm will also engage external parties to assist with validation efforts. once in a production environment, mrm assesses a model's performance on a periodic basis through ongoing monitoring reviews. mrm tracks issues that have been identified during model validation or through ongoing monitoring, and engages with model owners to ensure their timely remediation. mrm gauges model risk utilizing a collection of key risk indicators, which are periodically reported to relevant committees, including but not limited to, the model risk management committee as well as the board risk committee. mrm will also present model risk topics to the board risk committee as necessary.
70 truist financial corporation technology risk technology risk is the business risk associated with the use, ownership, operation, involvement, influence, and adoption of information technology across the company. truist has defined and adopted a technology risk framework that provides the foundation for technology risk strategy, program, and oversight and defines key objectives, operating model components, risk domains, and capabilities to manage this risk.
merger integration risk the truist merger program was designed to ensure successful integration following the merger through strong governance practices and controls, with processes, metrics and reporting exemplifying a strong risk culture. the core truist merger program structure consists of key stakeholders from each line of business. integration activities and risk mitigation are monitored through established workgroups and truist merger program leadership, with oversight and escalation into the merger oversight committee (as the primary committee), tmc, and board technology committee.
cybersecurity risk the technology landscape is constantly evolving, and new and unforeseen threats and actions by others may disrupt operations or result in losses beyond truist's risk control thresholds. truist maintains a comprehensive risk-based information security / cybersecurity framework implemented through people, processes, and technology whereby truist actively monitors and evaluates threats, events, and the performance of its business operations and continually adapts its risk mitigation activities accordingly.
truist's framework aligns with those of the national institute of standards and technology, the international standards organization 27000 series, the it governance institute, and the control objectives for information and related technology, as well as conforms with the requirements and guidance from applicable regulatory authorities, including the federal financial institutions examination council. in addition, truist's framework, which includes internally and externally focused capabilities, drives the development and implementation of truist's data security strategy that is designed to reduce risk while enabling truist's corporate business objectives.
truist has built an organization with dedicated, skilled talent to operationalize truist's cybersecurity strategy. the cybersecurity strategy is enabled by continuous enhancement of truist's multilayered defenses including advanced capabilities for early and rapid cyber threat identification, detection, protection, response, and recovery. truist participates in the federally recognized financial services information sharing and analysis center as a key part of the company's cyber threat intelligence and response programs, as well as other industry organizations and initiatives that promote industry best practices such as harmonized cybersecurity standards, cyber readiness, and secure consumer financial data sharing.
to further mitigate the risks presented by an evolving cyber threat landscape, truist provides data protection guidance to clients and promotes data protection awareness and accountability through mandatory teammate training. truist conducts scenario-driven test exercises simulating impacts and consequences developed through analysis of real-world technology incidents as well as known and anticipated cyber threats. these exercises are designed to assess the viability of truist's crisis response and management programs and provide the basis for continuous improvement.
truist's cybersecurity risk program is overseen by executive leadership and the board. regular updates on the status of the cybersecurity risk program, including information security risks and incidents, emerging threats, and control environment, are aggregated and escalated to executive leadership and the board. additionally, truist has a cyber incident response team that manages significant cyber-specific events with escalation up to executive leadership and the board. truist's framework requires annual exercises at a minimum to test truist's preparedness. the board devotes significant time and attention to its oversight of cyber security risk and approves related information security policies. although truist has invested substantial resources to manage and reduce cybersecurity risk, it is not possible to completely eliminate this risk. truist obtains insurance that protects against certain losses, expenses, and damages associated with cybersecurity risk. see item 1a, "risk factors," for additional information regarding cybersecurity risk.
liquidity liquidity represents the continuing ability to meet funding needs, including deposit withdrawals, repayment of borrowings and other liabilities, and funding of loan commitments. in addition to the level of liquid assets, such as cash, cash equivalents, and afs securities, other factors affect the ability to meet liquidity needs, including access to a variety of funding sources, maintaining borrowing capacity, growing core deposits, loan repayment, and the ability to securitize or package loans for sale.
truist financial corporation 71
truist monitors the ability to meet client demand for funds under both normal and stressed market conditions. in considering its liquidity position, management evaluates truist's funding mix based on client core funding, client rate-sensitive funding, and national markets funding. in addition, management evaluates exposure to rate-sensitive funding sources that mature in one year or less. management also measures liquidity needs against 30 days of stressed cash outflows for truist and truist bank. to ensure a strong liquidity position and compliance with regulatory requirements, management maintains a liquid asset buffer of cash on hand and highly liquid unencumbered securities.
internal liquidity stress testing liquidity stress testing is designed to ensure that truist and truist bank have sufficient liquidity for a variety of institution-specific and market-wide adverse scenarios. each liquidity stress test scenario applies defined assumptions to execute sources and uses of liquidity over varying planning horizons. the types of expected liquidity uses during a stressed event may include deposit attrition, contractual maturities, reductions in unsecured and secured funding, and increased draws on unfunded commitments. to mitigate liquidity outflows, truist has identified sources of liquidity; however, access to these sources of liquidity could be affected within a stressed environment.
truist maintains a liquidity buffer of cash on hand and highly liquid unencumbered securities that is sufficient to meet the projected net stressed cash-flow needs and maintain compliance with regulatory requirements. the liquidity buffer consists of unencumbered highly liquid assets and truist's liquidity buffer is substantially the same in composition to what qualifies as hqla under the lcr rule.
contingency funding plan truist has a contingency funding plan designed to ensure that liquidity sources are sufficient to meet ongoing obligations and commitments, particularly in the event of a liquidity contraction. this plan is designed to examine and quantify the organization's liquidity under the various internal liquidity stress scenarios and is periodically tested to assess the plan's reliability. additionally, the plan provides a framework for management and other critical teammates to follow in the event of a liquidity contraction or in anticipation of such an event. the plan addresses authority for activation and decision making, liquidity options, and the responsibilities of key departments in the event of a liquidity contraction.
lcr and hqla the lcr rule requires that truist and truist bank maintain an amount of eligible hqla that is sufficient to meet its estimated total net cash outflows over a prospective 30 calendar-day period of stress. eligible hqla, for purposes of calculating the lcr, is the amount of unencumbered hqla that satisfy operational requirements of the lcr rule. truist and truist bank are subject to the category iii reduced lcr requirements. truist held average weighted eligible hqla of $86.7 billion and truist's average lcr was 114% for the three months ended december 31, 2021.
effective july 2021, truist became subject to final rules implementing the nsfr, which are designed to ensure that banking organizations maintain a stable, long-term funding profile in relation to their asset composition and off-balance sheet activities. at december 31, 2021, the company was compliant with this requirement.
sources of funds management believes current sources of liquidity are sufficient to meet truist's on- and off-balance sheet obligations. truist funds its balance sheet through diverse sources of funding including client deposits, secured and unsecured capital markets funding, and shareholders' equity. truist bank's primary source of funding is client deposits. continued access to client deposits is highly dependent on public confidence in the stability of truist bank and its ability to return funds to clients when requested.
truist bank maintains a number of diverse funding sources to meet its liquidity requirements. these sources include unsecured borrowings from the capital markets through the issuance of senior or subordinated bank notes, institutional cds, overnight and term federal funds markets, and retail brokered cds. truist bank also maintains access to secured borrowing sources including fhlb advances, repurchase agreements, and the frb discount window. the following table presents a summary of truist bank's available secured borrowing capacity and eligible cash at the frb:

at december 31, 2021, truist bank's available secured borrowing capacity represented approximately 14.2 times the amount of wholesale funding maturities in one-year or less.
parent company the parent company serves as the primary source of capital for the operating subsidiaries. the parent company's assets consist primarily of cash on deposit with truist bank, equity investments in subsidiaries, advances to subsidiaries, and notes receivable from subsidiaries. the principal obligations of the parent company are payments on long-term debt. the main sources of funds for the parent company are dividends and management fees from subsidiaries, repayments of advances to subsidiaries, and proceeds from the issuance of equity and long-term debt. the primary uses of funds by the parent company are investments in subsidiaries, advances to subsidiaries, dividend payments to common and preferred shareholders, repurchases of common stock, and payments on long-term debt. see "note 22. parent company financial information" for additional information regarding dividends from subsidiaries and debt transactions.
access to funding at the parent company is more sensitive to market disruptions. therefore, truist prudently manages cash levels at the parent company to cover a minimum of one year of projected cash outflows which includes unfunded external commitments, debt service, common and preferred dividends and scheduled debt maturities, without the benefit of any new cash inflows. truist maintains a significant buffer above the projected one year of cash outflows. in determining the buffer, truist considers cash requirements for common and preferred dividends, unfunded commitments to affiliates, serving as a source of strength to truist bank, and being able to withstand sustained market disruptions that could limit access to the capital markets. at december 31, 2021 and december 31, 2020, the parent company had 35 months and 43 months, respectively, of cash on hand to satisfy projected cash outflows, and 19 months and 22 months, respectively, when including the payment of common stock dividends.
credit ratings credit ratings are forward-looking opinions of rating agencies as to the company's ability to meet its financial commitments and repay its securities and obligations in accordance with their terms of issuance. credit ratings influence both borrowing costs and access to the capital markets. the company's credit ratings are continuously monitored by the rating agencies and are subject to change at any time. as truist seeks to maintain high-quality credit ratings, management meets with the major rating agencies on a regular basis to provide financial and business updates and to discuss current outlooks and trends. see item 1a, "risk factors," for additional information regarding factors that influence credit ratings and potential risks that could materialize in the event of downgrade in the company's credit ratings.

recent changes in the company's credit ratings and outlooks include:
•on may 7, 2021, fitch ratings affirmed the ratings of truist and truist bank and revised the ratings outlook to "stable" from "negative" based on the view that the company's diverse business model and solid strategy execution will drive stable earnings performance, and on increased confidence in a u.s. economic recovery.
•on may 24, 2021, s&p global ratings affirmed the ratings of truist and truist bank and revised its ratings outlook to "positive" from "stable," citing stabilization in u.s. economic trends and the easing of industry risk in the u.s. banking system, and noting that the merger of equals provides better diversity and market position, and could generate higher earnings power, financial flexibility, and technology, providing the company with a sustainable competitive advantage.
•on june 10, 2021, dbrs morningstar confirmed the ratings of truist and truist bank and revised the trend for all ratings to "positive" from "stable", reflecting the company's substantial progress with the merger integration and the view that the impact of the economic fallout from the coronavirus pandemic will continue to be manageable.
•on july 12, 2021, moody's investors service upgraded truist bank's long-term subordinated debt rating to a2 from a3, and downgraded truist bank's long-term bank deposit rating to aa3 from aa2, following revisions to moody's advanced loss given failure analysis that were published in its updated banks methodology on july 9, 2021.
•on december 7, 2021, moody's investors service released esg issuer profile scores (ips) and credit impact scores (cis) to assist in demonstrating the impact of esg on credit ratings. ips assess an issuer's exposure to the risk categories in moody's esg classification system from a credit perspective. cis indicate the extent to which esg factors impacted the issuer's credit ratings. consistent with most other banks, truist was assigned an ips of e-3, s-4, and g-2, and a cis of cis-2, the latter indicating that esg attributes had a neutral-to-low impact on truist's current ratings.
•on january 19, 2022, s&p global ratings published truist's assigned esg credit indicators of e-2, s-2, and g-2, which were consistent with the scores assigned to most other banks and which indicated that environmental, social and governance factors have "no material influence" on the rating agency's analysis of the company.
management believes current sources of liquidity are adequate to meet truist's current requirements and plans for continued growth. as of december 31, 2021, the company had $1.9 billion in obligations to purchase goods or services that are enforceable and legally binding. many of the purchase obligations have terms that are not fixed and determinable and are included in the total amount of obligations based upon the estimated timing and amount of payment. in addition, certain of the purchase agreements contain clauses that would allow truist to cancel the agreement with specified notice; however, that impact is not included in determining the total amount of obligations. see "note 9. other assets and liabilities," "note 11. borrowings," and "note 16. commitments and contingencies" for additional information regarding outstanding balances of sources of liquidity and contractual commitments and obligations.
capital the maintenance of appropriate levels of capital is a management priority and is monitored on a regular basis. truist's principal goals related to the maintenance of capital are to provide adequate capital to support truist's risk profile consistent with the board-approved risk appetite, provide financial flexibility to support future growth and client needs, comply with relevant laws, regulations, and supervisory guidance, achieve optimal credit ratings for truist and its subsidiaries, remain a source of strength for its subsidiaries, and provide a competitive return to shareholders. risk-based capital ratios, which include cet1 capital, tier 1 capital, and total capital are calculated based on regulatory guidance related to the measurement of capital and risk-weighted assets.
truist regularly performs stress testing on its capital levels and is required to periodically submit the company's capital plans and stress testing results to the banking regulators. management regularly monitors the capital position of truist on both a consolidated and bank-level basis. in this regard, management's overriding policy is to maintain capital at levels that are in excess of internal capital targets, which are above the regulatory "well capitalized" minimums. management evaluates whether capital ratios calculated after the effect of alternative capital actions are likely to remain above minimums specified by the frb for the annual ccar process. breaches of minimum targets prompt a review of the planned capital actions included in truist's capital plan.

74 truist financial corporation payments of cash dividends and repurchases of common shares are the methods used to manage any excess capital generated. in addition, management closely monitors the parent company's double leverage ratio (investments in subsidiaries as a percentage of shareholders' equity). the active management of the subsidiaries' equity capital is the process used to manage this important driver of parent company liquidity and is a key element in the management of truist's capital position.
management intends to maintain capital at truist bank at levels that will result in classification as "well-capitalized" for regulatory purposes. secondarily, it is management's intent to maintain truist bank's capital at levels that result in regulatory risk-based capital ratios that are generally comparable with peers of similar size, complexity, and risk profile. if the capital levels of truist bank increase above these guidelines, excess capital may be transferred to the parent company in the form of special dividend payments, subject to regulatory and other operating considerations.
management's capital deployment plan in order of preference is to focus on (i) organic growth, (ii) dividends, and (iii) strategic opportunities and/or share repurchases depending on opportunities in the marketplace and truist's interest and ability to proceed with acquisitions.

(1)tangible common equity and related measures are non-gaap measures that exclude the impact of intangible assets, net of deferred taxes, and their related amortization. these measures are useful for evaluating the performance of a business consistently, whether acquired or developed internally. truist's management uses these measures to assess the quality of capital and returns relative to balance sheet risk. these capital measures are not necessarily comparable to similar capital measures that may be presented by other companies.
truist's capital level at december 31, 2021 remains strong compared to the regulatory levels for well capitalized banks. truist's cet1 ratio was 9.6% as of december 31, 2021. the decline compared to the 2020 cet1 ratio reflects capital deployed through the acquisitions of service finance, llc and constellation affiliated partners, the repurchase of common stock, and loan growth in the fourth quarter of 2021 driving an increase in risk-weighted assets. truist increased common dividends 7% to $0.48 per share starting in the third quarter of 2021. during 2021, truist paid $2.5 billion in common stock dividends or $1.86 per share, and repurchased $1.6 billion of common stock. truist also redeemed $1.4 billion of preferred stock to optimize the company's capital position. the dividend payout ratio for 2021 was 41% compared to 58% for the prior year. the total payout ratio for 2021 was 68% compared to 58% for the prior year, reflecting the resumption of share repurchases during the year. in early 2022, truist declared common dividends of $0.48 per share for the first quarter of 2022, and announced the acquisition of kensington vanguard national land services to expand ih's title insurance operation.

reclassifications in certain circumstances, reclassifications have been made to prior period information to conform to the current presentation. such reclassifications had no effect on previously reported shareholders' equity or net income. refer to "note 1. basis of presentation" for additional discussion regarding reclassifications.
critical accounting policies the accounting and reporting policies of truist are in accordance with gaap and conform to the accounting and reporting guidelines prescribed by bank regulatory authorities. the financial position and results of operations are affected by management's application of accounting policies, including estimates, assumptions and judgments made to arrive at the carrying value of assets and liabilities and amounts reported for revenues and expenses. different assumptions in the application of these policies could result in material changes in the consolidated financial position and/or consolidated results of operations and related disclosures. understanding truist's accounting policies is fundamental to understanding the consolidated financial position and consolidated results of operations. accordingly, truist's significant accounting policies and effects of new accounting pronouncements are discussed in detail in "note 1. basis of presentation."
the following is a summary of truist's critical accounting policies that are highly dependent on estimates, assumptions, and judgments. these critical accounting policies are reviewed with the audit committee of the board of directors on a periodic basis.
acl truist's acl represents management's best estimate of expected future credit losses related to the loan and lease portfolios and off-balance sheet lending commitments at the balance sheet date. estimates of expected future loan and lease losses are determined by using statistical models and management's judgement. the models are designed to forecast probability of default, exposure at default and loss given default by correlating certain macroeconomic forecast data to historical experience. the models are generally applied at the portfolio level to pools of loans with similar risk characteristics. the macroeconomic data used in the models is based on forecasted variables for the reasonable and supportable period of two years. beyond this forecast period the models gradually revert to long-term historical loss conditions over a one year period. as a means of addressing uncertainty related to future economic conditions, the quantitative allowance includes an adjustment that reflects model output calculated using a range of potential future economic conditions. expected losses are estimated through contractual maturity, giving appropriate consideration to expected prepayments unless the borrower has a right to renew that is not cancellable or it is reasonably expected that the loan will be modified as a tdr.
a qualitative allowance which incorporates management's judgement is also included in the estimation of expected future loan and lease losses, including qualitative adjustments in circumstances where the model output is inconsistent with management's expectations with respect to expected credit losses. this allowance is used to adjust for limitations in modeled results related to the current economic conditions, and considerations with respect to the impact of current and expected events or risks, the outcomes of which are uncertain and may not be completely considered by quantitative models.
management considers a range of macroeconomic forecast data in connection with the allowance estimation process. under the range of scenarios considered as of december 31, 2021, use of the company's pessimistic scenario would have resulted in an increase to the modeled allowance results of approximately $2.1 billion. this estimate reflects the sensitivity of the modeled allowance estimate to macroeconomic forecast data but does not consider other qualitative adjustments that could increase or decrease modeled loss estimates calculated using this alternative economic scenario.
the company individually evaluates expected credits losses related to loans and leases that do not share similar risk characteristics and loans that have been classified as a tdr. for individually evaluated loans, the alll is determined through review of data specific to the borrower and related collateral, if any, while for tdrs, default expectations and estimated prepayment speeds that are specific to each of the restructured loan populations are incorporated in the determination of the alll.
the methodology used to determine an estimate for the rufc is similar to that used to determine the funded component of the alll and is measured over the period there is a contractual obligation to extend credit that is not unconditionally cancellable. the rufc is adjusted for factors specific to binding commitments, including the probability of funding and exposure at default. a detailed discussion of the methodology used in determining the acl is included in "note 1. basis of presentation."
fair value of financial instruments the vast majority of assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis are based on either quoted market prices or market prices for similar instruments. refer to "note 18. fair value disclosures" for additional disclosures regarding the fair value of financial instruments and "note 2. business combinations" for additional disclosures regarding business combinations.
76 truist financial corporation securities truist generally utilizes a third-party pricing service in determining the fair value of its afs investment securities, whereas trading securities are priced internally. fair value measurements for investment securities are derived from market-based pricing matrices that were developed using observable inputs that include benchmark yields, benchmark securities, reported trades, offers, bids, issuer spreads, and broker quotes. management performs procedures to evaluate the fair values provided by the third-party service provider. these procedures, which are performed independent of the responsible business unit, include comparison of pricing information received from the third party pricing service to other third-party pricing sources, review of additional information provided by the third-party pricing service and other third-party sources for selected securities and back-testing to compare the price realized on security sales to the daily pricing information received from the third-party pricing service. the enterprise valuation committee, which provides oversight to truist's enterprise-wide ipv function, is responsible for the comparison of pricing information received from the third-party pricing service or internally to other third-party pricing sources, approving tolerance limits determined by ipv for price comparison exceptions, reviewing significant changes to pricing and valuation policies and reviewing and approving the pricing decisions made on any illiquid and hard-to-price securities. when market observable data is not available, which generally occurs due to the lack of liquidity or inactive markets for certain securities, the valuation of the security is subjective and may involve substantial judgment by management to reflect unobservable input assumptions.
msrs truist's primary class of msrs for which it separately manages the economic risks relates to residential mortgages. residential msrs do not trade in an active, open market with readily observable prices. while sales of msrs do occur, the precise terms and conditions typically are not readily available. accordingly, truist estimates the fair value of residential msrs using a stochastic oas valuation model to project residential msr cash flows over multiple interest rate scenarios, which are then discounted at risk-adjusted rates. the oas model considers portfolio characteristics, contractually-specified servicing fees, prepayment assumptions, delinquency rates, late charges, other ancillary revenue, costs to service and other economic factors. truist reassesses and periodically adjusts the underlying inputs and assumptions in the oas model to reflect market conditions and assumptions that a market participant would consider in valuing the residential msr asset.
fair value estimates and assumptions are compared to industry surveys, recent market activity, actual portfolio experience and, when available, observable market data. due to the nature of the valuation inputs, residential msrs are classified within level 3 of the valuation hierarchy. the value of residential msrs is significantly affected by mortgage interest rates available in the marketplace, which influence mortgage loan prepayment speeds. in general, during periods of declining interest rates, the value of msrs declines due to increasing prepayments attributable to increased mortgage-refinance activity. conversely, during periods of rising interest rates, the value of residential msrs generally increases due to reduced refinance activity. truist typically hedges against market value changes in the residential msrs. refer to "note 8. loan servicing" for quantitative disclosures reflecting the effect that changes in management's assumptions would have on the fair value of residential msrs.
lhfs truist originates certain residential and commercial mortgage loans for sale to investors that are measured at fair value. the fair value is primarily based on quoted market prices for securities backed by similar types of loans. changes in the fair value are recorded as components of residential mortgage income and commercial mortgage income, while the related origination costs are generally recognized in personnel expense when incurred. the changes in fair value are largely driven by changes in interest rates subsequent to loan funding and changes in the fair value of servicing associated with the lhfs. truist uses various derivative instruments to mitigate the economic effect of changes in fair value of the underlying loans. lhfs also includes certain loans, generally carried at locom, where management has committed to a formal plan of sale and the loans are available for immediate sale. adjustments to reflect unrealized gains and losses resulting from changes in fair value, up to the original carrying amount, and realized gains and losses upon ultimate sale are classified as noninterest income. the fair value of these loans is estimated using observable market prices when available. when observable market prices are not available, the company uses judgment and estimates fair value using internal models that reflect assumptions consistent with those that would be used by a market participant in estimating fair value. refer to "note 1. basis of presentation" for further description of the company's accounting for lhfs.

trading loans truist elects to measure certain loans at fair value for financial reporting where fair value aligns with the underlying business purpose. specifically, loans included within this classification include trading loans that are (i) purchased in connection with the company's trs business, (ii) part of the loan sales and trading business within the c&cb segment, or (iii) backed by the sba. refer to "note 16. commitments and contingencies," and "note 19. derivative financial instruments," for further discussion of the company's trs business. the loans purchased in connection with the company's trs and sales and trading businesses are primarily commercial and corporate leveraged loans valued based on quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active by a third party pricing service. sba loans are fully guaranteed by the u.s. government as to contractual principal and interest and there is sufficient observable trading activity upon which to base the estimate of fair value.
derivative assets and liabilities truist uses derivatives to manage various financial risks and in a dealer capacity to facilitate client transactions. truist mitigates credit risk by subjecting counterparties to credit reviews and approvals similar to those used in making loans and other extensions of credit. in addition, certain counterparties are required to provide collateral to truist when their unsecured loss positions exceed certain negotiated limits. the fair values of derivative financial instruments are determined based on quoted market prices and internal pricing models that use market observable data for interest rates, foreign exchange, equity, and credit. the fair value of interest rate lock commitments, which are related to mortgage loan commitments, is based on quoted market prices adjusted for commitments that truist does not expect to fund and includes the value attributable to the net servicing fee. refer to "note 19. derivative financial instruments" for further information on the company's derivatives.
goodwill and other intangible assets the acquisition method of accounting requires that assets acquired and liabilities assumed in business combinations are recorded at their fair values. this often involves estimates based on third party valuations or internal valuations based on discounted cash flow analyses or other valuation techniques, which are inherently subjective. the amortization of definite-lived intangible assets is based upon the estimated economic benefits to be received, which is also subjective. business combinations also typically result in goodwill, which is subject to ongoing periodic impairment tests based on the fair values of the reporting units to which the acquired goodwill relates. refer to "note 1. basis of presentation" for a description of the impairment testing process.
at december 31, 2021, truist's reporting units with goodwill balances were cb&w, c&cb, and ih. management reviews the goodwill of each reporting unit for impairment on an annual basis as of october 1 or more often if events or circumstances indicate that it is more-likely-than-not that the fair value of a reporting unit is below its carrying value. for its annual impairment review, truist elected to perform a quantitative test of each of its reporting units. the quantitative impairment test estimates the fair value of the reporting units using the income approach and market based approaches, weighted 50% and 50%, respectively. the income approach utilizes a discounted cash flow analysis. the market based approaches utilize comparable public company information, key valuation multiples, and considers a market control premium associated with cost synergies and other cash flow benefits that arise from obtaining control over a reporting unit, and guideline transactions, when applicable.
the inputs and assumptions specific to each reporting unit are incorporated in the valuations, including projections of future cash flows, discount rates, applicable valuation multiples based on the comparable public company information, and guideline transaction information. truist also assesses the reasonableness of the aggregate estimated fair value of the reporting units by comparison to its market capitalization over a reasonable period of time, including consideration of historic bank control premiums and the current market.
multi-year financial forecasts are developed for each reporting unit by considering several inputs and assumptions such as net interest margin, expected credit losses, noninterest income, noninterest expense, and required capital. of these inputs, the projection of net interest margin is the most significant to the financial projections of the cb&w and c&cb reporting units. the long-term growth rate used in determining the terminal value of each reporting unit was 3% as of october 1, 2021, based on management's assessment of the minimum expected terminal growth rate of each reporting unit. discount rates are estimated based on the capital asset pricing model, which considers the risk-free interest rate, market risk premium, beta, and unsystematic risk adjustments specific to a particular reporting unit. the discount rates are also calibrated based on risks related to the projected cash flows of each reporting unit. the discount rates utilized for the cb&w, c&cb, and ih reporting units as of october 1, 2021 were 11%, 10%, and 10%, respectively.
based on the company's annual impairment analysis of goodwill as of october 1, it was determined for the cb&w, c&cb, and ih reporting units that the respective reporting unit's fair value was in excess of its respective carrying value as of october 1, 2021, therefore goodwill is considered not impaired for the cb&w, c&cb, and ih reporting units. none of the reporting units of the company had a fair value that exceeded the respective carrying value by less than 10%.
78 truist financial corporation the company also performs sensitivity analyses around these assumptions in order to assess the reasonableness of the assumptions, and the resulting estimated fair values. while the company's sensitivity analyses did not indicate risk of impairment as of october 1. 2021, future potential changes in these assumptions may impact the estimated fair value of a reporting unit and cause the fair value of the reporting unit to be below its carrying value. additionally, a reporting unit's carrying value could change based on market conditions, asset growth, or the risk profile of those reporting units, which could impact whether the fair value of a reporting unit is less than carrying value.
the company monitored events and circumstances during the fourth quarter of 2021, concluding that it was not more-likely-than-not that the fair value of one or more of its reporting units is below its respective carrying amount as of december 31, 2021.
income taxes truist is subject to income tax laws of the u.s., its states, and the municipalities in which the company conducts business. in estimating the net amount due to or to be received from tax jurisdictions either currently or in the future, the company assesses the appropriate tax treatment of transactions and filing positions after considering statutes, regulations, judicial precedent, and other pertinent information. the income tax laws are complex and subject to different interpretations by the taxpayer and the relevant government taxing authorities. significant judgment is required in determining the tax accruals and in evaluating the company's tax positions, including evaluating uncertain tax positions. changes in the estimate of accrued taxes occur periodically due to changes in tax rates, interpretations of tax laws and new judicial guidance, the status of examinations by the tax authorities, and newly enacted statutory and regulatory guidance that could impact the relative merits and risks of tax positions. these changes, when they occur, impact tax expense and can materially affect operating results. truist reviews tax positions quarterly and adjusts accrued taxes as new information becomes available.
deferred income tax assets represent amounts available to reduce income taxes payable in future years. such assets arise due to temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities, as well as from nol and tax credit carryforwards. the company regularly evaluates the ability to realize dtas, recognizing a valuation allowance if, based on the weight of available evidence, it is more-likely-than-not that some portion or all of the dta will not be realized. in determining whether a valuation allowance is necessary, the company considers the level of taxable income in prior years to the extent that carrybacks are permitted under current tax laws, as well as estimates of future pre-tax and taxable income and tax planning strategies that would, if necessary, be implemented. truist currently maintains a valuation allowance for certain state carryforwards. for additional income tax information, refer to "note 1. basis of presentation" and "note 14. income taxes."
pension and postretirement benefit obligations truist offers various pension plans and postretirement benefit plans to teammates. calculation of the obligations and related expenses under these plans requires the use of actuarial valuation methods and assumptions, which are subject to management judgment and may differ significantly if different assumptions are used. the discount rate assumption used to measure the postretirement benefit obligations is set by reference to an aa above median corporate bond yield curve and the individual characteristics of the plans such as projected cash flow patterns and payment durations.
management also considered the sensitivity that changes in the expected return on plan assets and the discount rate would have on pension expense. for the company's qualified plans, a decrease of 25 basis points in the discount rate would result in additional pension expense of approximately $23 million for 2022, while a decrease of 100 basis points in the expected return on plan assets would result in an increase of approximately $166 million in pension expense for 2022. refer to "note 15. benefit plans" for disclosures related to the benefit plans.

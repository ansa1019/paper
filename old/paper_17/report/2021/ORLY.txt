item 1a. risk factors our future performance is subject to a variety of risks and uncertainties. although the risks described below are the risks that we believe are material, there may also be risks of which we are currently unaware, or that we currently regard as immaterial based upon the information available to us that later may prove to be material. interested parties should be aware that the occurrence of the events described in these risk factors, elsewhere in this form 10-k and in our other filings with the securities and exchange commission could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition. actual results, therefore, may materially differ from anticipated results described in our forward-looking statements.
risks related to the covid-19 pandemic the ongoing occurrence of covid-19, or any other such widespread public health crisis, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.
the covid-19 pandemic continues to have a significant impact on the u.s. and world economies. the public health concerns resulting from the pandemic have created significant uncertainty, economic disruption and volatility, all of which have impacted and may continue to impact our business. we may be required to take significant actions to mitigate any adverse impact of the covid-19 pandemic, including, but not limited to incurring increased expenses. we are unable to predict the ongoing short-term and long-term impact of the covid-19 pandemic on our customers, team members, supply chain, business, overall industry demand, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows due to several factors beyond our control, including, but not limited to:
●   the severity and duration of the pandemic, including additional outbreaks, new strands or variants of the virus and availability and public acceptance of effective medical treatments and vaccines for covid-19;

●   the continued response of both governmental and nongovernmental authorities, including, but not limited to, complex and changing regulations and guidance regarding the safety of employees and customers, inconsistent application of covid-19 orders and regulations, government stimulus payments and enhanced unemployment benefits;

●   the impact of the pandemic on consumer confidence and macroeconomic factors such as unemployment and work force availability, as well as industry specific demand drivers such as the number of u.s. miles driven, which could impact demand for our product;

17
●   temporary or long-term disruption in our supply network from local and international suppliers and/or delays in the delivery of our inventory;

●   volatility in the u.s. and global financial markets, including global debt and equity markets;

●   the impact of regulatory and legislative changes in liability for workers' compensation; and

●   the impact of litigation, investigations or claims from customers, team members, suppliers, regulators or other third parties relating to the covid-19 pandemic or our actions in response thereto, including any reputational harm.

the above factors and uncertainties, in addition to others we are not currently aware of, may result in adverse impacts to our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.
risks specific to our business and industry deteriorating economic conditions may adversely impact demand for our products, reduce access to credit and cause our customers and others, with which we do business, to suffer financial hardship, all of which could adversely impact our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.
although demand for many of our products is primarily non-discretionary in nature and tend to be purchased by consumers out of necessity, our sales are impacted by constraints on the economic health of our customers. the economic health of our customers is affected by many factors, including, among others, general business conditions, interest rates, inflation, consumer debt levels, the availability of consumer credit, currency exchange rates, taxation, fuel prices, unemployment levels and other matters that influence consumer confidence and spending, such as a prolonged public health crisis or pandemic, like the covid-19 pandemic. many of these factors are outside of our control. our customers' purchases, including purchases of our products, could decline during periods when income is lower, when prices increase in response to rising costs, or in periods of actual or perceived unfavorable economic conditions or political uncertainty. if any of these events occur, or if unfavorable economic conditions challenge the consumer environment, our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows could be adversely affected.
overall demand for products sold in the automotive aftermarket is dependent upon many factors including the total number of vehicle miles driven in the u.s., the total number of registered vehicles in the u.s., the age and quality of these registered vehicles and the level of unemployment in the u.s. changes in vehicle technology used by the original equipment manufacturers ("oem") on future vehicles, including but not limited to electric, hybrid and internal combustion engines, may result in less frequent repairs, parts lasting longer or elimination of certain repairs. in addition, restrictions on access to telematics, diagnostic tools and repair information imposed by the oems or by governmental regulations may force vehicle owners to rely on dealers to perform maintenance and repairs. adverse changes in these factors could lead to a decreased level of demand for our products, which could negatively impact our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.
in addition, economic conditions, including decreased access to credit, may result in financial difficulties leading to restructurings, bankruptcies, liquidations and other unfavorable events for our customers, suppliers, logistics and other service providers and financial institutions that are counterparties to our credit facilities. furthermore, the ability of these third parties to overcome these difficulties may worsen. if third parties, on whom we rely for merchandise, are unable to overcome difficulties resulting from the deterioration in economic conditions, the cause of which could include a prolonged public health crisis or pandemic, such as the covid-19 pandemic, and provide us with the merchandise we need, or if counterparties to our credit facilities do not perform their obligations, our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows could be adversely affected.
the automotive aftermarket business is highly competitive, and we may have to risk our capital to remain competitive, all of which could adversely impact our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.
both the diy and professional service provider portions of our business are highly competitive, particularly in the more densely populated areas that we serve. some of our competitors are larger than we are and have greater financial resources. in addition, some of our competitors are smaller than we are, but have a greater presence than we do in a particular market. online and mobile platforms may allow customers to quickly compare prices and product assortments between us and a range of competitors, which could result in pricing pressure. some online competitors may have a lower cost structure than we do, as a result of our strategy of providing an exceptional in-store experience and superior parts availability supported by our extensive store network and robust, regional distribution footprint, which could also create pricing pressure. we may have to expend more resources and risk additional capital to remain competitive and our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows could be adversely affected. for a list of our principal competitors, see the "competition" section of item 1 of this annual report on form 10-k.
18
we are sensitive to regional economic and weather conditions that could impact our costs and sales.
our business is sensitive to national and regional economic and weather conditions and natural disasters. unusually inclement weather, such as significant rain, snow, sleet, freezing rain, flooding, seismic activity and hurricanes, has historically discouraged our customers from visiting our stores during the affected period and reduced our sales, particularly to diy customers. extreme weather conditions, such as extreme heat and extreme cold temperatures, may enhance demand for our products due to increased failure rates of our customers' automotive parts, while temperate weather conditions may have a lesser impact on failure rates of automotive parts. in addition, our stores and dcs located in coastal regions may be subject to increased unrecoverable losses resulting from regional weather conditions and our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows could be adversely affected.
a change in the relationship with any of our key suppliers, the limited supply or unavailability of key products, supply chain disruptions or changes in trade policies could affect our financial health.
our business depends on developing and maintaining close relationships with our suppliers and on our suppliers' ability or willingness to sell quality products to us at favorable prices and terms. many factors outside of our control may harm these relationships and the ability or willingness of these suppliers to sell us products on favorable terms. for example, financial or operational difficulties that our suppliers may face could increase the cost of the products we purchase from them or our ability to source products from them. in addition, the trend toward consolidation among automotive parts suppliers, as well as the off-shoring of manufacturing capacity to foreign countries, may disrupt or end our relationship with some suppliers and could lead to less competition and result in higher prices. we could also be negatively impacted when our suppliers or our supply chain experiences work stoppages; labor strikes; a prolonged public health crisis or pandemic, such as the covid-19 pandemic; shipping and transportation disruptions or increased costs; currency fluctuations or inflation; or other interruptions to, or difficulties in, the manufacture or supply of the products we purchase. changes in u.s. trade policies, sanctions, practices, tariffs or taxes, import limitations and other factors relating to foreign trade and port agreements could affect our ability to source products and our suppliers' ability to source materials or provide products at current volumes and/or prices. these and other factors affecting our suppliers and our access to products could adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.
business interruptions in our distribution centers or other facilities may affect our store hours, stability of our computer systems, and/or availability and distribution of merchandise, which may affect our business.
weather, terrorist activities, war or other disasters, or the threat of them, may result in the closure of one or more of our dcs or other facilities, or may adversely affect our ability to deliver inventory to our stores on a nightly basis. this may affect our ability to timely provide products to our customers, resulting in lost sales or a potential loss of customer loyalty. some of our merchandise is imported from other countries and these goods could become difficult or impossible to bring into the united states, and we may not be able to obtain such merchandise from other sources at similar prices. such a disruption in revenue could potentially have a negative impact on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.
we rely extensively on our computer systems to manage inventory, process transactions and timely provide products to our customers. our systems are subject to damage or interruption from power outages, telecommunications failures, computer viruses, security breaches or other catastrophic events. if our systems are damaged or fail to function properly, we may experience loss of critical data and interruptions or delays in our ability to manage inventories or process customer transactions. such a disruption of our systems could negatively impact revenue and potentially have a negative impact on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.
failure to protect our brand and reputation could have a material adverse effect on our brand name, business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.
we believe our company has built an excellent reputation as a leading retailer in the automotive aftermarket industry. we believe our continued success depends, in part, on our ability to preserve, grow and leverage the value of our brand. our reputation is based, in part, on perceptions of subjective qualities; negative publicity involving the company, our merchandise or our industry in general that erode customer trust or confidence could adversely affect our reputation and business. failure to comply with ethical, social, product, labor, health and safety, accounting or environmental standards, or existing or future laws or regulations could also jeopardize our reputation and potentially lead to various adverse actions from consumer or environmental groups, employees or regulatory bodies, which could require us to incur substantial legal fees and costs. in addition, negative claims or publicity, including the availability of information and opinions on social media, as its impact is immediate, could adversely affect our reputation. the opportunity for the rapid dissemination of information, including inaccurate and inflammatory information and opinions, is virtually limitless and easily accessible. damage to our reputation or loss of consumer confidence for any of these or other reasons could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition or cash flows, as well as require additional resources to rebuild our reputation.
risks associated with international operations could result in additional costs and inefficiencies.
in addition to many of the risks we face in our u.s. operations, international operations present a unique set of risks and challenges, including local laws and customs, u.s. laws applicable to foreign operations and political and socio-economic conditions. our ability
19
to operate effectively and grow in international markets could be impacted by these risks resulting in legal liabilities, additional costs and the distraction of management's attention. compliance with the foreign corrupt practices act and protection of intellectual property rights surrounding items such as tradenames and trademarks in foreign jurisdictions can pose significant challenges.
in addition, our operations in international markets are conducted primarily in the local currency of those countries. given that our consolidated financial statements are denominated in u.s. dollars, amounts of assets, liabilities, net sales and other revenues and expenses denominated in local currencies must be translated into u.s. dollars using exchange rates for the current period. as a result, foreign currency exchange rates and fluctuations in those rates may adversely impact our financial performance.
risks related to our common stock risks related to us and unanticipated fluctuations in our quarterly operating results could affect our stock price.
we believe that quarter-to-quarter comparisons of our financial results are not necessarily meaningful indicators of our future operating results and should not be relied on as an indication of future performance. if our quarterly operating results fail to meet the expectations of analysts, the trading price of our common stock could be negatively affected. we cannot be certain that our growth plans and business strategies will be successful or that they will successfully meet the expectations of these analysts. if we fail to adequately address any of these risks or difficulties, our stock price would likely suffer.
the market price of our common stock may be volatile and could expose us to securities class action litigation.
the stock market and the price of our common stock may be subject to wide fluctuations based upon general economic and market conditions and potentially being targeted through the selling and buying of our common stock by a group of individuals, whose interests and reasoning behind such actions may not align with an average market participant. the market price of our common stock may also be affected by our ability to meet analysts' expectations and failure to meet such expectations, even slightly, could have an adverse effect on the market price of our common stock.
in addition, stock market volatility has had a significant effect on the market prices of securities issued by many companies for reasons unrelated to the operating performance of these companies. downturns in the stock market may cause the price of our common stock to decline. in the past, following periods of volatility in the market price of a company's securities, securities class action litigation has often been initiated against such companies. if similar litigation were initiated against us, it could result in substantial costs and a diversion of our management's attention and resources, which could have an adverse effect on our business.
risks related to our indebtedness and financing our debt levels could adversely affect our cash flow and prevent us from fulfilling our obligations.
we have an unsecured revolving credit facility and unsecured senior notes, which could have important consequences for our financial health. for example, our level of indebtedness could, among other things,
●   make it more difficult to satisfy our financial obligations, including those relating to the senior unsecured notes and our credit facility;

●   increase our vulnerability to adverse economic and industry conditions;

●   limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes and opportunities in our industry, which may place us at a competitive disadvantage;

●   require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flows to service the principal and interest on our debt, reducing the funds available for other business purposes, such as working capital, capital expenditures or other cash requirements;

●   limit our ability to incur additional debt with acceptable terms, if at all; and

●   expose us to fluctuations in interest rates, including changes that may result from the implementation of new benchmark rates that replace libor.

in addition, the terms of our financing obligations include restrictions, such as affirmative, negative and financial covenants, conditions on borrowing and subsidiary guarantees. a failure to comply with these restrictions could result in a default under our financing obligations or could require us to obtain waivers from our lenders for failure to comply with these restrictions. the occurrence of a default that remains uncured or the inability to secure a necessary consent or waiver could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
20
a downgrade in our credit rating would impact our cost of capital and could impact the market value of our unsecured senior notes, as well as limit our access to attractive supplier financing programs.
credit ratings are an important component of our cost of capital. these ratings are based upon, among other factors, our financial strength. our current credit ratings provide us with the ability to borrow funds at favorable rates. a downgrade in our current credit rating from either rating agency could adversely affect our cost of capital by causing us to pay a higher interest rate on borrowed funds under our unsecured revolving credit facility and a higher facility fee on commitments under our unsecured revolving credit facility. a downgrade in our current credit rating could also adversely affect the market price and/or liquidity of our unsecured senior notes, preventing a holder from selling the unsecured senior notes at a favorable price, as well as adversely affect our ability to issue new notes in the future. in addition, a downgrade in our current credit rating could limit the financial institutions willing to commit funds to our supplier financing programs at attractive rates. decreased participation in our supplier financing programs would lead to an increase in working capital needed to operate the business, adversely affecting our cash flows.
general risks we cannot assure future growth will be achieved.
we believe that our ability to open additional, profitable stores at a high growth rate will be a significant factor in achieving our growth objectives for the future. our ability to accomplish our growth objectives is dependent, in part, on matters beyond our control, such as weather conditions, zoning and other issues related to new store site development, the availability of qualified management personnel and general business and economic conditions. we cannot be sure that our growth plans for 2022 and beyond will be achieved. failure to achieve our growth objectives may negatively impact the trading price of our common stock. for a discussion of our growth strategies, see the "growth strategy" section of item 1 of this annual report on form 10-k.
in order to be successful, we will need to attract, retain and motivate key employees.
our success has been largely dependent on the efforts of certain key personnel. in order to be successful, we will need to attract, retain and motivate executives and other key employees. experienced management and technical personnel are in high demand and competition for their talents is intense. we must also continue to motivate employees and keep them focused on our strategies and goals. our business, results of operations and cash flows could be materially adversely affected by the unexpected loss of the services of one or more of our key employees. we cannot be sure that we will be able to continue to attract qualified personnel, which could cause us to be less efficient and, as a result, may adversely impact our sales and profitability. for a discussion of our management, see the "business" section of item 1 of this annual report on form 10-k.
risks associated with future acquisitions may not lead to expected growth and could result in increased costs and inefficiencies.
we expect to continue to make acquisitions as an element of our growth strategy. acquisitions involve certain risks that could cause our actual growth and profitability to differ from our expectations. examples of such risks include the following:
●   we may not be able to continue to identify suitable acquisition targets or to acquire additional companies at favorable prices or on other favorable terms.

●   our management's attention may be distracted.

●   we may fail to retain key personnel from acquired businesses.

●   we may assume unanticipated legal liabilities and other problems.

●   we may not be able to successfully integrate the operations (accounting and billing functions, for example) of businesses we acquire to realize economic, operational and other benefits.

we may fail, or be unable to, discover liabilities of businesses that we acquire for which we or the subsequent owner or operator may be liable.
a breach of customer, supplier, team member or company information could damage our reputation or result in substantial additional costs or possible litigation.
our business involves the receiving, storage and transmitting of certain personally identifiable or confidential information about our customers, suppliers, team members and the company, some of which is entrusted to third-party service providers and vendors. we and our third-party service providers and vendors have taken significant and appropriate steps to protect this information, including maintaining compliance with payment card industry and national clearing house standards and a security program that includes updating technology and security policies, employee training and monitoring and routine testing of our systems. however, these security measures are costly and require constant, ongoing attention and may not prevent a security breach due to cyber-attacks, computer malware viruses, exploitation of hardware or software vulnerabilities, team member error, malfeasance, system compromises, fraud, hacking, trickery or other intentional or unintentional acts, which could result in unauthorized parties gaining access to such information.
21
a compromise of our security measures or those of a third-party party we entrust could result in information related to our customers, suppliers, team members or the company being obtained or misused by unauthorized persons, adverse operational effects or interruptions or costs to the company to address the breach, all of which could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. the methods used to obtain unauthorized access are constantly evolving and may be difficult to anticipate or detect for long periods of time. if we experience a significant data security breach, we could be exposed to damage to our reputation, additional costs, lost sales, litigation or possible regulatory action. in addition, the regulatory environment related to information security and privacy is constantly evolving and may increase our responsibility and liability in relation to personal data that we process, which may require the investment of additional mechanisms to ensure compliance with privacy laws and regulations. the cost of complying with stricter and more complex data privacy, data collection and information security laws and standards could be significant to us. there is no guarantee that the procedures that we and our third-party service providers and vendors have implemented to protect against unauthorized access to secured data are adequate to safeguard against all data security breaches, and such a breach could potentially have a negative impact on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.
litigation, governmental proceedings, environmental legislation and regulations and employment legislation and regulations may affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
we are, and in the future may become, involved in lawsuits, regulatory inquiries and governmental and other legal proceedings, arising out of the ordinary course of our business. the damages sought against us in some of these litigation proceedings may be material and may adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.
environmental legislation and regulations, like the initiatives to limit greenhouse gas emissions and bills related to climate change, could adversely impact all industries. while it is uncertain whether these initiatives will become law, new or more stringent climate change-related mandates, laws or regulations, or stricter interpretations of existing mandates, laws or regulations could potentially be forthcoming. these matters, if enacted, could adversely impact our costs, by, among other things, increasing fuel prices or requiring additional expenditures by us or our suppliers to comply, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.
our business is subject to employment legislation and regulations, including requirements related to minimum wage. our success depends, in part, on our ability to manage operating costs and identify opportunities to reduce costs. our ability to meet labor needs, while controlling costs is subject to external factors, such as minimum wage legislation. a violation of, or change in, employment legislation and/or regulations could hinder our ability to control costs, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.
item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in management's discussion and analysis, we provide a historical and prospective narrative of our general financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and certain other factors that may affect our future results, including
●   an overview of the key drivers and other influences to of the automotive aftermarket industry;

●   key events and recent developments within our company;

●   our results of operations for the years ended december 31, 2021 and 2020;

●   our liquidity and capital resources;

●   our critical accounting estimates; and

●   recent accounting pronouncements that may affect our company.

the review of management's discussion and analysis should be made in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements, related notes and other financial information, forward-looking statements and other risk factors included elsewhere in this annual report.
overview we are a specialty retailer of automotive aftermarket parts, tools, supplies, equipment and accessories in the united states and mexico. we are one of the largest u.s. automotive aftermarket specialty retailers, selling our products to both diy customers and professional service providers - our "dual market strategy." our stores carry an extensive product line consisting of new and remanufactured automotive hard parts, maintenance items, accessories, a complete line of auto body paint and related materials, automotive tools and professional service provider service equipment.
our extensive product line includes an assortment of products that are differentiated by quality and price for most of the product lines we offer. for many of our product offerings, this quality differentiation reflects "good," "better," and "best" alternatives. our sales and total gross profit dollars are, generally, highest for the "best" quality category of products. consumers' willingness to select products at a higher point on the value spectrum is a driver of enhanced sales and profitability in our industry. we have ongoing initiatives focused on marketing and training to educate customers on the advantages of ongoing vehicle maintenance, as well as "purchasing up" on the value spectrum.
our stores also offer enhanced services and programs to our customers, including used oil, oil filter and battery recycling; battery, wiper and bulb replacement; battery diagnostic testing; electrical and module testing; check engine light code extraction; loaner tool program; drum and rotor resurfacing; custom hydraulic hoses; professional paint shop mixing and related materials; and machine shops. as of december 31, 2021, we operated 5,759 stores in 47 u.s. states and 25 stores in mexico.
we are influenced by a number of general macroeconomic factors that impact both our industry and our consumers, including, but not limited to, fuel costs, unemployment trends, interest rates and other economic factors. macroeconomic factors, such as total u.s. unemployment, and demand drivers specific to the automotive aftermarket, such as u.s. miles driven, have been pressured as a result of responses to the covid-19 pandemic, including stay at home orders, work from home arrangements and reduced travel. however, government stimulus and additional unemployment benefits, the ongoing gradual reopening processes across markets we operate in and increased miles driven have positively impacted our performance. due to the nature of these macroeconomic factors, we are unable to determine how long current conditions, including the pandemic, will persist and the degree of impact future changes may have on our business, industry or broader economic conditions.
we believe the key drivers of current and future long-term demand for the products sold within the automotive aftermarket include the number of u.s. miles driven, number of u.s. registered vehicles, new light vehicle registrations and average vehicle age.
number of miles driven the number of total miles driven in the u.s. influences the demand for repair and maintenance products sold within the automotive aftermarket. in total, vehicles in the u.s. are driven approximately three trillion miles per year, resulting in ongoing wear and tear and a corresponding continued demand for the repair and maintenance products necessary to keep these vehicles in operation. according to the u.s. department of transportation, the number of total miles driven in the u.s. decreased 13.2% in 2020, as a result of responses to the covid-19 pandemic, however for 2021, miles driven improved and increased 11.2%. government measures or consumer and business behavior in response to the covid-19 pandemic could again have a negative impact on miles driven, but we are unable to predict the duration and severity of the impact to our business.
26
size and age of the vehicle fleet the total number of vehicles on the road and the average age of the vehicle population heavily influence the demand for products sold within the automotive aftermarket industry. as reported by the auto care association, the total number of registered vehicles increased 12.7% from 2010 to 2020, bringing the number of light vehicles on the road to 281 million by the end of 2020. although the rate of new vehicle sales has been pressured due to supply chain constraints experienced by manufacturers, the outlook for the seasonally adjusted annual rate of light vehicle sales in the u.s. ("saar") was approximately 12.4 million for the year ended december 31, 2021. the annual changes to the vehicle population resulting from new vehicle sales and the fluctuation in vehicle scrappage rates in any given year represent a small percentage of the total light vehicle population and have a muted impact on the total number and average age of vehicles on the road over the short term. from 2010 to 2020, vehicle scrappage rates have remained relatively stable, ranging from 4.1% to 5.7% annually. as a result, over the past decade, the average age of the u.s. vehicle population has increased, growing 12.3%, from 10.6 years in 2010 to 11.9 years in 2020.
we believe the increase in average vehicle age can be attributed to better engineered and manufactured vehicles, which can be reliably driven at higher mileages due to better quality power trains, interiors and exteriors, and the consumer's willingness to invest in maintaining these higher-mileage, better built vehicles. the increase in average vehicle age also benefits from an environment of a new vehicle scarcity and higher than typical used vehicle prices, as consumers are more willing to continue to invest in their current vehicle. as the average age of vehicles on the road increases, a larger percentage of miles are being driven by vehicles that are outside of a manufacturer warranty. these out-of-warranty, older vehicles generate strong demand for automotive aftermarket products as they go through more routine maintenance cycles, have more frequent mechanical failures and generally require more maintenance than newer vehicles. we believe consumers will continue to invest in these reliable, higher-quality, higher-mileage vehicles and these investments, along with an increasing total light vehicle fleet, will support continued demand for automotive aftermarket products.
we remain confident in our ability to gain market share in our existing markets and grow our business in new markets by focusing on our dual market strategy and the core o'reilly values of hard work and excellent customer service.
key events and recent developments a key event that has had a significant impact on our operations is the covid-19 pandemic. as we navigate the ongoing challenges resulting from the covid-19 pandemic, we continue to place additional emphasis on the safety and wellness of our team members and our customers. during the year ended december 31, 2021, the increased level of vaccinations, the ongoing reopening processes across markets we operate in, government stimulus payments and enhanced unemployment benefits positively impacted demand for the products we sell. we continue to keep our stores open and operating to meet our customers' critical needs, while also ensuring the safety of our team members and customers through strict adherence to safety protocols. however, we cannot predict how long the current crisis will last or the extent of its future impacts on our customers, our team members, our supply chain and overall industry demand.

we believe the increased sales are the result of store growth, the high levels of customer service provided by our well-trained and technically proficient team members, superior inventory availability, including same day and over-night access to inventory from our regional distribution centers and hub store network, enhanced services and programs offered in our stores, a broader selection of product offerings in most stores with a dynamic catalog system to identify and source parts, a targeted promotional and advertising effort through a variety of media and localized promotional events, continued improvement in the merchandising and store layouts of our stores, compensation programs for all store team members that provide incentives for performance and our continued focus on serving both diy and professional service provider customers. the government stimulus payments, enhanced unemployment benefits, and general economic recovery, including lifting of stay at home orders and associated ongoing market reopenings, when combined with positive industry dynamics, such as consumers investing in existing vehicles and favorable weather, contributed to strong demand in the year ended december 31, 2021. in addition, despite the global supply chain disruptions that created inventory availability challenges for our industry during the year ended december 31, 2021, the strength of our distribution network and our strong supplier relationships allowed us to maintain better in-stock inventory positions than the broader market and contributed to our sales growth.
our comparable store sales increase for the year ended december 31, 2021, was driven by increases in average ticket and transaction counts for both professional service provider and diy customers. average ticket values continue to be positively impacted by the increasing complexity and cost of replacement parts necessary to maintain the current population of better-engineered and more technically advanced vehicles. these better-engineered, more technically advanced vehicles require less frequent repairs, as the component parts are more durable and last for longer periods of time. the resulting decrease in repair frequency creates pressure on customer transaction counts; however, when repairs are needed, the cost of replacement parts is, on average, greater, which is a benefit to average ticket values. average ticket values continue to benefit from consumers spending additional time and money repairing and maintaining their vehicles in response to the covid-19 pandemic, the economic environment and the new and used vehicle scarcity. average ticket values also benefited from increases in average selling prices, on a same-sku basis, as compared to the same period in 2020, driven by increases in acquisition costs of inventory, which were passed on in market prices. 2021 transaction counts improved due to prior year headwinds to traffic from the initial covid-19 stay at home orders in 2020 and business restrictions, which resulted in immediate pressure to transaction counts for both diy and professional service provider customers, combined with continued market reopening and recovery activity, ongoing government stimulus, favorable winter and spring weather conditions and a benefit from new and used vehicle scarcity positively impacting our customers' willingness to perform or invest in maintenance on their vehicles.
we opened 165 net, new u.s. stores and three new stores in mexico during the year ended december 31, 2021, compared to opening 155 net, new u.s. stores and one new store in mexico during the year ended december 31, 2020. as of december 31, 2021, we operated 5,759 stores in 47 u.s. states and 25 stores in mexico compared to 5,594 u.s. stores in 47 states and 22 stores in mexico at december 31, 2020. we anticipate new store growth will be 175 to 185 net, new store openings in 2022.
gross profit:
gross profit for the year ended december 31, 2021, increased 15% to $7.02 billion (or 52.7% of sales) from $6.09 billion (or 52.4% of sales) for the same period in 2020. the increase in gross profit dollars for the year ended december 31, 2021, was primarily the result of new store sales and the increase in comparable store sales at existing stores, partially offset by prior year gross profit dollars generated from one additional day due to leap day. the increase in gross profit as a percentage of sales for the year ended december 31, 2021, was due to a benefit from selling through inventory purchased prior to recent acquisition cost increases and corresponding selling price increases, partially offset by increased distribution costs. we determine inventory cost using the last-in, first-out ("lifo") method but had, over time, seen our lifo reserve balance exhausted, resulting in a lifo inventory value above replacement cost prior to the third

quarter ended september 30, 2021. our policy is to not write up inventory in excess of replacement cost, and accordingly, we had effectively valued our inventory at replacement cost, resulting in a benefit when selling prices increase as we sold through this lower cost inventory. during 2021, our lifo reserve reverted back to a more typical credit balance due to recent, significant inflation in acquisition costs; as a result, we anticipate a diminishing benefit moving forward from the final sell through of inventory valued at older, lower replacement cost. increased distribution system costs were driven by the significant increase in volumes over the past year, challenging labor markets and ongoing global logistical supply chain pressures.
selling, general and administrative expenses:
selling, general and administrative expenses ("sg&a") for the year ended december 31, 2021, increased 12% to $4.10 billion (or 30.8% of sales) from $3.67 billion (or 31.6% of sales) for the same period in 2020. the increase in total sg&a dollars for the year ended december 31, 2021, was the result of additional team members, facilities and vehicles to support our increased sales and store count, increased incentive compensation for team members resulting from our increased sales and operating profits and prior year strict expense control measures in response to the onset of the pandemic environment. the decrease in sg&a as a percentage of sales for the year ended december 31, 2021, was principally due to strong leverage of fixed store operating costs on strong comparable store sales growth and higher average store sales volumes.
operating income:
as a result of the impacts discussed above, operating income for the year ended december 31, 2021, increased 21% to $2.92 billion (or 21.9% of sales) from $2.42 billion (or 20.8% of sales) for the same period in 2020.
other income and expense:
total other expense for the year ended december 31, 2021, decreased 12% to $135 million (or 1.0% of sales), from $153 million (or 1.3% of sales) for the same period in 2020. the decrease in total other expense for the year ended december 31, 2021, was the result of decreased interest expense on lower average outstanding borrowings and lower average cost of borrowings.
income taxes:
our provision for income taxes for the year ended december 31, 2021, increased 20% to $617 million (22.2% effective tax rate) from $514 million (22.7% effective tax rate) for the same period in 2020. the increase in our provision for income taxes for the year ended december 31, 2021, was the result of higher taxable income, partially offset by higher excess tax benefits from share-based compensation and a greater benefit from tax credit equity investments. the decrease in our effective tax rate for the year ended december 31, 2021, was the result of the higher excess tax benefits from share-based compensation and a greater benefit from tax credit equity investments.
net income:
as a result of the impacts discussed above, net income for the year ended december 31, 2021, increased 24% to $2.16 billion (or 16.2% of sales), from $1.75 billion (or 15.1% of sales) for the same period in 2020.
earnings per share:
our diluted earnings per common share for the year ended december 31, 2021, increased 32% to $31.10 on 70 million shares from $23.53 on 74 million shares for the same period in 2020.
2020 compared to 2019
a discussion of the changes in our results of operations for the year ended december 31, 2020, as compared to the year ended december 31, 2019, has been omitted from this form 10-k but may be found in item 7. "management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations" of the annual report on form 10-k for the year ended december 31, 2020, filed with the securities and exchange commission (the "sec") on february 26, 2021, which is available free of charge on the sec's website at www.sec.gov by searching with our ticker symbol "orly" or at our internet address, www.oreillyauto.com, by clicking "investor relations" located at the bottom of the page.
liquidity and capital resources our long-term business strategy requires capital to open new stores, fund strategic acquisitions, expand distribution infrastructure, operate and maintain our existing stores and may include the opportunistic repurchase of shares of our common stock through our board-approved share repurchase program. our material cash requirements necessary to maintain the current operations of our long-term business strategy include, but are not limited to, inventory purchases, human capital obligations, including payroll and benefits,
31
contractual obligations, including debt and interest obligations, capital expenditures, payment of income taxes and other operational priorities. we expect to fund our short- and long-term cash and capital requirements with our primary sources of liquidity, which include funds generated from the normal course of our business operations and borrowings under our unsecured revolving credit facility. however, there can be no assurance that we will continue to generate cash flows or maintain liquidity at or above recent levels, as we are unable to predict decreased demand for our products, changes in customer buying patterns or the impact of the uncertainty and disruption cause by the covid-19 pandemic. additionally, these factors could also impact our ability to meet the debt covenants of our credit agreement and, therefore, negatively impact the funds available under our unsecured revolving credit facility.
our material contractual cash obligations as of december 31, 2021, included commitments for short and long-term debt arrangements and interest payments related to long-term debt, future minimum payments under non-cancelable lease arrangements, self-insurance reserves, projected obligations related to future payments under the company's nonqualified deferred compensation plan, purchase obligations for construction contract commitments, uncertain tax positions and associated estimated interest and penalties, payments for certain deferred income taxes and commitments for the purchase of inventory, all of which are included on our consolidated balance sheets. we expect to fund these various commitments and obligations primarily with operating cash flows expected to be generated in the normal course of business or through borrowings under our unsecured revolving credit facility. see note 5 "leases," note 12 "share-based compensation and benefit plans," note 13 "commitments" and note 15 "income taxes" to the consolidated financial statements for further information on our leasing arrangements, share-based compensation payments, construction commitments and uncertain tax positions, respectively, which are not reflected in the table below.

due to the absence of scheduled maturities, the nature of the account or the commitment's cancellation terms, the timing of payments for certain deferred income taxes, uncertain tax positions and commitments related to future payments under the company's nonqualified compensation plan cannot be determined and are therefore excluded from the above table, except for amounts estimated to be payable in 2022, which are included in "current liabilities" on our consolidated balance sheets.
off-balance sheet arrangements are transactions, agreements, or other contractual arrangements with an unconsolidated entity, for which we have an obligation to the entity that is not recorded in our consolidated financial statements. we have entered into an agreement to make capital contributions to certain tax credit equity investments for the purpose of receiving renewable energy tax credits. we are required to make capital contributions totaling $5.7 million upon achievement of project milestones by the solar or wind energy farms, the timing of which is variable and outside of the company's control. see note 7 "financing" to the consolidated financial statements for further information on our stand-by letters of credit.
we do not have any off-balance sheet financing that has, or is reasonably likely to have, a material, current or future effect on our financial condition, cash flows, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources.

cash and cash equivalents balances held outside of the u.s. were $7.5 million and $11.5 million as of december 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively, which was generally utilized to support the liquidity needs of foreign operations in mexico.
operating activities:
the increase in net cash provided by operating activities in 2021 compared to 2020 was primarily due to an increase in net income and a larger decrease in net inventory investment, partially offset by a decrease in accrued benefits and withholdings. the larger decrease in net inventory investment in 2021, as compared to 2020, was primarily attributable to the strong comparable store sales growth and the resulting benefit to inventory turns. the decrease in accrued benefits and withholdings is primarily due to the deferral of payroll tax payments under the cares act in 2020.
investing activities:
cash used in investing activities in 2021 compared to 2020 was relatively flat, with the slight change due primarily to entering into more renewable energy tax credit investments in 2021, as compared to 2020, primarily for the purpose of receiving renewable energy tax credits.
we opened 168 and 155 net, new stores in 2021 and 2020, respectively. we plan to open 175 to 185 net, new stores in 2022. the current costs associated with the opening of a new store, including the cost of land acquisition, building improvements, fixtures, vehicles, net inventory investment and computer equipment, are estimated to average approximately $1.5 million to $1.8 million; however, such costs may be significantly reduced where we lease, rather than purchase, the store site.
financing activities:
the increase in net cash used in financing activities in 2021 compared to 2020 was primarily attributable to debt repayments of $300 million in 2021, compared to net, borrowings of $236 million in 2020, and an increase in repurchases of our common stock.
2020 compared to 2019:
a discussion of the changes in our operating activities, liquidity activities and financing activities for the year ended december 31, 2020, as compared to the year ended december 31, 2019, has been omitted from this form 10-k but may be found in item 7. "management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations" of the annual report on form 10-k for the year ended december 31, 2020, filed with the securities and exchange commission (the "sec") on february 26, 2021, which is available free of charge on the sec's website at www.sec.gov by searching with our ticker symbol "orly" or at our internet address, www.oreillyauto.com, by clicking "investor relations" located at the bottom of the page.
debt instruments:
see note 7 "financing" to the consolidated financial statements for information concerning the company's credit agreement, unsecured revolving credit facility, outstanding letters of credit and unsecured senior notes.
debt covenants:
the indentures governing our senior notes contain covenants that limit our ability and the ability of certain of our subsidiaries to, among other things, create certain liens on assets to secure certain debt and enter into certain sale and leaseback transactions, and limit our
33
ability to merge or consolidate with another company or transfer all or substantially all of our property, in each case as set forth in the indentures. these covenants are, however, subject to a number of important limitations and exceptions. as of december 31, 2021, we were in compliance with the covenants applicable to our senior notes.
the credit agreement contains certain covenants, including limitations on indebtedness, a minimum consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio of 2.50:1.00 and a maximum consolidated leverage ratio of 3.50:1.00. the consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio includes a calculation of earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization, rent and non-cash share-based compensation expense to fixed charges. fixed charges include interest expense, capitalized interest and rent expense. the consolidated leverage ratio includes a calculation of adjusted debt to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization, rent and non-cash share-based compensation expense. adjusted debt includes outstanding debt, outstanding stand-by letters of credit and similar instruments and five-times rent expense and excludes any premium or discount recorded in conjunction with the issuance of long-term debt. in the event that we should default on any covenant contained within the credit agreement, certain actions may be taken, including, but not limited to, possible termination of commitments, immediate payment of outstanding principal amounts plus accrued interest and other amounts payable under the credit agreement and litigation from our lenders.
we had a consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio of 6.97 times and 5.93 times as of december 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively, and a consolidated leverage ratio of 1.59 times and 1.92 times as of december 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively, remaining in compliance with all covenants related to the borrowing arrangements.

free cash flow, the consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio and the consolidated leverage ratio discussed and presented in the tables above are not derived in accordance with united states generally accepted accounting principles ("gaap"). we do not, nor do we suggest investors should, consider such non-gaap financial measures in isolation from, or as a substitute for, gaap financial

information. we believe that the presentation of our free cash flow, consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio and consolidated leverage ratio provides meaningful supplemental information to both management and investors and reflects the required covenants under the credit agreement. we include these items in judging our performance and believe this non-gaap information is useful to investors as well. material limitations of these non-gaap measures are that such measures do not reflect actual gaap amounts. we compensate for such limitations by presenting, in the tables above, a reconciliation to the most directly comparable gaap measures.

critical accounting estimates the preparation of our financial statements in accordance with gaap requires the application of certain estimates and judgments by management. management bases its assumptions, estimates and adjustments on historical experience, current trends and other factors believed to be relevant at the time the consolidated financial statements are prepared. management believes that the following policies are critical due to the inherent uncertainty of these matters and the complex and subjective judgments required in establishing these estimates. management continues to review these critical accounting estimates and assumptions to ensure that the consolidated financial statements are presented fairly in accordance with gaap. however, actual results could differ from our assumptions and estimates and such differences could be material.
self-insurance reserves:
we use a combination of insurance and self-insurance mechanisms to provide for potential liabilities from workers' compensation, general liability, vehicle liability, property loss and team member health care benefits. with the exception of certain team member health care benefit liabilities, employment related claims and litigation, certain commercial litigation and certain regulatory matters, we obtain third-party insurance coverage to limit our exposure for any individual workers' compensation, general liability, vehicle liability or property loss claim.
when estimating our self-insurance liabilities, we consider a number of factors, including historical claims experience and trend-lines, projected medical and legal inflation, growth patterns and exposure forecasts. the assumptions made by management as they relate to each of these factors represent our judgment as to the most probable cumulative impact of each factor to our future obligations. certain of the self-insurance liabilities are determined at an estimate of their net present value, using a credit-adjusted discount rate. our calculation of self-insurance liabilities requires management to apply a significant amount of subjective judgment to estimate the ultimate cost to settle reported claims and claims incurred but not yet reported as of the balance sheet date. the application of alternative assumptions could result in a different estimate of these liabilities. management believes the assumptions developed and used to determine the estimate for our self-insurance reserve are reasonable. actual claim activity or development may vary from our assumptions and estimates, which may result in material losses or gains.
as we obtain additional information that affects the assumptions and estimates we used to recognize liabilities for claims incurred in prior accounting periods, we adjust our self-insurance liabilities to reflect the revised estimates based on this additional information. these liabilities are recorded at our estimate of their net present value. these liabilities do not have scheduled maturities, but we can estimate the timing of future payments based upon historical patterns. we could apply alternative assumptions regarding the timing of payments that could result in materially different estimates of the net present value of the liabilities.
our self-insurance reserve estimate included on our consolidated balance sheets increased $19.8 million from 2020 to 2021, which is primarily due to our growing operations, including inflation, increases in healthcare costs, the number of vehicles and the number of hours worked, as well as our historical claims experience. if the underlying assumptions in management's estimate changed self-insurance reserves 10% from our estimated reserves at december 31, 2021, the financial impact would have been approximately $22 million or 0.8% of pretax income for the year ended december 31, 2021. see note 1 "summary of significant accounting policies" to the consolidated financial statements for further information on our self-insurance reserves.
valuation of long-lived assets:
we evaluate the carrying value of finite and indefinite long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of these assets might exceed their current fair values. as a component of the finite long-lived assets evaluation, we review performance at the store level to identify any stores with current period operating losses that should be considered for impairment. a potential impairment has occurred if the projected future undiscounted cash flows realized from the best possible use of the asset are less than the carrying value of the asset. the estimate of cash flows includes management's assumptions of cash inflows and outflows directly resulting from the use of that asset in operations. if the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its estimated future
36
cash flows, an impairment charge is recognized for the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the assets.
as a component of the indefinite long-lived assets evaluation, we perform a qualitative assessment to determine if events or circumstances that could affect the inputs used to determine the fair value of the intangible asset have occurred, as well as if they continue to support an indefinite useful life. areas evaluated include changes in cost factors such as raw materials or labor, financial performance including declining revenues or cash flows, the legal, regulatory and political environment, and other industry and market considerations, including the competitive environment and changes in product demand. if events or market conditions exist that would more likely than not indicate that impairment may be necessary, a detailed quantitative assessment would be performed.
based on our qualitative assessment, we do not believe there has been a change of events or circumstances that would indicate that a calculation of fair value of indefinite long-lived assets is required as of december 31, 2021. our impairment analyses contain estimates due to the inherently judgmental nature of forecasting long-term estimated cash flows and determining the ultimate useful lives and fair values of the assets. actual results could differ from these estimates, which could materially impact our impairment assessment. see note 6 "goodwill and other intangibles" to the consolidated financial statements for further information on our finite and indefinite long-lived assets.

item 1a. risk factors regulatory risks we are subject to complex and evolving global regulations that could harm our business and financial results.
as a global payments technology company, we are subject to complex and evolving regulations that govern our operations. see item 1-business-government regulation for more information on the most significant areas of regulation that affect our business. the impact of these regulations on us, our clients, and other third parties could limit our ability to enforce our payments system rules; require us to adopt new rules or change existing rules; affect our existing contractual arrangements; increase our compliance costs; require us to make our technology or intellectual property available to third parties, including competitors, in an undesirable manner; and reduce our revenue opportunities. as discussed in more detail below, we may face differing rules and regulations in matters like interchange reimbursement rates, preferred routing, domestic processing requirements, currency conversion, point-of-sale transaction rules and practices, privacy, data use or protection, licensing requirements, and associated product technology. as a result, the visa operating rules and our other contractual commitments may differ from country to country or by product offering. complying with these and other regulations increases our costs and could reduce our revenue opportunities. our diversification into new product offerings and participation in new flows could also introduce new licensing and other regulatory obligations that impact our business.
if widely varying regulations come into existence worldwide, we may have difficulty rapidly adjusting our product offerings, services, fees and other important aspects of our business in the regions where we operate. our compliance programs and policies are designed to support our compliance with a wide array of regulations and laws, such as anti-money laundering, anti-corruption, competition, money transfer services, privacy and sanctions, and we continually enhance our compliance programs as regulations evolve. however, we cannot guarantee that our practices will be deemed compliant by all applicable regulatory authorities. in the event our controls should fail or we are found to be out of compliance for other reasons, we could be subject to monetary damages, civil and criminal penalties, litigation, investigations and proceedings, and damage to our global brands and reputation. furthermore, the evolving and increased regulatory focus on the payments industry could negatively impact or reduce the number of visa products our clients issue, the volume of payments we process, our revenues, our brands, our competitive positioning, our ability to use our intellectual property to differentiate our products and services, the quality and types of products and services we offer, the countries in which our products are used, and the types of consumers and merchants who can obtain or accept our products, all of which could harm our business.
increased scrutiny and regulation of the global payments industry, including with respect to interchange reimbursement fees, merchant discount rates, operating rules, risk management protocols and other related practices, could harm our business.
regulators around the world have been establishing or increasing their authority to regulate certain aspects of the payments industry. see item 1-business -government regulation for more information. in the u.s. and many other jurisdictions, we have historically set default interchange reimbursement fees. even though we generally do not receive any revenue related to interchange reimbursement fees in a payment transaction (in the context of credit and debit transactions, those fees are paid by the acquirers to the issuers; the reverse is true for certain transactions like atm), interchange reimbursement fees are a factor on which we compete with other payments providers and are therefore an important determinant of the volume of transactions we process. consequently, changes to these fees, whether voluntarily or by mandate, can substantially affect our overall payments volumes and revenues.
interchange reimbursement fees, certain operating rules and related practices continue to be subject to increased government regulation globally, and regulatory authorities and central banks in a number of jurisdictions have reviewed or are reviewing these fees, rules, and practices. for example, regulations adopted by the u.s. federal reserve cap the maximum u.s. debit interchange reimbursement rate received by large financial institutions at 21 cents plus 5 basis points per transaction, plus a possible fraud adjustment of 1 cent. the dodd-frank act also limits issuers' and our ability to adopt network exclusivity and preferred routing in the debit and prepaid area, which also impacts our business. earlier this year, the federal reserve issued a notice of proposed rulemaking that would, among other things, require issuers to ensure that at least two networks are available for routing card not present debit transactions. various stakeholder groups are also advocating that the federal reserve further lower interchange fees on debit transactions and restrict the ability of payments networks to enter table of contents into certain incentive and growth agreements with issuers. in addition, there continues to be interest in further regulation of interchange fees and routing practices by members of congress and state legislators in the u.s. the eu's ifr places an effective cap on consumer credit and consumer debit interchange fees for both domestic and cross-border transactions within the eea (30 basis points and 20 basis points, respectively). eu member states have the ability to further reduce these interchange levels within their territories. the european commission concluded its impact assessment of the ifr, indicating that while it does not intend to expand the legislation at this time, it will continue to monitor market dynamics. countries in other parts of the world, including the latin america region, have either adopted or are exploring interchange caps. for example, in march 2017, argentina's central bank passed regulations that cap interchange fees on credit and debit transactions. in march 2018, brazil adopted interchange caps on debit transactions and in march 2020, the congress in costa rica passed legislation allowing the central bank to regulate interchange and other fees. this trend to regulate pricing continued in latin america in 2021, when the president in chile signed legislation to create a committee to set interchange caps. finally, in australia, the reserve bank completed its review of the country's payment system regulations and made a series of preliminary recommendations including, to further lower interchange rates for debit transactions, and set expectations for issuers and acquirers in the country to support greater issuance and acceptance of dual-badged debit cards and allow merchant choice routing on certain transactions.
when we cannot set default interchange reimbursement rates at optimal levels, issuers and acquirers may find our payments system less attractive. this may increase the attractiveness of other payments systems, such as our competitors' closed-loop payments systems with direct connections to both merchants and consumers. we believe some issuers may react to such regulations by charging new or higher fees, or reducing certain benefits to consumers, which make our products less appealing to consumers. some acquirers may elect to charge higher mdr regardless of the visa interchange reimbursement rate, causing merchants not to accept our products or to steer customers to alternative payments systems or forms of payment. in addition, in an effort to reduce the expense of their payment programs, some issuers and acquirers have obtained, and may continue to obtain, incentives from us, including reductions in the fees that we charge, which may directly impact our revenues.
in addition to the regulation of interchange reimbursement fees, a number of regulators impose restrictions on other aspects of our payments business. for example, many governments including, but not limited to governments in india and turkey are using regulation to further drive down mdr, which could negatively affect the economics of our transactions. some countries in latin america, like peru and chile are relying on antitrust-driven regulatory actions that can have implications for how the payments ecosystem and four party model operate. the psr's review of the acquiring market in the united kingdom could lead to additional regulatory pressure on our business. with increased merchant lobbying, we could also begin to see regulatory interest in network fees. government regulations or pressure may also require us to allow other payments networks to support visa products or services, or to have the other network's functionality or brand marks on our products. as innovations in payment technology have enabled us to expand into new products and services, they have also expanded the potential scope of regulatory influence. for instance, new products and capabilities, including tokenization, push payments, and non-card based payment flows (e.g., visa b2b connect) could bring increased licensing or authorization requirements in the countries where the product or capability is offered. in addition, the eu's requirement to separate scheme and processing adds costs and impacts the execution of our commercial, innovation and product strategies.
we are also subject to central bank oversight in a growing number of countries, including, brazil, india, russia, the united kingdom and within the eu. furthermore, some countries with existing oversight frameworks are looking to further enhance their regulatory powers. this oversight could result in new governance, reporting, licensing, cybersecurity, processing infrastructure, capital, or credit risk management requirements. we could also be required to adopt policies and practices designed to mitigate settlement and liquidity risks, including increased requirements to maintain sufficient levels of capital and financial resources locally, as well as localized risk management or governance. increased oversight could also include new criteria for member participation and merchant access to our payments system. additionally, regulators in other jurisdictions are considering or adopting approaches based on similar regulatory principles.
regulators around the world increasingly take note of each other's approaches to regulating the payments industry. consequently, a development in one jurisdiction may influence regulatory approaches in another. the risks created by a new law, regulation or regulatory outcome in one jurisdiction have the potential to be replicated and to negatively affect our business in another jurisdiction or in other product offerings. for example, our settlement with the european commission on cross-border interchange rates has drawn some preliminary attention of regulators in other parts of the world. similarly, new regulations involving one product offering may prompt regulators to extend the regulations to other product offerings. for example, credit payments could become subject to similar regulation table of contents as debit payments (or vice versa). for instance, the reserve bank of australia initially capped credit interchange, but subsequently capped debit interchange as well.
government-imposed obligations and/or restrictions on international payment systems may prevent us from competing against providers in certain countries, including significant markets such as china, india and russia.
governments in a number of jurisdictions shield domestic payment card networks, brands, and processors from international competition by imposing market access barriers and preferential domestic regulations. to varying degrees, these policies and regulations affect the terms of competition in the marketplace and undermine the competitiveness of international payments networks. public authorities may impose regulatory requirements that favor domestic providers or mandate that domestic payments or data processing be performed entirely within that country, which could prevent us from managing the end-to-end processing of certain transactions.
in russia, legislation effectively prevents us from processing domestic transactions. the central bank controlled national payment card system (nspk) is the only entity allowed to process domestically. in china, unionpay remains the sole processor of domestic payment card transactions and operates the sole domestic acceptance mark. although we have filed an application with the people's bank of china (pboc) to operate a bank card clearing institution (bcci) in china, the timing and the procedural steps for approval remain uncertain. the approval process might require several years, and there is no guarantee that the license to operate a bcci will be approved or, if we obtain such license, that we will be able to successfully compete with domestic payments networks.
regulatory initiatives in india also suggest growing nationalistic priorities, including a data localization mandate passed by the government, which has cost implications for us and could affect our ability to effectively compete with domestic payment providers. furthermore, any inability to meet the requirements of the data localization mandate could impact our ability to do business in india. in europe, with the support of the european central bank, a group of european banks have announced their intent to launch a pan-european payment system, the european payments initiative or epi, with the purported intent to reduce the risks of disintermediation by international technology companies and continued reliance on international payments networks for intra-europe card transactions. furthermore, regional groups of countries, such as the gulf cooperation council (gcc) and a number of countries in southeast asia, are considering, or may consider, efforts to restrict our participation in the processing of regional transactions. the african development bank has also indicated an interest in supporting national payment systems in its efforts to expand financial inclusion and strengthen regional financial stability. finally, some countries such as south africa are mandating on-shore processing of domestic transactions. geopolitical events, including sanctions, trade tensions or other types of activities could potentially intensify any or all of these activities, which could adversely affect our business.
due to our inability to manage the end-to-end processing of transactions for cards in certain countries (e.g., russia and thailand), we depend on our close working relationships with our clients or third-party processors to ensure transactions involving our products are processed effectively. our ability to do so may be adversely affected by regulatory requirements and policies pertaining to transaction routing or on-shore processing.
co-badging and co-residency regulations may pose additional challenges in markets where visa competes with national networks for issuance and routing. for example, in china, certain banks have issued dual-branded cards for which domestic transactions in china are processed by unionpay and transactions outside of china are processed by us or other international payments networks. the pboc is contemplating that dual-branded cards could be phased out over time as new licenses are issued to international companies to participate in china's domestic payments market. accordingly, we have been working with chinese issuers to issue visa-only branded cards for international travel, and later for domestic transactions after we obtain a bcci license. however, notwithstanding such efforts, the phase out of dual-branded cards may decrease our payment volumes and impact the revenue we generate in china. furthermore, as discussed above, australia is contemplating additional requirements to mandate dual-badged or co-badged cards that support the local domestic debit network, eftpos.
mir and unionpay have grown rapidly in russia and china, respectively, and are actively pursuing international expansion plans, which could potentially lead to regulatory pressures on our international routing rule (which requires that international transactions on visa cards be routed over visanet). furthermore, although regulatory barriers shield mir and unionpay from competition in russia and china, respectively, alternative payment providers such as alipay and wechat pay have rapidly expanded into ecommerce, offline, and cross-border payments, which could make it difficult for us to compete even if our license is approved in china. netsunion clearing corp, a table of contents chinese digital transaction routing system, and other such systems could have a competitive advantage in comparison with international payments networks.
finally, central banks in a number of countries, including those in argentina, australia, brazil, canada and russia, are in the process of developing or expanding national real-time payments networks with the goal of driving a greater number of domestic transactions onto these systems. similarly, an increasing number of jurisdictions are exploring the concept of building central bank digital currencies for retail payments. if successfully deployed, these national payment platforms and digital currencies could have significant implications for visa's domestic and cross-border payments, including potential disintermediation.
in general, national laws that protect or otherwise support domestic providers or processing may increase our costs; decrease our payments volumes and impact the revenue we generate in those countries; decrease the number of visa products issued or processed; impede us from utilizing our global processing capabilities and controlling the quality of the services supporting our brands; restrict our activities; limit our growth and the ability to introduce new products, services and innovations; force us to leave countries or prevent us from entering new markets; and create new competitors, all of which could harm our business.
laws and regulations regarding the handling of personal data and information may impede our services or result in increased costs, legal claims, or fines against us.
our business relies on the processing of data in many jurisdictions and the movement of data across national borders. legal requirements relating to the collection, storage, handling, use, disclosure, transfer, and security of personal data continue to evolve, and regulatory scrutiny in this area is increasing around the world. for example, in july 2020 the court of justice of the european union (cjeu) ruled to invalidate the u.s./eu privacy shield - a legal framework that allowed participating companies to transfer personal data from eu member states to the u.s. visa has never used the privacy shield framework for its transfers, and relies instead on standard contractual clauses. however, the cjeu ruling made clear that these transfer mechanisms will be subject to additional scrutiny as well. significant uncertainty exists as privacy and data protection laws may be interpreted and applied differently from country to country and may create inconsistent or conflicting requirements. for example, the eu's and uk's general data protection regulation (gdpr) extends the scope of the eu and uk data protection law to all companies processing data of eu and uk residents, regardless of the company's location. the law requires companies to comply with a broad range of requirements regarding the handling of personal information. although we have a global data privacy program that addresses the requirements applicable to our international business, our ongoing efforts to comply with gdpr and rapidly emerging privacy and data protection laws in countries such as india or states in the u.s. such as colorado and virginia may increase the complexity of our compliance operations, entail substantial expenses, divert resources from other initiatives and projects, and could limit the services we are able to offer.
furthermore, inconsistent local and regional regulations restricting location, movement, collection, use and management of data may limit our ability to innovate or compete in certain jurisdictions. for example, china adopted its first comprehensive privacy law, the personal information protection law (pipl), which took effect in november 2021. although certain details of pipl may require further regulatory clarification or guidance, visa could be impacted more significantly if our license is approved and we begin conducting domestic bank card clearing activity in china. lastly, enforcement actions and investigations by regulatory authorities related to data security incidents and privacy violations continue to increase. the enactment of more restrictive laws, rules, regulations, or future enforcement actions or investigations could impact us through increased costs or restrictions on our business, and noncompliance could result in regulatory penalties and significant legal liability.
we may be subject to tax examinations or disputes, or changes in tax laws.
we exercise significant judgment and make estimates in calculating our worldwide provision for income taxes and other tax liabilities. although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable, many factors may limit their accuracy. we are currently under examination by, or in disputes with, the u.s. internal revenue service, the uk's hm revenue and customs as well as tax authorities in other jurisdictions, and we may be subject to additional examinations or disputes in the future. relevant tax authorities may disagree with our tax treatment of certain material items and thereby increase our tax liability. failure to sustain our position in these matters could harm our cash flow and financial position. in addition, changes in existing laws in the u.s. or foreign jurisdictions, including unilateral actions of foreign jurisdictions to introduce digital services taxes, or changes resulting from the organisation for economic cooperation and development's programme of work, related to the revision of profit allocation and nexus rules and design of a system to ensure multinational enterprises pay a minimum level of tax to table of contents the countries where we earn revenue, may also materially affect our effective tax rate. a substantial increase in our tax payments could have a material, adverse effect on our financial results. see also note 19-income taxes to our consolidated financial statements included in item 8-financial statements and supplementary data of this report.
litigation risks we may be adversely affected by the outcome of litigation or investigations, despite certain protections that are in place.
we are involved in numerous litigation matters, investigations, and proceedings asserted by civil litigants, governments, and enforcement bodies investigating or alleging, among other things, violations of competition and antitrust law, consumer protection law, privacy law and intellectual property law (these are referred to as "actions" in this section). details of the most significant actions we face are described more fully in note 20-legal matters to our consolidated financial statements included in item 8-financial statements and supplementary data of this report. these actions are inherently uncertain, expensive and disruptive to our operations. in the event we are found liable in any material action, particularly in a large class action lawsuit, such as one involving an antitrust claim entitling the plaintiff to treble damages in the u.s., or we incur liability arising from a government investigation, we may be required to pay significant awards, settlements or fines. in addition, settlement terms, judgments, orders or pressures resulting from actions may harm our business by influencing or requiring us to modify, among other things, the default interchange reimbursement rates we set, the visa operating rules or the way in which we enforce those rules, our fees or pricing, or the way we do business. these actions or their outcomes may also influence regulators, investigators, governments or civil litigants in the same or other jurisdictions, which may lead to additional actions against visa. finally, we are required by some of our commercial agreements to indemnify other entities for litigation brought against them, even if visa is not a defendant.
for certain actions like those that are u.s. covered litigation or ve territory covered litigation, as described in note 5-u.s. and europe retrospective responsibility plans and note 20-legal matters to our consolidated financial statements included in item 8-financial statements and supplementary data of this report, we have certain financial protections pursuant to the respective retrospective responsibility plans. the two retrospective responsibility plans are different in the protections they provide and the mechanisms by which we are protected. the failure of one or both of the retrospective responsibility plans to adequately insulate us from the impact of such settlements, judgments, losses, or liabilities could materially harm our financial condition or cash flows, or even cause us to become insolvent.
business risks we face intense competition in our industry.
the global payments space is intensely competitive. as technology evolves, new competitors or methods of payment emerge, and existing clients and competitors assume different roles. our products compete with cash, checks, electronic funds, virtual currency payments, global or multi-regional networks, other domestic and closed-loop payments systems, and alternative payment providers primarily focused on enabling payments through ecommerce and mobile channels. as the global payments space becomes more complex, we face increasing competition from our clients, other emerging payment providers such as fintechs, other digital payments, technology companies that have developed payments systems enabled through online activity in ecommerce, social media, and mobile channels, as well as governments in a number of jurisdictions (e.g. brazil, india and russia), that are developing, supporting and/or operating national schemes, real time payments networks and other payment platforms.
our competitors may acquire or develop substantially better technology, have more widely adopted delivery channels or have greater financial resources. they may offer more effective, innovative or a wider range of programs, products and services. they may use more effective advertising and marketing strategies that result in broader brand recognition, and greater use, including with respect to issuance and merchant acceptance. they may also develop better security solutions or more favorable pricing arrangements. moreover, even if we successfully adapt to technological change and the proliferation of alternative types of payment services by developing and offering our own services in these areas, such services may provide less favorable financial terms for us than we currently receive from visanet transactions, which could hurt our financial results and prospects.
certain of our competitors operate with different business models, have different cost structures or participate in different market segments. those business models may ultimately prove more successful or more adaptable to table of contents regulatory, technological and other developments. in some cases, these competitors have the support of government mandates that prohibit, limit or otherwise hinder our ability to compete for transactions within certain countries and regions. some of our competitors, including american express, discover, private-label card networks, virtual currency providers, technology companies that enable the exchange of digital assets, and certain alternative payments systems like alipay and wechat pay, operate closed-loop payments systems, with direct connections to both merchants and consumers. government actions or initiatives such as the dodd-frank act, the ifr in europe, or real time payment initiatives by governments such as the u.s. federal reserve's fednow or the central bank of brazil's pix system may provide competitors with increased opportunities to derive competitive advantages from these business models, and may create new competitors, including in some cases the government itself. similarly, regulation in europe under psd2 and the ifr may require us to open up access to, and allow participation in, our network to additional participants, and reduce the infrastructure investment and regulatory burden on competitors. we also run the risk of disintermediation due to factors such as emerging technologies and platforms, including mobile payments, alternative payment credentials, other ledger technologies or payment forms, and by virtue of increasing bilateral agreements between entities that prefer not to use our payments network for processing transactions. for example, merchants could process transactions directly with issuers, or processors could process transactions directly with issuers and acquirers.
we expect the competitive landscape to continue to shift and evolve. for example:
•we, along with our competitors, clients, network participants, and others are developing or participating in alternative payments systems or products, such as mobile payment services, ecommerce payment services, p2p payment services, real-time and faster payment initiatives, and payment services that permit ach or direct debits from or to consumer checking accounts, that could either reduce our role or otherwise disintermediate us from the transaction processing or the value added services we provide to support such processing. examples include initiatives from the clearing house, an association consisting of large financial institutions that has developed its own faster payments system; early warning services, which operates zelle, a bank-offered alternative network that provides another platform for faster funds or real-time payments across a variety of payment types, including p2p, corporate and government disbursement, bill pay and deposit check transactions; and cryptocurrency or stablecoin-based payments initiatives.
•similarly, many countries are developing or promoting domestic networks, switches and real-time payment systems (e.g. india, russia, as well as europe). to the extent these governments mandate local banks and merchants to use and accept these systems for domestic or other transactions, prohibit international payments networks, like visa, from participating on those systems, and/or impose restrictions or prohibitions, on international payments networks from offering payment services on such transactions, we could face the risk of our business being disintermediated in those countries. for example, in argentina, the government has mandated local acquirers to use debit card credentials to initiate payment transactions on a government-sponsored national real-time payment system. furthermore, in some regions (e.g., southeast asia; the middle east), through intergovernmental organizations such as the association of southeast asian nations and the gcc, some countries are looking into cross-border connectivity of such domestic systems;
•parties that process our transactions may try to minimize or eliminate our position in the payments value chain;
•parties that access our payment credentials, tokens and technologies, including clients, technology solution providers or others might be able to migrate or steer account holders and other clients to alternative payment methods or use our payment credentials, tokens and technologies to establish or help bolster alternate payment methods and platforms;
•participants in the payments industry may merge, form joint ventures or enable or enter into other business combinations that strengthen their existing business propositions or create new, competing payment services; and
•new or revised industry standards related to online checkout and web payments, cloud-based payments, tokenization or other payments-related technologies set by individual countries, regions or organizations such as the international organization for standardization, american national standards institute, world wide web consortium, european card standards group, pci co, nexo and emvco may result in additional costs and expenses for visa and its clients, or otherwise negatively impact the functionality and competitiveness of our products and services.
table of contents as the competitive landscape is quickly evolving, we may not be able to foresee or respond sufficiently to emerging risks associated with new businesses, products, services and practices. we may be asked to adjust our local rules and practices, develop or customize certain aspects of our payment services, or agree to business arrangements that may be less protective of visa's proprietary technology and interests in order to compete and we may face increasing operational costs and risk of litigation concerning intellectual property. our failure to compete effectively in light of any such developments could harm our business and prospects for future growth.
our revenues and profits are dependent on our client and merchant base, which may be costly to win, retain, and develop.
our financial institution clients and merchants can reassess their commitments to us at any time or develop their own competitive services. while we have certain contractual protections, our clients, including some of our largest clients, generally have flexibility to issue non-visa products. further, in certain circumstances, our financial institution clients may decide to terminate our contractual relationship on relatively short notice without paying significant early termination fees. because a significant portion of our net revenues is concentrated among our largest clients, the loss of business from any one of these larger clients could harm our business, results of operations, and financial condition. for more information, please see note 14-enterprise-wide disclosures and concentration of business to our consolidated financial statements included in item 8-financial statements and supplementary data of this report.
in addition, we face intense competitive pressure on the prices we charge our financial institution clients. in order to stay competitive, we may need to adjust our pricing or offer incentives to our clients to increase payments volume, enter new market segments, adapt to regulatory changes, and expand their use and acceptance of visa products and services. these include up-front cash payments, fee discounts, rebates, credits, performance-based incentives, marketing, and other support payments that impact our revenues and profitability. in addition, we offer incentives to certain merchants or acquirers to win routing preference in relation to other network options or forms of payment. market pressures on pricing, incentives, fee discounts, and rebates could moderate our growth. if we are not able to implement cost containment and productivity initiatives in other areas of our business or increase our volumes in other ways to offset or absorb the financial impact of these incentives, fee discounts, and rebates, it may harm our net revenues and profits.
in addition, it may be difficult or costly for us to acquire or conduct business with financial institutions or merchants that have longstanding exclusive, or nearly exclusive, relationships with our competitors. these financial institutions or merchants may be more successful and may grow more quickly than our existing clients or merchants. in addition, if there is a consolidation or acquisition of one or more of our largest clients or co-brand partners by a financial institution client or merchant with a strong relationship with one of our competitors, it could result in our business shifting to a competitor, which could put us at a competitive disadvantage and harm our business.
merchants' and processors' continued push to lower acceptance costs and challenge industry practices could harm our business.
we rely in part on merchants and their relationships with our clients to maintain and expand the use and acceptance of visa products. certain merchants and merchant-affiliated groups have been exerting their influence in the global payments system in certain jurisdictions, such as the u.s., canada and europe, to attempt to lower their acceptance costs by lobbying for new legislation, seeking regulatory intervention, filing lawsuits and in some cases, refusing to accept visa products. if they are successful in their efforts, we may face increased compliance and litigation expenses, issuers may decrease their issuance of our products, and consumer usage of our products could be adversely impacted. for example, in the u.s., certain stakeholders have raised concerns regarding how payment security standards and rules may impact debit routing choice and the cost of payment card acceptance. in addition to ongoing litigation related to the u.s. migration to emv-capable cards and point-of-sale terminals, u.s. merchant-affiliated groups and processors have expressed concerns regarding the emv certification process and some policymakers have expressed concerns about the roles of industry bodies such as emvco and the payment card industry security standards council in the development of payment card standards. additionally, some merchants and processors have advocated for changes to industry practices and visa acceptance requirements at the point of sale, including the ability for merchants to accept only certain types of visa products, to mandate only pin authenticated transactions, to differentiate or steer among visa product types issued by different financial institutions, and to impose surcharges on customers presenting visa products as their form of payment. if successful, these efforts could adversely impact consumers' usage of our products, lead to regulatory enforcement and/or litigation, increase our compliance and litigation expenses, and harm our business.
table of contents we depend on relationships with financial institutions, acquirers, processors, merchants, payment facilitators, ecommerce platforms, fintechs and other third parties.
as noted above, our relationships with industry participants are complex and require us to balance the interests of multiple third parties. for instance, we depend significantly on relationships with our financial institution clients and on their relationships with account holders and merchants to support our programs and services, and thereby compete effectively in the marketplace. we engage in discussions with merchants, acquirers, ecommerce platforms and processors to provide incentives to promote routing preference and acceptance growth. we also engage in many payment card co-branding efforts with merchants, who receive incentives from us. as emerging participants such as fintechs enter the payments industry, we engage in discussions to address the role they may play in the ecosystem, whether as, for example, an issuer, merchant, ecommerce platform or digital wallet provider. as these and other relationships become more prevalent and take on a greater importance to our business, our success will increasingly depend on our ability to sustain and grow these relationships. in addition, we depend on our clients and third parties, including network partners, vendors and suppliers, to submit, facilitate and process transactions properly, provide various services associated with our payments network on our behalf, and otherwise adhere to our operating rules and applicable laws. to the extent that such parties fail to perform or deliver adequate services, it may result in negative experiences for account holders or others when using their visa-branded payment products, which could harm our business and reputation.
our business could be harmed if we are not able to maintain and enhance our brand, if events occur that have the potential to damage our brand or reputation, or if we experience brand disintermediation.
our brand is globally recognized and is a key asset of our business. we believe that our clients and account holders associate our brand with acceptance, security, convenience, speed, and reliability. our success depends in large part on our ability to maintain the value of our brand and reputation of our products and services in the payments ecosystem, elevate the brand through new and existing products, services and partnerships, and uphold our corporate reputation. the popularity of products that we have developed in partnership with technology companies and financial institutions may have the potential to cause consumer confusion or brand disintermediation at the point-of-sale and decrease the value of our brand. our brand reputation may be negatively impacted by a number of factors, including authorization, clearing and settlement service disruptions; data security breaches; compliance failures by visa, including our employees, agents, clients, partners or suppliers; failure to meet our environmental, social and governance goals; negative perception of our industry, the industries of our clients, visa-accepting merchants, or our clients' customers, including third party payments providers; ill-perceived actions or affiliations by clients, partners or other third parties, such as sponsorship or co-brand partners; and fraudulent, controversial or illegal activities using our payment products. if we are unable to maintain our reputation, the value of our brand may be impaired, which could harm our relationships with clients, account holders, governments and the public, as well as impact our business.
global economic, political, market, health and social events or conditions, including the ongoing effects of the coronavirus pandemic, may harm our business.
more than half of our net revenues are earned outside the u.s. international cross-border transaction revenues represent a significant part of our revenue and are an important part of our growth strategy. our revenues are dependent on the volume and number of payment transactions made by consumers, governments, and businesses whose spending patterns may be affected by prevailing economic, political, market, health and social events or conditions. adverse macroeconomic conditions, including recessions, inflation, high unemployment, currency fluctuations, actual or anticipated large-scale defaults or failures, or a slowdown of global trade could decrease consumer and corporate confidence and reduce consumer, small business, government, and corporate spending which have a direct impact on our revenues. in addition, outbreaks of illnesses, pandemics like covid-19, or other local or global health issues, political uncertainties, international hostilities, armed conflict, or unrest, climate-related events, including the increasing frequency of extreme weather events, and natural disasters could have similar impacts on our operations, clients, third-party suppliers, activities in a particular location or globally, and cross-border travel and spend. geopolitical trends towards nationalism, protectionism, and restrictive visa requirements, as well as continued activity and uncertainty around economic sanctions, tariffs or trade restrictions could limit the expansion of our business in those regions. in addition, as governments, investors and other stakeholders face additional pressures to accelerate actions to address climate change and other environmental, governance and social topics, governments may implement regulations or investors and other stakeholders may impose new expectations or focus investments in ways that cause significant shifts in disclosure, commerce and consumption behaviors that may have negative impacts on our business. as a result of any of these factors, any decline in cross-
table of contents border travel and spend could impact the number of cross-border transactions we process and our currency exchange activities, which in turn would reduce our international transaction revenues.
a decline in economic, political, market, health and social conditions could impact our clients as well, and their decisions could reduce the number of cards, accounts, and credit lines of their account holders, which ultimately impact our revenues. they may also implement cost-reduction initiatives that reduce or eliminate marketing budgets, and decrease spending on optional or enhanced value added services from us. any events or conditions that impair the functioning of the financial markets, tighten the credit market, or lead to a downgrade of our current credit rating could increase our future borrowing costs and impair our ability to access the capital and credit markets on favorable terms, which could affect our liquidity and capital resources, or significantly increase our cost of capital. if clients default on their settlement obligations, it may also impact our liquidity. any of these events could adversely affect our volumes and revenue.
the ongoing effects of the coronavirus pandemic remain difficult to predict due to numerous uncertainties, including the transmissibility, severity, duration and resurgence of the outbreak; new variants of the virus; the uptake and effectiveness of health and safety measures or actions that are voluntarily adopted by the public or required by governments or public health authorities, including vaccines and treatments; the speed and strength of an economic recovery, including the reopening of borders and the resumption of international travel; and the impact to our employees and our operations, the business of our clients, suppliers and business partners; and other factors such as:
•third party disruptions, including potential outages at network providers, call centers and other suppliers;
•increased consumer dispute volumes due to travel or event cancellations and the speed or accuracy in processing refunds;
•increased cyber and payment fraud risk, as cybercriminals attempt ddos related attacks, phishing scams and other disruptive actions, given the shift to online banking, ecommerce and other online activity, as well as more employees working remotely as a result of the ongoing pandemic;
•challenges to the availability and reliability of our network due to changes to normal operations, including the possibility of one or more clusters of covid-19 cases occurring at our data centers, affecting our employees, or affecting the systems or employees of our issuers, acquirers or merchants;
•additional regulatory requirements, including, for example, government initiatives or requests to reduce or eliminate payments fees or other costs. a number of countries have taken steps to temporarily cap interchange or other fees on electronic payments as part of their covid-19 economic relief measures. it is possible that some or all of these caps may become permanent over time, or that we see governments introduce additional and/or new pricing caps in future economic relief initiatives. in addition, proponents of interchange and/or mdr regulation may try to position government intervention as necessary to support recovery efforts. in an overall soft global economy, such pricing measures could result in additional financial pressures on our business; and
•workforce impacts, such as difficulty recruiting, retaining, training, motivating and developing employees due to evolving health and safety protocols; changing worker expectations and talent marketplace variability regarding flexible work models; restrictions on immigration, travel and employee mobility; and the challenges of maintaining our strong corporate culture, which values communication, collaboration and connections, despite a majority of employees working from home.
our indemnification obligation to fund settlement losses of our clients exposes us to significant risk of loss and may reduce our liquidity.
we indemnify issuers and acquirers for settlement losses they may suffer due to the failure of another issuer or acquirer to honor its settlement obligations in accordance with the visa operating rules. in certain instances, we may indemnify issuers or acquirers in situations in which a transaction is not processed by our system. this indemnification creates settlement risk for us due to the timing difference between the date of a payment transaction and the date of subsequent settlement. our indemnification exposure is generally limited to the amount of unsettled visa card payment transactions at any point in time and any subsequent amounts that may fall due relating to adjustments for previously processed transactions. concurrent settlement failures or insolvencies involving more than one of our largest clients, several of our smaller clients, or systemic operational failures could negatively impact our financial position. even if we have sufficient liquidity to cover a settlement failure or insolvency, we may table of contents be unable to recover the amount of such payment. this could expose us to significant losses and harm our business. see note 12-settlement guarantee management to our consolidated financial statements included in item 8-financial statements and supplementary data of this report.
technology and cybersecurity risks failure to anticipate, adapt to, or keep pace with, new technologies in the payments industry could harm our business and impact future growth.
the global payments industry is undergoing significant and rapid technological change, including mobile and other proximity and in-app payment technologies, ecommerce, tokenization, cryptocurrencies, distributed ledger and blockchain technologies, and new authentication technologies such as biometrics, 3d secure 2.0 and dynamic cardholder verification values or dcvv2. as a result, we expect new services and technologies to continue to emerge and evolve, including those developed by visa such as our cross-border b2b payment service, visa b2b connect. in addition to our own initiatives and innovations, we work closely with third parties, including potential competitors, for the development of, and access to, new technologies. it is difficult, however, to predict which technological developments or innovations will become widely adopted and how those technologies may be regulated. moreover, some of the new technologies could be subject to intellectual property-related lawsuits or claims, potentially impacting our development efforts and/or requiring us to obtain licenses. if we or our partners fail to adapt and keep pace with new technologies in the payments space in a timely manner, it could harm our ability to compete, decrease the value of our products and services to our clients, impact our intellectual property or licensing rights, harm our business and impact our future growth.
a disruption, failure or breach of our networks or systems, including as a result of cyber-attacks, could harm our business.
our cybersecurity and processing systems, as well as those of financial institutions, merchants, and third-party service providers, have experienced in limited instances and may continue to experience errors, interruptions, delays or damage from a number of causes, including power outages, hardware, software and network failures, computer viruses, malware or other destructive software, internal design, manual or user errors, cyber-attacks, terrorism, workplace violence or wrongdoing, catastrophic events, natural disasters, severe weather conditions and other effects from climate change. in addition, there is risk that third party suppliers of hardware and infrastructure required to operate our data centers and support employee productivity could be impacted by supply chain disruptions, such as manufacturing and shipping delays. an extended supply chain disruption could also impact processing or delivery of technology services.
furthermore, our visibility and role in the global payments industry may also put our company at a greater risk of being targeted by hackers. in the normal course of our business, we have been the target of malicious cyber-attack attempts. we have been, and may continue to be, impacted by attacks and data security breaches of financial institutions, merchants, or third-party processors. we are also aware of instances where nation states have sponsored attacks against some of our financial institution clients, and other instances where merchants and issuers have encountered substantial data security breaches affecting their customers, some of whom were visa account holders. such attacks and breaches have resulted, and may continue to result in, fraudulent activity and ultimately, financial losses to visa's clients, and it is difficult to predict the direct or indirect impact of future attacks or breaches to our business.
numerous and evolving cybersecurity threats, including advanced and persistent cyber-attacks, phishing and social engineering schemes, particularly on our internet-facing applications, could compromise the confidentiality, availability, and integrity of data in our systems or the systems of our third-party service providers. because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access, or to disable or degrade systems change frequently, have become increasingly more complex and sophisticated, and may be difficult to detect for periods of time, we may not anticipate these acts or respond adequately or timely. the security measures and procedures we, our financial institution and merchant clients, other merchants and third-party service providers in the payments ecosystem have in place to protect sensitive consumer data and other information may not be successful or sufficient to counter all data security breaches, cyber-attacks, or system failures. in some cases, the mitigation efforts may be dependent on third parties who may not deliver to the required contractual standards, who may not be able to timely patch vulnerabilities or fix security defects, or whose hardware, software or network services may be subject to error, defect, delay, outage or lack appropriate malware prevention to prevent breaches or data exfiltration incidents. although we devote significant resources to our cybersecurity, acquired entities, and supplier risk management table of contents programs and have implemented security measures to protect our systems and data, and to prevent, detect and respond to data security incidents, there can be no assurance that our efforts will prevent these threats.
these events could significantly disrupt our operations; impact our clients and consumers; damage our reputation and brand; result in litigation or claims, violations of applicable privacy and other laws, and increased regulatory review or scrutiny, investigations, actions, fines or penalties; result in damages or changes to our business practices; decrease the overall use and acceptance of our products; decrease our volume, revenues and future growth prospects; and be costly, time consuming and difficult to remedy. in the event of damage or disruption to our business due to these occurrences, we may not be able to successfully and quickly recover all of our critical business functions, assets, and data through our business continuity program. furthermore, while we maintain insurance, our coverage may not sufficiently cover all types of losses or claims that may arise.
structural and organizational risks we may not achieve the anticipated benefits of our acquisitions or strategic investments, and may face risks and uncertainties as a result.
as part of our overall business strategy, we make acquisitions and strategic investments. we may not achieve the anticipated benefits of our current and future acquisitions and strategic investments and they may involve significant risks and uncertainties, including:
•disruption to our ongoing business, including diversion of resources and management's attention from our existing business;
•greater than expected investment of resources or operating expenses;
•failure to adequately develop our acquired entities;
•the data security, cybersecurity and operational resilience posture of our acquired entities, or companies we invest in or partner with, may not be adequate and may be more susceptible to cyber incidents;
•difficulty, expense or failure of implementing controls, procedures and policies at the acquired entities;
•challenges of integrating new employees, business cultures, business systems and technologies;
•failure to retain employees, clients or partners of our acquired entities;
•in the case of foreign acquisitions, risks related to the integration of operations across different cultures and languages;
•disruptions, costs, liabilities, judgments, settlements or business pressures resulting from litigation matters, investigations or legal proceedings involving the acquisitions or strategic investments;
•the inability to pursue aspects of the acquired entities due to outcomes in litigation matters, investigations or legal proceedings;
•failure to obtain the necessary government or other approvals at all, on a timely basis or without the imposition of burdensome conditions or restrictions;
•the economic, political, regulatory and compliance risks associated with entering into a new business or operating in new regions or countries. for more information on regulatory risks, please see item 1-business-government regulations and item 1a-risk factors-regulatory risks above;
•discovery of unidentified issues and related liabilities after the acquisition or investment was made;
•failure to mitigate the deficiencies and liabilities of the acquired entities;
•dilutive issuance of equity securities, if new securities are issued;
•the incurrence of debt;
•negative impact on our financial position and/or statement of operations; and
•anticipated benefits, synergies or value of the investment or acquisition not materializing.
table of contents we may be unable to attract, hire, and retain a highly qualified and diverse workforce, including key management.
the talents and efforts of our employees, particularly our key management, are vital to our success. the market for highly skilled workers and leaders in our industry, especially in fintech, technology and other specialized areas, is extremely competitive. our management team has significant industry experience and would be difficult to replace. we may be unable to retain them or to attract other highly qualified employees, particularly if we do not offer employment terms that are competitive with the rest of the labor market. ongoing changes in laws and policies regarding immigration and work authorizations have made it more difficult for employees to work in, or transfer among, jurisdictions in which we have operations and could continue to impair our ability to attract and retain qualified employees. failure to attract, hire, develop, motivate, and retain highly qualified and diverse employee talent; to meet our goals related to fostering an inclusive and diverse culture, including increasing the number of underrepresented employees in the u.s.; to develop and implement an adequate succession plan for the management team; to maintain a corporate culture that fosters innovation, collaboration and inclusion; or to design and successfully implement flexible work models that meet the expectations of employees and prospective employees could disrupt our operations and adversely affect our business and our future success. these challenges may be further amplified by the ongoing coronavirus pandemic.
the conversions of our class b and class c common stock or series a, b and c preferred stock into shares of class a common stock would result in voting dilution to, and could impact the market price of, our existing class a common stock.
the market price of our class a common stock could fall as a result of many factors. the value of our class b and c common stock and series a, b and c preferred stock is tied to the value of the class a common stock. under our u.s. retrospective responsibility plan, upon final resolution of our u.s. covered litigation, all class b common stock will become convertible into class a common stock. in september 2020, we released $7.3 billion of the as-converted value from our series b and series c preferred stock and issued series a preferred stock in connection with that release. visa will continue to release value from the series b and series c preferred stock in stages based on developments in current and potential litigation under our europe retrospective responsibility plan. the series b and series c preferred stock will become fully convertible to series a preferred stock or class a common stock no later than 2028 (subject to a holdback to cover any pending claims). visa may take action on the class b common stock and series b and c preferred stock at a certain valuation and due to unforeseen circumstances the overall value of the class b and c common stock and series a, b and c preferred stock as determined by the class a common stock price, may later decrease. conversion of our class b and class c common stock into class a common stock, or our series a, b and c preferred stock into class a common stock, would increase the amount of class a common stock outstanding, which could adversely affect the market price of our existing class a common stock and would dilute the voting power of existing class a common stockholders.
holders of our class b and c common stock and series a, b and c preferred stock may have different interests than our class a common stockholders concerning certain significant transactions.
although their voting rights are limited, holders of our class b and c common stock and, in certain specified circumstances, holders of our series a, b and c preferred stock, can vote on certain significant transactions. with respect to our class b and c common stock, these transactions include a proposed consolidation or merger, a decision to exit our core payments business and any other vote required under delaware law. with respect to our series a, b and c preferred stock, voting rights are limited to proposed consolidations or mergers in which holders of the series a, b and c preferred stock would receive shares of stock or other equity securities with preferences, rights and privileges that are not substantially identical to the preferences, rights and privileges of the applicable series of preferred stock; or, in the case of series b and c preferred stock, holders would receive securities, cash or other property that is different from what our class a common stockholders would receive. because the holders of classes of capital stock other than class a common stock are our current and former financial institution clients, they may have interests that diverge from our class a common stockholders. as a result, the holders of these classes of capital stock may not have the same incentive to approve a corporate action that may be favorable to the holders of class a common stock, and their interests may otherwise conflict with interests of our class a common stockholders.
table of contents delaware law, provisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws, and our capital structure could make a merger, takeover attempt, or change in control difficult.
provisions contained in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws and our capital structure could delay or prevent a merger, takeover attempt, or change in control that our stockholders may consider favorable. for example, except for limited exceptions:
•no person may beneficially own more than 15 percent of our class a common stock (or 15 percent of our total outstanding common stock on an as-converted basis), unless our board of directors approves the acquisition of such shares in advance;
•no competitor or an affiliate of a competitor may hold more than 5 percent of our total outstanding common stock on an as-converted basis;
•the affirmative votes of the class b and c common stock and series a, b and c preferred stock are required for certain types of consolidations or mergers;
•our stockholders may only take action during a stockholders' meeting and may not act by written consent; and
•only the board of directors, chairman, or ceo or any stockholders who have owned continuously for at least one year not less than 15 percent of the voting power of all shares of class a common stock outstanding may call a special meeting of stockholders.

coronavirus. as the effects of an evolving coronavirus ("covid-19") pandemic continues, much remains uncertain. our priority remains the safety of our employees, clients and the communities in which we live and operate. we are taking a phased approach to reopening our offices, with most of our employees currently working remotely. we continue to remain in close and regular contact with our employees, clients, partners and governments globally to help them navigate these challenging times.
the ongoing effects of covid-19 remain difficult to predict due to numerous uncertainties, including the transmissibility, severity, duration and resurgence of the outbreak; new variants of the virus; the uptake and effectiveness of health and safety measures or actions that are voluntarily adopted by the public or required by governments or public health authorities, including vaccines and treatments; the speed and strength of an economic recovery, including the reopening of borders and the resumption of international travel; and the impact to our employees and our operations, the business of our clients, suppliers and business partners; and other factors identified in part i, item 1a "risk factors" in this form 10-k. we will continue to evaluate the nature and extent of the impact to our business.
highlights for fiscal 2021. net revenues were $24.1 billion, an increase of 10% over the prior year, primarily due to the year-over-year growth in payments volume, processed transactions and cross-border volume, helped by table of contents fewer covid-19 restrictions, partially offset by higher client incentives. exchange rate movements and our hedging program positively impacted our net revenues growth by approximately half a percentage point.
gaap operating expenses were $8.3 billion and increased 7% over the prior year, primarily driven by higher personnel and marketing expenses, partially offset by lower general and administrative expenses. non-gaap operating expenses were $8.1 billion and increased 5% over the prior year, primarily driven by higher personnel and marketing expenses, partially offset by lower general and administrative expenses. exchange rate movements negatively impacted our operating expense growth by approximately half a percentage point.
non-gaap financial results. we use non-gaap financial measures of our performance which exclude certain items which we believe are not representative of our continuing operations, as they may be non-recurring or have no cash impact, and may distort our longer-term operating trends. we consider non-gaap measures useful to investors because they provide greater transparency into management's view and assessment of our ongoing operating performance.
•gains and losses on equity investments. gains and losses on equity investments include periodic non-cash fair value adjustments and gains and losses upon sale of an investment. these long-term investments are strategic in nature and are primarily private company investments. gains and losses and the related tax impacts associated with these investments are tied to the performance of the companies that we invest in and therefore do not correlate to the underlying performance of our business.
•amortization of acquired intangible assets. amortization of acquired intangible assets consists of amortization of intangible assets such as developed technology, customer relationships and brands acquired in connection with business combinations executed beginning in fiscal 2019. amortization charges for our acquired intangible assets are non-cash and are significantly affected by the timing, frequency and size of our acquisitions, rather than our core operations. as such, we have excluded this amount and the related tax impact to facilitate an evaluation of our current operating performance and comparison to our past operating performance.
•acquisition-related costs. acquisition-related costs consist primarily of one-time transaction and integration costs associated with our business combinations. these costs include professional fees, technology integration fees, restructuring activities and other direct costs related to the purchase and integration of acquired entities. it also includes retention equity and deferred equity compensation when they are agreed upon as part of the purchase price of the transaction but are required to be recognized as expense post-combination. we have excluded these amounts and the related tax impacts as the expenses are recognized for a limited duration and do not reflect the underlying performance of our business.
•remeasurement of deferred tax balances. during fiscal 2021, in connection with the uk enacted legislation on june 10, 2021 that increases the tax rate from 19% to 25%, effective april 1, 2023, we remeasured our uk deferred tax liabilities, resulting in the recognition of a non-recurring, non-cash income tax expense of $1.0 billion.
during fiscal 2020, in connection with the uk enacted legislation that repealed the previous tax rate reduction from 19% to 17% that was effective on april 1, 2020, we remeasured our uk deferred tax liabilities as of the enactment date, resulting in the recognition of a non-recurring, non-cash income tax expense of $329 million. see note 19-income taxes to our consolidated financial statements included in item 8-financial statements and supplementary data of this report.
•indirect taxes. during fiscal 2021, we recognized a one-time charge within general and administrative expense of $152 million, before tax. net of the related income tax benefit of $40 million, determined by applying applicable tax rates, non-gaap net income increased by $112 million. this charge is to record our estimate of probable additional indirect taxes, related to prior periods, for which we could be liable as a result of certain changes in applicable law. this one-time charge is not representative of our ongoing operations.
•resolution of a tax item. during fiscal 2020, we resolved a long-outstanding tax matter, dating back more than 12 years, relating to certain tax filing positions taken prior to our initial public offering. the resolution of this matter resulted in the recognition of a one-time charge to income tax expense of $28 million, which we believe is not representative of our continuing operations and ongoing effective tax rate.

•litigation provision. during fiscal 2019, we recorded a litigation provision of $370 million and related tax benefits of $83 million associated with the interchange multidistrict litigation. the tax impact is determined by applying applicable federal and state tax rates to the litigation provision. under the u.s. retrospective responsibility plan, we recover the monetary liabilities related to the u.s. covered litigation through a reduction to the conversion rate of our class b common stock to shares of class a common stock. see note 5-u.s. and europe retrospective responsibility plans and note 20-legal matters to our consolidated financial statements included in item 8-financial statements and supplementary data of this report.

net revenues increased in fiscal 2021 primarily due to the year-over-year growth in payments volume, processed transactions and cross-border volume, helped by fewer covid-19 restrictions, partially offset by higher client incentives.
our net revenues are impacted by the overall strengthening or weakening of the u.s. dollar as payments volume and related revenues denominated in local currencies are converted to u.s. dollars. in fiscal 2021, exchange rate movements and our hedging program positively impacted our net revenues growth by approximately half a percentage point.

(1)figures in the table may not recalculate exactly due to rounding. percentage changes are calculated based on unrounded numbers.

•service revenues increased primarily due to 14% growth in nominal payments volume. service revenues were also impacted by select pricing modifications and business mix.
•data processing revenues increased due to 17% growth in processed transactions, as the business laps the initial impacts of covid-19 starting in march 2020.
•international transaction revenues increased primarily due to growth in nominal cross-border volumes, excluding transactions within europe, of 4%, as the business laps the initial impacts of covid-19 starting in march 2020 and border restrictions were relaxed in various markets.
•other revenues increased as the business laps the initial impacts of covid-19 starting in march 2020, driven by higher consulting and data services revenues.
•client incentives increased in conjunction with the increase in payments volume during fiscal 2021. the amount of client incentives we record in future periods will vary based on changes in performance expectations, actual client performance, amendments to existing contracts or the execution of new contracts.

(2)operating expenses for fiscal 2021 and 2019 include significant items that we do not believe are indicative of our operating performance. see overview within this item 7-management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations.
•personnel expenses increased primarily due to higher headcount and incentive compensation, reflecting our strategy to invest in future growth.
•marketing expenses increased as we lapped reductions in spending in the prior year at the outset of covid-19 as well as higher spending in client marketing and various campaigns, including the olympic games tokyo 2020, which were held in summer 2021.
•general and administrative expenses decreased due to lower travel expenses, favorable foreign currency fluctuations and lower usage of travel related card benefits, partially offset by a one-time charge to record our estimate of probable additional indirect taxes, related to prior periods, for which we could be liable as a result of certain changes in applicable laws.
non-operating income (expense)
non-operating income (expense) primarily includes interest expense, gains and losses earned on investments, income from derivative instruments not associated with our core business, as well as the non-service components of net periodic pension income and expense.

table of contents effective income tax rate the following table presents our effective income tax rates:
for the years ended september 30,
2021                                                          2020                    2019
effective income tax rate           23   %                  21   %                  19   %
the effective tax rate in fiscal 2021 differs from the effective tax rate in fiscal 2020 mainly due to the following:
•during fiscal 2021, a $1.0 billion non-recurring non-cash tax expense related to the remeasurement of uk deferred tax liabilities, as discussed below;
•during fiscal 2021, $255 million of tax benefits recognized as a result of the conclusion of audits by taxing authorities; and
•during fiscal 2020, a $329 million non-recurring, non-cash tax expense related to the remeasurement of uk deferred tax liabilities, as discussed below.
on june 10, 2021, the uk enacted legislation that increases the tax rate from 19% to 25%, effective april 1, 2023. on july 22, 2020, the uk enacted legislation that repealed the previous tax rate reduction from 19% to 17% that was effective on april 1, 2020. as a result, in fiscal 2021 and fiscal 2020, we recorded non-recurring, non-cash tax expense related to the remeasurement of our uk deferred tax liabilities, primarily related to intangibles recorded upon the acquisition of visa europe limited ("visa europe") in fiscal 2016.
liquidity and capital resources management of our liquidity we regularly evaluate cash requirements for current operations, commitments, development activities and capital expenditures, and we may elect to raise additional funds for these purposes in the future through the issuance of either debt or equity. our treasury policies provide management with the guidelines and authority to manage liquidity risk in a manner consistent with our corporate objectives.
the objectives of our treasury policies are to:
•provide adequate liquidity to cover operating expenditures and liquidity contingency scenarios;
•ensure timely completion of payments settlement activities;
•ensure payments on required litigation settlements;
•make planned capital investments in our business;
•pay dividends and repurchase our shares at the discretion of our board of directors; and
•invest excess cash in securities that enable us to first meet our working capital and liquidity needs, and earn additional income.
based on our current cash flow budgets and forecasts of our short-term and long-term liquidity needs, we believe that our current and projected sources of liquidity will be sufficient to meet our projected liquidity needs for more than the next 12 months. we will continue to assess our liquidity position and potential sources of supplemental liquidity in view of our operating performance, current economic and capital market conditions and other relevant circumstances.

operating activities. cash provided by operating activities in fiscal 2021 was higher than the prior fiscal year primarily due to growth in our underlying business, lower client incentive payments and timing and impact of covid-19 on settlement in the prior fiscal year.
investing activities. cash was used in investing activities in fiscal 2021 compared to cash provided by investing activities in fiscal 2020, primarily due to higher purchases, net of proceeds from sales and maturities of investment securities.
financing activities. cash used in financing activities in fiscal 2021 was higher than the prior fiscal year primarily due to the absence of proceeds received from the issuance of senior notes in the prior year, the $3.0 billion principal debt payment upon maturity of our senior notes and higher share repurchases. see note 10-debt and note 15-stockholders' equity, to our consolidated financial statements included in item 8-financial statements and supplementary data of this report.
sources of liquidity our primary sources of liquidity are cash on hand, cash flow from our operations, our investment portfolio and access to various equity and borrowing arrangements. funds from operations are maintained in cash and cash equivalents and short-term or long-term investment securities based upon our funding requirements, access to liquidity from these holdings and the return that these holdings provide.
cash, cash equivalents and investments. as of september 30, 2021, our cash and cash equivalents balance were $16.5 billion and our available-for-sale debt securities were $3.2 billion. our investment portfolio is designed to invest cash in securities which enables us to meet our working capital and liquidity needs. our investment portfolio consists of debt securities issued by the u.s. treasury or u.s. government-sponsored agencies. $1.5 billion of the investments are classified as current and are available to meet short-term liquidity needs. the remaining non-current investments have stated maturities of more than one year from the balance sheet date; however, they are also generally available to meet short-term liquidity needs.
factors that may impact the liquidity of our investment portfolio include, but are not limited to, changes to credit ratings of the securities, uncertainty related to regulatory developments, actions by central banks and other monetary authorities and the ongoing strength and quality of credit markets. we will continue to review our portfolio in light of evolving market and economic conditions. however, if current market conditions deteriorate, the liquidity of our investment portfolio may be impacted and we could determine that some of our investments are impaired, which could adversely impact our financial results. we have policies that limit the amount of credit exposure to any one financial institution or type of investment.
commercial paper program. we maintain a commercial paper program to support our working capital requirements and for other general corporate purposes. under the program, we are authorized to issue up to $3.0 billion in outstanding notes, with maturities up to 397 days from the date of issuance. at september 30, 2021, we had no outstanding obligations under the program. see note 10-debt to our consolidated financial statements included in item 8-financial statements and supplementary data of this report.
table of contents credit facility. we have an unsecured $5.0 billion revolving credit facility (the "credit facility") which expires on july 25, 2024. as of september 30, 2021, there were no borrowings under the credit facility. see note 10-debt to our consolidated financial statements included in item 8-financial statements and supplementary data of this report.
u.s. litigation escrow account. pursuant to the terms of the u.s. retrospective responsibility plan, which was created to insulate visa and our class a common shareholders from financial liability for certain litigation cases, we maintain a u.s. litigation escrow account from which monetary liabilities from settlements of, or judgments in, the u.s. covered litigation will be payable. as these funds are restricted for the sole purpose of making payments related to the u.s. covered litigation matters, we do not rely on them for other operational needs. see note 5-u.s. and europe retrospective responsibility plans and note 20-legal matters to our consolidated financial statements included in item 8-financial statements and supplementary data of this report.
credit ratings various factors affect our credit ratings, including changes in our operating performance, the economic environment, conditions in the electronic payments industry, our financial position and changes in our business strategy. our credit ratings are published by nationally recognized statistical rating organizations in the u.s. and have not changed from the prior-year comparable period. we do not currently foresee any reasonable circumstances under which our credit ratings would be significantly downgraded. if a downgrade were to occur, it could adversely impact, among other things, our future borrowing costs and access to capital markets.
uses of liquidity payments settlement. payments settlement due to and from our financial institution clients can represent a substantial daily liquidity requirement. most u.s. dollar settlements are settled within the same day and do not result in a receivable or payable balance, while settlements in currencies other than the u.s. dollar generally remain outstanding for one to two business days, which is consistent with industry practice for such transactions. in general, during fiscal 2021, we were not required to fund settlement-related working capital. at september 30, 2021, we held $9.1 billion of our total available liquidity to fund daily settlement in the event one or more of our financial institution clients are unable to settle, with the remaining liquidity available to support our working capital and other liquidity needs. see note 12-settlement guarantee management to our consolidated financial statements included in item 8-financial statements and supplementary data of this report.
litigation. judgments in and settlements of litigation or other fines imposed in investigations and proceedings, other than the u.s. covered litigation and ve territory covered litigation, which are covered by the u.s. and europe retrospective responsibility plans, could give rise to future liquidity needs. see note 5-u.s. and europe retrospective responsibility plans and note 20-legal matters to our consolidated financial statements included in item 8-financial statements and supplementary data of this report.
common stock repurchases. during fiscal 2021, we repurchased 40 million shares of our class a common stock in the open market for $8.7 billion. as of september 30, 2021, our january 2021 program had remaining authorized funds of $4.8 billion. see note 15-stockholders' equity to our consolidated financial statements included in item 8-financial statements and supplementary data of this report.
dividends. during fiscal 2021, we declared and paid $2.8 billion in dividends at a quarterly rate of $0.32 per share. on october 22, 2021, our board of directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.375 per share of class a common stock (determined in the case of class b and c common stock and series a, b and c convertible participating preferred stock on an as-converted basis). we expect to pay approximately $812 million in connection with this dividend on december 7, 2021. see note 15-stockholders' equity to our consolidated financial statements included in item 8-financial statements and supplementary data of this report. we expect to continue paying quarterly dividends in cash, subject to approval by the board of directors. all preferred and class b and c common stock will share ratably on an as-converted basis in such future dividends.
capital expenditures. during fiscal 2021, our capital expenditures decreased slightly. we expect to continue investing in technology assets and payments system infrastructure to support our digital solutions and core business initiatives.
senior notes. as of september 30, 2021, we had an outstanding aggregate principal amount relating to our fixed-rate senior notes of $21.0 billion with maturity dates ranging from september 2022 to august 2050. during fiscal 2021, we repaid $3.0 billion of principal upon maturity of our senior notes. a principal payment of $1.0 billion is table of contents due on september 14, 2022 on our fixed-rate senior notes issued in december 2015, for which we have sufficient liquidity. in august 2020, we issued a $500 million green bond as part of our commitment to sustainable living and a sustainable payments ecosystem. in fiscal 2021, we allocated $165 million to eligible green projects. see note 10-debt to our consolidated financial statements included in item 8-financial statements and supplementary data of this report.
client incentives. as the future cash payments for these agreements, which range in terms from less than one to fifteen years, are based on specific performance requirements, the timing of payments can vary. as of september 30, 2021, we had $5.4 billion of client incentives liability recorded on the consolidated balance sheet related to these agreements. see note 1-summary of significant accounting policies to our consolidated financial statements included in item 8-financial statements and supplementary data of this report.
uncertain tax positions. as of september 30, 2021, we had liabilities for uncertain tax positions of $1.8 billion for which we cannot determine the range and timing of the cash payments. see note 19-income taxes to our consolidated financial statements included in item 8-financial statements and supplementary data of this report.
pending acquisitions. on june 24, 2021, we entered into a definitive agreement to acquire tink for €1.8 billion, inclusive of cash and retention incentives. this acquisition is subject to customary closing conditions, including regulatory reviews and approvals.
on july 22, 2021, we entered into a definitive agreement to acquire currencycloud for a value of £700 million, inclusive of cash and retention incentives. the financial consideration will be reduced by the outstanding equity of currencycloud that we already own. this acquisition is subject to customary closing conditions, including regulatory reviews and approvals. see note 2-acquisitions to our consolidated financial statements included in item 8-financial statements and supplementary data of this report.
other uses of cash. the following table represents material, expected or contractually committed future obligations as of september 30, 2021. we believe that we will be able to fund these obligations through cash generated from our operations and available credit facility.

critical accounting estimates our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america which require us to make judgments, assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported. see note 1-summary of significant accounting policies to our consolidated financial statements included in item 8-financial statements and supplementary data of this report. we have established policies and control procedures which seek to ensure that estimates and assumptions are appropriately governed and applied consistently from period to period. however, actual results could differ from our assumptions and estimates, and such differences could be material.
we believe that the following accounting estimates are the most critical to fully understand and evaluate our reported financial results, as they require our most subjective or complex management judgments, resulting from the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and unpredictable.
revenue recognition-client incentives critical estimates. we enter into long-term incentive agreements with financial institution clients, merchants and other business partners for various programs that provide cash and other incentives designed to increase revenue by growing payments volume, increasing visa product acceptance, winning merchant routing transactions over to our network and driving innovation. these incentives are primarily accounted for as reductions to net revenues; however, if a separate identifiable benefit at fair value can be established, they are accounted for as operating expenses. incentives are recognized systematically and rationally based on management's estimate of each client's performance. these estimates are regularly reviewed and adjusted as appropriate based on changes in performance expectations, actual client performance, amendments to existing contracts or the execution of new contracts.
assumptions and judgment. estimation of client incentives relies on forecasts of payments and transaction volume, card issuance and card conversion. performance is estimated using client-reported information, transactional information accumulated from our systems, historical information, market and economic conditions and discussions with our clients, merchants and business partners.
impact if actual results differ from assumptions. if actual performance is not consistent with our estimates, client incentives may be materially different than initially recorded. increases in incentive payments are generally driven by increased payments and transaction volume, which drive our net revenues. as a result, in the event incentive payments exceed estimates, such payments are not expected to have a material effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. the cumulative impact of a revision in estimates is recorded in the period such revisions become probable and estimable. for the year ended september 30, 2021, client incentives represented 26% of gross revenues.
table of contents legal and regulatory matters critical estimates. we are currently involved in various legal proceedings, the outcomes of which are not within our complete control or may not be known for prolonged periods of time. management is required to assess the probability of loss and estimate the amount of such loss, if any, in preparing our consolidated financial statements.
assumptions and judgment. we evaluate the likelihood of a potential loss from legal or regulatory proceedings to which we are a party. we record a liability for such claims when a loss is deemed probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated. significant judgment may be required in the determination of both probability and whether a potential loss is reasonably estimable. our judgments are subjective based on management's understanding of the litigation profile, the specifics of each case, our history with similar proceedings, advice of in-house and outside legal counsel to the extent appropriate and management's best estimate of incurred loss. as additional information becomes available, we reassess the potential loss related to pending claims and may revise our estimates.
we have entered into loss sharing agreements that reduce our potential liability under certain litigation. however, our u.s. retrospective responsibility plan only addresses monetary liabilities from settlements of, or final judgments in, the u.s. covered litigation. the plan's mechanisms include the use of the u.s. litigation escrow account. the accrual related to the u.s. covered litigation could be either higher or lower than the u.s. litigation escrow account balance. our europe retrospective responsibility plan only covers visa europe territory covered litigation (and resultant liabilities and losses) relating to the covered period, subject to certain limitations, and does not cover any fines or penalties incurred in the european commission proceedings or any other matter. see note 5-u.s. and europe retrospective responsibility plans and note 20-legal matters to our consolidated financial statements included in item 8-financial statements and supplementary data.
impact if actual results differ from assumptions. due to the inherent uncertainties of the legal and regulatory processes in the multiple jurisdictions in which we operate, our judgments may be materially different than the actual outcomes, which could have material adverse effects on our business, financial conditions and results of operations. see note 20-legal matters to our consolidated financial statements included in item 8-financial statements and supplementary data.
income taxes critical estimates. in calculating our effective income tax rate, we make judgments regarding certain tax positions, including the timing and amount of deductions and allocations of income among various tax jurisdictions.
assumptions and judgment. we have various tax filing positions with regard to the timing and amount of deductions and credits and the allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions, based on our interpretation of local tax laws. we also inventory, evaluate and measure all uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken on tax returns and to record liabilities for the amount of such positions that may not be sustained, or may only be partially sustained, upon examination by the relevant taxing authorities.
impact if actual results differ from assumptions. although we believe that our estimates and judgments are reasonable, actual results may differ from these estimates. some or all of these judgments are subject to review by the taxing authorities. if one or more of the taxing authorities were to successfully challenge our right to realize some or all of the tax benefit we have recorded, and we were unable to realize this benefit, it could have a material adverse effect on our financial results and cash flows.

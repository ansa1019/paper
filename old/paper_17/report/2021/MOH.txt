risk factors we are dependent on the leadership of our chief executive officer and other executive officers and key employees.
the success of our business and the ability to execute our strategy are highly dependent on the efforts of mr.
zubretsky, our chief executive officer, and our other key executive officers and employees. the loss of their leadership, expertise, and experience could negatively impact our operations. our ability to replace them or any other key employee may be difficult and may take an extended period of time because of the limited number of individuals in the healthcare industry who have the breadth and depth of skills and experience necessary to operate and lead a business such as ours. competition to hire from this limited pool is intense, and we may be unable to hire, train, retain, or motivate these personnel. if we are unsuccessful in recruiting, retaining, managing, and motivating such personnel, our business, financial condition, cash flows, or results of operations could be adversely affected.
we face claims related to litigation which could result in substantial monetary damages.
we are subject to a variety of legal actions, including provider claims, employment related disputes, healthcare regulatory law-based litigation and enforcement actions, breach of contract actions, qui tam or false claims act actions, and securities class actions. if we incur liability materially in excess of the amount for which we have insurance coverage, our profitability would suffer. even if any claims brought against us are unsuccessful or without merit, we may have to defend ourselves against such claims. the defense of any such actions may be time-
consuming and costly, and may distract our management's attention. such legal actions could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.
because our corporate headquarters are located in southern california, our business operations may be significantly disrupted as a result of a major earthquake or wildfire.
our corporate headquarters are located in long beach, california. in addition, some of our health plans' claims are processed in long beach, california. southern california is exposed to a statistically greater risk of a major earthquake and wildfires than most other parts of the united states. if a major earthquake or wildfire were to strike southern california, our corporate functions and claims processing could be significantly impaired for a substantial period of time. if there is a major southern california earthquake or wildfire, there can be no assurances that our disaster recovery plan will be successful or that the business operations of our health plans, including those that are remote from any such event, would not be substantially impacted.
failure to maintain effective internal controls over financial reporting could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, and stock price, and could subject us to sanctions by regulatory authorities.
a material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. we have identified material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting in the past, which have subsequently been remediated. if additional material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting are discovered or occur in the future, our consolidated financial statements may contain material misstatements and we could be required to restate our financial results.

properties we own and lease certain real properties to support the business operations of our reportable segments. while we believe our current and anticipated facilities are adequate to meet our operational needs in the near term, we continually evaluate the adequacy of our properties for our anticipated future needs.
legal proceedings kentucky rfp. on september 4, 2020, anthem kentucky managed care plan, inc. brought an action in franklin county circuit court against the kentucky finance and administration cabinet, the kentucky cabinet for health and family services, and all of the five winning bidder health plans, including our kentucky health plan. this matter remains subject to additional legal and appellate proceedings, and no assurances can be given regarding the ultimate outcome. under the court's june 16, 2021 final order, our kentucky health plan will continue to operate for the foreseeable future under its current medicaid contract and provide care to kentucky medicaid members.
puerto rico. on august 13, 2021, molina healthcare of puerto, inc. ("mhpr") filed a complaint asserting, among other claims, breach of contract against puerto rico health insurance administration ("ases"). on september 13,
2021, in addition to filing its answer to mhpr's complaint, ases filed a counterclaim and a third-party complaint against mhpr and the company. the counterclaim alleges that mhpr and the company breached contractual obligations by failing to pay providers and, in addition to damages, seeks various equitable remedies. on october 8, 2021, mhpr filed its reply to the counterclaim, denying all the allegations, and on november 1, 2021, the company filed its answer to the third-party complaint. on december 3, 2021, mhpr filed a request for disbursement of illegally withheld funds, and ases filed its opposition. at a status hearing on january 19, 2022, the company and ases both argued mhpr's request for disbursement. the court has not ruled. this matter is in its early stages, and no prediction can be made as to the outcome. no gain or loss is probable and reasonably estimable with regard to either mhpr's complaint or the counterclaim of ases.

stock trading symbol and dividends our common stock is listed on the new york stock exchange under the trading symbol "moh." as of february 11, 2022, there were 13 registered holders of record of our common stock, including cede & co. to date we have not paid cash dividends on our common stock. we currently intend to retain any future earnings to fund our projected business operations. however, we intend to periodically evaluate our cash position to determine whether to pay a cash dividend in the future. our ability to pay dividends is partially dependent on, among other things, our receipt of cash dividends from our regulated subsidiaries. the ability of our regulated subsidiaries to pay dividends to us is limited by the state departments of insurance in the states in which we operate or may operate, as well as requirements of the government-sponsored health programs in which we participate. additionally, the indentures governing our outstanding senior notes and credit agreement contain various covenants that limit our ability to pay dividends on our common stock. any future determination to pay dividends will be at the discretion of our board of directors and will depend upon, among other factors, our results of operations, financial condition, capital requirements and contractual and regulatory restrictions. for more information regarding restrictions on the ability of our regulated subsidiaries to pay dividends to us, please see the notes to consolidated financial statements, note 15, "commitments and contingencies-regulatory capital requirements and dividend restrictions."

overview molina healthcare, inc., a fortune 500 company (currently ranked 155), provides managed healthcare services under the medicaid and medicare programs, and through the state insurance marketplaces (the "marketplace"). we served approximately 5.2 million members as of december 31, 2021, located across 18 states.
2021 highlights highlights of our 2021 results included the following:
• net income for 2021 was $659 million, or $11.25 per diluted share, compared to $673 million, or $11.23 per diluted share, in 2020;
• total revenue of $27.8 billion, which increased 43% compared to 2020;
• premium revenue of $26.9 billion, which increased 47% compared to 2020;
• consolidated medical care ratio ("mcr") of 88.3%, compared to 86.5% in 2020;
• membership, increased 1.2 million members year-over-year to 5.2 million at december 31, 2021;
• general and administrative expense ratio ("g&a ratio") improved to 7.4%, compared to 7.6% in 2020; and
• after-tax margin of 2.4%.
the net effect of covid decreased 2021 net income per diluted share by $3.50 per diluted share and decreased 2020
net income per diluted share by $2.30. the net effect of covid impacted all three lines of business and increased the 2021 consolidated mcr by approximately 90 basis points, compared to an increase of approximately 50 basis points to the consolidated mcr in 2020. the net effect of covid reflects covid-related inpatient costs and covid-
related risk corridors enacted by a number of our state customers beginning in the second quarter of 2020, partially offset by a decrease in medical costs due to covid-related utilization curtailment.
growth initiatives we have made major strides related to our growth strategy. on october 7, 2021, we signed a definitive agreement to acquire the medicaid managed long term care business of agewell new york. on october 25, 2021, we closed on the acquisition of affinity health plan in new york. on january 1, 2022, we closed the acquisition of cigna corporation's texas medicaid and medicare-medicaid plan contracts, along with certain operating assets. each of these acquisitions involve financially underperforming health plans, but with stable membership and revenue bases.
we believe they provide attractive opportunities for margin improvement, operating leverage and membership growth.
our growth initiatives continue to be anchored by our capital allocation priorities: first, organic growth; second, inorganic growth through accretive acquisitions; and third, programmatically returning excess capital to stockholders.

consolidated results net income and operating income net income amounted to $659 million, or $11.25 per diluted share in 2021, compared with net income of $673 million, or $11.23 per diluted share, in 2020. we estimate that the net effect of covid decreased net income by approximately $3.50 per diluted share in 2021. in 2020, the net effect of covid decreased net income by approximately $2.30 per diluted share.
operating income was $1,020 million in 2021, compared with $1,078 million in 2020. the decrease in operating income was mainly due to the increase in mcr, reflecting increases in all our segments, and the $128 million marketplace risk corridor judgment received in 2020, partially offset by the favorable impact of membership growth and higher premium revenues.
net income per share in 2021 was favorably impacted by the reduction in common shares outstanding as a result of our share repurchase programs in 2020. see further discussion and information in "liquidity and financial condition," below, and in the notes to consolidated financial statements, note 3, "net income per share."
premium revenue premium revenue increased $8.6 billion, or 47%, in 2021, when compared with 2020. the higher premium revenue mainly reflects growth in membership across all segments in 2021.
membership increased by 1.2 million compared with december 31, 2020, which mainly reflected the impact of acquisitions that closed in the second half of 2020, including magellan complete care and the affinity acquisition that closed in the fourth quarter of 2021, and organic increases in the medicaid and marketplace segments. the lower impact of covid-related risk corridors in 2021, that were enacted in several states beginning in the second quarter of 2020 in response to covid-related utilization curtailment, also contributed to increase in premium revenue.
medical care ratio the consolidated mcr in 2021 increased to 88.3%, compared to 86.5% in 2020, and reflects increases in all our segments. the net effect of covid increased the consolidated mcr by approximately 90 basis points in 2021, and reflects higher covid inpatient costs, and lower covid-related utilization curtailment, partially offset by a lower impact of covid-related risk corridors. the net effect of covid impacted all our segments, but the year-over-year change was unfavorable for our medicare and marketplace segments. in 2020, the net effect of covid increased our consolidated mcr by approximately 50 basis points.
the prior year reserve development in 2021 was modestly favorable, but its impact on earnings was mostly absorbed by the covid-related risk corridors.
premium tax revenue and expenses the premium tax ratio decreased to 2.8% in 2021, compared with 3.4% in 2020. the current year ratio decrease was mainly due to the changes in business mix resulting from the magellan complete care and other acquisitions closed in the second half of 2020.
marketplace risk corridor judgment in june 2020, the u.s. court of federal claims granted us judgment in the amount of $128 million for 2014, 2015, and 2016 marketplace risk corridor claims, following a favorable u.s. supreme court decision in april 2020 which held section 1342 of the affordable care act obligated the federal government to pay participating insurers the full marketplace risk corridor amounts calculated by that statute. we received the judgment in october 2020 and, consistent with the timing of the cash receipt, the gain was recognized in our fourth quarter 2020 financial results and reported in "marketplace risk corridor judgment" in our consolidated statements of income. the judgment did not create additional minimum mlr rebates.
investment income investment income decreased to $52 million in 2021, compared with $59 million in 2020. the year-over-year decrease was due to the continued low interest rate environment and a temporarily higher allocation in shorter-term invested assets during the covid-19 pandemic, which was rescinded effective for the second quarter of 2021.

other revenue other revenue increased to $77 million in 2021, compared with $17 million in 2020. beginning in the first quarter of 2021, other revenue includes service revenue associated with the long-term services and supports consultative services we now provide in wisconsin, as a result of our magellan complete care acquisition.
general and administrative ("g&a") expenses the g&a expense ratio decreased slightly to 7.4% in 2021 compared with 7.6% in 2020. the year over year decrease reflects the benefits of scale produced by our growth and our disciplined cost management, partially offset by appropriate investments to support our business growth and increased acquisition-related expenses.
health insurer fees ("hif")
there were no hif fees incurred or reimbursed in 2021, because the hif was repealed effective for years after 2020.
depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization increased to $131 million in 2021, compared with $88 million in 2020. the increase was due primarily to amortization associated with acquisitions completed in the second half of 2020 and 2021.
other operating expenses other operating expenses increased to $61 million in the year ended december 31, 2021, compared with $31 million in the year ended december 31, 2020. beginning in the first quarter of 2021, other operating expenses include service costs associated with the long-term services and supports consultative services we now provide in wisconsin, as noted above.
interest expense interest expense increased to $120 million in 2021, compared with $102 million in 2020, mainly due to higher levels of average outstanding debt, resulting from the net impact of financing activities in both 2020 and 2021.
other expenses (income), net in 2021, we recognized a loss on debt repayment of $25 million in connection with early redemption of our 5.375%
notes. in 2020, we recognized a loss on debt repayment of $15 million, in connection with repayment of our term loan facility and other financing transactions.
income taxes income tax expense amounted to $216 million in 2021, or 24.7% of pretax income, compared with income tax expense of
$288 million in 2020, or 30.0% of the pretax income. the effective tax rate is lower in 2021 mainly because the nondeductible hif was repealed for years after 2020.
reportable segments as of december 31, 2021, we served approximately 5.2 million members eligible for medicaid, medicare, and other government-sponsored healthcare programs for low-income families and individuals, including marketplace members, most of whom receive government premium subsidies.
in the first quarter of 2021, we realigned our reportable operating segments to reflect recent changes in our internal operating and reporting structure, which is now organized by government program. these reportable segments consist of: 1) medicaid; 2) medicare; 3) marketplace; and 4) other.
the medicaid, medicare, and marketplace segments represent the government-funded or sponsored programs under which we offer managed healthcare services. the other segment, which is insignificant to our consolidated results of operations, includes certain corporate amounts not associated with or allocated to the medicaid, medicare, or marketplace segments. additionally, the other segment includes service revenues and service costs associated with the long-term services and supports consultative services we now provide in wisconsin, as a result of the magellan complete care acquisition on december 31, 2020.

how we assess performance we derive our revenues primarily from health insurance premiums. our primary customers are state medicaid agencies and the federal government.
the key metrics used to assess the performance of our medicaid, medicare, and marketplace segments are premium revenue, medical margin and mcr. mcr represents the amount of medical care costs as a percentage of premium revenue. therefore, the underlying medical margin, or the amount earned by the medicaid, medicare, and marketplace segments after medical costs are deducted from premium revenue, represents the most important measure of earnings reviewed by management, and is used by our chief executive officer to review results, assess performance, and allocate resources. the key metric used to assess the performance of our other segment is service margin. the service margin is equal to service revenue minus cost of service revenue.
management's discussion and analysis of the change in medical margin is discussed below under "segment financial performance." for more information, see notes to consolidated financial statements, note 16, "segments."
trends and uncertainties for a discussion of the trends, uncertainties and other developments that affected our reportable segments during the year, refer to "item 1. business-our business," "-covid-19 pandemic," "-legislative and political environment,"
"-operations-medical management," and "-regulation."

medicaid medicaid premium revenue increased $6.2 billion in 2021, when compared with 2020, mainly due to the impact from the magellan complete care, and other acquisitions closed in the second half of 2020, the affinity acquisition that closed in the fourth quarter of 2021, and organic membership growth. excluding acquisitions, membership growth occurred across nearly all our states and was mainly driven by the extension of the phe period and the associated suspension of membership redeterminations. also contributing to the overall premium revenue increase was a lower impact of covid-related risk corridors in 2021 compared to 2020.

to the lower utilization of medical services resulting from covid-19. we recognized $564 million related to covid-
related risk corridors in 2020, mainly related to medicaid.
the medical margin of our medicaid program increased $518 million, or 29%, in 2021 when compared with 2020. the increase was driven by increased premium revenues and margin associated with the membership growth discussed above, partially offset by the mcr increase discussed below.
the medicaid mcr increased to 88.7% in 2021, from 87.4% in 2020, or 130 basis points. the increase in the medicaid mcr in 2021 was mainly due to business mix changes, partially offset by continued medical cost management and a year-over-year decrease in the net effect of covid. the year-over-year change in impact of the net effect of covid reflects the decrease in covid-related risk corridors discussed above, partially offset by an increase in covid-
related inpatient costs, and lower covid-related utilization curtailment. the medicaid mcr is consistent with our long-term target despite the net effect of covid.
medicare medicare premium revenue increased $849 million in 2021, when compared with 2020, primarily due to the impact of higher membership, mainly from the magellan complete care acquisition, and higher premium revenue pmpm.
the medical margin for medicare increased $79 million, or 23%, in 2021 when compared with 2020. the year-over-year increase in margin is driven by the increase in premium revenue from higher volume, partially offset by the mcr increase discussed below.
the medicare mcr increased to 87.2% in 2021, from 86.0% in 2020, or 120 basis points. the increase was primarily driven by the net effect of covid, including higher direct covid medical costs, resulting from higher infection rates in our medicare population. the net effect of covid had a negligible impact on the mcr in 2020. the medicare mcr is in line with our long-term target despite the net effect of covid.
marketplace marketplace premium revenue increased $1.5 billion in 2021, when compared with 2020, mainly due to higher membership, partially offset by a decrease in premium revenue pmpm. our marketplace membership as of december 31,
2021, amounted to 728,000 members, representing growth of 410,000 members year over year, and substantially exceeding our expectations. this improvement resulted from several factors, including strong product design and competitive pricing, better than expected natural attrition rates, and the extended special enrollment period. the decrease in premium revenue pmpm was mainly driven by changes in business mix, with an increase of members in the bronze metal tier.
the marketplace medical margin increased $75 million in 2021, primarily due to the increase in membership and premiums, mostly offset by an increase in the mcr compared to 2020.
the marketplace mcr increased to 86.9% in 2021, compared to 78.7% in 2020, or 820 basis points. the increase in mcr resulted mainly from a higher net effect of covid, due to continued covid utilization pressure in our largest marketplace geographies, and increased non-covid medical costs by members enrolled through the special enrollment period. special enrollment period membership grew to almost 40% of our marketplace book by the fourth quarter, and many of the new members that we attracted in 2021 were in regions disproportionately affected by covid, particularly in texas. moreover, we attracted a large number of members through the special enrollment period, and those members experienced higher non-covid utilization in addition to covid-related costs.
other the other segment includes service revenues and costs associated with the long-term services and supports consultative services we now provide in wisconsin as a result of our magellan complete care acquisition, and also includes certain corporate amounts not allocated to the medicaid, medicare, or marketplace segments. such amounts were immaterial to our consolidated results of operations for 2021 and 2020.
liquidity and financial condition liquidity we manage our cash, investments, and capital structure to meet the short- and long-term obligations of our business while maintaining liquidity and financial flexibility. we forecast, analyze, and monitor our cash flows to enable prudent investment management and financing within the confines of our financial strategy.

we maintain liquidity at two levels: 1) the regulated health plan subsidiaries; and 2) the parent company.
our regulated health plan subsidiaries' primary liquidity requirements include payment of medical claims and other health care services; payment of certain settlements with our state and federal customers, such as mlr and risk corridors and marketplace risk transfers on behalf of cms; general and administrative costs directly incurred or paid through an administrative services agreement to the parent company; and federal tax payments to the parent company under an intercompany tax sharing agreement. our regulated health plan subsidiaries meet their liquidity needs by generating cash flows from operating activities, primarily from premium revenue; cash flows from investing activities, including investment income and sales of investments; and capital contributions received from our parent company.
our regulated health plan subsidiaries generally receive premiums in advance of payments of claims for medical and other health care services; however, cash and cash equivalents in regulated health plan subsidiaries can fluctuate significantly in a particular period depending on the timing of receipts for premiums from our government partners.
any decline or delay in receipt of premium revenue could have a negative impact on our liquidity. we did not experience noticeable delays to, or changes in, the timing or level of premium receipts in 2021 as a result of the covid-19 pandemic, but there can be no assurance that we will not experience such delays in the future. see further discussion below in "future sources and uses of liquidity-future uses- potential impact of covid-19 pandemic ."
our regulated health plan subsidiaries are each subject to applicable state regulations that, among other things, require the maintenance of minimum levels of capital and surplus. we continue to maintain appropriate levels of aggregate excess statutory capital and surplus in our regulated health plan subsidiaries. see further discussion under "regulatory capital and dividend restrictions" below. when available and as permitted by applicable regulations, cash in excess of the capital needs of our regulated health plan subsidiaries is generally paid in the form of dividends to our parent company to be used for general corporate purposes. the regulated health plan subsidiaries paid dividends to the parent company amounting to $564 million in 2021 and $635 million in 2020.
parent company liquidity requirements generally consist of payment of administrative costs not directly incurred by our regulated operations, including, but not limited to, staffing costs, lease payments, branding and certain information technology services; capital contributions paid to our regulated health plan subsidiaries, including funding for newer health plans; capital expenditures; debt service; funding for common stock purchases, acquisitions and other growth-related activities; and federal tax payments. the parent company contributed capital of $440 million and $107 million in 2021 and 2020, respectively, to our regulated health plan subsidiaries to satisfy statutory capital and surplus requirements. the increased contributions in 2021 were mainly attributed to fund growth in our new york and kentucky health plans. our parent company normally meets its liquidity requirements by earning administrative services fees under administrative services agreements; dividends received from our regulated subsidiaries; collecting federal tax payments from the regulated subsidiaries; proceeds from issuance of debt and equity securities; and cash flows from investing activities, including investment income and sales of investments.
cash, cash equivalents and investments at the parent company amounted to $348 million and $644 million as of december 31, 2021, and 2020, respectively. the decrease in 2021 was due to cash used for acquisitions and share repurchases, partially offset by dividends received from regulated health plan subsidiaries. in the first quarter of 2021, we purchased an aggregate of approximately 577,000 shares for $122 million, and we also paid $6 million to settle shares purchased in late december 2020.
investments after considering expected cash flows from operating activities, we generally invest cash of regulated subsidiaries that exceeds our expected short-term obligations in longer term, investment-grade, and marketable debt securities to improve our overall investment return. these investments are made pursuant to board-approved investment policies which conform to applicable state laws and regulations.
our investment policies are designed to provide liquidity, preserve capital, and maximize total return on invested assets, all in a manner consistent with state requirements that prescribe the types of instruments in which our subsidiaries may invest. these investment policies require that our investments have final maturities of less than
10 years, or less than 10 years average life for structured securities. professional portfolio managers operating under documented guidelines manage our investments and a portion of our cash equivalents. our portfolio managers must obtain our prior approval before selling investments where the loss position of those investments exceeds certain levels.

we believe that the risks of the covid-19 pandemic, as they relate to our investments, are minimal. the overall rating of our portfolio is aa. our investment policy has directives in conjunction with state guidelines to minimize risks and exposures in volatile markets. additionally, our portfolio managers assist us in navigating the current volatility in the capital markets.
our restricted investments are invested principally in cash, cash equivalents, and u.s. treasury securities; we have the ability to hold such restricted investments until maturity. all of our unrestricted investments are classified as current assets.
cash flow activities our cash flows are summarized as follows:

cash equivalents operating activities we typically receive capitation payments monthly, in advance of payments for medical claims; however, government payors may adjust their payment schedules, positively or negatively impacting our reported cash flows from operating activities in any given period. for example, government payors may delay our premium payments, or they may prepay the following month's premium payment.
net cash provided by operations was $2.1 billion in 2021, compared with $1.9 billion of net cash provided in 2020.
the $221 million increase in cash flow was due to the growth in operations and the net impact of timing differences in government receivables and payables.
investing activities net cash used in investing activities was $1.7 billion in 2021, compared with $400 million of net cash used in
2020, a decrease in year-over-year cash flow of $1.3 billion. this change in cash flow was primarily due to increased purchases of investments in 2021, after a temporarily higher allocation in shorter-term invested assets during the covid-19 pandemic was rescinded in the second quarter of 2021.
financing activities net cash used in financing activities was $183 million in 2021, compared with $217 million of net cash provided by
2020, a decrease in year-over-year cash flow of $400 million. in 2021, cash inflows included $740 million from the issuance of the 3.875% notes due 2032, and cash outflows included $723 million in repayment of the 5.375% notes due
2022, common stock purchases of $128 million and $53 million for common stock withheld to settle employee tax obligations. additionally, we paid $23 million to settle contingent consideration liabilities relating to our kentucky passport acquisition that closed in 2020, $20 million of which has been presented as a financing cash outflow. in the year ended december 31, 2020, financing cash inflows included $1,429 million from the issuance of the 4.375% notes due 2028 and 3.875% notes due 2030 and $380 million borrowed under the term loan facility. cash outflows included the $600 million repayment of the term loan facility, common stock purchases of $606 million, which included $7 million to settle shares purchased in late december 2019, and net cash paid for the senior notes-
related transactions amounting to $380 million.
financial condition we believe that our cash resources, borrowing capacity available under our credit agreement as discussed further below in "future sources and uses of liquidity-future sources," and internally generated funds will be sufficient to support our operations, regulatory requirements, debt repayment obligations and capital expenditures for at least the next 12 months.
on a consolidated basis, as of december 31, 2021, our working capital was $3.0 billion compared with $2.9 billion as of december 31, 2020. at december 31, 2021, our cash and investments amounted to $7.9 billion, compared with
$6.2 billion of cash and investments at december 31, 2020.

because of the statutory restrictions that inhibit the ability of our health plan subsidiaries to transfer net assets to us, the amount of retained earnings readily available to pay dividends to our stockholders is generally limited to cash, cash equivalents and investments held by our unregulated parent. for more information, see the
"liquidity" discussion presented above.
regulatory capital and dividend restrictions each of our regulated, wholly owned subsidiaries must maintain a minimum amount of statutory capital determined by statute or regulations. such statutes, regulations and capital requirements also restrict the timing, payment and amount of dividends and other distributions, loans or advances that may be paid to us as the sole stockholder. to the extent our subsidiaries must comply with these regulations, they may not have the financial flexibility to transfer funds to us. based upon current statutes and regulations, the minimum capital and surplus requirement for these subsidiaries was estimated to be approximately $2.1 billion at december 31, 2021, compared with $1.5 billion at december 31, 2020. the aggregate capital and surplus of our wholly owned subsidiaries was in excess of these minimum capital requirements as of both dates.
under applicable regulatory requirements, the amount of dividends that may be paid by our wholly owned subsidiaries without prior approval by regulatory authorities as of december 31, 2021, was approximately $197 million in the aggregate. the subsidiaries may pay dividends over this amount, but only after approval is granted by the regulatory authorities.
based on our cash and investments balances as of december 31, 2021, management believes that our regulated wholly owned subsidiaries remain well capitalized and exceed their regulatory minimum requirements. we have the ability, and have committed to provide, additional capital to each of our health plans as necessary to ensure compliance with statutory capital and surplus requirements.
capital structure in september 2021, our board of directors authorized the purchase of up to $500 million, in the aggregate, of our common stock. this new program immediately supersedes the stock purchase program previously approved by our board of directors in september 2020. this new program will be funded with cash on hand and extends through december 31,
2022.
as debt held by the parent company comes due, we typically engage in a new private offering of debt to retire and replace the prior issuance. over the last several years we have seen a continued decline in interest rates, which has benefited our overall cost of capital during that time. there is no guarantee that the interest rate environment will continue to see declines in interest rates in the future, and future refinancing may occur at a higher rate than those we have achieved historically. this could increase our cost of capital in the future or cause us to pursue alternative financing sources, should the need arise.
we are not a party to any off-balance sheet financing arrangements.
debt ratings each of our senior notes is rated "bb-" by standard & poor's, and "ba3" by moody's investor service, inc. a downgrade in our ratings could adversely affect our borrowing capacity and increase our borrowing costs.
financial covenants the credit agreement contains customary non-financial and financial covenants, including a net leverage ratio and an interest coverage ratio. such ratios are computed as defined by the terms of the credit agreement.
in addition, the indentures governing each of our outstanding senior notes contain cross-default provisions that are triggered upon default by us or any of our subsidiaries on any indebtedness in excess of the amount specified in the applicable indenture. as of december 31, 2021, we were in compliance with all financial and non-financial covenants under the credit agreement and other long-term debt.
future sources and uses of liquidity future sources our regulated subsidiaries generate significant cash flows from premium revenue, which is generally received a short time before related healthcare services are paid. premium revenue is our primary source of liquidity. thus, any decline in the receipt of premium revenue, and our profitability, could have a negative impact on our liquidity.

potential impact of covid-19 pandemic . excluding acquisitions and our exit from puerto rico, we have added approximately 750,000 new medicaid members since march 31, 2020, when we first began to report on the impacts of the pandemic. we believe this membership increase was mainly due to the suspension of redeterminations for medicaid eligibility. we expect medicaid enrollment to continue to benefit from the extension of the phe period, and the associated pause on membership redeterminations, at least through mid-april 2022.
dividends from subsidiaries. when available and as permitted by applicable regulations, cash in excess of the capital needs of our regulated health plans is generally paid in the form of dividends to our unregulated parent company to be used for general corporate purposes. as a result of the covid-19 pandemic, state regulators could restrict the ability of our regulated health plan subsidiaries to pay dividends to the parent company, which could reduce the liquidity of the parent company. for more information on our regulatory capital requirements and dividend restrictions, refer to notes to consolidated financial statements, note 15, "commitments and contingencies-regulatory capital requirements and dividend restrictions," and note 17, "condensed financial information of registrant-note c - dividends and capital contributions."
credit agreement borrowing capacity. as of december 31, 2021, we had available borrowing capacity of $1 billion under the revolving credit facility of our credit agreement. in addition, the credit agreement provides for a $15
million swingline sub-facility and a $100 million letter of credit sub-facility, as well as incremental term loans available to finance certain acquisitions up to $500 million, plus an unlimited amount of such term loans as long as we maintain a minimum consolidated net leverage ratio. see further discussion in the notes to consolidated financial statements, note 11, "debt."
future uses common stock purchases. in september 2021, our board of directors authorized the purchase of up to $500 million, in the aggregate, of our common stock. this new program immediately supersedes the stock purchase program previously approved by our board of directors in september 2020. this new program will be funded with cash on hand and extends through december 31, 2022. the exact timing and amount of any repurchase is determined by management based on market conditions and share price, in addition to other factors, and subject to the restrictions relating to volume, price, and timing under applicable law. as of february 14, 2022, $500 million remained available to purchase our common stock under this program through december 31, 2022. see further information in the notes to consolidated financial statements, note 13, "stockholders' equity."
acquisitions . we have a disciplined and steady approach to growth. organic growth, which includes leveraging our existing health plan portfolio and winning new territories, is our highest priority. in addition to organic growth, we will consider targeted acquisitions that are a strategic fit that we believe will leverage operational synergies, and lead to incremental earnings accretion. for further information on our acquisitions, refer to the notes to consolidated financial statements, note 4, "business combinations."
on october 7, 2021, we announced a definitive agreement to acquire the medicaid managed long term care business of agewell new york. as of august 31, 2021, agewell served approximately 13,000 managed long-term services and supports members, with full-year 2020 premium revenue of approximately $700 million. the purchase price for the transaction is approximately $106 million, net of certain tax benefits and target allocation of required regulatory capital, which we intend to fund with cash on hand. the transaction is subject to applicable federal and state regulatory approvals and the satisfaction of other customary closing conditions. we currently expect the transaction to close by the third quarter of 2022.
potential impact of covid-19 pandemic . as described in "item 1. business-covid-19 pandemic," we have been subject to medicaid risk corridors as a result of the pandemic. beginning in 2020, through december 31, 2021, various states enacted temporary risk corridors in response to the reduced demand for medical services stemming from covid-19, which have resulted in a reduction of our medical margin, primarily in the medicaid segment. in some cases, these risk corridors were retroactive to earlier periods in 2020, or as early as the beginning of the states' fiscal years in 2019. beginning in the second quarter of 2020, we have recognized retroactive risk corridors that we believe to be probable, and where the ultimate premium amount is reasonably estimable. we recognized approximately $323 million, in the aggregate, related to such risk corridors, in 2021, and approximately
$564 million, in the aggregate, was recognized in 2020.
it is possible that certain states could change the structure of existing risk corridors, implement new risk corridors in the future or discontinue existing risk corridors. due to these uncertainties, the ultimate outcomes could differ materially from our estimates as a result of changes in facts or further developments, which could have an adverse effect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.

regulatory capital requirements and dividend restrictions. we have the ability, and have committed to provide, additional capital to each of our health plans as necessary to ensure compliance with minimum statutory capital requirements.
the molina healthcare charitable foundation. in august 2020, we announced our commitment of $150 million to fund the molina healthcare charitable foundation (the "foundation"), an independent not-for-profit charitable foundation. we contributed $15 million to the foundation in the fourth quarter of 2020.
contractual obligations. we are party to various contractual obligations that we will be required to satisfy over the short and long term. the majority are discussed in the notes to consolidated financial statements and primarily include the following: medical claims and benefits payable, amounts due to government agencies, principal and interest on our debt and leases. some items are based on management's estimates and assumptions about obligations, including duration, the possibility of renewal, anticipated actions by third parties, and other factors. because these estimates and assumptions are necessarily subjective, the contractual obligations we will actually pay in future periods may vary. additionally, we have a variety of other contractual agreements related to acquiring services used in our operations. however, we believe these other agreements do not contain material non-cancelable commitments.
critical accounting estimates when we prepare our consolidated financial statements, we use estimates and assumptions that may affect reported amounts and disclosures. actual results could differ from these estimates, and some differences could be material.
our most significant accounting estimates, which include a higher degree of judgment and/or complexity, include the following:
• medical claims and benefits payable. see discussion below, and refer to the notes to consolidated financial statements, notes 2, "significant accounting policies," and 10, "medical claims and benefits payable" for more information.
• contractual provisions that may adjust or limit revenue or profit. for a discussion of this topic, including amounts recorded in our consolidated financial statements, refer to the notes to consolidated financial statements, note 2, "significant accounting policies."
• quality incentives. for a discussion of this topic, refer to the notes to consolidated financial statements, note
2, "significant accounting policies."
• business combinations, and goodwill and intangible assets, net. for a comprehensive discussion of this topic, including amounts recorded in our consolidated financial statements, refer to the notes to consolidated financial statements, note 2, "significant accounting policies," note 4, "business combinations," and note 9, "goodwill and intangible assets, net."
medical care costs, medical claims and benefits payable medical care costs are recognized in the period in which services are provided and include fee-for-service claims, pharmacy benefits, capitation payments to providers, and various other medically-related costs. under fee-for-
service claims arrangements with providers, we retain the financial responsibility for medical care provided and incur costs based on actual utilization of hospital and physician services. such medical care costs include amounts paid by us as well as estimated medical claims and benefits payable for costs that were incurred but not paid as of the reporting date ("ibnp"). pharmacy benefits represent payments for members' prescription drug costs, net of rebates from drug manufacturers. we estimate pharmacy rebates based on historical and current utilization of prescription drugs and contractual provisions. capitation payments represent monthly contractual fees paid to providers, who are responsible for providing medical care to members, which could include medical or ancillary costs like dental, vision and other supplemental health benefits. such capitation costs are fixed in advance of the periods covered and are not subject to significant accounting estimates. other medical care costs include all medically-related administrative costs, amounts due to providers pursuant to risk-sharing or other incentive arrangements, provider claims, and other healthcare expenses. examples of medically-related administrative costs include expenses relating to health education, quality assurance, case management, care coordination, disease management, and 24-hour on-call nurses. additionally, we include an estimate for the cost of settling claims incurred through the reporting date in our medical claims and benefits payable liability.

the following table illustrates consolidated medical care costs by type for the periods indicated:

medical claims and benefits payable consist mainly of fee-for-service ibnp, unpaid pharmacy claims, capitation costs, other medical costs, including amounts payable to providers pursuant to risk-sharing or other incentive arrangements and amounts payable to providers on behalf of certain state agencies for certain state assessments in which we assume no financial risk. ibnp includes the costs of claims incurred as of the balance sheet date which have been reported to us, and our best estimate of the cost of claims incurred but not yet reported to us. we also include an additional reserve to ensure that our overall ibnp liability is sufficient under moderately adverse conditions. we reflect changes in these estimates in the consolidated results of operations in the period in which they are determined.
the estimation of the ibnp liability requires a significant degree of judgment in applying actuarial methods, determining the appropriate assumptions and considering numerous factors. of those factors, we consider estimated completion factors (measures the cumulative percentage of claims expense that will ultimately be paid for a given month of service based on historical payment patterns) and the assumed healthcare cost trend (the year-over-year change in per-member per-month medical care costs) to be the most critical assumptions. other relevant factors also include, but are not limited to, healthcare service utilization trends, claim inventory levels, changes in membership, product mix, seasonality, benefit changes or changes in fee schedules, provider contract changes, prior authorizations and the incidence of catastrophic or pandemic cases.
for claims incurred more than three months before the financial statement date, we mainly use estimated completion factors to estimate the ultimate cost of those claims. completion factors measure the cumulative percentage of claims expense that will ultimately be paid for a given month of service based on historical claims payment patterns. we analyze historical claims payment patterns by comparing claim incurred dates to claim payment dates to estimate completion factors. the estimated completion factors are then applied to claims paid through the financial statement date to estimate the ultimate claims cost for a given month's incurred claim activity. the difference between the estimated ultimate claims cost and the claims paid through the financial statement date represents our estimate of claims remaining to be paid as of the financial statement date and is included in our ibnp liability .
for claims incurred within three months before the financial statement date, actual claims paid are a less reliable measure of our ultimate cost since a large portion of medical claims are not submitted to us until several months after services have been submitted. accordingly, we estimate our ibnp liability for claims incurred during these months based on a blend of estimated completion factors and assumed medical care cost trend. the assumed medical care cost trend represents the year-over-year change in per-member per-month medical care costs, which can be affected by many factors including, but not limited to, our ability and practices to manage medical and pharmaceutical costs, changes in level and mix of services utilized, mix of benefits offered, including the impact of co-pays and deductibles, changes in medical practices, changes in member demographics, catastrophes and epidemics , and other relevant factors.
actuarial standards of practice generally require a level of confidence such that our overall best estimate of the ibnp liability has a greater probability of being adequate versus being insufficient, where the liability is sufficient to account for moderately adverse conditions. adverse conditions are situations that may cause actual claims to be higher than the otherwise estimated value of such claims at the time of the estimate, such as changes in the magnitude or severity of claims, uncertainties related to our entry into new geographical markets or provision of services to new populations, changes in state-controlled fee schedules, and modifications or upgrades to our claims processing systems and practices. therefore, in many situations, the claim amounts ultimately settled will be less than the estimate that satisfies the actuarial standards of practice.

when subsequent actual claims payments are less than we estimated, we recognize a benefit for favorable prior period development that is reported as part of "components of medical care costs related to: "prior years" in the table presented in note 10, "medical claims and benefits payable." our reserving practice is to consistently recognize the actuarial best estimate including a provision for moderately adverse conditions for each current period. this provision is reported as part of "components of medical care costs related to: current year" in the table presented in note 10. assuming stability in the size of our membership, the use of this consistent methodology, during any given period, usually results in the replenishment of reserves at a level that generally offsets the benefit of favorable prior period development in that period. in the case of material growth or decline of membership, replenishment can exceed or fall short of the favorable development, assuming all other factors remain unchanged.
because of the significant degree of judgment involved in estimation of our ibnp liability, there is considerable variability and uncertainty inherent in such estimates. the following table reflects the hypothetical change in our estimate of claims liability as of december 31, 2021 that would result if we change our completion factors for the fourth through the twelfth months preceding december 31, 2021, by the percentages indicated. a reduction in the completion factor results in an increase in medical claims liabilities. dollar amounts are in millions.

there are many related factors working in conjunction with one another that determine the accuracy of our estimates, some of which are qualitative in nature rather than quantitative. therefore, we are seldom able to quantify the impact that any single factor has on a change in estimate. given the variability inherent in the reserving process, we will only be able to identify specific factors if they represent a significant departure from expectations. as a result, we do not expect to be able to fully quantify the impact of individual factors on changes in estimates.
recently issued accounting standards refer to the notes to consolidated financial statements, note 2, "significant accounting policies," for a discussion of recent accounting pronouncements that affect us.

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our earnings and financial position are exposed to financial market risk relating to changes in interest rates, and the resulting impact on investment income and interest expense.
substantially all of our investments and restricted investments are subject to interest rate risk and will decrease in value if market interest rates increase. assuming a hypothetical and immediate 1% increase in market interest rates at december 31, 2021, the fair value of our fixed income investments would decrease by approximately $69
million. declines in interest rates over time will reduce our investment income.
for further information on fair value measurements and our investment portfolio, please refer to the notes to consolidated financial statements, note 5, "fair value measurements," and note 6, "investments."
borrowings under the credit agreement bear interest based, at our election, on a base rate or other defined rate, plus, in each case, the applicable margin. for further information, see notes to consolidated financial statements, note 11, "debt."

notes to consolidated financial statements
1. organization and basis of presentation organization and operations molina healthcare, inc. provides managed healthcare services under the medicaid and medicare programs, and through the state insurance marketplaces (the "marketplace"). in the first quarter of 2021, we realigned our reportable operating segments to reflect recent changes in our internal operating and reporting structure, which is now organized by government program. these reportable segments consist of: 1) medicaid; 2) medicare; 3) marketplace;
and 4) other. for further information, refer to note 16, "segments."
as of december 31, 2021, we served approximately 5.2million members eligible for government-sponsored healthcare programs, located across 18states.
our state medicaid contracts typically have terms of threeto five years, contain renewal options exercisable by the state medicaid agency, and allow either the state or the health plan to terminate the contract with or without cause. such contracts are subject to risk of loss in states that issue requests for proposal ("rfp") open to competitive bidding by other health plans. if one of our health plans is not a successful responsive bidder to a state rfp, its contract may not be renewed.
in addition to contract renewal, our state medicaid contracts may be periodically amended to include or exclude certain health benefits (such as pharmacy services, behavioral health services, or long-term care services);
populations such as the aged, blind or disabled ("abd"); and regions or service areas.
recent developments texas acquisition - medicaid and medicare. on january 1, 2022, we closed on our acquisition of cigna corporation's texas medicaid and medicare-medicaid plan ("mmp") contracts, along with certain operating assets. see note 4,
"business combinations," for further information.
new york acquisition - medicaid . on october 25, 2021, we closed on our acquisition of substantially all of the assets of affinity health plan, inc., a medicaid health plan in new york. as a result, we added approximately
310,000members in new york. see note 4, "business combinations," for further information.
new york acquisition-medicaid. on october 7, 2021, we announced a definitive agreement to acquire the medicaid managed long term care business of agewell new york ("agewell"). as of august 31, 2021, agewell served approximately 13,000managed long-term services and supports members, with full-year 2020 premium revenue of approximately $ 700million. the purchase price for the transaction is approximately $ 106million, net of certain tax benefits and target allocation of required regulatory capital, which we intend to fund with cash on hand. the transaction is subject to applicable federal and state regulatory approvals and the satisfaction of other customary closing conditions. we currently expect the transaction to close by the third quarter of 2022.
nevada procurement-medicaid. on august 17, 2021, we announced that our nevada health plan subsidiary was selected as an awardee in clark and washoe counties. this new contract commenced on january 1, 2022, and offers health coverage to tanf, chip and medicaid expansion beneficiaries. the four yearcontract with a possible two yearextension was ratified in september 2021.
ohio procurement-medicaid. on april 13, 2021, we announced that our ohio health plan subsidiary was selected as an awardee in all three regions across the state pursuant to the medicaid managed care request for award issued on september 30, 2020, by the ohio department of medicaid. this new contract is expected to begin july 1, 2022, and will offer health care coverage to medicaid beneficiaries through the state of ohio's covered family and children, expansion, and abd programs.
consolidation and presentation the consolidated financial statements include the accounts of molina healthcare, inc., and its subsidiaries. all significant inter-company balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. financial information related to subsidiaries acquired during any year is included only for periods subsequent to their acquisition. in the opinion of management, all adjustments considered necessary for a fair presentation of the results as of the date and for the periods presented have been included; such adjustments consist of normal recurring adjustments.

reclassifications consistent with the change in reportable segments described above, certain prior year disclosures in note 9,
"goodwill and intangible assets, net," note 10, "medical claims and benefits payable," and note 16, "segments,"
have been recast to conform to the current year presentation.
certain immaterial amounts presented in the accompanying consolidated statement of cash flows for the years ended december 31, 2020 and 2019, have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation.
use of estimates the preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with u.s. generally accepted accounting principles ("gaap") requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities. estimates also affect the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. actual results could differ from these estimates.
2. significant accounting policies cash and cash equivalents cash and cash equivalents consist of cash and short-term, highly liquid investments that are both readily convertible into known amounts of cash and have a maturity of three months or less on the date of purchase. the following table provides a reconciliation of cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash and cash equivalents reported within the accompanying consolidated balance sheets that sum to the total of the same such amounts presented in the accompanying consolidated statements of cash flows. the restricted cash and cash equivalents presented below are included in "restricted investments" in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.

presented in the consolidated statements of cash flows investments our investments are principally held in debt securities, which are grouped into two separate categories for accounting and reporting purposes: available-for-sale securities, and held-to-maturity securities. available-for-
sale ("afs") securities are recorded at fair value and unrealized gains and losses, if any, are recorded in stockholders' equity as other comprehensive income, net of applicable income taxes. held-to-maturity ("htm")
securities are recorded at amortized cost, which approximates fair value, and unrealized holding gains or losses are not generally recognized. realized gains and losses and unrealized losses arising from credit-related factors with respect to afs and htm securities are included in the determination of net income. the cost of securities sold is determined using the specific-identification method.
our investment policy requires that all of our investments have final maturities of less than 10years, or less than
10years average life for structured securities. investments and restricted investments are subject to interest rate risk and will decrease in value if market rates increase. declines in interest rates over time will reduce our investment income.
in general, our afs securities are classified as current assets without regard to the securities' contractual maturity dates because they may be readily liquidated. we monitor our investments for credit-related impairment.for comprehensive discussions of the fair value and classification of our investments, see note 5, "fair value measurements," and note 6, "investments."
accrued interest receivable relating to our afs and htm securities is presented within "prepaid expenses and other current assets" in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets, and amounted to $ 11million and $ 10million at december 31, 2021, and 2020, respectively. we do not measure an allowance for credit losses on accrued interest receivable. instead, we write off accrued interest receivable that has not been collected within 90 days of the interest payment due date. we recognize such write offs as a reversal of interest income. no accrued interest was written off during the year ended december 31, 2021.

receivables receivables consist primarily of premium amounts due from government agencies, which are subject to potential retroactive adjustments. because substantially all of our receivable amounts are readily determinable and substantially all of our creditors are governmental authorities, our allowance for credit losses is insignificant.
any amounts determined to be uncollectible are charged to expense when such determination is made.

business combinations we account for business combinations using the acquisition method of accounting, which requires us to recognize the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed at their acquisition date fair values. as discussed below, the excess of the purchase consideration transferred over the fair value of the net tangible and intangible assets acquired is recorded as goodwill. while we use our best estimates and assumptions to accurately value assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date, our estimates are inherently uncertain and subject to refinement. as a result, during the measurement period, which may be up to one year from the acquisition date, we may record adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed with the corresponding offset to goodwill. upon the conclusion of the final determination of the values of assets acquired or liabilities assumed, or one year after the date of acquisition, whichever comes first, any subsequent adjustments are recorded within our consolidated results of operations.
the purchase price for the acquisition of certain assets of passport health plan, inc. in 2020 included contingent consideration payable to seller relating to guarantees for minimum operating income in the post-acquisition period in 2020 and minimum membership targets in 2021. the liabilities are recorded at fair value on a recurring basis, which totaled $ 47million as of december 31, 2021. the contingent purchase consideration paid is presented primarily in "financing activities" in the accompanying consolidated statements of cash flows for the year ended december 31, 2021, with the balance reflected in "operating activities." we expect to pay the remaining balance of the liabilities, reported in "accounts payable, accrued liabilities and other" in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets, in 2022.
refer to note 4, "business combinations," and note 9, "goodwill and intangible assets, net," for further details.
long-lived assets, including intangible assets long-lived assets consist primarily of property, equipment, capitalized software (see note 7, "property, equipment, and capitalized software, net"), and intangible assets resulting from acquisitions. finite-lived, separately-
identified intangible assets acquired in business combinations are assets that represent future expected benefits but lack physical substance (such as purchased contract rights and provider contracts). intangible assets are initially recorded at fair value and are then amortized on a straight-line basis over their expected useful lives, generally between fiveand 16years.
determining the fair value of identifiable assets acquired, particularly intangible assets, and liabilities assumed, requires management to make estimates, which are based on all available information and in some cases assumptions with respect to the timing and amount of future revenues and expenses associated with an asset.
determining the useful life of an intangible asset also requires judgment, as different types of intangible assets will have different useful lives. the most significant intangible asset we typically record in a business combination is contract rights associated with membership assumed. in determining the estimated fair value of the intangible assets, we typically apply the income approach, which discounts the projected future net cash flows using an appropriate discount rate that reflects the risk associated with such projected future cash flows. the most critical assumptions used in determining the fair value of contract rights include forecasted operating margins and the weighted average cost of capital.

our intangible assets are subject to impairment tests when events or circumstances indicate that a finite-lived intangible asset's (or asset group's) carrying value may not be recoverable. consideration is given to a number of potential impairment indicators, including the ability of our health plan subsidiaries to obtain the renewal by amendment of their contracts in each state prior to the actual expiration of their contracts. however, there can be no assurance that these contracts will continue to be renewed. following the identification of any potential impairment indicators, to determine whether an impairment exists, we would compare the carrying amount of a finite-
lived intangible asset with the greater of the undiscounted cash flows that are expected to result from the use of the asset or related group of assets, or its value under the asset liquidation method. if it is determined that the carrying amount of the asset is not recoverable, the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the estimated fair value is recorded as an impairment.refer to note 9, "goodwill and intangible assets, net," for further details.
goodwill goodwill represents the excess of the purchase consideration over the fair value of net assets acquired in business combinations. goodwill is not amortized but is tested for impairment on an annual basis and more frequently if impairment indicators are present. impairment indicators may include experienced or expected operating cash-flow deterioration or losses, significant losses of membership, loss of state funding, loss of state contracts, and other factors. goodwill is impaired if the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value.
this excess is recorded as an impairment loss and adjusted if necessary for the impact of tax-deductible goodwill.
the loss recognized may not exceed the total goodwill allocated to the reporting unit.
when testing goodwill for impairment, we may first assess qualitative factors, such as industry and market factors, the dynamic economic and political environments in which we operate, cost factors, and changes in overall performance, to determine if it is more likely than not that the carrying value of our reporting units exceed their estimated fair values. if our qualitative assessment indicates that it is more likely than not that the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value, we perform the quantitative assessment. we may also elect to bypass the qualitative assessment and proceed directly to the quantitative assessment. we performed a qualitative goodwill assessment of our reporting units, which resulted in nogoodwill impairment losses in the year ended december 31, 2021.
if performing a quantitative assessment, we generally estimate the fair values of our reporting units by applying the income approach, using discounted cash flows. the base year in the reporting units' discounted cash flows is derived from the annual financial planning cycle, which commences in the fourth quarter of the year. as part of a quantitative assessment, we may also apply the asset liquidation method to estimate the fair value of individual reporting units, which is computed as total assets minus total liabilities, excluding intangible assets and deferred taxes. finally, we apply a market approach to reconcile the value of our reporting units to our consolidated market value. under the market approach, we consider publicly traded comparable company information to determine revenue and earnings multiples which are used to estimate our reporting units' fair values. the assumptions used are consistent with those used in our long-range business plan and annual planning process.
however, if these assumptions differ from actual results, the outcome of our goodwill impairment tests could be adversely affected.
leases right-of-use ("rou") assets represent our right to use the underlying assets over the lease term, and lease liabilities represent our obligation for lease payments arising from the related leases. rou assets and lease liabilities are recognized at the lease commencement date based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term. lease terms may include options to extend or terminate the lease when we believe it is reasonably certain that we will exercise such options. if applicable, we account for lease and non-lease components within a lease as a single lease component.
because most of our leases do not provide an implicit interest rate, we generally use our incremental borrowing rate to determine the present value of lease payments. lease expenses for operating lease payments are recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term, and the related rou assets and liabilities are reduced to the present value of the remaining lease payments at the end of each period. finance lease payments reduce finance lease liabilities, the related rou assets are amortized on a straight-line basis over the lease term, and interest expense is recognized using the effective interest method.

periodically for inflation. our lease agreements do not contain any material residual value guarantees or material restrictive covenants.

medical claims and benefits payable medical care costs are recognized in the period in which services are provided and include fee-for-service claims, pharmacy benefits, capitation payments to providers, and various other medically-related costs. under fee-for-
service claims arrangements with providers, we retain the financial responsibility for medical care provided and incur costs based on actual utilization of hospital and physician services. such medical care costs include amounts paid by us as well as estimated medical claims and benefits payable for costs that were incurred but not paid as of the reporting date ("ibnp"). pharmacy benefits represent payments for members' prescription drug costs, net of rebates from drug manufacturers. we estimate pharmacy rebates based on historical and current utilization of prescription drugs and contractual provisions. capitation payments represent monthly contractual fees paid to providers, who are responsible for providing medical care to members, which could include medical or ancillary costs like dental, vision and other supplemental health benefits. such capitation costs are fixed in advance of the periods covered and are not subject to significant accounting estimates. other medical care costs include all medically-related administrative costs, amounts due to providers pursuant to risk-sharing or other incentive arrangements, provider claims, and other healthcare expenses. examples of medically-related administrative costs include expenses relating to health education, quality assurance, case management, care coordination, disease management, and 24-hour on-call nurses. additionally, we include an estimate for the cost of settling claims incurred through the reporting date in our medical claims and benefits payable liability .
medical claims and benefits payable consist mainly of fee-for-service ibnp, unpaid pharmacy claims, capitation costs, other medical costs, including amounts payable to providers pursuant to risk-sharing or other incentive arrangements and amounts payable to providers on behalf of certain state agencies for certain state assessments in which we assume no financial risk . ibnp includes the costs of claims incurred as of the balance sheet date which have been reported to us, and our best estimate of the cost of claims incurred but not yet reported to us. we also include an additional reserve to ensure that our overall ibnp liability is sufficient under moderately adverse conditions. we reflect changes in these estimates in the consolidated results of operations in the period in which they are determined.
the estimation of the ibnp liability requires a significant degree of judgment in applying actuarial methods, determining the appropriate assumptions and considering numerous factors. of those factors, we consider estimated completion factors and the assumed healthcare cost trend to be the most critical assumptions. other relevant factors also include, but are not limited to, healthcare service utilization trends, claim inventory levels, changes in membership, product mix, seasonality, benefit changes or changes in medicaid fee schedules, provider contract changes, prior authorizations and the incidence of catastrophic or pandemic cases.
because of the significant degree of judgment involved in estimation of our ibnp liability, there is considerable variability and uncertainty inherent in such estimates. each reporting period, the recognized ibnp liability represents our best estimate of the total amount of unpaid claims incurred as of the balance sheet date using a consistent methodology in estimating our ibnp liability. we believe our current estimates are reasonable and adequate; however, the development of our estimate is a continuous process that we monitor and update as more complete claims payment information and healthcare cost trend data becomes available. actual medical care costs may be less than we previously estimated (favorable development) or more than we previously estimated (unfavorable development), and any differences could be material. any adjustments to reflect favorable development would be recognized as a decrease to medical care costs, and any adjustments to reflect unfavorable development would be recognized as an increase to medical care costs , in the period in which the adjustments are determined.

certain components of premium revenue are subject to accounting estimates and are described below, under
"contractual provisions that may adjust or limit revenue or profit," and "quality incentives."
contractual provisions that may adjust or limit revenue or profit many of our contracts contain provisions that may adjust or limit revenue or profit, as described below.
consequently, we recognize premium revenue as it is earned under such provisions. liabilities accrued for premiums to be returned under such provisions are reported in the aggregate as "amounts due government agencies" in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. categorized by program, such amounts due government agencies included the following:

medicaid program minimum mlr and medical cost corridors. a portion of our premium revenue may be returned if certain minimum amounts are not spent on defined medical care costs. under certain medical cost corridor provisions, the health plans may receive additional premiums if amounts spent on medical care costs exceed a defined maximum threshold.
profit sharing. our contracts with certain states contain profit sharing provisions under which we refund amounts to the states if our health plans generate profit above a certain specified percentage. in some cases, we are limited in the amount of administrative costs that we may deduct in calculating the refund, if any.
retroactive premium adjustments. state medicaid programs periodically adjust premium rates on a retroactive basis.
in these cases, we adjust our premium revenue in the period in which we determine that the adjustment is probable and reasonably estimable, based on our best estimate of the ultimate premium we expect to realize for the period being adjusted.
beginning in 2020, through december 31, 2021, various states enacted temporary risk corridors in response to the reduced demand for medical services stemming from covid-19, which have resulted in a reduction of our medical margin, primarily in the medicaid segment. in some cases, these risk corridors were retroactive to earlier periods in 2020, or as early as the beginning of the states' fiscal years in 2019. beginning in the second quarter of 2020, we have recognized retroactive risk corridors that we believe to be probable, and where the ultimate premium amount is reasonably estimable.we recognized approximately $ 323million related to such risk corridors in 2021, primarily in the medicaid segment. approximately $ 564million related to these covid-related risk corridors, in the aggregate, were recognized in 2020, including $ 37million related to mmp plans.
it is possible that certain states could change the structure of existing risk corridors, implement new risk corridors in the future or discontinue existing risk corridors. due to these uncertainties, the ultimate outcomes could differ materially from our estimates as a result of changes in facts or further developments, which could have an adverse effect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.

medicare program risk adjustment. our medicare premiums are subject to retroactive increase or decrease based on the health status of our medicare members (as measured by member risk score). we estimate our members' risk scores and the related amount of medicare revenue that will ultimately be realized for the periods presented based on our knowledge of our members' health status, risk scores and centers for medicare & medicaid services ("cms") practices.
minimum mlr. the affordable care act ("aca") established a minimum annual medical loss ratio ("minimum mlr") of 85%
for medicare. the medical loss ratio represents medical costs as a percentage of premium revenue. federal regulations define what constitutes medical costs and premium revenue. if the minimum mlr is not met, we may be required to pay rebates to the federal government. we recognize estimated rebates under the minimum mlr as an adjustment to premium revenue in our consolidated statements of income.
marketplace program risk adjustment. under this program, our health plans' composite risk scores are compared with the overall average risk score for the relevant state and market pool. generally, our health plans will make a risk adjustment payment into the pool if their composite risk scores are below the average risk score (risk adjustment payable), and will receive a risk adjustment payment from the pool if their composite risk scores are above the average risk score
(risk adjustment receivable). we estimate our ultimate premium based on insurance policy year-to-date experience, and recognize estimated premiums relating to the risk adjustment program as an adjustment to premium revenue in our consolidated statements of income.as of december 31, 2021, marketplace risk adjustment payables amounted to $
902million and related receivables amounted to $ 7million, for a net payable of $ 895million. as of december 31,
2020, marketplace risk adjustment payables amounted to $ 326million and related receivables amounted to $
20million, for a net payable of $ 306million.
minimum mlr. the aca has established a minimum mlr of 80% for the marketplace. if the minimum mlr is not met, we may be required to pay rebates to our marketplace policyholders. the marketplace risk adjustment program is taken into consideration when computing the minimum mlr. we recognize estimated rebates under the minimum mlr as an adjustment to premium revenue in our consolidated statements of income.
quality incentives at many of our health plans, revenue ranging from approximately 1% to 4% of certain health plan premiums is earned only if certain performance measures are met. such performance measures are generally found in our medicaid and mmp contracts. recognition of quality incentive premium revenue is subject to the use of estimates.
reinsurance we bear underwriting and reserving risks associated with our health plan subsidiaries. in certain cases, we limit our risk of significant catastrophic losses by maintaining high deductible reinsurance coverage with a highly-
rated, unaffiliated insurance company (the "third-party reinsurer"). because we remain liable for losses in the event the third-party reinsurer is unable to pay its portion of the losses, we continually monitor the third-party reinsurer's financial condition, including its ability to maintain high credit ratings. intercompany transactions with our captive are eliminated in consolidation.
we report reinsurance premiums as a reduction to premium revenue, while related reinsurance recoveries are reported as a reduction to medical care costs.reinsurance premiums amounted to $ 2million, $ 9million, and $ 17million for the years ended december 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively. reinsurance recoveries amounted to $ 33million, $
23million, and $ 18million for the years ended december 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively. reinsurance recoverable of $ 51million, $ 30million, and $ 21million, as of december 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively, is included in "receivables" in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.
premium deficiency reserves on loss contracts we assess the profitability of our contracts to determine if it is probable that a loss will be incurred in the future by reviewing current results and forecasts. for purposes of this assessment, contracts are grouped in a manner consistent with our method of acquiring, servicing and measuring the profitability of such contracts. a premium deficiency reserve ("pdr") is recognized if anticipated future medical care and administrative costs exceed anticipated future premium revenue, investment income and reinsurance recoveries.

income taxes we account for income taxes under the asset and liability method. deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the difference between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates expected to be in effect during the year in which the basis differences reverse. valuation allowances are established when management determines it is more likely than not that some portion, or all, of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.for further discussion and disclosure, see note 12, "income taxes."
taxes based on premiums health insurer fee ("hif"). under the affordable care act, the federal government imposed an annual fee, or excise tax, on health insurers for each calendar year (the "hif").the further consolidated appropriations act, 2020
repealed the hif effective for years after 2020.
premium and use tax. certain of our health plans are assessed a tax based on premium revenue collected. the premium revenues we receive from these states include reimbursement for the premium tax assessment. we have reported these taxes on a gross basis, as premium tax revenue and as premium tax expenses in the consolidated statements of income.
concentrations of credit risk financial instruments that potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents, investments, receivables, and restricted investments. our investments and a portion of our cash equivalents are managed by professional portfolio managers operating under documented investment guidelines. our portfolio managers must obtain our prior approval before selling investments where the loss position of those investments exceeds certain levels. our investments consist primarily of investment-grade debt securities with final maturities of less than 10years, or less than 10years average life for structured securities. restricted investments are invested principally in cash, cash equivalents and u.s. treasury securities. concentration of credit risk with respect to accounts receivable is limited because our payors consist principally of the federal government, and governments of each state in which our health plan subsidiaries operate.
risks and uncertainties our profitability depends in large part on our ability to accurately predict and effectively manage medical care costs. we continually review our medical costs in light of our underlying claims experience and revised actuarial data. however, several factors could adversely affect medical care costs. these factors, which include changes in healthcare practices, inflation, new technologies, major epidemics, natural disasters, and malpractice litigation, are beyond our control and may have an adverse effect on our ability to accurately predict and effectively control medical care costs. costs in excess of those anticipated could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.
we operate health plans primarily as a direct contractor with the states, and in los angeles county, california, as a subcontractor to another health plan holding a direct contract with the state. we are therefore dependent upon a relatively small number of contracts to support our revenue. the loss of any one of those contracts could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. in addition, our ability to arrange for the provision of medical services to our members is dependent upon our ability to develop and maintain adequate provider networks. our inability to develop or maintain such networks might, in certain circumstances, have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.

the following table summarizes premium revenue by state health plan for the periods presented:

4. business combinations in the fourth quarter of 2021, we closed on onebusiness combination in the medicaid segment, consistent with our strategy to grow in our existing markets. for this transaction, we applied the acquisition method of accounting, where the total purchase price was allocated, or preliminarily allocated, to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed, based on their fair values as of the acquisition date. we expect to complete the final determination of the purchase price allocation as soon as practicable, but no later than one year following the acquisition's closing date in accordance with accounting standards codification topic 805, business combinations . measurement period adjustments will be recorded in the period in which they are determined, as if they had been completed at the acquisition date.
acquisition costs amounted to $ 34million in the aggregate for the year ended december 31, 2021, and were recorded as "general and administrative expenses" in the accompanying consolidated statements of income.
affinity. on october 25, 2021, we closed on our acquisition of substantially all of the assets of affinity health plan, inc., a medicaid health plan in new york, for initial purchase consideration of approximately $ 176million.
finalization of purchase price adjustments as provided in the asset purchase agreement is expected to occur in the second half of 2022.
goodwill is calculated as the excess of the consideration transferred over the net assets recognized and represents the estimated future economic benefits arising from other assets acquired that could not be individually identified and separately recognized. such assets include synergies we expect to achieve, such as the use of our existing infrastructure to support the added membership, and future economic benefits arising from the assembled workforce.
approximately 100% of the goodwill is deductible for income tax purposes. the following table summarizes the provisional fair values assigned to assets acquired and liabilities assumed, in millions.

of $ 7million to "receivables," a decrease of $ 27million to "medical claims and benefits payable," and an increase of $ 18million to "amounts due government agencies." in the aggregate, we recorded a net increase of $ 10million to goodwill for these measurement period adjustments and purchase price adjustments, which has been finalized as of december 31, 2021.
cigna. as described in note 1, "organization and basis of presentation," we announced this acquisition closed on january 1, 2022. because the closing date fell on a holiday, the $ 58million purchase price was paid on december
31, 2021 and was recorded to prepaid expenses and other assets. such amounts are reported in investing activities in the accompanying consolidated statements of cash flows. the initial accounting for this transaction is incomplete.
5. fair value measurements we consider the carrying amounts of current assets and current liabilities to approximate their fair values because of the relatively short period of time between the origination of these instruments and their expected realization or payment. for our financial instruments measured at fair value on a recurring basis, we prioritize the inputs used in measuring fair value according to a three-tier fair value hierarchy as follows:
level 1 - observable inputs. level 1 financial instruments are actively traded and therefore the fair value for these securities is based on quoted market prices for identical securities in active markets.
level 2 - directly or indirectly observable inputs. fair value for these investments is determined using a market approach based on quoted prices for similar securities in active markets or quoted prices for identical securities in inactive markets.
level 3 - unobservable inputs. level 3 financial instruments are valued using unobservable inputs that represent management's best estimate of what market participants would use in pricing the financial instrument at the measurement date. as of december 31, 2021 and 2020, our level 3 financial instruments consisted of contingent consideration liabilities.
the net changes in fair value of level 3 financial instruments are reported in "other" operating expenses in our consolidated statements of income. in the years ended december 31, 2021 and 2020, we recognized a loss of $
24million and $ 6million, respectively, primarily for the increase in the fair value of the contingent consideration liability described below.
our financial instruments measured at fair value on a recurring basis at december 31, 2021, were as follows:

level 3 contingent consideration liabilities our level 3 financial instruments at december 31, 2021 are comprised solely of contingent consideration liabilities of $ 47million, in connection with our 2020 acquisition of certain assets of passport health plan, inc., a medicaid health plan in kentucky. refer to note 2, "significant accounting policies-business combinations", for further details. the liabilities are recorded at fair value on a recurring basis. in 2021, the estimated fair value of contingent purchase consideration increased by approximately $ 24million, mainly relating to an operating income guarantee, and was essentially offset by $ 23million paid to the seller for half the consideration due for minimum member enrollment targets in 2021. in january 2022, we paid the remaining half of the consideration due for minimum member enrollment targets of $ 23million.
fair value measurements - disclosure only the carrying amounts and estimated fair values of our notes payable are classified as level 2 financial instruments. fair value for these securities is determined using a market approach based on quoted market prices for similar securities in active markets or quoted prices for identical securities in inactive markets.

gross realized gains and losses from sales of available-for-sale securities are calculated under the specific identification method and are included in investment income. gross realized investment gains amounted to $
10million, $ 6million and $ 13million in the years ended december 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. gross realized investment losses were insignificant in the years ended december 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019.
we have determined that unrealized losses at december 31, 2021 and 2020 primarily resulted from fluctuating interest rates, rather than a deterioration of the creditworthiness of the issuers. therefore, we determined that an allowance for credit losses was not necessary. so long as we maintain the intent and ability to hold these securities to maturity, we are unlikely to experience losses. in the event that we dispose of these securities before maturity, we expect that realized losses, if any, will be insignificant.

the following table summarizes those available-for-sale investments that have been in a continuous loss position for less than 12 months. no investments have been in a continuous loss position for 12 months or more as of december 31, 2021, and 2020.

restricted investments held-to-maturity pursuant to the regulations governing our state health plan subsidiaries, we maintain statutory deposits and deposits required by government authorities primarily in cash, cash equivalents, and u.s. treasury securities. we also maintain restricted investments as protection against the insolvency of certain capitated providers. the use of these funds is limited as required by regulations in the various states in which we operate, or as needed in the event of insolvency of capitated providers. therefore, such investments are reported as "restricted investments" in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.
we have the ability to hold these restricted investments until maturity, and as a result, we would not expect the value of these investments to decline significantly due to a sudden change in market interest rates. our held-to-
maturity restricted investments are carried at amortized cost, which approximates fair value, of which $ 142million will mature in one year or less, and $ 70million will mature in one through five years.

ending balance the amounts presented for "components of medical care costs related to: prior years" represent the amount by which our original estimate of medical claims and benefits payable at the beginning of the year varied from the actual liabilities, based on information (principally the payment of claims) developed since those liabilities were first reported.
our estimates of medical claims and benefits payable recorded at december 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019 developed favorably by approximately $ 239million, $ 119million and $ 271million in 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. the favorable prior year development recognized in 2021 was primarily due to lower than expected utilization of medical services by our medicaid members, and to a lesser extent our medicare and marketplace members, and improved operating performance. consequently, the ultimate costs recognized in 2021 were lower than our original estimates in 2020, which was not discernible until additional information was provided, and as claims payments were processed.
the favorable prior year development recognized in 2020 was primarily due to lower than expected utilization of medical services by our medicaid members, and improved operating performance. consequently, the ultimate costs recognized in 2020 were lower than our original estimates in 2019, which was not discernible until additional information was provided, and as claims payments were processed.
the favorable prior year development recognized in 2019 was primarily due to lower than expected utilization of medical services by our medicaid members, and improved operating performance. consequently, the ultimate costs recognized in 2019 were lower than our original estimates in 2018, which was not discernible until additional information was provided, and as claims payments were processed.

the following tables provide information about our consolidated incurred and paid claims development as of december
31, 2021, as well as cumulative claims frequency and the total of incurred but not paid claims liabilities. the pattern of incurred and paid claims development is consistent across each of our segments. the cumulative claim frequency is measured by claim event, and includes claims covered under capitated arrangements.

credit agreement we are party to a credit agreement (the "credit agreement") which includes a revolving credit facility ("credit facility") of $ 1.0billion, among other provisions. the credit agreement has a term of five years, and all amounts outstanding will be due and payable on june 8, 2025. borrowings under the credit agreement bear interest based, at our election, on a base rate or other defined rate, plus in each case, the applicable margin. in addition to interest payable on the principal amount of indebtedness outstanding from time to time under the credit agreement, we are required to pay a quarterly commitment fee.
the credit agreement contains customary non-financial and financial covenants. as of december 31, 2021, we were in compliance with all financial and non-financial covenants under the credit agreement and other long-term debt. as of december 31, 2021, noamounts were outstanding under the credit facility.
senior notes our senior notes are described below. each of these notes are senior unsecured obligations of molina and rank equally in right of payment with all existing and future senior debt, and senior to all existing and future subordinated debt of molina. in addition, each of the notes contain customary non-financial covenants and change of control provisions.
the indentures governing the senior notes contain cross-default provisions that are triggered upon default by us or any of our subsidiaries on any indebtedness in excess of the amount specified in the applicable indenture.
5.375% notes due 2022. in december 2021, we completed the early redemption of the entire $ 700million aggregate principal amount of senior notes (the " 5.375% notes") that would have been due november 15, 2022. in accordance with the indenture governing such notes, the 5.375% notes were settled at 100% of par, plus an early redemption premium which amounted to $ 23million, plus accrued and unpaid interest. in conjunction with the redemption we wrote off $ 2million in unamortized deferred issuance costs directly related to the 5.375% notes.
4.375% notes due 2028. we have $ 800million aggregate principal amount of senior notes (the " 4.375% notes")
outstanding as of december 31, 2021, which are due june 15, 2028, unless earlier redeemed. interest, at a rate of
4.375% per annum, is payable semiannually in arrears on june 15 and december 15.
3.875% notes due 2030. we have $ 650million aggregate principal amount of senior notes (the " 3.875% notes due
2030") outstanding as of december 31, 2021, which are due november 15, 2030, unless earlier redeemed. interest, at a rate of 3.875% per annum, is payable semiannually in arrears on may 15 and november 15.
3.875% notes due 2032. on november 16, 2021, we completed the private offering of $ 750million aggregate principal amount of senior notes (the " 3.875% notes due 2032") due may 15, 2032, unless earlier redeemed. the 3.875% notes due 2032 contain optional early redemption provisions, with redemption prices in excess of par. interest, at a rate of 3.875% per annum, is payable semiannually in arrears on may 15 and november 15 of each year, commencing on may
15, 2022. a large majority of the net proceeds from the 3.875% notes due 2032 offering was used to repay $
700million principal amount outstanding under the 5.375% notes, and the balance is intended to be used for general corporate purposes. deferred issuance costs amounted to $ 10million.
in 2021, we recognized an aggregate loss on debt repayment of $ 25million including costs incurred in the early redemption of the 5.375% notes described above. in 2020, we recognized an aggregate loss on debt repayment of $

$ 330million aggregate principal amount of our senior notes that would have been due in june 2025, and other financing transactions. these costs are located within other expenses (income), net within our consolidated statements of income.

the effective tax rate was not impacted by the hif in 2019 given the hif moratorium. hif was repealed for years after 2020. our effective tax rate is based on expected income, statutory tax rates, and tax planning opportunities available to us in the various jurisdictions in which we operate. management estimates and judgments are required in determining our effective tax rate. we are routinely under audit by federal, state, or local authorities regarding the timing and amount of deductions, nexus of income among various tax jurisdictions, and compliance with federal, state, foreign, and local tax laws.

deferred tax assets and liabilities are classified as non-current. significant components of our deferred tax assets and liabilities as of december 31, 2021 and 2020 were as follows:

at december 31, 2021, we had state net operating loss carryforwards of $ 177million, which begin expiring in 2036.
at december 31, 2021, we had foreign net operating loss carryforwards of $ 9million, which expire in 2032.
at december 31, 2021, we had foreign tax credit carryovers of $ 5million, which expire in 2030.
we evaluate the need for a valuation allowance taking into consideration the ability to carry back and carry forward tax credits and losses, available tax planning strategies and future income, including reversal of temporary differences. we have determined that as of december 31, 2021, $ 10million of deferred tax assets did not satisfy the recognition criteria. therefore, we decreased our valuation allowance by $ 7million, from $ 17million at december 31, 2020, to $ 10million as of december 31, 2021.
we recognize tax benefits only if the tax position is more likely than not to be sustained. we are subject to income taxes in the united states, puerto rico, and numerous state jurisdictions. significant judgment is required in evaluating our tax positions and determining our provision for income taxes. during the ordinary course of business, there are many transactions and calculations for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. we establish reserves for tax-related uncertainties based on estimates of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes will be due. these reserves are established when we believe that certain positions might be challenged despite our belief that our tax return positions are fully supportable. we adjust these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances, such as the outcome of tax audits. the provision for income taxes includes the impact of reserve provisions and changes to reserves that are considered appropriate.
the roll forward of our unrecognized tax benefits is as follows:

12 months it is reasonably possible that unrecognized tax benefit liabilities may decrease by as much as $
10million as a result of the expiration of statutes of limitations.

our continuing practice is to recognize interest and/or penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense. amounts accrued for the payment of interest and penalties as of december 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019 were insignificant.
the u.s. internal revenue service (irs) completed exams for years 2017 and prior. we may be subject to examination by the irs for calendar years after 2017. with a few exceptions, which are immaterial in the aggregate, we no longer are subject to state, local, and puerto rico tax examinations for years before 2017.
13. stockholders' equity stock purchase programs in september 2021, our board of directors authorized the purchase of up to $ 500million, in the aggregate, of our common stock. this new program immediately supersedes the stock purchase program previously approved by our board of directors in september 2020, as described below. this new program will be funded with cash on hand and extends through december 31, 2022. the exact timing and amount of any repurchase is determined by management based on market conditions and share price, in addition to other factors, and subject to the restrictions relating to volume, price, and timing under applicable law. as of february 14, 2022, noshares had been purchased under this stock purchase program.
in september 2020, our board of directors authorized the purchase of up to $ 500million, in the aggregate, of our common stock. this program was funded with cash on hand. under this program, pursuant to a rule 10b5-1 trading plan, we purchased approximately 577,000shares of our common stock for $ 122million in january and february 2021
(average cost of $ 211.65). in november and december 2020, we purchased 766,000shares of our common stock for $
159million (average cost of $ 208.37), including approximately 29,000shares purchased for $ 6million in late december 2020, and settled in early january 2021.
share-based compensation in connection with our employee stock plans, approximately 429,000shares and 244,000shares of common stock were issued, net of shares used to settle employees' income tax obligations, during the years ended december 31, 2021, and 2020, respectively. total share-based compensation expense is reported in "general and administrative expenses"

equity incentive plan at december 31, 2021, we had employee equity incentives outstanding under our 2019 equity incentive plan (the "2019

"psas"), performance units ("psus"), stock options, and other stock- or cash-based awards, to eligible persons who perform services for us. the 2019 eip provides for the issuance of up to 2.9million shares of our common stock.
stock-based awards . rsas, psas and psus are granted with a fair value equal to the market price of our common stock on the date of grant, and generally vest in equal annual installments over periods up to four yearsfrom the date of grant. certain psus may vest in their entirety at the end of three-yearperformance periods, if their performance conditions are met. we generally recognize expense for rsas, psas and psus on a straight-line basis.

as of december 31, 2021, total unrecognized compensation expense related to unvested rsas and psus was $ 55million, and $ 12million, respectively, which we expect to recognize over a remaining weighted-average period of 2.1years, and 0.8years, respectively. this unrecognized compensation cost assumes an estimated forfeiture rate of 11.3% for non-executive employees as of december 31, 2021, based on actual forfeitures over the last 4years.
during the year ended december 31, 2021, we granted 127,102psus which vest in a range from 0% to 200% of the number of target units awarded, depending on the company's level of achievement with respect to the financial performance goal, after three years. we have not recognized stock compensation expense for these psus during the year ended december 31, 2021 as the complete performance conditions have not been determined as of december 31, 2021. we expect the performance conditions to be determined during the third year of vesting. at december 31, 2021,
116,172psus were outstanding.

employee stock purchase plans ("espp")

deductions. we estimate the fair value of the stock issued using a standard option pricing model. for the years ended december 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019, the inputs to this model were as follows: risk-free interest rates of approximately 0.1% to 2.3%; expected volatility of approximately 35% to 54%, dividend yields of 0%, and an average expected life of 0.5years.
14. employee benefit plans we sponsor defined contribution 401(k) plans that cover substantially all employees of our company and its subsidiaries. eligible employees are permitted to contribute up to the maximum amount allowed by law. we match up to the first 4% of compensation contributed by employees. expense recognized in connection with our contributions to the 401(k) plans amounted to $ 41million, $ 28million, and $ 28million in the years ended december 31, 2021,
2020, and 2019, respectively.
we also have a non-qualified deferred compensation plan for certain key employees. under this plan, eligible participants may defer portions of their base salary and bonus to provide tax-deferred growth. the deferrals are distributable based upon termination of employment or other periods, as elected under the plan and were $ 23million and $ 17million as of december 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.
15. commitments and contingencies regulatory capital requirements and dividend restrictions our health plans, which are generally operated by our respective wholly owned subsidiaries in those states in which our health plans operate, are subject to state laws and regulations that, among other things, require the maintenance of minimum levels of statutory capital, as defined by each state. the national association of insurance commissioners ("naic"), has adopted rules which, if implemented by the states, set minimum capitalization requirements for insurance companies, hmos, and other entities bearing risk for healthcare coverage. the requirements take the form of risk-based capital ("rbc") rules which may vary from state to state. regulators in some states may also enforce capital requirements that require the retention of net worth in excess of amounts formally required by statute or regulation.
all of the states in which our health plans operate, except california, florida, massachusetts and new york, have adopted the rbc rules. the rbc rules, if adopted by california, florida, massachusetts or new york, could increase the minimum capital required for those states. our massachusetts health plan maintains a $ 35million performance bond, effective through december 31, 2022, to partially satisfy minimum net worth requirements in that state.
statutes, regulations and informal capital requirements also restrict the timing, payment, and amount of dividends and other distributions that may be paid to us as the sole stockholder. to the extent our subsidiaries must comply with these regulations, they may not have the financial flexibility to transfer funds to us. based on current statutes and regulations, the net assets in these subsidiaries, which may not be transferable to us in the form of loans, advances, or cash dividends was approximately $ 2.7billion at december 31, 2021. because of the statutory restrictions that inhibit the ability of our health plans to transfer net assets to us, the amount of retained earnings readily available to pay dividends to our stockholders is generally limited to cash, cash equivalents and investments held by the parent company-molina healthcare, inc. such cash, cash equivalents and investments amounted to $ 348million and $ 644million as of december 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.
as of december 31, 2021, our health plans had aggregate statutory capital and surplus of approximately $
2.9billion, which was in excess of the required minimum aggregate statutory capital and surplus of approximately $
2.1billion. we have the ability and commitment to provide additional capital to each of our health plans when necessary to ensure that statutory capital and surplus continue to meet regulatory requirements.

operations, regulatory requirements, debt repayment obligations, and capital expenditures for the foreseeable future.
legal proceedings the healthcare industry is subject to numerous laws and regulations of federal, state, and local governments.
compliance with these laws and regulations can be subject to government review and interpretation, as well as regulatory actions unknown and unasserted at this time. penalties associated with violations of these laws and regulations include significant fines and penalties, exclusion from participating in publicly funded programs, and the repayment of previously billed and collected revenues.
we are involved in legal actions in the ordinary course of business including, but not limited to, various employment claims, vendor disputes and provider claims. some of these legal actions seek monetary damages, including claims for punitive damages, which may not be covered by insurance. we review legal matters and update our estimates of reasonably possible losses and related disclosures, as necessary. we have accrued liabilities for legal matters for which we deem the loss to be both probable and reasonably estimable. these liability estimates could change as a result of further developments of the matters. the outcome of legal actions is inherently uncertain. an adverse determination in one or more of these pending matters could have an adverse effect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.
kentucky rfp. on september 4, 2020, anthem kentucky managed care plan, inc. brought an action in franklin county circuit court against the kentucky finance and administration cabinet, the kentucky cabinet for health and family services, and all of the five winning bidder health plans, including our kentucky health plan. this matter remains subject to additional legal and appellate proceedings, and no assurances can be given regarding the ultimate outcome. under the court's june 16, 2021 final order, our kentucky health plan will continue to operate for the foreseeable future under its current medicaid contract and provide care to kentucky medicaid members.
puerto rico. on august 13, 2021, molina healthcare of puerto, inc. ("mhpr") filed a complaint asserting, among other claims, breach of contract against puerto rico health insurance administration ("ases"). on september 13,
2021, in addition to filing its answer to mhpr's complaint, ases filed a counterclaim and a third-party complaint against mhpr and the company. the counterclaim alleges that mhpr and the company breached contractual obligations by failing to pay providers and, in addition to damages, seeks various equitable remedies. on october 8, 2021, mhpr filed its reply to the counterclaim, denying all the allegations, and on november 1, 2021, the company filed its answer to the third-party complaint. on december 3, 2021, mhpr filed a request for disbursement of illegally withheld funds, and ases filed its opposition. at a status hearing on january 19, 2022, the company and ases both argued mhpr's request for disbursement. the court has not ruled. this matter is in its early stages, and no prediction can be made as to the outcome. no gain or loss is probable and reasonably estimable with regard to either mhpr's complaint or the counterclaim of ases.
professional liability insurance we carry medical professional liability insurance for healthcare services rendered in the primary care institutions that we manage. in addition, we carry managed care errors and omissions insurance for all managed care services that we provide.
16. segments in the first quarter of 2021, we realigned our reportable operating segments to reflect recent changes in our internal operating and reporting structure, which is now organized by government program. the revised reporting structure reflects the reporting and review process used by our chief executive officer (who is our chief operating decision maker) to assess performance and allocate resources, and is consistent with how we currently manage the business and view the markets we serve. these reportable segments consist of: 1) medicaid; 2) medicare; 3)
marketplace; and 4) other.
the medicaid, medicare, and marketplace segments represent the government-funded or sponsored programs under which we offer managed healthcare services. the other segment, which is insignificant to our consolidated results of operations, includes certain corporate amounts not associated with or allocated to the medicaid, medicare, or marketplace segments. additionally, the other segment includes service revenues and service costs associated with the long-term services and supports consultative services we now provide in wisconsin, as a result of the magellan complete care acquisition on december 31, 2020.

the key metrics used to assess the performance of our medicaid, medicare, and marketplace segments are premium revenue, medical margin and mcr. mcr represents the amount of medical care costs as a percentage of premium revenue. therefore, the underlying medical margin, or the amount earned by the medicaid, medicare, and marketplace segments after medical costs are deducted from premium revenue, represents the most important measure of earnings reviewed by management, and is used by our chief executive officer to review results, assess performance, and allocate resources. the key metric used to assess the performance of our other segment is service margin. the service margin is equal to service revenue minus cost of service revenue. we do not report total assets by segment since this is not a metric used to assess segment performance or allocate resources.
for all tables presented below, the prior period disclosures have been recast to conform to the current period segment presentation.
the following table presents total revenue by segment. inter-segment revenue was insignificant for all periods presented.

controls and procedures management's evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures we maintain disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in rule 13a-15(e) and rule 15d-15(e) under the securities exchange act of 1934, as amended (the "exchange act"), that are designed to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by us in reports we file or submit under the exchange act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the sec's rules and forms. disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by us in reports we file or submit under the exchange act is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. in designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives, and management is required to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost-
benefit relationship of any possible controls and procedures.
under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our chief executive officer and our chief financial officer, we carried out an evaluation of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this form 10-k pursuant to rule 13a-15(b) and rule 15d-15(b) of the exchange act. based on this evaluation, our chief executive officer and our chief financial officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of december 31, 2021, at the reasonable assurance level. in addition, management concluded that our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10-k are fairly stated in all material respects in accordance with u.s. generally accepted accounting principles ("gaap") for each of the periods presented herein.
management's report on internal control over financial reporting management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in rule 13a-15(f) under the exchange act. our internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of our assets; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with gaap, and that our receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of our management and directors; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on our financial statements.
internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements prepared for external purposes in accordance with gaap. because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. also, projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
management concluded that we maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of december 31,
2021, based on criteria described in internal control-integrated framework (2013) issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission ("coso").
ernst & young, llp, the independent registered public accounting firm who audited our consolidated financial statements included in this form 10-k, has issued a report on our internal control over financial reporting, which is included herein.
changes in internal control over financial reporting there were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in rule 13a-15(f) of the exchange act) during the quarter ended december 31, 2021, that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

we also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the public company accounting oversight board (united states) ("pcaob"), the consolidated balance sheets of the company as of december 31, 2021 and 2020, the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, stockholders' equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended december 31, 2021, and the related notes and our report dated february 14, 2022, expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.
basis for opinion the company's management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying management's report on internal control over financial reporting. our responsibility is to express an opinion on the company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. we are a public accounting firm registered with the pcaob and are required to be independent with respect to the company in accordance with the u.s. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the securities and exchange commission and the pcaob.
we conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the pcaob. those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.
our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. we believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

report of independent registered public accounting firm to the stockholders and the board of directors of molina healthcare, inc.
opinion on the financial statements we have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of molina healthcare, inc. (the "company") as of december 31, 2021 and 2020, the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, stockholders'
equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended december 31, 2021, and the related notes
(collectively referred to as the "consolidated financial statements"). in our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the company at december 31, 2021 and
2020, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended december
31, 2021, in conformity with u.s. generally accepted accounting principles.
we also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the public company accounting oversight board (united states) ("pcaob"), the company's internal control over financial reporting as of december 31, 2021, based on criteria established in internal control-integrated framework issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission (2013 framework), and our report dated february 14, 2022, expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.
basis for opinion these financial statements are the responsibility of the company's management. our responsibility is to express an opinion on the company's financial statements based on our audits. we are a public accounting firm registered with the pcaob and are required to be independent with respect to the company in accordance with the u.s. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the securities and exchange commission and the pcaob.
we conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the pcaob. those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. we believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
critical audit matters the critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective or complex judgments. the communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.
valuation of incurred but not paid fee-for-service claims as of december 31, 2021, the company's liability for fee-for-service claims incurred but not paid ("ibnp"), comprised $2,486 million of the $3,363 million of medical claims and benefits payable. as discussed in note 10 to the consolidated financial statements, the company's ibnp liability is determined using actuarial methods that include a number of factors and assumptions, including completion description of the matter    factors, which seek to measure the cumulative percentage of claims expense that will have been paid for a given month of service as of the reporting date, based on historical payment patterns, and assumed health care cost trend factors, which represent an estimate of claims expense based on recent claims expense levels and healthcare cost levels. there is significant uncertainty inherent in determining management's best estimate of completion and trend factors, which are used to calculate actuarial estimates of incurred but not paid claims.

auditing management's best estimate of the ibnp liability was complex and required the involvement of our actuarial specialists due to the highly judgmental nature of completion and trend factor assumptions used in the valuation process. these assumptions have a significant effect on the valuation of the ibnp liability.
we obtained an understanding, evaluated the design, and tested the operating effectiveness of the company's controls over the process for estimating the ibnp liability. this included testing management how we addressed the matter in our audit    review controls over completion and trend factor assumptions, and management's review and approval of actuarial methods used to calculate ibnp liability, including the data inputs and outputs of those models.
to test ibnp liability, our audit procedures included, among others, testing the completeness and accuracy of data used in the calculation by testing reconciliations of underlying claims and membership data recorded in source systems to the actuarial reserving calculations, and comparing a sample of claims to source documentation. with the assistance of ey actuarial specialists, we evaluated the company's selection and weighting of actuarial methods by comparing the weightings used in the current estimate to those used in prior periods and those used in the industry for the specific types of insurance. to evaluate significant assumptions used by management in the actuarial methods, we compared assumptions to current and historical claims trends, to those used historically and to current industry benchmarks. we also compared management's recorded ibnp liability to a range of reasonable ibnp estimates calculated independently by our ey actuarial specialists.
additionally, we performed a review of the prior period estimates using subsequent claims development, and we reviewed and evaluated management's disclosures surrounding fee-for-service claims ibnp.

medicaid medicaid premium revenue increased $6.2 billion in 2021, when compared with 2020, mainly due to the impact from the magellan complete care, and other acquisitions closed in the second half of 2020, the affinity acquisition that closed in the fourth quarter of 2021, and organic membership growth. excluding acquisitions, membership growth occurred across nearly all our states and was mainly driven by the extension of the phe period and the associated suspension of membership redeterminations. also contributing to the overall premium revenue increase was a lower impact of covid-related risk corridors in 2021 compared to 2020.

to the lower utilization of medical services resulting from covid-19. we recognized $564 million related to covid-
related risk corridors in 2020, mainly related to medicaid.
the medical margin of our medicaid program increased $518 million, or 29%, in 2021 when compared with 2020. the increase was driven by increased premium revenues and margin associated with the membership growth discussed above, partially offset by the mcr increase discussed below.
the medicaid mcr increased to 88.7% in 2021, from 87.4% in 2020, or 130 basis points. the increase in the medicaid mcr in 2021 was mainly due to business mix changes, partially offset by continued medical cost management and a year-over-year decrease in the net effect of covid. the year-over-year change in impact of the net effect of covid reflects the decrease in covid-related risk corridors discussed above, partially offset by an increase in covid-
related inpatient costs, and lower covid-related utilization curtailment. the medicaid mcr is consistent with our long-term target despite the net effect of covid.
medicare medicare premium revenue increased $849 million in 2021, when compared with 2020, primarily due to the impact of higher membership, mainly from the magellan complete care acquisition, and higher premium revenue pmpm.
the medical margin for medicare increased $79 million, or 23%, in 2021 when compared with 2020. the year-over-year increase in margin is driven by the increase in premium revenue from higher volume, partially offset by the mcr increase discussed below.
the medicare mcr increased to 87.2% in 2021, from 86.0% in 2020, or 120 basis points. the increase was primarily driven by the net effect of covid, including higher direct covid medical costs, resulting from higher infection rates in our medicare population. the net effect of covid had a negligible impact on the mcr in 2020. the medicare mcr is in line with our long-term target despite the net effect of covid.
marketplace marketplace premium revenue increased $1.5 billion in 2021, when compared with 2020, mainly due to higher membership, partially offset by a decrease in premium revenue pmpm. our marketplace membership as of december 31,
2021, amounted to 728,000 members, representing growth of 410,000 members year over year, and substantially exceeding our expectations. this improvement resulted from several factors, including strong product design and competitive pricing, better than expected natural attrition rates, and the extended special enrollment period. the decrease in premium revenue pmpm was mainly driven by changes in business mix, with an increase of members in the bronze metal tier.
the marketplace medical margin increased $75 million in 2021, primarily due to the increase in membership and premiums, mostly offset by an increase in the mcr compared to 2020.
the marketplace mcr increased to 86.9% in 2021, compared to 78.7% in 2020, or 820 basis points. the increase in mcr resulted mainly from a higher net effect of covid, due to continued covid utilization pressure in our largest marketplace geographies, and increased non-covid medical costs by members enrolled through the special enrollment period. special enrollment period membership grew to almost 40% of our marketplace book by the fourth quarter, and many of the new members that we attracted in 2021 were in regions disproportionately affected by covid, particularly in texas. moreover, we attracted a large number of members through the special enrollment period, and those members experienced higher non-covid utilization in addition to covid-related costs.
other the other segment includes service revenues and costs associated with the long-term services and supports consultative services we now provide in wisconsin as a result of our magellan complete care acquisition, and also includes certain corporate amounts not allocated to the medicaid, medicare, or marketplace segments. such amounts were immaterial to our consolidated results of operations for 2021 and 2020.
liquidity and financial condition liquidity we manage our cash, investments, and capital structure to meet the short- and long-term obligations of our business while maintaining liquidity and financial flexibility. we forecast, analyze, and monitor our cash flows to enable prudent investment management and financing within the confines of our financial strategy.

we maintain liquidity at two levels: 1) the regulated health plan subsidiaries; and 2) the parent company.
our regulated health plan subsidiaries' primary liquidity requirements include payment of medical claims and other health care services; payment of certain settlements with our state and federal customers, such as mlr and risk corridors and marketplace risk transfers on behalf of cms; general and administrative costs directly incurred or paid through an administrative services agreement to the parent company; and federal tax payments to the parent company under an intercompany tax sharing agreement. our regulated health plan subsidiaries meet their liquidity needs by generating cash flows from operating activities, primarily from premium revenue; cash flows from investing activities, including investment income and sales of investments; and capital contributions received from our parent company.
our regulated health plan subsidiaries generally receive premiums in advance of payments of claims for medical and other health care services; however, cash and cash equivalents in regulated health plan subsidiaries can fluctuate significantly in a particular period depending on the timing of receipts for premiums from our government partners.
any decline or delay in receipt of premium revenue could have a negative impact on our liquidity. we did not experience noticeable delays to, or changes in, the timing or level of premium receipts in 2021 as a result of the covid-19 pandemic, but there can be no assurance that we will not experience such delays in the future. see further discussion below in "future sources and uses of liquidity-future uses- potential impact of covid-19 pandemic ."
our regulated health plan subsidiaries are each subject to applicable state regulations that, among other things, require the maintenance of minimum levels of capital and surplus. we continue to maintain appropriate levels of aggregate excess statutory capital and surplus in our regulated health plan subsidiaries. see further discussion under "regulatory capital and dividend restrictions" below. when available and as permitted by applicable regulations, cash in excess of the capital needs of our regulated health plan subsidiaries is generally paid in the form of dividends to our parent company to be used for general corporate purposes. the regulated health plan subsidiaries paid dividends to the parent company amounting to $564 million in 2021 and $635 million in 2020.
parent company liquidity requirements generally consist of payment of administrative costs not directly incurred by our regulated operations, including, but not limited to, staffing costs, lease payments, branding and certain information technology services; capital contributions paid to our regulated health plan subsidiaries, including funding for newer health plans; capital expenditures; debt service; funding for common stock purchases, acquisitions and other growth-related activities; and federal tax payments. the parent company contributed capital of $440 million and $107 million in 2021 and 2020, respectively, to our regulated health plan subsidiaries to satisfy statutory capital and surplus requirements. the increased contributions in 2021 were mainly attributed to fund growth in our new york and kentucky health plans. our parent company normally meets its liquidity requirements by earning administrative services fees under administrative services agreements; dividends received from our regulated subsidiaries; collecting federal tax payments from the regulated subsidiaries; proceeds from issuance of debt and equity securities; and cash flows from investing activities, including investment income and sales of investments.
cash, cash equivalents and investments at the parent company amounted to $348 million and $644 million as of december 31, 2021, and 2020, respectively. the decrease in 2021 was due to cash used for acquisitions and share repurchases, partially offset by dividends received from regulated health plan subsidiaries. in the first quarter of 2021, we purchased an aggregate of approximately 577,000 shares for $122 million, and we also paid $6 million to settle shares purchased in late december 2020.
investments after considering expected cash flows from operating activities, we generally invest cash of regulated subsidiaries that exceeds our expected short-term obligations in longer term, investment-grade, and marketable debt securities to improve our overall investment return. these investments are made pursuant to board-approved investment policies which conform to applicable state laws and regulations.
our investment policies are designed to provide liquidity, preserve capital, and maximize total return on invested assets, all in a manner consistent with state requirements that prescribe the types of instruments in which our subsidiaries may invest. these investment policies require that our investments have final maturities of less than
10 years, or less than 10 years average life for structured securities. professional portfolio managers operating under documented guidelines manage our investments and a portion of our cash equivalents. our portfolio managers must obtain our prior approval before selling investments where the loss position of those investments exceeds certain levels.

we believe that the risks of the covid-19 pandemic, as they relate to our investments, are minimal. the overall rating of our portfolio is aa. our investment policy has directives in conjunction with state guidelines to minimize risks and exposures in volatile markets. additionally, our portfolio managers assist us in navigating the current volatility in the capital markets.
our restricted investments are invested principally in cash, cash equivalents, and u.s. treasury securities; we have the ability to hold such restricted investments until maturity. all of our unrestricted investments are classified as current assets.
cash flow activities our cash flows are summarized as follows:

cash equivalents operating activities we typically receive capitation payments monthly, in advance of payments for medical claims; however, government payors may adjust their payment schedules, positively or negatively impacting our reported cash flows from operating activities in any given period. for example, government payors may delay our premium payments, or they may prepay the following month's premium payment.
net cash provided by operations was $2.1 billion in 2021, compared with $1.9 billion of net cash provided in 2020.
the $221 million increase in cash flow was due to the growth in operations and the net impact of timing differences in government receivables and payables.
investing activities net cash used in investing activities was $1.7 billion in 2021, compared with $400 million of net cash used in
2020, a decrease in year-over-year cash flow of $1.3 billion. this change in cash flow was primarily due to increased purchases of investments in 2021, after a temporarily higher allocation in shorter-term invested assets during the covid-19 pandemic was rescinded in the second quarter of 2021.
financing activities net cash used in financing activities was $183 million in 2021, compared with $217 million of net cash provided by
2020, a decrease in year-over-year cash flow of $400 million. in 2021, cash inflows included $740 million from the issuance of the 3.875% notes due 2032, and cash outflows included $723 million in repayment of the 5.375% notes due
2022, common stock purchases of $128 million and $53 million for common stock withheld to settle employee tax obligations. additionally, we paid $23 million to settle contingent consideration liabilities relating to our kentucky passport acquisition that closed in 2020, $20 million of which has been presented as a financing cash outflow. in the year ended december 31, 2020, financing cash inflows included $1,429 million from the issuance of the 4.375% notes due 2028 and 3.875% notes due 2030 and $380 million borrowed under the term loan facility. cash outflows included the $600 million repayment of the term loan facility, common stock purchases of $606 million, which included $7 million to settle shares purchased in late december 2019, and net cash paid for the senior notes-
related transactions amounting to $380 million.
financial condition we believe that our cash resources, borrowing capacity available under our credit agreement as discussed further below in "future sources and uses of liquidity-future sources," and internally generated funds will be sufficient to support our operations, regulatory requirements, debt repayment obligations and capital expenditures for at least the next 12 months.
on a consolidated basis, as of december 31, 2021, our working capital was $3.0 billion compared with $2.9 billion as of december 31, 2020. at december 31, 2021, our cash and investments amounted to $7.9 billion, compared with
$6.2 billion of cash and investments at december 31, 2020.

because of the statutory restrictions that inhibit the ability of our health plan subsidiaries to transfer net assets to us, the amount of retained earnings readily available to pay dividends to our stockholders is generally limited to cash, cash equivalents and investments held by our unregulated parent. for more information, see the
"liquidity" discussion presented above.
regulatory capital and dividend restrictions each of our regulated, wholly owned subsidiaries must maintain a minimum amount of statutory capital determined by statute or regulations. such statutes, regulations and capital requirements also restrict the timing, payment and amount of dividends and other distributions, loans or advances that may be paid to us as the sole stockholder. to the extent our subsidiaries must comply with these regulations, they may not have the financial flexibility to transfer funds to us. based upon current statutes and regulations, the minimum capital and surplus requirement for these subsidiaries was estimated to be approximately $2.1 billion at december 31, 2021, compared with $1.5 billion at december 31, 2020. the aggregate capital and surplus of our wholly owned subsidiaries was in excess of these minimum capital requirements as of both dates.
under applicable regulatory requirements, the amount of dividends that may be paid by our wholly owned subsidiaries without prior approval by regulatory authorities as of december 31, 2021, was approximately $197 million in the aggregate. the subsidiaries may pay dividends over this amount, but only after approval is granted by the regulatory authorities.
based on our cash and investments balances as of december 31, 2021, management believes that our regulated wholly owned subsidiaries remain well capitalized and exceed their regulatory minimum requirements. we have the ability, and have committed to provide, additional capital to each of our health plans as necessary to ensure compliance with statutory capital and surplus requirements.
capital structure in september 2021, our board of directors authorized the purchase of up to $500 million, in the aggregate, of our common stock. this new program immediately supersedes the stock purchase program previously approved by our board of directors in september 2020. this new program will be funded with cash on hand and extends through december 31,
2022.
as debt held by the parent company comes due, we typically engage in a new private offering of debt to retire and replace the prior issuance. over the last several years we have seen a continued decline in interest rates, which has benefited our overall cost of capital during that time. there is no guarantee that the interest rate environment will continue to see declines in interest rates in the future, and future refinancing may occur at a higher rate than those we have achieved historically. this could increase our cost of capital in the future or cause us to pursue alternative financing sources, should the need arise.
we are not a party to any off-balance sheet financing arrangements.
debt ratings each of our senior notes is rated "bb-" by standard & poor's, and "ba3" by moody's investor service, inc. a downgrade in our ratings could adversely affect our borrowing capacity and increase our borrowing costs.
financial covenants the credit agreement contains customary non-financial and financial covenants, including a net leverage ratio and an interest coverage ratio. such ratios are computed as defined by the terms of the credit agreement.
in addition, the indentures governing each of our outstanding senior notes contain cross-default provisions that are triggered upon default by us or any of our subsidiaries on any indebtedness in excess of the amount specified in the applicable indenture. as of december 31, 2021, we were in compliance with all financial and non-financial covenants under the credit agreement and other long-term debt.
future sources and uses of liquidity future sources our regulated subsidiaries generate significant cash flows from premium revenue, which is generally received a short time before related healthcare services are paid. premium revenue is our primary source of liquidity. thus, any decline in the receipt of premium revenue, and our profitability, could have a negative impact on our liquidity.

potential impact of covid-19 pandemic . excluding acquisitions and our exit from puerto rico, we have added approximately 750,000 new medicaid members since march 31, 2020, when we first began to report on the impacts of the pandemic. we believe this membership increase was mainly due to the suspension of redeterminations for medicaid eligibility. we expect medicaid enrollment to continue to benefit from the extension of the phe period, and the associated pause on membership redeterminations, at least through mid-april 2022.
dividends from subsidiaries. when available and as permitted by applicable regulations, cash in excess of the capital needs of our regulated health plans is generally paid in the form of dividends to our unregulated parent company to be used for general corporate purposes. as a result of the covid-19 pandemic, state regulators could restrict the ability of our regulated health plan subsidiaries to pay dividends to the parent company, which could reduce the liquidity of the parent company. for more information on our regulatory capital requirements and dividend restrictions, refer to notes to consolidated financial statements, note 15, "commitments and contingencies-regulatory capital requirements and dividend restrictions," and note 17, "condensed financial information of registrant-note c - dividends and capital contributions."
credit agreement borrowing capacity. as of december 31, 2021, we had available borrowing capacity of $1 billion under the revolving credit facility of our credit agreement. in addition, the credit agreement provides for a $15
million swingline sub-facility and a $100 million letter of credit sub-facility, as well as incremental term loans available to finance certain acquisitions up to $500 million, plus an unlimited amount of such term loans as long as we maintain a minimum consolidated net leverage ratio. see further discussion in the notes to consolidated financial statements, note 11, "debt."
future uses common stock purchases. in september 2021, our board of directors authorized the purchase of up to $500 million, in the aggregate, of our common stock. this new program immediately supersedes the stock purchase program previously approved by our board of directors in september 2020. this new program will be funded with cash on hand and extends through december 31, 2022. the exact timing and amount of any repurchase is determined by management based on market conditions and share price, in addition to other factors, and subject to the restrictions relating to volume, price, and timing under applicable law. as of february 14, 2022, $500 million remained available to purchase our common stock under this program through december 31, 2022. see further information in the notes to consolidated financial statements, note 13, "stockholders' equity."
acquisitions . we have a disciplined and steady approach to growth. organic growth, which includes leveraging our existing health plan portfolio and winning new territories, is our highest priority. in addition to organic growth, we will consider targeted acquisitions that are a strategic fit that we believe will leverage operational synergies, and lead to incremental earnings accretion. for further information on our acquisitions, refer to the notes to consolidated financial statements, note 4, "business combinations."
on october 7, 2021, we announced a definitive agreement to acquire the medicaid managed long term care business of agewell new york. as of august 31, 2021, agewell served approximately 13,000 managed long-term services and supports members, with full-year 2020 premium revenue of approximately $700 million. the purchase price for the transaction is approximately $106 million, net of certain tax benefits and target allocation of required regulatory capital, which we intend to fund with cash on hand. the transaction is subject to applicable federal and state regulatory approvals and the satisfaction of other customary closing conditions. we currently expect the transaction to close by the third quarter of 2022.
potential impact of covid-19 pandemic . as described in "item 1. business-covid-19 pandemic," we have been subject to medicaid risk corridors as a result of the pandemic. beginning in 2020, through december 31, 2021, various states enacted temporary risk corridors in response to the reduced demand for medical services stemming from covid-19, which have resulted in a reduction of our medical margin, primarily in the medicaid segment. in some cases, these risk corridors were retroactive to earlier periods in 2020, or as early as the beginning of the states' fiscal years in 2019. beginning in the second quarter of 2020, we have recognized retroactive risk corridors that we believe to be probable, and where the ultimate premium amount is reasonably estimable. we recognized approximately $323 million, in the aggregate, related to such risk corridors, in 2021, and approximately
$564 million, in the aggregate, was recognized in 2020.
it is possible that certain states could change the structure of existing risk corridors, implement new risk corridors in the future or discontinue existing risk corridors. due to these uncertainties, the ultimate outcomes could differ materially from our estimates as a result of changes in facts or further developments, which could have an adverse effect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.

regulatory capital requirements and dividend restrictions. we have the ability, and have committed to provide, additional capital to each of our health plans as necessary to ensure compliance with minimum statutory capital requirements.
the molina healthcare charitable foundation. in august 2020, we announced our commitment of $150 million to fund the molina healthcare charitable foundation (the "foundation"), an independent not-for-profit charitable foundation. we contributed $15 million to the foundation in the fourth quarter of 2020.
contractual obligations. we are party to various contractual obligations that we will be required to satisfy over the short and long term. the majority are discussed in the notes to consolidated financial statements and primarily include the following: medical claims and benefits payable, amounts due to government agencies, principal and interest on our debt and leases. some items are based on management's estimates and assumptions about obligations, including duration, the possibility of renewal, anticipated actions by third parties, and other factors. because these estimates and assumptions are necessarily subjective, the contractual obligations we will actually pay in future periods may vary. additionally, we have a variety of other contractual agreements related to acquiring services used in our operations. however, we believe these other agreements do not contain material non-cancelable commitments.
critical accounting estimates when we prepare our consolidated financial statements, we use estimates and assumptions that may affect reported amounts and disclosures. actual results could differ from these estimates, and some differences could be material.
our most significant accounting estimates, which include a higher degree of judgment and/or complexity, include the following:
• medical claims and benefits payable. see discussion below, and refer to the notes to consolidated financial statements, notes 2, "significant accounting policies," and 10, "medical claims and benefits payable" for more information.
• contractual provisions that may adjust or limit revenue or profit. for a discussion of this topic, including amounts recorded in our consolidated financial statements, refer to the notes to consolidated financial statements, note 2, "significant accounting policies."
• quality incentives. for a discussion of this topic, refer to the notes to consolidated financial statements, note
2, "significant accounting policies."
• business combinations, and goodwill and intangible assets, net. for a comprehensive discussion of this topic, including amounts recorded in our consolidated financial statements, refer to the notes to consolidated financial statements, note 2, "significant accounting policies," note 4, "business combinations," and note 9, "goodwill and intangible assets, net."
medical care costs, medical claims and benefits payable medical care costs are recognized in the period in which services are provided and include fee-for-service claims, pharmacy benefits, capitation payments to providers, and various other medically-related costs. under fee-for-
service claims arrangements with providers, we retain the financial responsibility for medical care provided and incur costs based on actual utilization of hospital and physician services. such medical care costs include amounts paid by us as well as estimated medical claims and benefits payable for costs that were incurred but not paid as of the reporting date ("ibnp"). pharmacy benefits represent payments for members' prescription drug costs, net of rebates from drug manufacturers. we estimate pharmacy rebates based on historical and current utilization of prescription drugs and contractual provisions. capitation payments represent monthly contractual fees paid to providers, who are responsible for providing medical care to members, which could include medical or ancillary costs like dental, vision and other supplemental health benefits. such capitation costs are fixed in advance of the periods covered and are not subject to significant accounting estimates. other medical care costs include all medically-related administrative costs, amounts due to providers pursuant to risk-sharing or other incentive arrangements, provider claims, and other healthcare expenses. examples of medically-related administrative costs include expenses relating to health education, quality assurance, case management, care coordination, disease management, and 24-hour on-call nurses. additionally, we include an estimate for the cost of settling claims incurred through the reporting date in our medical claims and benefits payable liability.

the following table illustrates consolidated medical care costs by type for the periods indicated:

medical claims and benefits payable consist mainly of fee-for-service ibnp, unpaid pharmacy claims, capitation costs, other medical costs, including amounts payable to providers pursuant to risk-sharing or other incentive arrangements and amounts payable to providers on behalf of certain state agencies for certain state assessments in which we assume no financial risk. ibnp includes the costs of claims incurred as of the balance sheet date which have been reported to us, and our best estimate of the cost of claims incurred but not yet reported to us. we also include an additional reserve to ensure that our overall ibnp liability is sufficient under moderately adverse conditions. we reflect changes in these estimates in the consolidated results of operations in the period in which they are determined.
the estimation of the ibnp liability requires a significant degree of judgment in applying actuarial methods, determining the appropriate assumptions and considering numerous factors. of those factors, we consider estimated completion factors (measures the cumulative percentage of claims expense that will ultimately be paid for a given month of service based on historical payment patterns) and the assumed healthcare cost trend (the year-over-year change in per-member per-month medical care costs) to be the most critical assumptions. other relevant factors also include, but are not limited to, healthcare service utilization trends, claim inventory levels, changes in membership, product mix, seasonality, benefit changes or changes in fee schedules, provider contract changes, prior authorizations and the incidence of catastrophic or pandemic cases.
for claims incurred more than three months before the financial statement date, we mainly use estimated completion factors to estimate the ultimate cost of those claims. completion factors measure the cumulative percentage of claims expense that will ultimately be paid for a given month of service based on historical claims payment patterns. we analyze historical claims payment patterns by comparing claim incurred dates to claim payment dates to estimate completion factors. the estimated completion factors are then applied to claims paid through the financial statement date to estimate the ultimate claims cost for a given month's incurred claim activity. the difference between the estimated ultimate claims cost and the claims paid through the financial statement date represents our estimate of claims remaining to be paid as of the financial statement date and is included in our ibnp liability .
for claims incurred within three months before the financial statement date, actual claims paid are a less reliable measure of our ultimate cost since a large portion of medical claims are not submitted to us until several months after services have been submitted. accordingly, we estimate our ibnp liability for claims incurred during these months based on a blend of estimated completion factors and assumed medical care cost trend. the assumed medical care cost trend represents the year-over-year change in per-member per-month medical care costs, which can be affected by many factors including, but not limited to, our ability and practices to manage medical and pharmaceutical costs, changes in level and mix of services utilized, mix of benefits offered, including the impact of co-pays and deductibles, changes in medical practices, changes in member demographics, catastrophes and epidemics , and other relevant factors.
actuarial standards of practice generally require a level of confidence such that our overall best estimate of the ibnp liability has a greater probability of being adequate versus being insufficient, where the liability is sufficient to account for moderately adverse conditions. adverse conditions are situations that may cause actual claims to be higher than the otherwise estimated value of such claims at the time of the estimate, such as changes in the magnitude or severity of claims, uncertainties related to our entry into new geographical markets or provision of services to new populations, changes in state-controlled fee schedules, and modifications or upgrades to our claims processing systems and practices. therefore, in many situations, the claim amounts ultimately settled will be less than the estimate that satisfies the actuarial standards of practice.

when subsequent actual claims payments are less than we estimated, we recognize a benefit for favorable prior period development that is reported as part of "components of medical care costs related to: "prior years" in the table presented in note 10, "medical claims and benefits payable." our reserving practice is to consistently recognize the actuarial best estimate including a provision for moderately adverse conditions for each current period. this provision is reported as part of "components of medical care costs related to: current year" in the table presented in note 10. assuming stability in the size of our membership, the use of this consistent methodology, during any given period, usually results in the replenishment of reserves at a level that generally offsets the benefit of favorable prior period development in that period. in the case of material growth or decline of membership, replenishment can exceed or fall short of the favorable development, assuming all other factors remain unchanged.
because of the significant degree of judgment involved in estimation of our ibnp liability, there is considerable variability and uncertainty inherent in such estimates. the following table reflects the hypothetical change in our estimate of claims liability as of december 31, 2021 that would result if we change our completion factors for the fourth through the twelfth months preceding december 31, 2021, by the percentages indicated. a reduction in the completion factor results in an increase in medical claims liabilities. dollar amounts are in millions.

there are many related factors working in conjunction with one another that determine the accuracy of our estimates, some of which are qualitative in nature rather than quantitative. therefore, we are seldom able to quantify the impact that any single factor has on a change in estimate. given the variability inherent in the reserving process, we will only be able to identify specific factors if they represent a significant departure from expectations. as a result, we do not expect to be able to fully quantify the impact of individual factors on changes in estimates.

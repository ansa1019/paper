we have established procedures based on legal and regulatory requirements on a worldwide basis that are designed to facilitate compliance with applicable statutory and regulatory requirements and to require that our policies relating to business conduct, ethics and practices are followed globally. in addition, we have established procedures to mitigate the risk that a counterparty's performance obligations will be unenforceable, including consideration of counterparty legal authority and capacity, adequacy of legal documentation, the permissibility of a transaction under applicable law and whether applicable bankruptcy or insolvency laws limit or alter contractual remedies. the heightened legal and regulatory focus on the financial services and banking industries globally presents a continuing business challenge for us.
december 2021 form 10-k financial statements and supplementary data report of independent registered public accounting firm to the shareholders and the board of directors of morgan stanley:
opinion on the financial statements we have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of morgan stanley and subsidiaries (the "firm") as of december 31, 2021 and 2020, the related consolidated income statements, comprehensive income statements, cash flow statements and statements of changes in total equity for each of the three years in the period ended december 31, 2021, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the "financial statements"). in our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the firm as of december 31, 2021 and 2020, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended december 31, 2021, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america.
we have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the public company accounting oversight board (united states) (pcaob), the firm's internal control over financial reporting as of december 31, 2021, based on criteria established in internal control - integrated framework (2013) issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission and our report dated february 24, 2022, expressed an unqualified opinion on the firm's internal control over financial reporting.
basis for opinion these financial statements are the responsibility of the firm's management. our responsibility is to express an opinion on the firm's financial statements based on our audits. we are a public accounting firm registered with the pcaob and are required to be independent with respect to the firm in accordance with the u.s. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the securities and exchange commission and the pcaob.
we conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the pcaob. those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. we believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
critical audit matters the critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current-period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. the communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.
valuation of level 3 financial assets and liabilities carried at fair value on a recurring basis-refer to note 5 to the financial statements critical audit matter description the firm's trading and financing activities result in the firm carrying material financial instruments having limited price transparency. these financial instruments can span a broad array of product types and generally include derivative, security, loan, and borrowing positions. as described in note 5, these level 3 financial instruments approximate $11.9 billion and $6.2 billion, respectively, of financial assets and liabilities carried at fair value on a recurring basis at december 31, 2021. unlike financial instruments whose inputs are readily observable and, therefore, more easily independently corroborated, the valuation of financial instruments classified as level 3 is inherently subjective and often involves the use of unobservable inputs and proprietary valuation models whose underlying algorithms and valuation methodologies are complex.
we identified the valuation of level 3 financial assets and liabilities carried at fair value on a recurring basis as a critical audit matter given the firm uses complex valuation models and/or model inputs that are not observable in the marketplace to determine the respective fair values. performing our audit procedures to evaluate the appropriateness of these models and inputs involved a high degree of auditor judgment, professionals with specialized skills and knowledge, and an increased extent of testing.
how the critical audit matter was addressed in the audit our audit procedures related to the valuation of level 3 financial assets and liabilities carried at fair value on a recurring basis included the following, among others:
•we tested the design and operating effectiveness of the firm's internal controls that address fair value estimates, including model review and price verification. the firm maintains these internal controls to assess the appropriateness of its valuation methodologies and the relevant inputs and assumptions used to determine fair value estimates.

•we independently evaluated the appropriateness of management's significant valuation methodologies, including the input assumptions, considering the expected assumptions of other market participants and external data when available.
•we developed independent fair value estimates for selected level 3 financial instruments, using externally sourced inputs and independent valuation models, and used such estimates to further evaluate management's fair value estimates. for certain of our selected level 3 financial instruments, this included a comparison to the firm's fair value estimates for similar transactions and an evaluation of the firm's assumptions inclusive of the inputs, as applicable.
•we tested the revenues arising from the trade date fair value estimates for selected structured transactions classified as level 3 financial instruments. for certain of our selected transactions, we developed independent fair value estimates to test the valuation inputs and assumptions used by the firm and evaluated whether these methods were consistent with relevant firm valuation policies.
•we assessed the consistency by which management has applied significant and unobservable valuation assumptions used in developing fair value estimates.
•we performed a retrospective assessment of management's fair value estimates for certain of our selected level 3 financial instruments, for which there were events or transactions occurring after the valuation date. we did so by comparing management's estimates to the relevant evidence provided by such events or transactions, as applicable.
intangible assets-valuation of customer relationship and indefinite lived management contract intangible assets for the eaton vance acquisition-refer to note 3 to the financial statements critical audit matter description on march 1, 2021, the firm completed the acquisition of eaton vance for approximately $8.7 billion. this business combination was recognized using the acquisition method of accounting. accordingly, the purchase price was allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their fair values, including identified intangibles of approximately $4 billion. the intangibles included customer relationships of $1.5 billion and indefinite lived management contracts of $2.1 billion. management, with the assistance of a valuation specialist, estimated the fair value of the intangible assets by discounting the forecasted future cash flows. the determination of fair value of the identified intangible assets involves significant estimates and assumptions related to forecasted future cash flows including revenue growth rates and the selection of the discount rates.
we identified the valuation of customer relationship and indefinite lived management contract intangible assets as a critical audit matter because the fair value determination requires management to make significant estimates and assumptions in determining the forecasted future cash flows including revenue growth rates and the selection of the respective discount rates. performing audit procedures to evaluate the reasonableness of these estimates and assumptions required a high degree of auditor judgment and an increased extent of effort, including the involvement of our valuation specialists.
how the critical audit matter was addressed in the audit our audit procedures related to the valuation of customer relationship and indefinite lived management contract intangible assets acquired as part of the eaton vance acquisition included the following, among others:
•we performed sensitivity analyses to evaluate the impact of changes in assumptions on the valuation of the customer relationship and indefinite lived management contract intangible assets.
•we tested the operating effectiveness of internal controls over the valuation methodology used, the determination of forecasted future cash flows, assumptions relating to revenue growth and the selection of the discount rates.
•we assessed the knowledge, skill, ability and objectivity of management's valuation specialist and evaluated the work performed.
•we evaluated the appropriateness of the valuation methodology used and the reasonableness of the forecasted future cash flows for the customer relationship and indefinite lived management contract intangible assets, specifically the assumptions relating to the revenue growth rates. further, we evaluated whether the assumptions used were reasonable considering external market and industry data as well as the past performance of eaton vance.
•we tested the source information underlying the determination of the revenue growth and discount rates and also tested the mathematical accuracy of the calculations.
•we developed a range of independent estimates of discount rates for the customer relationship and indefinite lived management contract intangible assets and compared those to the discount rates utilized by management.

1. introduction and basis of presentation the firm morgan stanley is a global financial services firm that maintains significant market positions in each of its business segments-institutional securities, wealth management and investment management. morgan stanley, through its subsidiaries and affiliates, provides a wide variety of products and services to a large and diversified group of clients and customers, including corporations, governments, financial institutions and individuals. unless the context otherwise requires, the terms "morgan stanley" or the "firm" mean morgan stanley (the "parent company") together with its consolidated subsidiaries. see the "glossary of common terms and acronyms" for the definition of certain terms and acronyms used throughout this form 10-k.
a description of the clients and principal products and services of each of the firm's business segments is as follows:
institutional securities provides a variety of products and services to corporations, governments, financial institutions and ultra-high net worth clients. investment banking services consist of capital raising and financial advisory services, including the underwriting of debt, equity and other securities, as well as advice on mergers and acquisitions, restructurings and project finance. our equity and fixed income businesses include sales, financing, prime brokerage, market-making, asia wealth management services and certain business-related investments. lending activities include originating corporate loans and commercial real estate loans, providing secured lending facilities, and extending securities-based and other financing to customers. other activities include research.
wealth management provides a comprehensive array of financial services and solutions to individual investors and small to medium-sized businesses and institutions covering: financial advisor-led brokerage and investment advisory services; self-directed brokerage services; financial and wealth planning services; workplace services, including stock plan administration; annuity and insurance products; securities-based lending, residential real estate loans and other lending products; banking; and retirement plan services.
investment management provides a broad range of investment strategies and products that span geographies, asset classes, and public and private markets to a diverse group of clients across institutional and intermediary channels. strategies and products, which are offered through a variety of investment vehicles, include equity, fixed income, alternatives and solutions, and liquidity and overlay services. institutional clients include defined benefit/defined contribution plans, foundations, endowments, government entities, sovereign wealth funds, insurance companies, third-party fund sponsors and corporations. individual clients are generally served through intermediaries, including affiliated and non-affiliated distributors.
basis of financial information the financial statements are prepared in accordance with u.s. gaap, which requires the firm to make estimates and assumptions regarding the valuations of certain financial instruments, the valuations of goodwill and intangible assets, the outcome of legal and tax matters, deferred tax assets, acl, and other matters that affect its financial statements and related disclosures. the firm believes that the estimates utilized in the preparation of its financial statements are prudent and reasonable. actual results could differ materially from these estimates.
the financial statements reflect the effects of the following reclassifications to prior period amounts. the provision for credit losses for loans and lending commitments is presented as a separate line in the income statements. previously, the provision for credit losses for loans was included in other revenues, and the provision for credit losses for lending commitments was included in other expenses. in addition, economic hedges of certain held-for-sale and held-for-investment loans, which were previously reported in trading revenues, are reported in other revenues.
the notes are an integral part of the firm's financial statements. the firm has evaluated subsequent events for adjustment to or disclosure in these financial statements through the date of this report and has not identified any recordable or disclosable events not otherwise reported in these financial statements or the notes thereto.
consolidation the financial statements include the accounts of the firm, its wholly owned subsidiaries and other entities in which the firm has a controlling financial interest, including certain vies (see note 16). intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated. for consolidated subsidiaries that are not wholly owned, the third-party holdings of equity interests are referred to as noncontrolling interests. the net income attributable to noncontrolling interests for such subsidiaries is presented as net income applicable to noncontrolling interests in the income statement. the portion of shareholders' equity that is attributable to noncontrolling interests for such subsidiaries is presented as noncontrolling interests, a component of total equity, in the balance sheet.
for entities where the total equity investment at risk is sufficient to enable the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support and the equity holders bear the residual economic risks and returns of the entity and have the power to direct the activities of the entity that most significantly affect its economic performance, the firm consolidates those entities it controls either through a majority voting interest or otherwise. for vies (i.e., entities december 2021 form 10-k notes to consolidated financial statements that do not meet the aforementioned criteria), the firm consolidates those entities where it has the power to make the decisions that most significantly affect the economic performance of the vie and has the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits that could potentially be significant to the vie.
for investments in entities in which the firm does not have a controlling financial interest but has significant influence over operating and financial decisions, it applies the equity method of accounting with net gains and losses recorded within other revenues (see note 12) unless the firm has elected to measure the investment at fair value, in which case net gains and losses are recorded within investments revenues (see note 5).
equity and partnership interests held by entities qualifying for accounting purposes as investment companies are carried at fair value.

•morgan stanley smith barney llc ("mssb"),
•morgan stanley europe se ("msese"),

2. significant accounting policies revenue recognition revenues are recognized when the promised goods or services are delivered to our customers in an amount that is based on the consideration the firm expects to receive in exchange for those goods or services when such amounts are not probable of significant reversal.
investment banking revenues from investment banking activities consist of revenues earned from underwriting, primarily equity and fixed income securities and loan syndications, and advisory fees, primarily for mergers, acquisitions and restructurings.
underwriting revenues are generally recognized on trade date if there is no uncertainty or contingency related to the amount to be paid. underwriting costs are deferred and recognized in the relevant non-interest expenses line items when the related underwriting revenues are recorded.
advisory fees are recognized as advice is provided to the client, based on the estimated progress of work and when revenues are not probable of a significant reversal. advisory costs are recognized as incurred in the relevant non-interest expenses line items, including those reimbursed.
commissions and fees commission and fee revenues generally result from transaction-based arrangements in which the client is charged a fee for the execution of transactions. such revenues primarily arise from transactions in equity securities; services related to sales and trading activities; and sales of mutual funds, alternative funds, futures, insurance products and options, as well as revenues from order flow payments for directing customer orders to broker-dealers, exchanges, and market centers for execution. commission and fee revenues are recognized on trade date when the performance obligation is satisfied.
asset management revenues asset management, distribution and administration fees are generally based on related asset levels being managed, such as the aum of a customer's account or the net asset value of a fund. these fees are generally recognized when services are performed and the fees become known. management fees are reduced by estimated fee waivers and expense caps, if any, provided to the customer.
performance-based fees not in the form of carried interest are recorded when the annual performance target is met and the revenues are not probable of a significant reversal.
sales commissions paid by the firm in connection with the sale of certain classes of shares of its open-end mutual fund products are accounted for as deferred commission assets and amortized to expense over the expected life of the contract. the firm periodically tests deferred commission assets for recoverability based on cash flows expected to be received in future periods. other asset management and distribution costs are recognized as incurred in the relevant non-interest expenses line items.
carried interest the firm is entitled to receive performance-based fees in the form of carried interest when the return in certain funds exceeds specified performance targets. when the firm earns carried interest from funds as specified performance thresholds are met, that carried interest and any related general or limited partner interest are accounted for under the equity method of accounting and measured based on the firm's claim on the nav of the fund at the reporting date, taking into account the distribution terms applicable to the interest held. such items are reflected within investment revenues.
december 2021 form 10-k notes to consolidated financial statements see note 23 for information regarding the net cumulative unrealized amount of performance-based fee revenues at risk of reversal. see note 15 for information regarding general partner guarantees, which include potential obligations to return performance fee distributions previously received.
other items revenues from certain commodities-related contracts are recognized as the promised goods or services are delivered to the customer.
receivables from contracts with customers are recognized in customer and other receivables in the balance sheet when the underlying performance obligations have been satisfied and the firm has the right per the contract to bill the customer. contract assets are recognized in other assets when the firm has satisfied its performance obligations but customer payment is conditional. contract liabilities are recognized in other liabilities when the firm has collected payment from a customer based on the terms of the contract but the underlying performance obligations are not yet satisfied.
for contracts with a term of less than one year, incremental costs to obtain the contract are expensed as incurred. revenues are not discounted when payment is expected within one year.
the firm generally presents, net within revenues, taxes assessed by a governmental authority that are both imposed on and concurrent with a specific revenue-producing transaction and collected by the firm from a customer.
cash and cash equivalents cash and cash equivalents consist of cash and due from banks and interest bearing deposits with banks. cash equivalents are highly liquid investments with remaining maturities of three months or less from the acquisition date that are readily convertible to cash and are not held for trading purposes.
cash and cash equivalents also include restricted cash such as cash segregated in compliance with federal or other regulations, including minimum reserve requirements set by the federal reserve bank and other central banks, and the firm's initial margin deposited with clearing organizations.
fair value of financial instruments instruments within trading assets and trading liabilities are measured at fair value, either as required or allowed by accounting guidance. these financial instruments primarily represent the firm's trading and investment positions and include both cash and derivative products. in addition, securities classified as afs are measured at fair value.
gains and losses on instruments carried at fair value are reflected in trading revenues, investments revenues or investment banking revenues in the income statement, except for gains and losses related to available-for-sale ("afs") securities (see "afs investment securities" section herein and note 8) and derivatives accounted for as hedges, as well as economic derivative hedges associated with certain held-for-sale and held-for-investment corporate loans and lending commitments (see "hedge accounting" and "other hedges" herein and note 7).
interest income and interest expense are recorded within the income statement depending on the nature of the instrument and related market conventions. when interest is included as a component of the instruments' fair value, interest is recorded within trading revenues or investments revenues. otherwise, it is recorded within interest income or interest expense. dividend income is recorded in trading revenues or investments revenues depending on the business activity.
the fair value of otc financial instruments, including derivative contracts related to financial instruments and commodities, is presented in the accompanying balance sheet on a net-by-counterparty basis, when appropriate. additionally, the firm nets the fair value of cash collateral paid or received against the fair value amounts recognized for net derivative positions executed with the same counterparty under the same master netting agreement.
fair value option the firm has elected to measure certain eligible instruments at fair value, including securities purchased under agreements to resell, loans and lending commitments, equity method investments and certain other assets, deposits, securities sold under agreements to repurchase, other secured financings and borrowings.
fair value measurement-definition and hierarchy fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability (i.e., the "exit price") in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date.
fair value is a market-based measure considered from the perspective of a market participant rather than an entity-specific measure. therefore, even when market assumptions are not readily available, assumptions are set to reflect those that the firm believes market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability at the measurement date. where the firm manages a group of financial assets, financial liabilities, and nonfinancial items accounted for as derivatives on the basis of its net exposure to either market risks or credit risk, the firm measures the fair value of that group of financial instruments consistently with how market participants would price the net risk exposure at the measurement date.
in determining fair value, the firm uses various valuation approaches and establishes a hierarchy for inputs used in measuring fair value that requires the most observable inputs be used when available.
december 2021 form 10-k notes to consolidated financial statements observable inputs are inputs that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability that were developed based on market data obtained from sources independent of the firm. unobservable inputs are inputs that reflect assumptions the firm believes other market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability that are developed based on the best information available in the circumstances. the fair value hierarchy is broken down into three levels based on the observability of inputs as follows, with level 1 being the highest and level 3 being the lowest level:
level 1.    valuations based on quoted prices in active markets that the firm has the ability to access for identical assets or liabilities. valuation adjustments, block discounts and discounts for entity-specific restrictions that would not transfer to market participants are not applied to level 1 instruments. since valuations are based on quoted prices that are readily and regularly available in an active market, valuation of these products does not entail a significant degree of judgment.
level 2.    valuations based on one or more quoted prices in markets that are not active or for which all significant inputs are observable, either directly or indirectly.
level 3.    valuations based on inputs that are unobservable and significant to the overall fair value measurement.
the availability of observable inputs can vary from product to product and is affected by a wide variety of factors, including the type of product, whether the product is new and not yet established in the marketplace, the liquidity of markets and other characteristics particular to the product. to the extent that valuation is based on models or inputs that are less observable or unobservable in the market, the determination of fair value requires more judgment. accordingly, the degree of judgment exercised by the firm in determining fair value is greatest for instruments categorized in level 3 of the fair value hierarchy.
the firm considers prices and inputs that are current as of the measurement date, including during periods of market dislocation. in periods of market dislocation, the observability of prices and inputs may be reduced for many instruments. this condition could cause an instrument to be reclassified from level 1 to level 2 or from level 2 to level 3 of the fair value hierarchy.
in certain cases, the inputs used to measure fair value may fall into different levels of the fair value hierarchy. in such cases, the total fair value amount is disclosed in the level appropriate for the lowest level input that is significant to the total fair value of the asset or liability.
valuation techniques many cash instruments and otc derivative contracts have bid and ask prices that can be observed in the marketplace. bid prices reflect the highest price that a party is willing to pay for an asset. ask prices represent the lowest price that a party is willing to accept for an asset. the firm carries positions at the point within the bid-ask range that meets its best estimate of fair value. for offsetting positions in the same financial instrument, the same price within the bid-ask spread is used to measure both the long and short positions.
fair value for many cash instruments and otc derivative contracts is derived using pricing models. pricing models take into account the contract terms, as well as multiple inputs, including, where applicable, commodity prices, equity prices, interest rate yield curves, credit curves, correlation, creditworthiness of the counterparty, creditworthiness of the firm, option volatility and currency rates.
where appropriate, valuation adjustments are made to account for various factors such as liquidity risk (bid-ask adjustments), credit quality, model uncertainty, and concentration risk and funding in order to arrive at fair value. adjustments for liquidity risk adjust model-derived mid-market amounts of level 2 and level 3 financial instruments for the bid-mid or mid-ask spread required to properly reflect the exit price of a risk position. bid-mid and mid-ask spreads are marked to levels observed in trade activity, broker quotes or other external third-party data. where these spreads are unobservable for the particular position in question, spreads are derived from observable levels of similar positions.
the firm applies credit-related valuation adjustments to its borrowings for which the fair value option was elected and to otc derivatives. the firm considers the impact of changes in its own credit spreads based upon observations of the secondary bond market spreads when measuring the fair value for borrowings.
for otc derivatives, the impact of changes in both the firm's and the counterparty's credit rating is considered when measuring fair value. in determining the expected exposure, the firm simulates the distribution of the future exposure to a counterparty, then applies market-based default probabilities to the future exposure, leveraging external third-party cds spread data. where cds spread data are unavailable for a specific counterparty, bond market spreads, cds spread data based on the counterparty's credit rating or cds spread data that reference a comparable counterparty may be utilized. the firm also considers collateral held and legally enforceable master netting agreements that mitigate its exposure to each counterparty.
adjustments for model uncertainty are taken for positions whose underlying models are reliant on significant inputs that are neither directly nor indirectly observable, hence requiring reliance on established theoretical concepts in their derivation. these adjustments are derived by making assessments of the possible degree of variability using statistical approaches and market-based information where possible.
the firm may apply concentration adjustments to certain of its otc derivative portfolios to reflect the additional cost of closing out a particularly large risk exposure. where possible, december 2021 form 10-k notes to consolidated financial statements these adjustments are based on observable market information, but in many instances, significant judgment is required to estimate the costs of closing out concentrated risk exposures due to the lack of liquidity in the marketplace.
the firm applies an fva in the fair value measurements of otc uncollateralized or partially collateralized derivatives and in collateralized derivatives where the terms of the agreement do not permit the reuse of the collateral received. in general, fva reflects a market funding risk premium inherent in the noted derivative instruments. the methodology for measuring fva leverages the firm's existing credit-related valuation adjustment calculation methodologies, which apply to both assets and liabilities.
see note 5 for a description of valuation techniques applied to the major categories of financial instruments measured at fair value.
assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis certain of the firm's assets and liabilities are measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis. the firm incurs losses or gains for any adjustments of these assets or liabilities to fair value.
for assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis, fair value is determined by using various valuation approaches. the same hierarchy for inputs as described above, which requires that observable inputs be used when available, is used in measuring fair value for these items.
for further information on financial assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value on a recurring and non-recurring basis, see note 5.
offsetting of derivative instruments in connection with its derivative activities, the firm generally enters into master netting agreements and collateral agreements with its counterparties. these agreements provide the firm with the right, in the event of a default by the counterparty, to net a counterparty's rights and obligations under the agreement and to liquidate and set off cash collateral against any net amount owed by the counterparty. derivatives with enforceable master netting agreements are reported net of cash collateral received and posted.
however, in certain circumstances, the firm may not have such an agreement in place; the relevant insolvency regime may not support the enforceability of the master netting agreement or collateral agreement; or the firm may not have sought legal advice to support the enforceability of the agreement. in cases where the firm has not determined an agreement to be enforceable, the related amounts are not offset (see note 7).
the firm's policy is generally to receive cash and/or securities posted as collateral (with rights of rehypothecation), irrespective of the enforceability determination regarding the master netting and collateral agreement. in certain cases, the firm may agree for such collateral to be posted to a third-party custodian under a control agreement that enables it to take control of such collateral in the event of a counterparty default. the enforceability of the master netting agreement is taken into account in the firm's risk management practices and application of counterparty credit limits.
for information related to offsetting of derivatives, see note 7.
hedge accounting the firm applies hedge accounting using various derivative financial instruments for the following types of hedges: hedges of changes in the fair value of assets and liabilities due to the risk being hedged (fair value hedges); and hedges of net investments in foreign operations whose functional currency is different from the reporting currency of the parent company (net investment hedges). these financial instruments are included within trading assets-derivative and other contracts or trading liabilities-derivative and other contracts in the balance sheet. for hedges where hedge accounting is being applied, the firm performs effectiveness testing and other procedures.
fair value hedges-interest rate risk the firm's designated fair value hedges consist of interest rate swaps designated as hedges of changes in the benchmark interest rate of certain fixed rate afs securities and senior borrowings. the firm also designates interest rate swaps as fair value hedges of changes in the benchmark interest rate of certain fixed rate deposits. the firm is permitted to hedge the full, or part of the, contractual term of the hedged instrument. the firm uses regression analysis to perform an ongoing prospective and retrospective assessment of the effectiveness of these hedging relationships. a hedging relationship is deemed effective if the change in fair value of the hedging instrument (derivative) and the change in fair value of the hedged item (afs security, deposit liability or borrowing), due to changes in the benchmark interest rate, offset within a range of 80% to 125%. the firm considers the impact of valuation adjustments related to counterparty credit spreads and its own credit spreads to determine whether they would cause the hedging relationship to be ineffective.
for qualifying fair value hedges of benchmark interest rates, the change in the fair value of the derivative, offset by the change in the fair value attributable to the change in the benchmark interest rate risk of the hedged asset (liability), is recognized in earnings each period as a component of interest income (expense). for afs securities, the change in fair value of the hedged item due to changes other than the risk being hedged will continue to be reported in oci. when a derivative is de-designated as a hedge, any basis adjustment december 2021 form 10-k notes to consolidated financial statements remaining on the hedged asset (liability) is amortized to interest income (expense) over the remaining life of the asset (liability) using the effective interest method.
net investment hedges the firm uses forward foreign exchange contracts to manage a portion of the currency exposure relating to its net investments in foreign operations. to the extent that the notional amounts of the hedging instruments equal the portion of the investments being hedged and the underlying exchange rate of the derivative hedging instrument is the same as the exchange rate between the functional currency of the investee and the intermediate parent entity's functional currency, it is considered to be perfectly effective, with no income statement recognition. the gain or loss from revaluing hedges of net investments in foreign operations at the spot rate is reported within aoci. the forward points on the hedging instruments are excluded from hedge effectiveness testing and changes in the fair value of this excluded component are recorded currently in interest income.
other hedges in addition to hedges that are designated and qualify for hedge accounting, the firm uses derivatives to economically hedge credit risk associated with certain held-for-sale and held-for-investment corporate loans and lending commitments, and the related gains and losses are reported within other revenues in the income statement.
for further information on derivative instruments and hedging activities, see note 7.
afs investment securities afs securities are reported at fair value in the balance sheet. interest income, including amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts, is included in interest income in the income statement. unrealized gains are recorded in oci, and unrealized losses are recorded either in oci or in other revenues as described below.
afs securities in an unrealized loss position are first evaluated to determine whether there is an intent to sell or it is more likely than not the firm will be required to sell before recovery of the amortized cost basis. if so, the amortized cost basis is written down to the fair value of the security such that the entire unrealized loss is recognized in other revenues, and any previously established acl is written off.
for all other afs securities in an unrealized loss position, any portion of unrealized losses representing a credit loss is recognized in other revenues and as an increase to the acl for afs securities, with the remainder of unrealized losses recognized in oci. a credit loss exists if the firm does not expect to recover the amortized cost basis of the security. when considering whether a credit loss exists, the firm considers relevant information, including:
•guarantees (implicit or explicit) by the u.s. government;
•the extent to which the fair value has been less than the amortized cost basis;
•adverse conditions specifically related to the security, its industry or geographic area;
•changes in the financial condition of the issuer of the security or, in the case of an asset-backed debt security, changes in the financial condition of the underlying loan obligors;
•the payment structure of the debt security and the likelihood of the issuer being able to make payments that increase in the future;
•failure of the issuer of the security to make scheduled interest or principal payments;
•the current rating and any changes to the rating of the security by a rating agency.
if a credit loss exists, the firm measures the credit loss as the difference between the present value of cash flows expected to be collected (discounted at the implicit interest rate at acquisition of the security or discounted at the effective yield for securities that incorporate changes in prepayment assumptions) and the amortized cost basis of the security. changes in prepayment assumptions alone are not considered to result in a credit loss. when estimating the present value of expected cash flows, information utilized includes the remaining payment terms of the security, prepayment speeds, financial condition of the issuer, expected defaults and the value of any underlying collateral.

htm securities htm securities are reported at amortized cost, net of any acl, in the balance sheet. refer to "allowance for credit losses" herein for guidance on the acl determination. interest income, including amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts on htm securities, is included in interest income in the income statement.
loans the firm accounts for loans based on the following categories: loans held for investment; loans held for sale; and loans at fair value.
december 2021 form 10-k notes to consolidated financial statements nonaccrual all loan categories described below follow the same nonaccrual and write-off guidance as discussed in "allowance for credit losses" herein.
loans held for investment loans held for investment are reported at outstanding principal adjusted for any charge-offs, the allowance for credit losses, any unamortized deferred fees or costs for originated loans, and any unamortized premiums or discounts for purchased loans.
interest income.    interest income on performing loans held for investment is accrued and recognized as interest income at the contractual rate of interest. purchase price discounts or premiums, as well as net deferred loan fees or costs, are amortized into interest income over the life of the loan to produce a level rate of return.
lending commitments.    the firm records the liability and related expense for the credit exposure related to commitments to fund loans. for more information regarding loan commitments, standby letters of credit and financial guarantees, see note 15.
for more information regarding allowance for credit losses, refer to "allowance for credit losses" herein.
loans held for sale loans held for sale are measured at the lower of cost or fair value, with valuation changes recorded in other revenues. the firm determines the valuation allowance on an individual loan basis, except for residential mortgage loans for which the valuation allowance is determined at the loan product level. any decreases in fair value below the initial carrying amount and any recoveries in fair value up to the initial carrying amount are recorded in other revenues. increases in fair value above initial carrying value are not recognized.
interest income. interest income on loans held for sale is accrued and recognized based on the contractual rate of interest. loan origination fees or costs and purchase price discounts or premiums are deferred as an adjustment to the loan's cost basis until the related loan is sold and, as such, are included in the periodic determination of the lower of cost or fair value adjustments and the gain or loss recognized at the time of sale.
lending commitments. commitments to fund mortgage loans held for sale are derivatives and are reported in trading assets or trading liabilities in the balance sheet with an offset to trading revenues in the income statement.
for commitments to fund non-mortgage loans, the firm records the liability and related expense for the fair value exposure below cost of such commitments in other liabilities and accrued expenses in the balance sheet with an offset to other revenues in the income statement.
because loans and lending commitments held for sale are recognized at the lower of cost or fair value, the allowance for credit losses and charge-off policies do not apply to these loans.
loans at fair value loans for which the fair value option is elected are carried at fair value, with changes in fair value recognized in earnings. loans carried at fair value are not evaluated for purposes of recording an allowance for credit losses. for further information on loans carried at fair value and classified as trading assets and trading liabilities, see note 5.
lending commitments. the firm records the liability and related expense for the fair value exposure related to commitments to fund loans that will be measured at fair value. the liability is recorded in trading liabilities in the balance sheet, and the expense is recorded in trading revenues in the income statement.
because such loans and lending commitments are reported at fair value, the allowance for credit losses and charge-off policies do not apply to these loans.
for further information on loans, see note 10.
allowance for credit losses the acl for financial instruments measured at amortized cost and certain off-balance sheet exposures (e.g., hfi loans and lending commitments, htm securities, customer and other receivables and certain guarantees) represents an estimate of expected credit losses over the entire life of the financial instrument.
factors considered by management when determining the acl include payment status, fair value of collateral and expected payments of principal and interest, as well as internal or external information relating to past events, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts. the firm uses three forecasts that include assumptions about certain macroeconomic variables, including, but not limited to, u.s. gross domestic product ("gdp"), equity market indices and unemployment rates, as well as commercial real estate and home price indices. at the conclusion of the firm's reasonable and supportable forecast period of 13 quarters, there is a gradual reversion back to historical averages.
the acl is measured on a collective basis when similar risk characteristics exist for multiple instruments, considering all available information relevant to assessing the collectability of cash flows. generally, the firm applies a probability of default/loss given default model for instruments that are collectively assessed, under which the acl is calculated as the product of probability of default, loss given default and exposure at default. these parameters are forecast for each december 2021 form 10-k notes to consolidated financial statements collective group of assets using a scenario-based statistical model.
if the instrument does not share similar risk characteristics with other instruments, including when it is probable that the firm will be unable to collect the full payment of principal and interest on the instrument when due, the acl is measured on an individual basis. the firm generally applies a discounted cash flow method for instruments that are individually assessed.
the firm may also elect to use an approach that considers the fair value of the collateral when measuring the acl if the loan is collateral dependent (i.e., repayment of the loan is expected to be provided substantially by the sale or operation of the underlying collateral and the borrower is experiencing financial difficulty).
additionally, the firm can elect to use an approach to measure the acl that considers the fair value of collateral where the borrower is required to, and reasonably expected to, continually adjust and replenish the amount of collateral securing the instrument to reflect changes in the fair value of such collateral. the firm has elected to use this approach for certain securities-based loans, margin loans, securities purchased under agreements to resell and securities borrowed.
credit quality indicators considered in developing the acl include:
•corporate loans, secured lending facilities, commercial real estate loans and securities, and other loans: internal risk ratings developed by the credit risk management department that are refreshed at least annually, and more frequently as necessary. these ratings generally correspond to external ratings published by s&p. the firm also considers transaction structure, including type of collateral, collateral terms and position of the obligation within the capital structure. in addition, for commercial real estate, the firm considers property type and location, net operating income and ltv ratios, among other factors, as well as commercial real estate price and credit spread indices and capitalization rates.
•residential real estate loans: loan origination fair isaac corporation ("fico") credit scores as determined by independent credit agencies in the u.s. and ltv ratios.
•employee loans: employment status, which includes those currently employed by the firm and for which the firm can deduct any unpaid amounts due to it through certain compensation arrangements; and those no longer employed by the firm where such arrangements are no longer applicable.
qualitative and environmental factors such as economic and business conditions, the nature and volume of the portfolio, and lending terms and the volume and severity of past due loans are also considered in the acl calculations.

nonaccrual the firm places financial instruments on nonaccrual status if principal or interest is not expected when contractually due or is past due for a period of 90 days or more unless the obligation is well-secured and is in the process of collection. for borrowers impacted by covid-19, see "modifications and nonaccrual status for borrowers impacted by covid-19" herein for additional considerations.
for any instrument placed on nonaccrual status, the firm reverses any unpaid interest accrued with an offsetting reduction to interest income. principal and interest payments received on nonaccrual instruments are applied to principal if there is doubt regarding the ultimate collectability of principal. if collection of the principal is not in doubt, interest income is realized on a cash basis. if the instrument is brought current and neither principal nor interest collection is in doubt, instruments can generally return to accrual status, and interest income can be recognized.
modifications and nonaccrual status for borrowers impacted by covid-19
in the first quarter of 2020, the firm elected to apply the guidance issued by congress in the coronavirus aid, relief, and economic security act ("cares act"), as well as by the u.s. banking agencies stating that certain concessions granted to borrowers that are current on existing loans, either individually or as part of a program for creditworthy december 2021 form 10-k notes to consolidated financial statements borrowers who are experiencing short-term financial or operational problems as a result of covid-19, generally would not be considered tdrs. additionally, these loans generally would not be considered nonaccrual unless collectability concerns exist despite the modification provided. for loans remaining on accrual status, the firm elected to continue recognizing interest income during the modification periods. the cares act relief expired on january 1, 2022.
acl charge-offs the principal balance of a financial instrument is charged off in the period it is deemed uncollectible, resulting in a reduction in the acl and in the balance of the financial instrument in the balance sheet. accrued interest receivable balances that are separately recorded from the related financial instruments are charged off against interest income when the related financial instrument is placed on nonaccrual status. accordingly, the firm elected not to measure an acl for accrued interest receivables. however, in the case of loans that are modified as a result of covid-19 and remain on accrual status due to the relief noted in "modifications and nonaccrual status for borrowers impacted by covid-19" herein, accrued interest receivable balances are assessed for any required acl.
transfers of financial assets transfers of financial assets are accounted for as sales when the firm has relinquished control over the transferred assets. any related gain or loss on sale is recorded in net revenues. transfers that are not accounted for as sales are treated as collateralized financings. securities borrowed or purchased under agreements to resell and securities loaned or sold under agreements to repurchase are treated as collateralized financings (see note 9).
securities purchased under agreements to resell ("reverse repurchase agreements") and securities sold under agreements to repurchase ("repurchase agreements"), including repurchase and reverse repurchase agreements-to-maturity, are carried in the balance sheet at the amount of cash paid or received plus accrued interest except for certain reverse repurchase and repurchase agreements for which the firm has elected the fair value option (see note 6). where appropriate, repurchase agreements and reverse repurchase agreements with the same counterparty are reported on a net basis. securities borrowed and securities loaned are recorded at the amount of cash collateral advanced or received.
in instances where the firm is the lender in securities-for-securities transactions and is permitted to sell or repledge these securities, the fair value of the collateral received is reported in trading assets, and the related obligation to return the collateral is reported in trading liabilities in the balance sheet. securities-for-securities transactions where the firm is the borrower are not included in the balance sheet.
in order to manage credit exposure arising from these transactions, in appropriate circumstances, the firm enters into master netting agreements and collateral agreements with its counterparties. these agreements provide the firm with the right, in the event of a default by the counterparty, to net a counterparty's rights and obligations under the agreement and to liquidate and set off collateral held by the firm against the net amount owed by the counterparty.
the firm's policy is generally to take possession of securities purchased or borrowed in connection with reverse repurchase agreements and securities borrowed transactions, respectively, and to receive cash and/or securities delivered under repurchase agreements or securities loaned transactions (with rights of rehypothecation).
for information related to offsetting of certain collateralized transactions, see note 9.
premises, equipment and capitalized software costs premises, equipment and capitalized software costs consist of buildings, leasehold improvements, furniture, fixtures, computer and communications equipment, power generation assets and capitalized software (externally purchased and developed for internal use). premises, equipment and capitalized software costs are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization and are included in other assets in the balance sheet. depreciation and amortization are provided by the straight-line method over the estimated useful life of the asset.

premises, equipment and capitalized software costs are tested for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances suggest that an asset's carrying value may not be fully recoverable.
goodwill and intangible assets the firm tests goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment on an annual basis and on an interim basis when certain events or circumstances exist. the firm tests goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level, which is generally at the level of or one level below the asset's business segment. the firm tests indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment at the aggregate level of management contracts. for both the annual and interim tests, the firm has the option to either (i) perform a quantitative impairment test or (ii) first perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is december 2021 form 10-k notes to consolidated financial statements more likely than not that the fair value is less than its carrying amount, in which case the quantitative test would be performed.
when performing a quantitative impairment test, the firm compares the fair value with the carrying amount. if the fair value is less than the carrying amount, the impairment loss is equal to the excess of the carrying value over the fair value, limited to the carrying amount.
the estimated fair values are derived based on valuation techniques the firm believes market participants would use. the estimated fair values are generally determined by utilizing a discounted cash flow methodology or methodologies that incorporate price-to-book and price-to-earnings multiples of certain comparable companies for goodwill impairment testing.
intangible assets with a finite life are amortized over their estimated useful life and are reviewed for impairment on an interim basis when impairment indicators are present. impairment losses are recorded within other expenses in the income statement.
earnings per common share basic eps is computed by dividing earnings available to morgan stanley common shareholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the period. earnings available to morgan stanley common shareholders represents net income applicable to morgan stanley reduced by preferred stock dividends. common shares outstanding include common stock and vested rsus where recipients have satisfied the relevant vesting terms. diluted eps reflects the assumed conversion of all dilutive securities.
share-based awards that pay dividend equivalents subject to vesting are included in diluted shares outstanding (if dilutive) under the treasury stock method.
the firm has granted psus that vest and convert to shares of common stock only if predetermined performance and market goals are satisfied. since the issuance of the shares is contingent upon the satisfaction of certain conditions, the psus are included in diluted eps based on the number of shares (if any) that would be issuable if the reporting date was the end of the performance period.
for further information on diluted earnings (loss) per common share, see note 18 to the financial statements.
deferred compensation stock-based compensation the firm measures compensation expense for stock-based awards at fair value. the firm determines the fair value of rsus (including psus with non-market performance conditions) based on the grant-date fair value of its common stock, measured as the volume-weighted average price on the date of grant ("vwap"). the fair value of rsus not entitled to dividends until conversion is measured at vwap reduced by the present value of dividends expected to be paid on the underlying shares prior to scheduled conversion date. psus that contain market-based conditions are valued using a monte carlo valuation model.
compensation expense is recognized over the vesting period relevant to each separately vesting portion of the award. compensation expense for awards with performance conditions is recognized based on the probable outcome of the performance condition at each reporting date. compensation expense for awards with market-based conditions is recognized irrespective of the probability of the market condition being achieved and is not reversed if the market condition is not met. the firm accounts for forfeitures as they occur.
stock-based awards generally contain clawback and cancellation provisions. certain awards provide the firm discretion to claw back or cancel all or a portion of the award under specified circumstances. compensation expense for those awards is adjusted for changes in the fair value of the firm's common stock or the relevant model valuation, as appropriate, until conversion, exercise or expiration.
employee stock trusts in connection with certain stock-based compensation plans, the firm has established employee stock trusts to provide, at its discretion, common stock voting rights to certain rsu holders. following the grant of an rsu award, when a stock trust is utilized, the firm contributes shares to be held in the stock trust until the rsus convert to common shares. the assets of the employee stock trusts are consolidated with those of the firm and are generally accounted for in a manner similar to treasury stock, where the shares of common stock outstanding reported in common stock issued to employee stock trusts are offset by an equal amount reported in employee stock trusts in the balance sheet.
the firm uses the grant-date fair value of stock-based compensation as the basis for recording the movement of the assets to or from the employee stock trusts. changes in the fair value are not recognized as the firm's stock-based compensation must be settled by delivery of a fixed number of shares of the firm's common stock.
deferred cash-based compensation compensation expense for deferred cash-based compensation awards is calculated based on the notional value of the award granted, adjusted for changes in the fair value of the referenced investments that employees select. compensation expense is recognized over the vesting period relevant to each separately vesting portion of the award.
the firm invests directly, as a principal, in financial instruments and other investments to economically hedge certain of its obligations under its deferred cash-based december 2021 form 10-k notes to consolidated financial statements compensation plans. changes in the value of such investments are recorded in trading revenues and investments revenues. although changes in compensation expense resulting from changes in the fair value of the referenced investments will generally be offset by changes in the fair value of investments made by the firm, there is typically a timing difference between the immediate recognition of gains and losses on the firm's investments and the deferred recognition of the related compensation expense over the vesting period.
retirement-eligible employee compensation for year-end stock-based awards and deferred cash-based compensation awards anticipated to be granted to retirement-eligible employees under award terms that do not contain a future service requirement, the firm accrues the estimated cost of the awards over the course of the calendar year preceding the grant date, which reflects the period over which the compensation is earned.
carried interest compensation the firm generally recognizes compensation expense for any portion of carried interest (both realized and unrealized) that is allocated to employees. for information on performance-based fees in the form of carried interest, which are directly related to carried interest compensation, see "revenue recognition-carried interest" herein.
income taxes deferred tax assets and liabilities are recorded based upon the temporary differences between the financial statement and income tax bases of assets and liabilities using currently enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse. the effect of a change in tax rates on deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized in income tax expense (benefit) in the period that includes the enactment date. such effects are recorded in provision for income taxes regardless of where deferred taxes were originally recorded.
the firm recognizes net deferred tax assets to the extent that it believes these assets are more likely than not to be realized. in making such a determination, the firm considers all available positive and negative evidence, including future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences, projected future taxable income, tax planning strategies and results of recent operations. when performing the assessment, the firm considers all types of deferred tax assets in combination with each other, regardless of the origin of the underlying temporary difference. if a deferred tax asset is determined to be unrealizable, a valuation allowance is established. if the firm subsequently determines that it would be able to realize deferred tax assets in excess of their net recorded amount, it would make an adjustment to the deferred tax asset valuation allowance, which would reduce the provision for income taxes.
the firm recognizes tax expense associated with global intangible low-taxed income as it is incurred as part of the current income taxes to be paid or refunded for the current period.
uncertain tax positions are recorded on the basis of a two-step process, whereby (i) the firm determines whether it is more likely than not that the tax positions will be sustained on the basis of the technical merits of the position and (ii) for those tax positions that meet this threshold, the firm recognizes the largest amount of tax benefit that is more likely than not to be realized upon ultimate settlement with the related tax authority. interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits are recognized as a component of the provision for income taxes.
foreign currencies assets and liabilities of operations with non-u.s. dollar functional currencies are translated at year-end rates of exchange. gains or losses resulting from translating foreign currency financial statements, net of hedge gains or losses and related tax effects, are reflected in aoci in the balance sheet. gains or losses resulting from remeasurement of foreign currency transactions are included in net income, and amounts recognized in the income statement are translated at the rate of exchange on the respective date of recognition for each amount.
accounting updates adopted in 2020
reference rate reform the firm has adopted the reference rate reform accounting update. there was no impact to the firm's financial statements upon initial adoption.
this accounting update provides optional accounting relief to entities with contracts, hedge accounting relationships or other transactions that reference libor or other interest rate benchmarks for which the referenced rate is expected to be discontinued or replaced. the firm is applying the accounting relief as relevant contract and hedge accounting relationship modifications are made during the course of the reference rate reform transition period. the optional relief generally allows for contract modifications solely related to the replacement of the reference rate to be accounted for as a continuation of the existing contract instead of as an extinguishment of the contract and would, therefore, not trigger certain accounting impacts that would otherwise be required. it also allows entities to change certain critical terms of existing hedge accounting relationships that are affected by reference rate reform, and these changes would not require de-designating the hedge accounting relationship. the optional relief currently ends december 31, 2022.
financial instruments-credit losses the firm has adopted the financial instruments-credit losses accounting update.
december 2021 form 10-k notes to consolidated financial statements this accounting update impacted the impairment model for certain financial assets measured at amortized cost by requiring a cecl methodology to estimate expected credit losses over the entire life of the financial asset, recorded at inception or purchase. cecl replaced the incurred loss model previously applicable to loans held for investment, htm securities and other receivables carried at amortized cost, such as employee loans.
the update also eliminated the concept of other-than-temporary impairment for afs securities and instead requires impairments on afs securities to be recognized in earnings through an allowance when the fair value is less than amortized cost and a credit loss exists, and through a permanent reduction of the amortized cost basis when the securities are expected to be sold before recovery of amortized cost.
at transition on january 1, 2020, the adoption of this accounting standard resulted in an increase in the allowance for credit losses of $131 million with a corresponding reduction in retained earnings of $100 million, net of tax. the adoption impact was primarily attributable to a $124 million increase in the allowance for credit losses on employee loans.
3. acquisitions acquisition of eaton vance on march 1, 2021, the firm completed the acquisition of 100% of eaton vance corp. ("eaton vance") in a stock and cash transaction, which increased the scale and breadth of the investment management business segment. total consideration for the transaction was approximately $8.7 billion, which consists of the $5.3 billion fair value of 69 million common shares issued from common stock held in treasury and cash of approximately $3.4 billion.
upon acquisition, the assets and liabilities of eaton vance were adjusted to their respective fair values as of the closing date of the transaction, including the identifiable intangible assets acquired. in addition, the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net assets acquired has been recorded as goodwill. the fair value estimates used in valuing certain acquired assets and liabilities are based, in part, on inputs that are unobservable. for intangible assets, these include, but are not limited to, forecasted future cash flows, revenue growth rates, attrition rates and discount rates.

valuation techniques for assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis u.s. treasury and agency securities u.s. treasury securities valuation technique:
•fair value is determined using quoted market prices.
valuation hierarchy classification:
•level 1-as inputs are observable and in an active market u.s. agency securities valuation techniques:
•non-callable agency-issued debt securities are generally valued using quoted market prices, and callable agency-issued debt securities are valued by benchmarking model-derived prices to quoted market prices and trade data for comparable instruments.
•the fair value of agency mortgage pass-through pool securities is model-driven based on spreads of comparable to-be-announced securities.
•cmos are generally valued using quoted market prices and trade data adjusted by subsequent changes in related indices for comparable instruments.
valuation hierarchy classification:
•level 1-on-the-run agency issued debt securities if actively traded and inputs are observable
•level 2-all other agency issued debt securities, agency mortgage pass-through pool securities and cmos if actively traded and inputs are observable
•level 3-in instances where the trading activity is limited or inputs are unobservable other sovereign government obligations valuation techniques:
•fair value is determined using quoted prices in active markets when available. when not available, quoted prices in less active markets are used. in the absence of position-specific quoted prices, fair value may be determined through benchmarking from comparable instruments.
valuation hierarchy classification:
•level 1-if actively traded and inputs are observable

•fair value of contingent corporate lending commitments is determined by using executed transactions on comparable loans and the anticipated market price based on pricing indications from syndicate banks and customers. the valuation of loans and lending commitments also takes into account fee income that is considered an attribute of the contract.
•fair value of mortgage loans is determined using observable prices based on transactional data or third-party pricing for comparable instruments, when available.
•where position-specific external prices are not observable, fair value is estimated based on benchmarking to prices and rates observed in the primary market for similar loan or borrower types or based on the present value of expected future cash flows using the firm's best available estimates of the key assumptions, including forecasted credit losses, prepayment rates, forward yield curves and discount rates commensurate with the risks involved or a methodology that utilizes the capital structure and credit spreads of recent comparable securitization transactions.
•fair value of equity margin loans is determined by discounting future interest cash flows, net of potential losses resulting from large downward price movements of the underlying margin loan collateral. the potential losses are modeled using the margin loan rate, which is calibrated from market observable cds spreads, implied debt yields or volatility metrics of the loan collateral.

•otc derivative contracts include forward, swap and option contracts related to interest rates, foreign currencies, credit standing of reference entities, equity prices or commodity prices.
•depending on the product and the terms of the transaction, the fair value of otc derivative products can be modeled using a series of techniques, including closed-form analytic formulas, such as the black-scholes option-pricing model, simulation models or a combination thereof. many pricing models do not entail material subjectivity as the methodologies employed do not necessitate significant judgment since model inputs may be observed from actively quoted markets, as is the case for generic interest rate swaps, many equity, commodity and foreign currency option contracts, and certain cds. in the case of more established derivative products, the pricing models used by the firm are widely accepted by the financial services industry.
•more complex otc derivative products are typically less liquid and require more judgment in the implementation of the valuation technique since direct trading activity or quotes are unobservable. this includes certain types of interest rate derivatives with both volatility and correlation exposure, equity, commodity or foreign currency derivatives that are either longer-dated or include exposure to multiple underlyings, and credit derivatives, including cds on certain mortgage- or asset-backed securities and basket cds. where required inputs are unobservable, relationships to observable data points, based on historical and/or implied observations, may be employed as a technique to estimate the model input values. for further information on the valuation techniques for otc derivative products, see note 2.

1.net transfers in 2021 reflect the transfer in the third quarter of $895 million of equity margin loans from level 3 to level 2 as a result of the reduced significance of the margin loan rate input. net transfers in 2020 reflect the largely offsetting impacts of equity margin loan transfers of $857 million into level 3 in the first quarter and $707 million out of level 3 in the second quarter, both driven by changes in the significance level of the margin loan rate input based on changes in liquidity conditions.
2.net transfers in 2021 reflect the transfer in the second quarter of $2.0 billion of corporate and other debt, $1.0 billion of net equity derivatives and $2.2 billion of borrowings from level 3 to level 2 as the unobservable inputs were not significant to the overall fair value measurements.
3.net transfers in 2021 reflect the transfer in the first quarter of $2.5 billion of afs securities from level 3 to level 2 due to increased trading activity and observability of pricing inputs. purchases of afs investment securities in 2020 relate to securities acquired as part of the e*trade transaction. for additional information on the acquisition of e*trade, see note 3.
level 3 instruments may be hedged with instruments classified in level 1 and level 2. the realized and unrealized gains or losses for assets and liabilities within the level 3 category presented in the previous tables do not reflect the related realized and unrealized gains or losses on hedging instruments that have been classified by the firm within the level 1 and/or level 2 categories.
the unrealized gains (losses) during the period for assets and liabilities within the level 3 category may include changes in fair value during the period that were attributable to both observable and unobservable inputs. total realized and unrealized gains (losses) are primarily included in trading revenues in the income statement.
additionally, in the previous tables, consolidations of vies are included in purchases, and deconsolidations of vies are included in settlements.

1.a single amount is disclosed for range and average when there is no significant difference between the minimum, maximum and average. amounts represent weighted averages except where simple averages and the median of the inputs are more relevant.
2.includes derivative contracts with multiple risks (i.e., hybrid products).
the previous table provides information on the valuation techniques, significant unobservable inputs, and the ranges and averages for each major category of assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring and nonrecurring basis with a significant level 3 balance. the level of aggregation and breadth of products cause the range of inputs to be wide and not evenly distributed across the inventory of financial instruments. further, the range of unobservable inputs may differ across firms in the financial services industry because of diversity in the types of products included in each firm's inventory. generally, there are no predictable relationships between multiple significant unobservable inputs attributable to a given valuation technique.
during 2021, there were no significant revisions made to the descriptions of the firm's significant unobservable inputs.
an increase (decrease) to the following significant unobservable inputs would generally result in a higher (lower) fair value.
•comparable bond or loan price. a pricing input used when prices for the identical instrument are not available. significant subjectivity may be involved when fair value is determined using pricing data available for comparable instruments. valuation using comparable instruments can be done by calculating an implied yield (or spread over a liquid benchmark) from the price of a comparable bond or loan, then adjusting that yield (or spread) to derive a value for the bond or loan. the adjustment to yield (or spread)
should account for relevant differences in the bonds or loans such as maturity or credit quality. alternatively, a price-to-price basis can be assumed between the comparable instrument and the bond or loan being valued in order to establish the value of the bond or loan.
•comparable equity price. a price derived from equity raises, share buybacks and external bid levels, etc. a discount or premium may be included in the fair value estimate.
•contingency probability. probability associated with the realization of an underlying event upon which the value of an asset is contingent.
•ebitda multiple/exit multiple. the ratio of enterprise value to ebitda, where enterprise value is the aggregate value of equity and debt minus cash and cash equivalents. the ebitda multiple reflects the value of the company in terms of its full-year ebitda, whereas the exit multiple reflects the value of the company in terms of its full-year expected ebitda at exit. either multiple allows comparison between companies from an operational perspective as the effect of capital structure, taxation and depreciation/amortization is excluded.
an increase (decrease) to the following significant unobservable inputs would generally result in a lower (higher) fair value.
•cash-synthetic basis. the measure of the price differential between cash financial instruments and their synthetic derivative-based equivalents. the range disclosed in the previous table signifies the number of points by which the synthetic bond equivalent price is higher than the quoted price of the underlying cash bonds.
•funding spread. the cost of borrowing defined as the incremental spread over the ois rate for a specific collateral rate (which refers to the rate applicable to a specific type of security pledged as collateral).
•loss given default. amount expressed as a percentage of par that is the expected loss when a credit event occurs.
•margin loan rate. the annualized rate that reflects the possibility of losses as a result of movements in the price of the underlying margin loan collateral. the rate is calibrated from the discount rate, credit spreads and/or volatility measures.
•wacc. wacc represents the theoretical rate of return required to debt and equity investors. the wacc is used in a discounted cash flow model that calculates the value of the equity. the model assumes that the cash flow assumptions, including projections, are fully reflected in the current equity value, while the debt to equity ratio is held constant.
97                december 2021 form 10-k notes to consolidated financial statements an increase (decrease) to the following significant unobservable inputs would generally result in an impact to the fair value, but the magnitude and direction of the impact would depend on whether the firm is long or short the exposure.
•correlation. a pricing input where the payoff is driven by more than one underlying risk. correlation is a measure of the relationship between the movement of two variables (i.e., how the change in one variable influences a change in the other variable).
•credit spread. the credit spread reflects the additional net yield an investor can earn from a security with more credit risk relative to one with less credit risk. the credit spread of a particular security is often quoted in relation to the yield on a credit risk-free benchmark security or reference rate.
•interest rate curve. the term structure of interest rates (relationship between interest rates and the time to maturity) and a market's measure of future interest rates at the time of observation. an interest rate curve is used to set interest rate and foreign exchange derivative cash flows and is a pricing input used in the discounting of any otc derivative cash flow.
•volatility. the measure of variability in possible returns for an instrument given how much that instrument changes in value over time. volatility is a pricing input for options, and, generally, the lower the volatility, the less risky the option. the level of volatility used in the valuation of a particular option depends on a number of factors, including the nature of the risk underlying that option, the tenor and the strike price of the option.
•volatility skew. the measure of the difference in implied volatility for options with identical underliers and expiry dates but with different strikes.

1.investments in hedge funds may be subject to initial period lock-up or gate provisions, which restrict an investor from withdrawing from the fund during a certain initial period or restrict the redemption amount on any redemption date, respectively.
amounts in the previous table represent the firm's carrying value of general and limited partnership interests in fund investments, as well as any related performance-based income in the form of carried interest. the carrying amounts are measured based on the nav of the fund taking into account the distribution terms applicable to the interest held. this same measurement applies whether the fund investments are accounted for under the equity method or fair value.
private equity.    funds that pursue multiple strategies, including leveraged buyouts, venture capital, infrastructure growth capital, distressed investments and mezzanine capital. in addition, the funds may be structured with a focus on specific geographic regions.
real estate.    funds that invest in real estate assets such as commercial office buildings, retail properties, multi-family residential properties, developments or hotels. in addition, the funds may be structured with a focus on specific geographic regions.
investments in private equity and real estate funds generally are not redeemable due to the closed-end nature of these funds. instead, distributions from each fund will be received as the underlying investments of the funds are disposed and monetized.
hedge.    funds that pursue various investment strategies, including long-short equity, fixed income/credit, event-driven and multi-strategy.

1.gains and losses for loans and other assets-other investments are classified in other revenues. for other items, gains and losses are recorded in other revenues if the item is held for sale; otherwise, they are recorded in other expenses.
2.nonrecurring changes in the fair value of loans and lending commitments, which exclude the impact of related economic hedges, are calculated as follows: for the held-for-investment category, based on the value of the underlying collateral; and for the held-for-sale category, based on recently executed transactions, market price quotations, valuation models that incorporate market observable inputs where possible, such as comparable loan or debt prices and cds spread levels adjusted for any basis difference between cash and derivative instruments, or default recovery analysis where such transactions and quotations are unobservable.
3.losses related to other assets-other investments were determined using techniques that included discounted cash flow models, methodologies that incorporate multiples of certain comparable companies and recently executed transactions.
4.losses related to other assets-premises, equipment and software generally include impairments as well as write-offs related to the disposal of certain assets.
5.losses related to other assets-rou assets include impairments related to the discontinued use of certain leased properties.

1.certain prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current presentation.
the notional amounts of derivative contracts generally overstate the firm's exposure. in most circumstances, notional amounts are used only as a reference point from which to calculate amounts owed between the parties to the contract. furthermore, notional amounts do not reflect the benefit of legally enforceable netting arrangements or risk mitigating transactions.

the firm enters into credit derivatives, principally cds, under which it receives or provides protection against the risk of default on a set of debt obligations issued by a specified reference entity or entities. a majority of the firm's counterparties for these derivatives are banks, broker-dealers, and insurance and other financial institutions.

103               december 2021 form 10-k notes to consolidated financial statements the purchase of credit protection does not represent the sole manner in which the firm risk manages its exposure to credit derivatives. the firm manages its exposure to these derivative contracts through a variety of risk mitigation strategies, which include managing the credit and correlation risk across single-name, non-tranched indices and baskets, tranched indices and baskets, and cash positions. aggregate market risk limits have been established for credit derivatives, and market risk measures are routinely monitored against these limits. the firm may also recover amounts on the underlying reference obligation delivered to the firm under cds where credit protection was sold.
single-name cds.    a cds protects the buyer against the loss of principal on a bond or loan in case of a default by the issuer. the protection buyer pays a periodic premium (generally quarterly) over the life of the contract and is protected for the period. the firm, in turn, performs under a cds if a credit event as defined under the contract occurs. typical credit events include bankruptcy, dissolution or insolvency of the referenced entity, failure to pay and restructuring of the obligations of the referenced entity.
index and basket cds.    index and basket cds are products where credit protection is provided on a portfolio of single-name cds. generally, in the event of a default on one of the underlying names, the firm pays a pro rata portion of the total notional amount of the cds.
the firm also enters into tranched index and basket cds where credit protection is provided on a particular portion of the portfolio loss distribution. the most junior tranches cover initial defaults, and once losses exceed the notional of the tranche, they are passed on to the next most senior tranche in the capital structure.
other credit contracts.    the firm has invested in clns and cdos, which are hybrid instruments containing embedded derivatives, in which credit protection has been sold to the issuer of the note. if there is a credit event of a reference entity underlying the instrument, the principal balance of the note may not be repaid in full to the firm.

9. collateralized transactions the firm enters into securities purchased under agreements to resell, securities sold under agreements to repurchase, securities borrowed and securities loaned transactions to, among other things, acquire securities to cover short positions and settle other securities obligations, to accommodate customers' needs and to finance its inventory positions.
the firm monitors the fair value of the underlying securities as compared with the related receivable or payable, including accrued interest, and, as necessary, requests additional collateral, as provided under the applicable agreement to ensure such transactions are adequately collateralized, or returns excess collateral.
the risk related to a decline in the market value of collateral pledged or received is managed by setting appropriate market-based margin requirements. increases in collateral margin calls on secured financing due to market value declines may be mitigated by increases in collateral margin calls on securities purchased under agreements to resell and securities borrowed transactions with similar quality collateral. additionally, the firm may request lower quality collateral pledged be replaced with higher quality collateral through collateral substitution rights in the underlying agreements.
the firm actively manages its secured financings in a manner that reduces the potential refinancing risk of secured financings of less liquid assets and also considers the quality of collateral when negotiating collateral eligibility with counterparties. the firm utilizes shorter term secured financing for highly liquid assets and has established longer tenor limits for less liquid assets, for which funding may be at risk in the event of a market disruption.

margin and other lending         $71,532                    $74,714
the firm provides margin lending arrangements that allow customers to borrow against the value of qualifying securities. receivables from these arrangements are included within customer and other receivables in the balance sheet. under these arrangements, the firm receives collateral, which includes u.s. government and agency securities, other sovereign government obligations, corporate and other debt, and corporate equities. margin loans are collateralized by customer-owned securities held by the firm. the firm monitors required margin levels and established credit terms daily and, pursuant to such guidelines, requires customers to deposit additional collateral, or reduce positions, when necessary.
margin loans are extended on a demand basis and generally are not committed facilities. factors considered in the review of margin loans are the amount of the loan, the intended purpose, the degree of leverage being employed in the account and the amount of collateral, as well as an overall evaluation of the portfolio to ensure proper diversification or, in the case of concentrated positions, appropriate liquidity of the underlying collateral or potential hedging strategies to reduce risk. underlying collateral for margin loans is reviewed with respect to the liquidity of the proposed collateral positions, valuation of securities, historic trading range, volatility analysis and an evaluation of industry concentrations. for these transactions, adherence to the firm's collateral policies significantly limits its credit exposure in the event of a customer default. the firm may request additional margin collateral from customers, if appropriate, and, if necessary, may sell securities that have not been paid for or purchase securities sold but not delivered from customers.
also included in the amounts in the previous table is non-purpose securities-based lending on non-bank entities in the wealth management business segment.
other secured financings other secured financings include the liabilities related to transfers of financial assets that are accounted for as financings rather than sales, consolidated vies where the firm is deemed to be the primary beneficiary, and certain elns and other secured borrowings. these liabilities are generally payable from the cash flows of the related assets, which are accounted for as trading assets (see notes 14 and 16).

credit quality the crm evaluates new obligors before credit transactions are initially approved and at least annually thereafter for corporate and commercial real estate loans. for corporate, secured lending facilities and other loans, credit evaluations typically involve the evaluation of financial statements, assessment of leverage, liquidity, capital strength, asset composition and quality, market capitalization and access to capital markets, cash flow projections and debt service requirements, and the adequacy of collateral, if applicable. the crm also evaluates strategy, market position, industry dynamics, obligor's management and other factors that could affect an obligor's risk profile.
for commercial real estate loans, the credit evaluation is focused on property and transaction metrics, including property type, ltv ratio, occupancy levels, debt service ratio, prevailing capitalization rates and market dynamics.
for residential real estate and securities-based loans, the initial credit evaluation typically includes, but is not limited to, review of the obligor's income, net worth, liquidity, collateral, ltv ratio and credit bureau information. subsequent credit monitoring for residential real estate loans is performed at the portfolio level. securities-based loan collateral values are monitored on an ongoing basis.
for information related to credit quality indicators considered in developing the acl, see note 2.

the aggregate allowance for credit losses for loans and lending commitments decreased in 2021, primarily reflecting charge-offs. the provision for credit losses on loans and lending commitments was flat, primarily as a result of portfolio growth, offset by the impact of changes in loan quality mix. the base scenario used in our acl models as of december 31, 2021 was generated using a combination of industry consensus economic forecasts, forward rates, and internally developed and validated models, and assumes continued growth over the forecast period. given the nature of our lending portfolio, the most sensitive model input is u.s. gross domestic product.
see note 2 for a description of the acl calculated under the cecl methodology, including credit quality indicators, used for held-for-investment loans beginning in 2020 and for a summary of the differences compared with the firm's acl methodology under the prior incurred loss model.

certain senior debt securities are denominated in various non-u.s. dollar currencies and may be structured to provide a return that is linked to equity, credit, commodity or other indices (e.g., the consumer price index). senior debt also may be structured to be callable by the firm or extendible at the option of holders of the senior debt securities.
the firm's borrowings include notes carried and managed on a fair value basis. these include instruments whose payments and redemption values are linked to the performance of a specific index, a basket of stocks, a specific equity security, a commodity, a credit exposure or basket of credit exposures; and instruments with various interest rate-related features, including step-ups, step-downs and zero coupons. also included are unsecured contracts which are not classified as otc derivatives because they fail net investment criteria. to minimize the exposure from such instruments, the firm has entered into various swap contracts and purchased options that effectively convert the borrowing costs into floating rates. the swaps and purchased options used to economically hedge the embedded features are derivatives and also are carried at fair value. changes in fair value related to the notes and economic hedges are reported in trading revenues. see notes 2 and 6 for further information on borrowings carried at fair value.

the firm's use of swaps for asset and liability management affects its effective average borrowing rate.

since commitments associated with these instruments may expire unused, the amounts shown do not necessarily reflect the actual future cash funding requirements.

notes to consolidated financial statements accepted by the borrower but not yet closed include only the amount that the firm expects it will be allocated from the lead syndicate bank. due to the nature of the firm's obligations under the commitments, these amounts include certain commitments participated to third parties.
forward-starting secured financing receivables.  this amount includes securities purchased under agreements to resell and securities borrowed that the firm has entered into prior to the balance sheet date that will settle after the balance sheet date. these transactions are primarily secured by collateral from u.s. government agency securities and other sovereign government obligations when they are funded.
central counterparty.  these commitments relate to the firm's membership in certain clearinghouses and are contingent upon the default of a clearinghouse member or other stress events.
underwriting commitments.  the firm provides underwriting commitments in connection with its capital raising sources to a diverse group of corporate and other institutional clients.
investment activities.  the firm sponsors several non-consolidated investment management funds for third-party investors where it typically acts as general partner of, and investment advisor to, these funds and typically commits to invest a minority of the capital of such funds, with subscribing third-party investors contributing the majority. the firm has contractual capital commitments, guarantees and counterparty arrangements with respect to these investment management funds.
letters of credit and other financial guarantees.  the firm has outstanding letters of credit and other financial guarantees issued by third-party banks to certain of the firm's counterparties. the firm is contingently liable for these letters of credit and other financial guarantees, which are primarily used to provide collateral for securities and commodities traded and to satisfy various margin requirements in lieu of depositing cash or securities with these counterparties.

1.the carrying amounts of derivative contracts that meet the accounting definition of a guarantee are shown on a gross basis. for further information on derivative contracts, see note 7.
2.these amounts include certain issued standby letters of credit participated to third parties, totaling $0.7 billion of notional and collateral/recourse, due to the nature of the firm's obligations under these arrangements. as of december 31, 2021, the carrying amount of standby letters of credit and other financial guarantees issued includes an allowance for credit losses of $84 million.
3.related to commercial and residential mortgage securitizations.
types of guarantees non-credit derivatives. certain derivative contracts meet the accounting definition of a guarantee, including certain written options, contingent forward contracts and cds (see note 7 regarding credit derivatives in which the firm has sold credit protection to the counterparty which are excluded from the previous table). for non-credit derivative contracts that meet the accounting definition of a guarantee the notional amount is used as the maximum potential payout for certain derivative contracts, such as written interest rate caps and written foreign currency options. the firm evaluates collateral requirements for all derivatives, including derivatives that do not meet the accounting definition of a guarantee. for the effects of cash collateral and counterparty netting, see note 7.
in certain situations, collateral may be held by the firm for those contracts that meet the definition of a guarantee. generally, the firm sets collateral requirements by counterparty so that the collateral covers various transactions and products and is not allocated specifically to individual contracts. also, the firm may recover amounts related to the underlying asset delivered to the firm under the derivative contract.
standby letters of credit and other financial guarantees issued. in connection with its corporate lending business and other corporate activities, the firm provides standby letters of credit and other financial guarantees to counterparties. such arrangements represent obligations to make payments to third parties if the counterparty fails to fulfill its obligation under a borrowing arrangement or other contractual obligation. a majority of the firm's standby letters of credit are provided on behalf of counterparties that are investment grade. if the counterparty fails to fulfill its contractual obligation, the firm has access to collateral or recourse that would approximate its obligation.
december 2021 form 10-k notes to consolidated financial statements market value guarantees. market value guarantees are issued to guarantee timely payment of a specified return to investors in certain affordable housing tax credit funds. these guarantees are designed to return an investor's contribution to a fund and the investor's share of tax losses and tax credits expected to be generated by a fund.
liquidity facilities. the firm has entered into liquidity facilities with spes and other counterparties, whereby the firm is required to make certain payments if losses or defaults occur. primarily, the firm acts as liquidity provider to municipal bond securitization spes and for standalone municipal bonds in which the holders of beneficial interests issued by these spes or the holders of the individual bonds, respectively, have the right to tender their interests for purchase by the firm on specified dates at a specified price. the firm often may have recourse to the underlying assets held by the spes in the event payments are required under such liquidity facilities, as well as make-whole or recourse provisions with the trust sponsors. the recourse amount often exceeds the maximum potential payout amount of the guarantee. substantially all of the underlying assets in the spes are investment grade. liquidity facilities provided to municipal tender option bond trusts are classified as derivatives.
whole loan sales guarantees. the firm has provided, or otherwise agreed to be responsible for, representations and warranties regarding certain whole loan sales. under certain circumstances, the firm may be required to repurchase such assets or make other payments related to such assets if such representations and warranties are breached. the firm's maximum potential payout related to such representations and warranties is equal to the current upb of such loans. since the firm no longer services these loans, it has no information on the current upb of those loans, and, accordingly, the amount included in the previous table represents the upb at the time of the whole loan sale or at the time when the firm last serviced any of those loans. the current upb balances could be substantially lower than the maximum potential payout amount included in the previous table. the related liability primarily relates to sales of loans to the federal mortgage agencies.
securitization representations and warranties. as part of the firm's institutional securities business segment's securitizations and related activities, the firm has provided, or otherwise agreed to be responsible for, representations and warranties regarding certain assets transferred in securitization transactions sponsored by the firm. the extent and nature of the representations and warranties, if any, vary among different securitizations. under certain circumstances, the firm may be required to repurchase certain assets or make other payments related to such assets if such representations and warranties are breached. the maximum potential amount of future payments the firm could be required to make would be equal to the current outstanding balances of, or losses associated with, the assets subject to breaches of such representations and warranties. the amount included in the previous table for the maximum potential payout includes the current upb or historical losses where known and the upb at the time of sale when the current upb is not known.
general partner guarantees. as a general partner in certain investment management funds, the firm receives certain distributions from the partnerships when the return exceeds specified performance targets according to the provisions of the partnership agreements. the firm may be required to return all or a portion of such distributions to the limited partners in the event the limited partners do not achieve a certain return as specified in the various partnership agreements, subject to certain limitations.
client clearing guarantees. the firm is a sponsoring member of the government securities division of the ficc's sponsored clearing model. clients of the firm, as sponsored members, can transact in overnight and term securities repurchase and resale agreements, which are cleared through the ficc. as sponsoring member, the firm guarantees to the ficc the prompt and full payment and performance of its clients' obligations. in 2020, the ficc's sponsored clearing model was updated such that the firm could be responsible for liquidation of a sponsored member's account and guarantees any resulting loss to the ficc in the event the sponsored member fails to fully pay any net liquidation amount due from the sponsored member to the ficc. accordingly, the firm's maximum potential payout amount reflects the total of the estimated net liquidation amounts for sponsored member accounts. the firm minimizes credit exposure under this guarantee by obtaining a security interest in its sponsored member clients' collateral and their contractual rights under sponsored member transactions. therefore, the firm's exposure is estimated to be an amount substantially lower than the maximum potential payout amount. the collateral amount in which the firm has a security interest is approximately equal to the maximum potential payout amount of the guarantee.
other guarantees and indemnities in the normal course of business, the firm provides guarantees and indemnifications in a variety of transactions. these provisions generally are standard contractual terms. certain of these guarantees and indemnifications are described below:
•indemnities. the firm provides standard indemnities to counterparties for certain contingent exposures and taxes, including u.s. and foreign withholding taxes, on interest and other payments made on derivatives, securities and stock lending transactions, certain annuity products and other financial arrangements. these indemnity payments could be required based on a change in the tax laws, a change in interpretation of applicable tax rulings or a change in factual circumstances. certain contracts contain provisions that enable the firm to terminate the agreement upon the occurrence of such events. the maximum potential amount of future payments that the firm could be december 2021 form 10-k notes to consolidated financial statements required to make under these indemnifications cannot be estimated.
•exchange/clearinghouse member guarantees. the firm is a member of various exchanges and clearinghouses that trade and clear securities and/or derivative contracts. associated with its membership, the firm may be required to pay a certain amount as determined by the exchange or the clearinghouse in case of a default of any of its members or pay a proportionate share of the financial obligations of another member that may default on its obligations to the exchange or the clearinghouse. while the rules governing different exchange or clearinghouse memberships and the forms of these guarantees may vary, in general the firm's obligations under these rules would arise only if the exchange or clearinghouse had previously exhausted its resources.
in addition, some clearinghouse rules require members to assume a proportionate share of losses resulting from the clearinghouse's investment of guarantee fund contributions and initial margin and of other losses unrelated to the default of a clearing member, if such losses exceed the specified resources allocated for such purpose by the clearinghouse.
the maximum potential payout under these rules cannot be estimated. the firm has not recorded any contingent liability in its financial statements for these agreements and believes that any potential requirement to make payments under these agreements is remote.
•merger and acquisition guarantees. the firm may, from time to time, in its role as investment banking advisor be required to provide guarantees in connection with certain european merger and acquisition transactions. if required by the regulating authorities, the firm provides a guarantee that the acquirer in the transaction has or will have sufficient funds to complete the transaction and would then be required to make the acquisition payments in the event the acquirer's funds are insufficient at the completion date of the transaction. these arrangements generally cover the time frame from the transaction offer date to its closing date and, therefore, are generally short term in nature. the firm believes the likelihood of any payment by the firm under these arrangements is remote given the level of its due diligence in its role as investment banking advisor.
in addition, in the ordinary course of business, the firm guarantees the debt and/or certain trading obligations (including obligations associated with derivatives, foreign exchange contracts and the settlement of physical commodities) of certain subsidiaries. these guarantees generally are entity or product specific and are required by investors or trading counterparties. the activities of the firm's subsidiaries covered by these guarantees (including any related debt or trading obligations) are included in the financial statements.
contingencies legal in addition to the matters described in the following paragraphs, in the normal course of business, the firm has been named, from time to time, as a defendant in various legal actions, including arbitrations, class actions and other litigation, arising in connection with its activities as a global diversified financial services institution. certain of the actual or threatened legal actions include claims for substantial compensatory and/or punitive damages or claims for indeterminate amounts of damages. in some cases, the entities that would otherwise be the primary defendants in such cases are bankrupt or are in financial distress. these actions have included, but are not limited to, antitrust, false claims act, residential mortgage and credit crisis-related matters.
while the firm has identified below any individual proceedings where the firm believes a material loss to be reasonably possible and reasonably estimable, there can be no assurance that material losses will not be incurred from claims that have not yet been asserted or those where potential losses have not yet been determined to be probable or possible and reasonably estimable.
the firm contests liability and/or the amount of damages as appropriate in each pending matter. where available information indicates that it is probable a liability had been incurred at the date of the financial statements and the firm can reasonably estimate the amount of that loss, the firm accrues the estimated loss by a charge to income.

legal expenses          $157          $336          $221
the firm's legal expenses can, and may in the future, fluctuate from period to period, given the current environment regarding government investigations and private litigation affecting global financial services firms, including the firm.
in many proceedings and investigations, however, it is inherently difficult to determine whether any loss is probable or even possible or to estimate the amount of any loss. in addition, even where a loss is possible or an exposure to loss exists in excess of the liability already accrued with respect to a previously recognized loss contingency, it is not always possible to reasonably estimate the size of the possible loss or range of loss, particularly for proceedings and investigations where the factual record is being developed or contested or where plaintiffs or government entities seek substantial or indeterminate damages, restitution, disgorgement or penalties. numerous issues may need to be resolved before a loss or additional loss, or range of loss or additional range of loss, can be reasonably estimated for a proceeding or investigation, including through potentially lengthy discovery and determination of important factual matters, determination of issues related to class certification and the calculation of damages or other relief, and consideration of novel or december 2021 form 10-k notes to consolidated financial statements unsettled legal questions relevant to the proceedings or investigations in question.
for certain other legal proceedings and investigations, the firm can estimate reasonably possible losses, additional losses, ranges of loss or ranges of additional loss in excess of amounts accrued but does not believe, based on current knowledge and after consultation with counsel, that such losses could have a material adverse effect on the firm's financial statements as a whole, other than the matters referred to in the following paragraphs.
on september 23, 2014, financial guaranty insurance company ("fgic") filed a complaint against the firm in the supreme court of the state of new york county ("supreme court of ny") styled financial guaranty insurance company v. morgan stanley abs capital i inc. et al. relating to the morgan stanley abs capital i inc. trust 2007-nc4. the complaint asserts claims for breach of contract and fraudulent inducement and alleges, among other things, that the loans in the trust breached various representations and warranties and that defendants made untrue statements and material omissions to induce fgic to issue a financial guaranty policy on certain classes of certificates that had an original balance of approximately $876 million. the complaint seeks, among other relief, specific performance of the loan breach remedy procedures in the transaction documents, compensatory, consequential and punitive damages, attorneys' fees, interest and costs. on january 23, 2017, the court denied the firm's motion to dismiss the complaint. on september 13, 2018, the appellate division, first department ("first department") affirmed in part and reversed in part the lower court's order denying the firm's motion to dismiss the complaint. on december 20, 2018, the first department denied plaintiff's motion for leave to appeal to the new york court of appeals ("court of appeals") or, in the alternative, for re-argument. on july 30, 2021, the firm filed a motion for summary judgment. on february 4, 2022, the parties entered into a confidential settlement agreement, which is conditioned on consummation of the firm's agreement to settle deutsche bank national trust company solely in its capacity as trustee of the morgan stanley abs capital i inc. trust 2007-nc4 v. morgan stanley mortgage capital holdings llc as successor-by-merger to morgan stanley mortgage capital inc., and morgan stanley abs capital i inc. based on currently available information, the firm believes that it could incur a loss in this action of up to approximately $277 million, the total original unpaid balance of the mortgage loans for which the firm received repurchase demands from a certificate holder and fgic that the firm did not repurchase, plus pre- and post- judgment interest, fees and costs, as well as claim payments that fgic has made and will make in the future. in addition, plaintiff is seeking to expand the number of loans at issue and the possible range of loss could increase.
on january 23, 2015, deutsche bank national trust company, in its capacity as trustee, filed a complaint against the firm styled deutsche bank national trust company solely in its capacity as trustee of the morgan stanley abs capital i inc. trust 2007-nc4 v. morgan stanley mortgage capital holdings llc as successor-by-merger to morgan stanley mortgage capital inc., and morgan stanley abs capital i inc., pending in the supreme court of ny. the complaint asserts claims for breach of contract and alleges, among other things, that the loans in the trust, which had an original principal balance of approximately $1.05 billion, breached various representations and warranties. the complaint seeks, among other relief, specific performance of the loan breach remedy procedures in the transaction documents, compensatory, consequential, rescissory, equitable and punitive damages, attorneys' fees, costs and other related expenses, and interest. on december 11, 2015, the court granted in part and denied in part the firm's motion to dismiss the complaint. on october 19, 2018, the court granted the firm's motion for leave to amend its answer and to stay the case pending resolution of deutsche bank national trust company's appeal to the court of appeals in another case, styled deutsche bank national trust company v. barclays bank plc, regarding the applicable statute of limitations. on january 17, 2019, the first department reversed the trial court's order to the extent that it had granted in part the firm's motion to dismiss the complaint. on june 4, 2019, the first department granted the firm's motion for leave to appeal its january 17, 2019 decision to the court of appeals. on march 19, 2020, the firm filed a motion for partial summary judgment. on december 22, 2020, the court of appeals reversed the first department and reinstated the trial court's order to the extent it had granted in part the firm's motion to dismiss the complaint. on february 4, 2022, the parties entered into an agreement to settle the litigation, which is conditioned on approval by either certificateholders in a consent solicitation or a court in a trust instructional proceeding. based on currently available information, the firm believes that it could incur a loss in this action of up to approximately $277 million, the total original unpaid balance of the mortgage loans for which the firm received repurchase demands from a certificate holder and a monoline insurer that the firm did not repurchase, plus pre- and post-judgment interest, fees and costs, but plaintiff is seeking to expand the number of loans at issue and the possible range of loss could increase.

•interests purchased in connection with market-making activities, securities held in its investment securities portfolio and retained interests held as a result of securitization activities, including re-securitization transactions.
•guarantees issued and residual interests retained in connection with municipal bond securitizations.
•loans made to and investments in vies that hold debt, equity, real estate or other assets.
•derivatives entered into with vies.
•structuring of clns or other asset-repackaging notes designed to meet the investment objectives of clients.
•other structured transactions designed to provide tax-efficient yields to the firm or its clients.
the firm determines whether it is the primary beneficiary of a vie upon its initial involvement with the vie and reassesses whether it is the primary beneficiary on an ongoing basis as long as it has any continuing involvement with the vie. this determination is based upon an analysis of the design of the vie, including the vie's structure and activities, the power to make significant economic decisions held by the firm and by other parties, and the variable interests owned by the firm and other parties.
the power to make the most significant economic decisions may take a number of different forms in different types of vies. the firm considers servicing or collateral management decisions as representing the power to make the most significant economic decisions in transactions such as securitizations or cdos. as a result, the firm does not consolidate securitizations or cdos for which it does not act as the servicer or collateral manager unless it holds certain other rights to replace the servicer or collateral manager or to require the liquidation of the entity. if the firm serves as servicer or collateral manager, or has certain other rights described in the previous sentence, the firm analyzes the interests in the vie that it holds and consolidates only those vies for which it holds a potentially significant interest in the vie.
for many transactions, such as re-securitization transactions, clns and other asset-repackaging notes, there are no significant economic decisions made on an ongoing basis. in these cases, the firm focuses its analysis on decisions made prior to the initial closing of the transaction and at the termination of the transaction. the firm concluded in most of these transactions that decisions made prior to the initial closing were shared between the firm and the initial investors based upon the nature of the assets, including whether the assets were issued in a transaction sponsored by the firm and the extent of the information available to the firm and to investors, the number, nature and involvement of investors, other rights held by the firm and investors, the standardization of the legal documentation and the level of continuing involvement by the firm, including the amount and type of interests owned by the firm and by other investors. the firm focused its control decision on any right held by the firm or investors related to the termination of the vie. most re-securitization transactions, clns and other asset-repackaging notes have no such termination rights.

consolidated vie assets and liabilities are presented in the previous tables after intercompany eliminations. generally, most assets owned by consolidated vies cannot be removed unilaterally by the firm and are not available to the firm while the related liabilities issued by consolidated vies are non-recourse to the firm. however, in certain consolidated vies, the firm either has the unilateral right to remove assets or provides additional recourse through derivatives such as total return swaps, guarantees or other forms of involvement.
in general, the firm's exposure to loss in consolidated vies is limited to losses that would be absorbed on the vie net assets recognized in its financial statements, net of amounts absorbed by third-party variable interest holders.

2.other primarily includes exposures to commercial real estate property and investment funds.
3.where notional amounts are utilized in quantifying the maximum exposure related to derivatives, such amounts do not reflect changes in fair value recorded by the firm.
4.additional vie assets owned represents the carrying value of total exposure to non-consolidated vies for which the maximum exposure to loss is less than specific thresholds, primarily interests issued by securitization spes. the firm's maximum exposure to loss generally equals the fair value of the assets owned. these assets are primarily included in trading assets and investment securities and are measured at fair value (see note 5). the firm does not provide additional support in these transactions through contractual facilities, guarantees or similar derivatives.
the majority of the vies included in the previous tables are sponsored by unrelated parties; examples of the firm's involvement with these vies include its secondary market-making activities and the securities held in its investment securities portfolio (see note 8).
the firm's maximum exposure to loss is dependent on the nature of the firm's variable interest in the vie and is limited to the notional amounts of certain liquidity facilities and other credit support, total return swaps and written put options, as well as the fair value of certain other derivatives and investments the firm has made in the vie.
the firm's maximum exposure to loss in the previous tables does not include the offsetting benefit of hedges or any reductions associated with the amount of collateral held as part of a transaction with the vie or any party to the vie directly against a specific exposure to loss.
liabilities issued by vies generally are non-recourse to the firm.

december 2021 form 10-k notes to consolidated financial statements securitization activities in a securitization transaction, the firm transfers assets (generally commercial or residential mortgage loans or securities) to an spe, sells to investors most of the beneficial interests, such as notes or certificates, issued by the spe, and, in many cases, retains other beneficial interests. the purchase of the transferred assets by the spe is financed through the sale of these interests.
in many securitization transactions involving commercial mortgage loans, the firm transfers a portion of the assets to the spe with unrelated parties transferring the remaining assets. in addition, mainly in securitization transactions involving residential mortgage loans, the firm may also enter into derivative transactions, primarily interest rate swaps or interest rate caps, with the spe.
although not obligated, the firm generally makes a market in the securities issued by spes in securitization transactions. as a market maker, the firm offers to buy these securities from, and sell these securities to, investors. securities purchased through these market-making activities are not considered to be retained interests; these beneficial interests generally are included in trading assets-corporate and other debt and are measured at fair value.
the firm enters into derivatives, generally interest rate swaps and interest rate caps, with a senior payment priority in many securitization transactions. the risks associated with these and similar derivatives with spes are essentially the same as similar derivatives with non-spe counterparties and are managed as part of the firm's overall exposure. see note 7 for further information on derivative instruments and hedging activities.
investment securities the firm holds securities issued by vies within the investment securities portfolio. these securities are composed of those related to transactions sponsored by the federal mortgage agencies and predominantly the most senior securities issued by vies backed by student loans and commercial mortgage loans. transactions sponsored by the federal mortgage agencies include an explicit or implicit guarantee provided by the u.s. government. additionally, the firm holds certain commercial mortgage-backed securities issued by vies retained as a result of the firm's securitization activities. see note 8 for further information on the investment securities portfolio.
municipal tender option bond trusts in a municipal tender option bond trust transaction, the client transfers a municipal bond to a trust. the trust issues short-term securities that the firm, as the remarketing agent, sells to investors. the client generally retains a residual interest. the short-term securities are supported by a liquidity facility pursuant to which the investors may put their short-term interests. in most programs, a third-party provider will provide such liquidity facility; in some programs, the firm provides this liquidity facility.
the firm may, in lieu of purchasing short-term securities for remarketing, decide to extend a temporary loan to the trust. the client can generally terminate the transaction at any time. the liquidity provider can generally terminate the transaction upon the occurrence of certain events. when the transaction is terminated, the municipal bond is generally sold or returned to the client. any losses suffered by the liquidity provider upon the sale of the bond are the responsibility of the client. this obligation is generally collateralized. liquidity facilities provided to municipal tender option bond trusts are classified as derivatives. the firm consolidates any municipal tender option bond trusts in which it holds the residual interest.
credit protection purchased through credit-linked notes cln transactions are designed to provide investors with exposure to certain credit risk on referenced assets. in these transactions, the firm transfers assets (generally high-quality securities or money market investments) to an spe, enters into a derivative transaction in which the spe sells protection on an unrelated referenced asset or group of assets, through a credit derivative, and sells the securities issued by the spe to investors. in some transactions, the firm may also enter into interest rate or currency swaps with the spe. depending on the structure, the assets and liabilities of the spe may be consolidated and recognized in the firm's balance sheet or accounted for as a sale of assets.
upon the occurrence of a credit event related to the referenced asset, the spe will deliver securities collateral as payment to the firm, which exposes the firm to changes in the collateral's value.
derivative payments by the spe are collateralized. the risks associated with these and similar derivatives with spes are essentially the same as those with non-spe counterparties and are managed as part of the firm's overall exposure.
other structured financings the firm invests in interests issued by entities that develop and own low-income communities (including low-income housing projects) and entities that construct and own facilities that will generate energy from renewable resources. the interests entitle the firm to a share of tax credits and tax losses generated by these projects. in addition, the firm has issued guarantees to investors in certain low-income housing funds. the guarantees are designed to return an investor's contribution to a fund and the investor's share of tax losses and tax credits expected to be generated by the fund. the firm is also involved with entities designed to provide tax-efficient yields to the firm or its clients.
collateralized loan and debt obligations clos and cdos are spes that purchase a pool of assets consisting of corporate loans, corporate bonds, abs or december 2021 form 10-k notes to consolidated financial statements synthetic exposures on similar assets through derivatives and issue multiple tranches of debt and equity securities to investors. the firm underwrites the securities issued in certain clo transactions on behalf of unaffiliated sponsors and provides advisory services to these unaffiliated sponsors. the firm sells corporate loans to many of these spes, in some cases representing a significant portion of the total assets purchased. although not obligated, the firm generally makes a market in the securities issued by spes in these transactions and may retain unsold securities. these beneficial interests are included in trading assets and are measured at fair value.
equity-linked notes eln transactions are designed to provide investors with exposure to certain risks related to the specific equity security, equity index or other index. in an eln transaction, the firm typically transfers to an spe either a note issued by the firm, the payments on which are linked to the performance of a specific equity security, equity index or other index, or debt securities issued by other companies and a derivative contract, the terms of which will relate to the performance of a specific equity security, equity index or other index. these eln transactions with spes were not consolidated at december 31, 2021 or december 31, 2020.

the previous tables include transactions with spes in which the firm, acting as principal, transferred financial assets with continuing involvement and received sales treatment. the transferred assets are carried at fair value prior to securitization, and any changes in fair value are recognized in the income statement. the firm may act as underwriter of the beneficial interests issued by these securitization vehicles, for which investment banking revenues are recognized. the firm may retain interests in the securitized financial assets as one or more tranches of the securitization. these retained interests are generally carried at fair value in the balance sheet with changes in fair value recognized in the income statement. fair value for these interests is measured using techniques that are consistent with the valuation techniques applied to the firm's major categories of assets and liabilities as described in notes 2 and 5. further, as permitted by applicable guidance, certain transfers of assets where the firm's only continuing involvement is a derivative are only reported in the following assets sold with retained exposure table.

17. regulatory requirements regulatory capital framework the firm is an fhc under the bank holding company act of 1956, as amended, and is subject to the regulation and oversight of the board of governors of the federal reserve system ("federal reserve"). the federal reserve establishes capital requirements for the firm, including "well-capitalized" standards, and evaluates the firm's compliance with such capital requirements. the occ establishes similar capital requirements and standards for the firm's u.s. bank subsidiaries, including, among others, msbna and mspbna. the regulatory capital requirements are largely based on the basel iii capital standards established by the basel committee on banking supervision and also implement certain provisions of the dodd-frank wall street reform and consumer protection act. in addition, many of the firm's regulated subsidiaries are subject to regulatory capital requirements, including regulated subsidiaries provisionally registered as swap dealers with the cftc or conditionally registered as security-based swap dealers with the sec or registered as broker-dealers or futures commission merchants.
regulatory capital requirements the firm is required to maintain minimum risk-based and leverage-based capital ratios under regulatory capital requirements. a summary of the calculations of regulatory capital and rwa follows.
risk-based regulatory capital. risk-based capital ratio requirements apply to common equity tier 1 capital, tier 1 capital and total capital (which includes tier 2 capital), each as a percentage of rwa, and consist of regulatory minimum required ratios plus the firm's capital buffer requirement. capital requirements require certain adjustments to, and deductions from, capital for purposes of determining these ratios.
cecl deferral.  in 2020, the u.s. banking agencies adopted a final rule, consistent with an interim final rule that was effective march 31, 2020, altering, for purposes of the regulatory capital rules, the required adoption time period for cecl. as of december 31, 2021 and december 31, 2020, the risk-based and leverage-based capital amounts and ratios, as well as rwa, adjusted average assets and supplementary leverage exposure are calculated excluding the effect of the adoption of cecl based on the firm's election to defer this effect over a five-year transition period that began on january 1, 2020 in accordance with the final rule. the deferral impacts begin to phase back in at 25% per year beginning in 2022 and become fully phased-in beginning in 2025.

1.the ccyb can be set up to 2.5% but is currently set by the federal reserve at zero.
the capital buffer requirement represents the amount of common equity tier 1 capital the firm must maintain above the minimum risk-based capital requirements in order to avoid restrictions on the firm's ability to make capital distributions, including the payment of dividends and the repurchase of stock, and to pay discretionary bonuses to executive officers. the firm's standardized approach capital buffer requirement is equal to the sum of the scb, g-sib capital surcharge and ccyb, and the advanced approach capital buffer requirement is equal to the 2.5% capital conservation buffer, g-sib capital surcharge and ccyb.

risk-weighted assets rwa reflects both the firm's on- and off-balance sheet risk, as well as capital charges attributable to the risk of loss arising from the following:
•credit risk: the failure of a borrower, counterparty or issuer to meet its financial obligations to the firm;
123               december 2021 form 10-k notes to consolidated financial statements
•market risk: adverse changes in the level of one or more market prices, rates, indices, volatilities, correlations or other market factors, such as market liquidity; and
•operational risk: inadequate or failed processes or systems from human factors or from external events (e.g., fraud, theft, legal and compliance risks, cyber attacks or damage to physical assets).
the firm's risk-based capital ratios are computed under both (i) the standardized approaches for calculating credit risk and market risk rwa ("standardized approach") and (ii) the applicable advanced approaches for calculating credit risk, market risk and operational risk rwa ("advanced approach"). the credit risk rwa calculations between the two approaches differ in that the standardized approach requires calculation of rwa using prescribed risk weights, whereas the advanced approach utilizes models to calculate exposure amounts and risk weights. at december 31, 2021 and december 31, 2020, the differences between the actual and required ratio were lower under the standardized approach.
leverage-based regulatory capital. leverage-based capital requirements include a minimum tier 1 leverage ratio of 4%, a minimum slr of 3% and an enhanced slr capital buffer of at least 2%.

1.required ratios are inclusive of any buffers applicable as of the date presented.
2.the firm early adopted the standardized approach for counterparty credit risk ("sa-ccr") on december 1, 2021. sa-ccr replaced the current exposure method used to measure derivatives counterparty exposure within the standardized approach rwa and supplementary leverage ratio exposure calculations. as a result of the adoption, as of december 31, 2021, the firm's risk-weighted assets under the standardized approach increased by $25 billion, and the firm's standardized common equity tier 1 capital ratio decreased by 90 basis points.
3.adjusted average assets represents the denominator of the tier 1 leverage ratio and is composed of the average daily balance of consolidated on-balance sheet assets for the quarters ending on the respective balance sheet dates, reduced by disallowed goodwill, intangible assets, investments in covered funds, defined benefit pension plan assets, after-tax gain on sale from assets sold into securitizations, investments in the firm's own capital instruments, certain defined tax assets and other capital deductions.
4.supplementary leverage exposure is the sum of adjusted average assets used in the tier 1 leverage ratio and other adjustments, primarily: (i) for derivatives, potential future exposure and the effective notional principal amount of sold credit protection, offset by qualifying purchased credit protection; (ii) the counterparty credit risk for repo-style transactions; and (iii) the credit equivalent amount for off-balance sheet exposures.
5.the firm's slr and supplementary leverage exposure as of december 31, 2020 reflect the exclusion of u.s. treasury securities and deposits at federal reserve banks based on a federal reserve interim final rule that was in effect until march 31, 2021.
certain u.s. bank subsidiaries' regulatory capital and capital ratios the occ establishes capital requirements for the firm's u.s. bank subsidiaries, which as of december 31, 2021 and december 31, 2020 include, among others, morgan stanley bank, n.a. ("msbna") and morgan stanley private bank, national association ("mspbna"), and evaluates their compliance with such capital requirements. regulatory capital requirements for msbna and mspbna are calculated in a similar manner to the firm's regulatory capital requirements, although g-sib capital surcharge and scb requirements do not apply to the u.s. bank subsidiaries.

notes to consolidated financial statements have a direct material effect on the u.s. bank subsidiaries' and the firm's financial statements.
at december 31, 2021 and december 31, 2020, msbna and mspbna risk-based capital ratios are based on the standardized approach rules. at december 31, 2021 and december 31, 2020, the risk-based and leverage-based capital amounts and ratios are calculated excluding the effect of the adoption of cecl based on msbna's and mspbna's election to defer this effect over a five-year transition period, which began on january 1, 2020. the deferral impacts begin to phase back in at 25% per year beginning in 2022 and become fully phased-in beginning in 2025.

1. fair value of converted stock is based on the share price on conversion. fair value of vested stock is based on the share price at date of vesting.
performance-based stock units psus will vest and convert to shares of common stock only if the firm satisfies predetermined performance and market-based conditions over a three-year performance period. the number of psus that will vest ranges from 0% to 150% of the target award, based on the extent to which the firm achieves the specified performance goals. one-half of the award is earned based on the firm's average return on equity, excluding certain adjustments ("ms adjusted roe"). for all awards granted beginning in 2021, this performance measure was updated and is now based on the firm's average return on tangible common equity excluding certain adjustments ("ms adjusted rotce"). the other half of the award will be earned based on the firm's total shareholder return, relative to the total shareholder return of the s&p 500 financials sector index ("relative ms tsr"). psus have vesting, restriction and cancellation provisions that are generally similar to those of rsus. at december 31, 2021, approximately 3 million psus were outstanding.

the relative ms tsr fair values on the award date were estimated using a monte carlo simulation and the following assumptions.

the risk-free interest rate was determined based on the yields available on u.s. treasury zero-coupon issues. the expected stock price volatility was determined using historical volatility. the correlation coefficient was developed based on historical price data of the firm and the s&p 500 financials sector index. the model uses an expected dividend yield equivalent to reinvesting dividends.

the u.s. qualified plan's assets represent 86% of the firm's total pension plan assets. the u.s. qualified plan uses a combination of active and risk-controlled fixed income investment strategies. the fixed income asset allocation consists primarily of fixed income securities and related derivative instruments designed to approximate the expected cash flows of the plan's liabilities in order to help reduce plan exposure to interest rate variation and to better align assets with the obligation. the longer-duration fixed income allocation is expected to help protect the plan's funded status and maintain the stability of plan contributions over the long run. the investment portfolio performance is assessed by comparing actual investment performance with changes in the estimated present value of the u.s. qualified plan's benefit obligation.
derivative instruments are permitted in the u.s. qualified plan's investment portfolio only to the extent that they comply with all of the plan's investment policy guidelines and are consistent with the plan's risk and return objectives.

controls and procedures conclusion regarding the effectiveness of disclosure controls and procedures under the supervision and with the participation of the firm's management, including the chief executive officer and chief financial officer, the firm conducted an evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures, as such term is defined under exchange act rule 13a-15(e). based on this evaluation, the chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that the firm's disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of the end of the period covered by this annual report.
management's report on internal control over financial reporting the firm's management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. the firm's internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states of america ("u.s. gaap").
the internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that:
•pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the firm;
•provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with u.s. gaap and that receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of the firm's management and directors; and
•provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of firm assets that could have a material effect on the firm's financial statements.
because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
management assessed the effectiveness of the firm's internal control over financial reporting as of december 31, 2021. in making this assessment, management used the criteria set forth by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission ("coso") in internal control-integrated framework (2013). based on management's assessment and those criteria, management believes that the firm maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of december 31, 2021.
the firm's independent registered public accounting firm has audited and issued a report on the firm's internal control over financial reporting, which appears below.
december 2021 form 10-k report of independent registered public accounting firm to the shareholders and the board of directors of morgan stanley:

we have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the public company accounting oversight board (united states) (pcaob), the financial statements of the firm as of and for the year ended december 31, 2021 and our report dated february 24, 2022 expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements.
basis for opinion the firm's management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying management's report on internal control over financial reporting. our responsibility is to express an opinion on the firm's internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. we are a public accounting firm registered with the pcaob and are required to be independent with respect to the firm in accordance with the u.s. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the securities and exchange commission and the pcaob.
we conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the pcaob. those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. we believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
definition and limitations of internal control over financial reporting a company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. a company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

legal proceedings in addition to the matters described below, in the normal course of business, the firm has been named, from time to time, as a defendant in various legal actions, including arbitrations, class actions and other litigation, arising in connection with its activities as a global diversified financial services institution. certain of the actual or threatened legal actions include claims for substantial compensatory and/or punitive damages or claims for indeterminate amounts of damages. in some cases, the entities that would otherwise be the primary defendants in such cases are bankrupt or are in financial distress.
the firm is also involved, from time to time, in other reviews, investigations and proceedings (both formal and informal) by governmental and self-regulatory agencies regarding the firm's business, and involving, among other matters, sales and trading activities, financial products or offerings sponsored, underwritten or sold by the firm, and accounting and operational matters, certain of which may result in adverse judgments, settlements, fines, penalties, injunctions or other relief.
the firm contests liability and/or the amount of damages as appropriate in each pending matter. where available information indicates that it is probable a liability had been incurred at the date of the financial statements and the firm can reasonably estimate the amount of that loss, the firm accrues the estimated loss by a charge to income. the firm's future legal expenses may fluctuate from period to period, given the current environment regarding government investigations and private litigation affecting global financial services firms, including the firm.
in many proceedings and investigations, however, it is inherently difficult to determine whether any loss is probable or even possible or to estimate the amount of any loss. the firm cannot predict with certainty if, how or when such proceedings or investigations will be resolved or what the eventual settlement, fine, penalty or other relief, if any, may be, particularly for proceedings and investigations where the factual record is being developed or contested or where plaintiffs or government entities seek substantial or indeterminate damages, restitution, disgorgement or penalties. numerous issues may need to be resolved before a loss or additional loss or range of loss or additional range of loss can be reasonably estimated for a proceeding or investigation, including through potentially lengthy discovery and determination of important factual matters, determination of issues related to class certification and the calculation of damages or other relief, and consideration of novel or unsettled legal questions relevant to the proceedings or investigations in question. subject to the foregoing, the firm believes, based on current knowledge and after consultation with counsel, that the outcome of such proceedings and investigations will not have a material adverse effect on the financial condition of the firm, although the outcome of such proceedings or investigations could be material to the firm's operating results and cash flows for a particular period depending on, among other things, the level of the firm's revenues or income for such period.
while the firm has identified below certain proceedings that the firm believes to be material, individually or collectively, there can be no assurance that additional material losses will not be incurred from claims that have not yet been asserted or are not yet determined to be material.

management's discussion and analysis for more information about resolution and recovery planning requirements and our activities in these areas, including the implications of such activities in a resolution scenario, see "business-supervision and regulation-financial holding company-resolution and recovery planning" and "risk factors-legal, regulatory and compliance risk."
regulatory developments and other matters replacement of london interbank offered rate and replacement or reform of other interest rate benchmarks central banks around the world, including the federal reserve, have commissioned committees and working groups of market participants and official sector representatives to replace libor and replace or reform other interest rate benchmarks (collectively, the "ibors"). a transition away from use of the ibors to alternative rates and other potential interest rate benchmark reforms is underway and will continue over the course of the next few years.
in accordance with announcements by the financial conduct authority ("fca"), which regulates libor publication, and ice benchmark administration limited, which administers libor publication, the publication of most non-u.s. dollar libor rates ceased as of the end of december 2021. while publication of the one-, three- and six-month sterling and japanese yen libor settings will continue at least until the end of 2022 on the basis of a "synthetic" methodology (known as "synthetic libor"), these rates have been designated unrepresentative by the fca and are solely available for use in legacy transactions. furthermore, while certain u.s. dollar libor tenors are expected to continue to be published until june 30, 2023, the u.s. banking agencies and the fca have issued guidance instructing banks to cease entering into new contracts referencing u.s. dollar libor no later than december 31, 2021, with certain exceptions.
as of december 31, 2021, our libor-referenced contracts were primarily concentrated in derivative contracts and to a lesser extent, loans, floating rate notes, preferred shares, securitizations and mortgages. a significant majority of our derivative contracts, and a majority of our non-derivative contracts contain fallback provisions or otherwise have an expected path that will allow for the transition to an alternative reference rate upon the cessation of the applicable libor rate.
while we have made substantial progress in the transition away from the ibors, we nonetheless currently remain party to a significant number of u.s. dollar libor-linked contracts. a significant majority of our u.s. dollar derivative contracts contain ibor fallback provisions based in the first instance on sofr due to incorporation of the international swaps and derivatives association ("isda") fallbacks supplement or through amendment by adherence to the 2020 ibor fallbacks protocol. further, to the extent that a u.s. dollar libor-linked derivative or non-derivative contract is governed by new york law, new york state has enacted legislation that is intended to minimize legal and economic uncertainty following u.s. dollar libor's cessation by replacing libor references in certain contracts under certain circumstances with a benchmark based on sofr, including any spread adjustment, recommended by the federal reserve, the federal reserve bank of new york or the alternative reference rates committee. for those u.s. dollar libor-linked contracts without appropriate fallbacks and for which the new york state legislation is not expected to apply, we are actively developing appropriate transition plans in light of the planned june 30, 2023 cessation date for the remaining u.s. dollar libor tenors.
following the cessation or non-representativeness designation of non-u.s. dollar libor rates as of december 31, 2021, our non-u.s. dollar libor-linked contracts containing fallback provisions transitioned to alternative reference rates through the operation of the fallbacks within the contracts. for example, as of the first reset date following december 31, 2021, derivative contracts referencing non-u.s. dollar libor that either incorporate the isda ibor fallbacks supplement or that were amended through adherence to the 2020 ibor fallbacks protocol, are or will be valued using the adjusted version of the applicable risk-free reference rate selected as an alternative to the ibors by the appropriate national committee (e.g., sterling overnight index average rate in place of sterling libor and the tokyo overnight average rate in place of japanese yen libor).
of the remaining portion of non-u.s. dollar libor-linked contracts that have not transitioned to alternative reference rates through the operation of fallback provisions, many of these contracts reference sterling or japanese yen libor settings for which a synthetic rate will be published at least until the end of 2022, therefore these contracts will continue to reference synthetic libor at least for the duration of 2022.
our ibor transition plan is overseen by a global steering committee, with senior management oversight, and we continue to execute against our firm-wide ibor transition plan to complete the transition to alternative reference rates, including implementing regulatory guidance to cease entering into new contracts referencing u.s. dollar libor after december 31, 2021, with certain exceptions.

december 2021 form 10-k quantitative and qualitative disclosures about risk risk management overview risk is an inherent part of our businesses and activities. we believe effective risk management is vital to the success of our business activities. accordingly, we have an enterprise risk management ("erm") framework to integrate the diverse roles of risk management into a holistic enterprise structure and to facilitate the incorporation of risk assessment into decision-making processes across the firm.
we have policies and procedures in place to identify, measure, monitor, escalate, mitigate and control the principal risks involved in the activities of the institutional securities, wealth management and investment management business segments, as well as at the parent company level. the principal risks involved in our business activities include market (including non-trading risks), credit, operational, model, compliance, cybersecurity, liquidity, strategic, reputational and conduct risk. strategic risk is integrated into our business planning, embedded in the evaluation of all principal risks and overseen by the board.
the cornerstone of our risk management philosophy is the pursuit of risk-adjusted returns through prudent risk taking that protects our capital base and franchise. this philosophy is implemented through the erm framework. five key principles underlie this philosophy: integrity, comprehensiveness, independence, accountability and transparency. to help ensure the efficacy of risk management, which is an essential component of our reputation, senior management requires thorough and frequent communication and the appropriate escalation of risk matters. the fast-paced, complex and constantly evolving nature of global financial markets requires us to maintain a risk management culture that is incisive, knowledgeable about specialized products and markets, and subject to ongoing review and enhancement.
our risk appetite defines the aggregate level and types of risk that the firm is willing to accept to achieve its business objectives, taking into account the interests of clients and fiduciary duties to shareholders, as well as capital and other regulatory requirements. this risk appetite is embedded in our risk culture and linked to our short-term and long-term strategic, capital and financial plans, as well as compensation programs. this risk appetite and the related board-level risk limits and risk tolerance statements are reviewed and approved by the risk committee of the board ("brc") and the board on at least an annual basis.
risk governance structure risk management at the firm requires independent firm-level oversight, accountability of our business divisions, and effective communication of risk matters across the firm, to senior management and ultimately to the board. our risk governance structure is set forth in the following chart and also includes risk managers, committees, and groups within and across business segments and operating legal entities. the erm framework, composed of independent but complementary entities, facilitates efficient and comprehensive supervision of our risk exposures and processes.

december 2021 form 10-k risk disclosures morgan stanley board of directors the board has oversight of the erm framework and is responsible for helping to ensure that our risks are managed in a sound manner. the board has authorized the committees within the erm framework to help facilitate our risk oversight responsibilities. as set forth in our corporate governance policies, the board also oversees, and receives reports on, our financial performance, strategy and business plans, as well as our practices and procedures relating to reputational and franchise risk, and culture, values and conduct.
risk committee of the board the brc assists the board in its oversight of the erm framework; oversees major risk exposures of the firm, including market, credit, model and liquidity risk, against established risk measurement methodologies and the steps management has taken to monitor and control such exposures; oversees our risk appetite statement, including risk limits and tolerances; reviews capital, liquidity and funding strategy and related guidelines and policies; reviews the contingency funding plan and capital planning process; oversees our significant risk management and risk assessment guidelines and policies; oversees the performance of the chief risk officer; reviews reports from our strategic transactions committee, ccar committee and rrp committee; reviews new product risk, emerging risks, climate risk and regulatory matters; and reviews the internal audit department reports on the assessment of the risk management, liquidity and capital functions. the brc reports to the board on a regular basis and coordinates with other board committees with respect to oversight of risk management and risk assessment guidelines.
audit committee of the board the audit committee of the board ("bac") oversees the integrity of our financial statements, compliance with legal and regulatory requirements, and system of internal controls; oversees risk management and risk assessment guidelines in coordination with the board, the brc, and the operations and technology committee of the board ("botc"); reviews the major legal, compliance and conduct risk exposures of the firm and the steps management has taken to monitor and control such exposures; selects, determines the fees, evaluates and, when appropriate, replaces the independent auditor; oversees the qualifications, independence and performance of our independent auditor and pre-approves audit and permitted non-audit services; oversees the performance of our chief audit officer; and, after review, recommends to the board the acceptance and inclusion of the annual audited financial statements in the firm's annual report on form 10-k. the bac reports to the board on a regular basis.
operations and technology committee of the board the botc oversees our operations and technology strategy and significant investments in support of such strategy;
oversees operations, technology and operational risk, including information security, fraud, vendor, data protection, privacy, business continuity and resilience, cybersecurity risks and the steps management has taken to monitor and control such exposures; receives reports regarding business continuity and resilience; and reviews risk management and risk assessment guidelines in coordination with the board, the brc and the bac, and policies regarding operations, technology and operational risk. the botc reports to the board on a regular basis.
firm risk committee the board has also authorized the firm risk committee ("frc"), a management committee appointed and co-chaired by the chief executive officer and chief risk officer, which includes the most senior officers of the firm from the business, independent risk functions and control groups, to help oversee the erm framework. the frc's responsibilities include: oversight of our risk management principles, procedures and limits; the monitoring of capital levels and material market, credit, model, operational, liquidity, legal, compliance and reputational risk matters, and other risks, as appropriate; and the steps management has taken to monitor and manage such risks. the frc also establishes and communicates risk tolerance, including aggregate firm limits and tolerances, as appropriate. the governance process review subcommittee of the frc oversees governance and process issues on behalf of the frc. the frc reports to the board, the bac, the botc and the brc through the chief risk officer, chief financial officer and chief legal officer.
functional risk and control committees functional risk and control committees and other committees within the erm framework facilitate efficient and comprehensive supervision of our risk exposures and processes.
each business segment has a risk committee that is responsible for helping to ensure that the business segment, as applicable, adheres to established limits for market, credit, operational and other risks; implements risk measurement, monitoring, and management policies, procedures, controls and systems that are consistent with the risk framework established by the frc; and reviews, on a periodic basis, our aggregate risk exposures, risk exception experience, and the efficacy of our risk identification, measurement, monitoring and management policies and procedures, and related controls.
chief risk officer the chief risk officer, who is independent of business units, reports to the brc and the chief executive officer. the chief risk officer oversees compliance with our risk limits; approves exceptions to our risk limits; independently reviews material market, credit, model, operational and liquidity risks; and reviews results of risk management processes with the december 2021 form 10-k risk disclosures board, the brc, the botc and the bac, as appropriate. the chief risk officer also coordinates with the chief financial officer regarding capital and liquidity management and works with the compensation, management development and succession committee of the board to help ensure that the structure and design of incentive compensation arrangements do not encourage unnecessary and excessive risk taking.
independent risk management functions the risk management functions (market risk, credit risk, operational risk, model risk and liquidity risk management departments) are independent of our business units and report to the chief risk officer. these functions assist senior management and the frc in monitoring and controlling our risk through a number of control processes. each function maintains its own risk governance structure with specified individuals and committees responsible for aspects of managing risk. further discussion about the responsibilities of the risk management functions may be found under "market risk," "credit risk," "operational risk," "model risk" and "liquidity risk" herein.
support and control groups our support and control groups include, but are not limited to, the legal and compliance division, the finance division, technology division, operations division, the human resources department, corporate services, firm resilience, and firm strategy and execution. our support and control groups coordinate with the business segment control groups to review the risk monitoring and risk management policies and procedures relating to, among other things, controls over financial reporting and disclosure; each business segment's market, credit and operational risk profile; liquidity risks; model risks; sales practices; reputational, legal enforceability, compliance, conduct and regulatory risk; and technological risks. participation by the senior officers of the firm and business segment control groups helps ensure that risk policies and procedures, exceptions to risk limits, new products and business ventures, and transactions with risk elements undergo thorough review.
internal audit department the internal audit department ("iad") independently assesses the firm's risk management processes and controls using methodology developed from professional auditing standards and regulatory guidance. iad undertakes these responsibilities through periodic reviews of our business activities, operations and systems, as well as special investigations and retrospective reviews that may be specifically requested by the bac or management. in addition to regular reports to the bac, the chief audit officer, who reports functionally to the bac and administratively to the chief executive officer, periodically reports to the brc and botc on various matters of risks and controls.
culture, values and conduct of employees employees of the firm are accountable for conducting themselves in accordance with our core values: put clients first, do the right thing, lead with exceptional ideas, commit to diversity and inclusion, and give back. we are committed to reinforcing and confirming adherence to our core values through our governance framework, tone from the top, management oversight, risk management and controls, and three lines of defense structure (business, control functions such as risk management and compliance, and internal audit).
the board is responsible for overseeing the firm's practices and procedures relating to culture, values and conduct, as set forth in the firm's corporate governance policies. our culture, values and conduct committee, along with the compliance and conduct risk committee, are the senior management committees that oversee the firmwide culture, values and conduct program and report regularly to the board. a fundamental building block of this program is the firm's code of conduct, which establishes standards for employee conduct that further reinforce the firm's commitment to integrity and ethical conduct. every new hire and every employee annually is required to certify to their understanding of and adherence to the code of conduct. the firm's global conduct risk management policy also sets out a consistent global framework for managing conduct risk (i.e., the risk arising from misconduct by employees or contingent workers) and conduct risk incidents at the firm.
the employee annual performance review process includes evaluation of employee conduct related to risk management practices and the firm's expectations. we also have several mutually reinforcing processes to identify employee conduct that may have an impact on employment status, current year compensation and/or prior year compensation. for example, the global incentive compensation discretion policy sets forth standards for managers when making annual compensation decisions and specifically provides that managers must consider whether their employees effectively managed and/or supervised risk control practices during the performance year. management committees from control functions periodically meet to discuss employees whose conduct is not in line with our expectations. these results are incorporated into identified employees' performance reviews and compensation and promotion decisions.
the firm's clawback and cancellation provisions apply to deferred incentive compensation and cover a broad scope of employee conduct, including any act or omission (including with respect to direct supervisory responsibilities) that constitutes a breach of obligation to the firm or causes a restatement of the firm's financial results, constitutes a violation of the firm's global risk management principles, policies and standards, or causes a loss of revenue associated with a position on which the employee was paid and the employee operated outside of risk management policies.
december 2021 form 10-k risk disclosures risk limits framework risk limits and quantitative metrics provide the basis for monitoring risk-taking activity and avoiding outsized risk taking. our risk-taking capacity is sized through the firm's capital planning process where losses are estimated under the firm's bhc severely adverse stress testing scenario. we also maintain a comprehensive suite of risk limits and quantitative metrics to support and implement our risk appetite statement. our risk limits support linkages between the overall risk appetite, which is reviewed by the board, and more granular risk-taking decisions and activities.
risk limits, once established, are reviewed and updated on at least an annual basis, with more frequent updates as necessary. board-level risk limits address the most important firmwide aggregations of risk. additional risk limits approved by the frc address more specific types of risk and are bound by the higher-level board risk limits.
risk management process in subsequent sections, we discuss our risk management policies and procedures for our primary risks involved in the activities of our institutional securities, wealth management and investment management business segments. these sections and the estimated amounts of our risk exposure generated by our statistical analyses are forward-looking statements. however, the analyses used to assess such risks are not predictions of future events, and actual results may vary significantly from such analyses due to events in the markets in which we operate and certain other factors described in the following paragraphs.
market risk market risk refers to the risk that a change in the level of one or more market prices, rates, spreads, indices, volatilities, correlations or other market factors, such as market liquidity, will result in losses for a position or portfolio. generally, we incur market risk as a result of trading, investing and client facilitation activities, principally within the institutional securities business segment where the substantial majority of our var for market risk exposures is generated. in addition, we incur non-trading market risk, principally within the wealth management and investment management business segments. the wealth management business segment primarily incurs non-trading market risk (including interest rate risk) from lending and deposit-taking activities. the investment management business segment primarily incurs non-trading market risk from capital investments in its funds.
market risk also includes non-trading interest rate risk. non-trading interest rate risk in the banking book (amounts classified for regulatory capital purposes under the banking book regime) refers to the exposure that a change in interest rates will result in prospective earnings changes for assets and liabilities in the banking book.
sound market risk management is an integral part of our culture. the various business units and trading desks are responsible for ensuring that market risk exposures are well-managed and prudent. the control groups help ensure that these risks are measured and closely monitored and are made transparent to senior management. the market risk department is responsible for ensuring the transparency of material market risks, monitoring compliance with established limits and escalating risk concentrations to appropriate senior management.
to execute these responsibilities, the market risk department monitors our risk against limits on aggregate risk exposures, performs a variety of risk analyses, routinely reports risk summaries, and maintains our var and scenario analysis systems. market risk is also monitored through various measures: by use of statistics (including var and related analytical measures); by measures of position size and sensitivity; and through routine stress testing, which measures the impact on the value of existing portfolios of specified changes in market factors and scenarios designed by the market risk department in collaboration with the business units. the material risks identified by these processes are summarized in reports produced by the market risk department that are circulated to and discussed with senior management, the frc, the brc and the board.
trading risks primary market risk exposures and market risk management we have exposures to a wide range of risks related to interest rates and credit spreads, equity prices, foreign exchange rates and commodity prices as well as the associated implied volatilities and spreads of the global markets in which we conduct our trading activities.
we are exposed to interest rate and credit spread risk as a result of our market-making activities and other trading in interest rate-sensitive financial instruments (i.e., risk arising from changes in the level or implied volatility of interest rates, the timing of mortgage prepayments, the shape of the yield curve and/or credit spreads). the activities from which those exposures arise and the markets in which we are active include, but are not limited to, the following: derivatives, corporate and government debt across both developed and emerging markets and asset-backed debt, including mortgage-related securities.
we are exposed to equity price and implied volatility risk as a result of making markets in equity securities and derivatives and maintaining other positions, including positions in non-public entities. positions in non-public entities may include, but are not limited to, exposures to private equity, venture capital, private partnerships, real estate funds and other funds. such positions are less liquid, have longer investment horizons and are more difficult to hedge than listed equities.
december 2021 form 10-k risk disclosures we are exposed to foreign exchange rate and implied volatility risk as a result of making markets in foreign currencies and foreign currency derivatives, from maintaining foreign exchange positions and from holding non-u.s. dollar-denominated financial instruments.
we are exposed to commodity price and implied volatility risk as a result of market-making activities in commodity products related primarily to electricity, natural gas, oil and precious metals. commodity exposures are subject to periods of high price volatility as a result of changes in supply and demand. these changes can be caused by weather conditions; physical production and transportation; or geopolitical and other events that affect the available supply and level of demand for these commodities.
we manage our trading positions by employing a variety of risk mitigation strategies. these strategies include diversification of risk exposures and hedging. hedging activities consist of the purchase or sale of positions in related securities and financial instruments, including a variety of derivative products (e.g., futures, forwards, swaps and options). hedging activities may not always provide effective mitigation against trading losses due to differences in the terms, specific characteristics or other basis risks that may exist between the hedge instrument and the risk exposure that is being hedged.
we manage the market risk associated with our trading activities on a firmwide basis, on a worldwide trading division level and on an individual product basis. we manage and monitor our market risk exposures in such a way as to maintain a portfolio that we believe is well-diversified in the aggregate with respect to market risk factors and that reflects our aggregate risk tolerance as established by our senior management.
aggregate market risk limits have been approved for the firm across all divisions worldwide. additional market risk limits are assigned to trading desks and, as appropriate, products and regions. trading division risk managers, desk risk managers, traders and the market risk department monitor market risk measures against limits in accordance with policies set by our senior management.
value-at-risk the statistical technique known as var is one of the tools we use to measure, monitor and review the market risk exposures of our trading portfolios. the market risk department calculates and distributes daily var-based risk measures to various levels of management.
we estimate var using a model based on a one-year equal weighted historical simulation for general market risk factors and name-specific risk in corporate equities and related derivatives, and monte carlo simulation for name-specific risk in bonds, loans and related derivatives. the model constructs a distribution of hypothetical daily changes in the value of trading portfolios based on historical observation of daily changes in key market indices or other market risk factors, and information on the sensitivity of the portfolio values to these market risk factor changes.
var for risk management purposes ("management var") is computed at a 95% level of confidence over a one-day time horizon, which is a useful indicator of possible trading losses resulting from adverse daily market moves. the 95%/one-day var corresponds to the unrealized loss in portfolio value that, based on historically observed market risk factor movements, would have been exceeded with a frequency of 5%, or five times in every 100 trading days, if the portfolio were held constant for one day.
our var model generally takes into account linear and non-linear exposures to equity and commodity price risk, interest rate risk, credit spread risk and foreign exchange rates. the model also takes into account linear exposures to implied volatility risks for all asset classes and non-linear exposures to implied volatility risks for equity, commodity and foreign exchange referenced products. the var model also captures certain implied correlation risks associated with portfolio credit derivatives, as well as certain basis risks (e.g., corporate debt and related credit derivatives).
we use var as one of a range of risk management tools. among their benefits, var models permit estimation of a portfolio's aggregate market risk exposure, incorporating a range of varied market risks and portfolio assets. one key element of the var model is that it reflects risk reduction due to portfolio diversification or hedging activities. however, var has various limitations, which include, but are not limited to: use of historical changes in market risk factors, which may not be accurate predictors of future market conditions and may not fully incorporate the risk of extreme market events that are outsized relative to observed historical market behavior or reflect the historical distribution of results beyond the 95% confidence interval; and reporting of losses in a single day, which does not reflect the risk of positions that cannot be liquidated or hedged in one day. a small proportion of market risk generated by trading positions is not included in var.
the modeling of the risk characteristics of some positions relies on approximations that, under certain circumstances, could produce significantly different results from those produced using more precise measures. var is most appropriate as a risk measure for trading positions in liquid financial markets and will understate the risk associated with severe events, such as periods of extreme illiquidity. we are aware of these and other limitations and, therefore, use var as only one component in our risk management oversight process. this process also incorporates stress testing and scenario analyses and extensive risk monitoring, analysis and control at the trading desk, division and firm levels.
we update our var model in response to changes in the composition of trading portfolios and to improvements in modeling techniques and systems capabilities. we are december 2021 form 10-k risk disclosures committed to continuous review and enhancement of var methodologies and assumptions in order to capture evolving risks associated with changes in market structure and dynamics. as part of our regular process improvements, additional systematic and name-specific risk factors may be added to improve the var model's ability to more accurately estimate risks to specific asset classes or industry sectors.
since the reported var statistics are estimates based on historical data, var should not be viewed as predictive of our future revenues or financial performance or of our ability to monitor and manage risk. there can be no assurance that our actual losses on a particular day will not exceed the var amounts indicated in the following tables or that such losses will not occur more than five times in 100 trading days for a 95%/one-day var. var does not predict the magnitude of losses that, should they occur, may be significantly greater than the var amount.
var statistics are not readily comparable across firms because of differences in the firms' portfolios, modeling assumptions and methodologies. these differences can result in materially different var estimates across firms for similar portfolios. the impact of such differences varies depending on the factor history assumptions, the frequency with which the factor history is updated and the confidence level. as a result, var statistics are more useful when interpreted as indicators of trends in a firm's risk profile rather than as an absolute measure of risk to be compared across firms.
our regulators have approved the same var model we use for risk management purposes for use in regulatory calculations.
the portfolio of positions used for management var differs from that used for regulatory var. management var contains certain positions that are excluded from regulatory var.

1.the high and low var values for the total management var and each of the component vars might have occurred on different days during the quarter, and, therefore, the diversification benefit is not an applicable measure.
2.diversification benefit equals the difference between the total var and the sum of the component vars. this benefit arises because the simulated one-day losses for each of the components occur on different days; similar diversification benefits also are taken into account within each component.
average total management var and management var for the primary risk categories decreased in 2021 from 2020 primarily due to reduced exposures in interest rate and credit spreads, and the significant volatility in 2020 no longer being included in the one-year var window. during 2021, management var peaked at $175 million for one day driven by increased equity exposure resulting from the aforementioned credit event for a single client.
distribution of var statistics and net revenues we evaluate the reasonableness of our var model by comparing the potential declines in portfolio values generated by the model with corresponding actual trading results for the firm, as well as individual business units. for days where losses exceed the var statistic, we examine the drivers of trading losses to evaluate the var model's accuracy. there were 14 trading loss days in 2021, one of which exceeded 95% total management var.

the previous table presents an analysis of selected instantaneous upward and downward parallel interest rate shocks (subject to a floor of zero percent in the downward scenario) on net interest income over the next 12 months for our u.s. bank subsidiaries. these shocks are applied to our 12-month forecast for our u.s. bank subsidiaries, which incorporates market expectations of interest rates and our forecasted business activity.
we do not manage to any single rate scenario but rather manage net interest income in our u.s. bank subsidiaries to optimize across a range of possible outcomes, including non-parallel rate change scenarios. the sensitivity analysis assumes that we take no action in response to these scenarios, assumes there are no changes in other macroeconomic variables normally correlated with changes in interest rates, and includes subjective assumptions regarding customer and market re-pricing behavior and other factors. the change in sensitivity to interest rates between december 31, 2021 and december 31, 2020 is primarily driven by the effects of changes in the mix of our assets and liabilities and changes in market rates.

we have exposure to public and private companies through direct investments, as well as through funds that invest in these assets. these investments are predominantly equity positions with long investment horizons, a portion of which is for business facilitation purposes. the market risk related to these investments is measured by estimating the potential reduction in net revenues associated with a reasonably possible 10% decline in investment values and related impact on performance-based income, as applicable. the change in investments sensitivity related to other firm investments between december 31, 2021 and december 31, 2020 was primarily driven by new investments in community reinvestment act affordable housing and increases in investments in the equity business.
asset management revenue sensitivity certain asset management revenues in the wealth management and investment management business segments are derived from management fees, which are based on fee-based client assets in wealth management or aum in investment management (together, "client holdings"). the assets underlying client holdings are primarily composed of equity, fixed income and alternative investments and are sensitive to changes in related markets. the overall level of these revenues depends on multiple factors that include, but are not limited to, the level and duration of a market increase or decline, price volatility, the geographic and industry mix of client assets, and client behavior such as the rate and magnitude of client investments and redemptions. therefore, overall revenues do not correlate completely with changes in the related markets.
december 2021 form 10-k risk disclosures credit risk credit risk refers to the risk of loss arising when a borrower, counterparty or issuer does not meet its financial obligations to us. we are primarily exposed to credit risk from institutions and individuals through our institutional securities and wealth management business segments.
we incur credit risk in our institutional securities business segment through a variety of activities, including, but not limited to, the following:
•extending credit to clients through loans and lending commitments;
•entering into swap or other derivative contracts under which counterparties may have obligations to make payments to us;
•providing short- or long-term funding that is secured by physical or financial collateral whose value may at times be insufficient to fully cover the repayment amount;
•posting margin and/or collateral to clearinghouses, clearing agencies, exchanges, banks, securities firms and other financial counterparties;
•placing funds on deposit at other financial institutions to support our clearing and settlement obligations; and
•investing or trading in securities and loan pools, whereby the value of these assets may fluctuate based on realized or expected defaults on the underlying obligations or loans.
we incur credit risk in our wealth management business segment, primarily through lending to individuals and entities, including, but not limited to, the following:
•margin loans collateralized by securities;
•securities-based lending and other forms of secured loans, including tailored lending to high and ultra-high net worth clients;

monitoring and control the credit risk management department ("crm") establishes firmwide practices to evaluate, monitor and control credit risk at the transaction, obligor and portfolio levels. the crm approves extensions of credit, evaluates the creditworthiness of the counterparties and borrowers on a regular basis, and helps ensure that credit exposure is actively monitored and managed. the evaluation of counterparties and borrowers includes an assessment of the probability that an obligor will default on its financial obligations and any losses that may occur when an obligor defaults. in addition, credit risk exposure is actively managed by credit professionals and committees within the crm and through various risk committees, whose membership includes individuals from the crm. a comprehensive and global credit limits framework is utilized to manage credit risk levels across the firm. the credit limits framework is calibrated within our risk tolerance and includes single-name limits and portfolio concentration limits by country, industry and product type.
the crm helps ensure timely and transparent communication of material credit risks, compliance with established limits and escalation of risk concentrations to appropriate senior management. the crm also works closely with the market risk department and applicable business units to monitor risk exposures and to perform stress tests to identify, analyze and control credit risk concentrations arising from lending and trading activities. the stress tests shock market factors (e.g., interest rates, commodity prices, credit spreads), risk parameters (e.g., probability of default and loss given default), recovery rates and expected losses in order to assess the impact of stresses on exposures, profit and loss, and our capital position. stress tests are conducted in accordance with our established policies and procedures.
credit evaluation the evaluation of corporate and institutional counterparties and borrowers includes assigning credit ratings, which reflect an assessment of an obligor's probability of default and loss given default. credit evaluations typically involve the assessment of financial statements; leverage; liquidity; capital strength; asset composition and quality; market capitalization; access to capital markets; adequacy of collateral, if applicable; and, in the case of certain loans, cash flow projections and debt service requirements. the crm also evaluates strategy, market position, industry dynamics, management and other factors such as country risks and legal and contingent risks that could affect the obligor's risk profile. additionally, the crm evaluates the relative position of our exposure in the borrower's capital structure and relative recovery prospects, as well as other structural elements of the particular transaction.
the evaluation of consumer borrowers is tailored to the specific type of lending. securities-based loans are evaluated based on factors that include, but are not limited to, the amount of the loan and the amount, quality, diversification, price volatility and liquidity of the collateral. the underwriting of residential real estate loans includes, but is not limited to, review of the obligor's debt-to-income ratio, net worth, liquidity, collateral, ltv ratio and industry standard credit scoring models (e.g., fico scores). subsequent credit monitoring for individual loans is performed at the portfolio level, and collateral values are monitored on an ongoing basis.
credit risk metrics assigned to our borrowers during the evaluation process are incorporated into the crm maintenance of the allowance for credit losses. such allowance serves as a reserve for probable inherent losses, as well as probable losses related to loans identified as impaired. for more information on the allowance for credit losses, see notes 2 and 10 to the financial statements.
december 2021 form 10-k risk disclosures risk mitigation we may seek to mitigate credit risk from our lending and trading activities in multiple ways, including collateral provisions, guarantees and hedges. at the transaction level, we seek to mitigate risk through management of key risk elements such as size, tenor, financial covenants, seniority and collateral. we actively hedge our lending and derivatives exposures. hedging activities consist of the purchase or sale of positions in related securities and financial instruments, including a variety of derivative products (e.g., futures, forwards, swaps and options). additionally, we may sell, assign or syndicate loans and lending commitments to other financial institutions in the primary and secondary loan markets.
in connection with our derivatives trading activities, we generally enter into master netting agreements and collateral arrangements with counterparties. these agreements provide us with the ability to demand collateral, as well as to liquidate collateral and offset receivables and payables covered under the same master agreement in the event of a counterparty default. a collateral management group monitors collateral levels against requirements and oversees the administration of the collateral function. see note 9 to the financial statements for additional information about our collateralized transactions.

1.investment management business segment loans are related to certain of our activities as an investment advisor and manager. loans held at fair value are the result of the consolidation of investment vehicles (including clos) managed by investment management, composed primarily of senior secured loans to corporations.
2.fvo also includes the fair value of certain unfunded lending commitments.
3.lending commitments represent the notional amount of legally binding obligations to provide funding to clients for lending transactions. since commitments associated with these business activities may expire unused or may not be utilized to full capacity, they do not necessarily reflect the actual future cash funding requirements.
we provide loans and lending commitments to a variety of customers, including large corporate and institutional clients, as well as high to ultra-high net worth individuals. in addition, we purchase loans in the secondary market. loans and lending commitments are either held for investment, held for sale or carried at fair value. for more information on these loan classifications, see note 2 to the financial statements.
in 2021, total loans and lending commitments increased by approximately $46 billion, primarily due to growth in securities-based and residential real estate loans within the wealth management business segment, as well as increases in secured lending facilities and corporate lending commitments within the institutional securities business segment.
see notes 5, 6, 10 and 15 to the financial statements for further information.

credit exposure arising from our loans and lending commitments is measured in accordance with our internal risk management standards. risk factors considered in determining the allowance for credit losses for loans and lending commitments include the borrower's financial strength, industry, facility structure, ltv ratio, debt service ratio, collateral and covenants. qualitative and environmental factors such as economic and business conditions, nature and volume of the portfolio and lending terms, and volume and severity of past due loans may also be considered.
the aggregate allowance for credit losses for loans and lending commitments decreased in 2021, primarily reflecting charge-offs. the provision for credit losses on loans and lending commitments was flat, primarily as a result of portfolio growth, offset by the impact of changes in loan quality mix.
the base scenario used in our acl models as of december 31, 2021 was generated using a combination of industry consensus economic forecasts, forward rates, and internally developed and validated models, and assumes continued growth over the forecast period. given the nature of our lending portfolio, the most sensitive model input is u.s. gross domestic product.

sectors currently in focus due to covid-19
the economic effects of covid-19 have impacted borrowers in many sectors and industries, though certain sectors remain more sensitive to the current economic environment and are continuing to receive heightened focus. the sectors currently in focus are retail, air travel, lodging and leisure, upstream energy, and healthcare services and systems. as of december 31, 2021, exposures to these sectors are included across the industrials, financials, real estate, consumer discretionary, energy and healthcare industries in the previous table, and in aggregate represent less than 10% of total institutional securities business segment lending exposure. further, as of december 31, 2021, over 90% of these exposures are either investment grade and/or secured by collateral. the future developments of covid-19 and its effect on the economic environment remain uncertain; therefore, the sectors impacted may change over time. refer to "risk factors" herein.
institutional securities lending activities the institutional securities business segment lending activities include corporate, secured lending facilities, commercial real estate, and securities-based lending and other. as of december 31, 2021, over 90% of our total lending exposure, which consists of loans and lending commitments, is investment grade and/or secured by collateral.
corporate comprises relationship and event-driven loans and lending commitments, which typically consist of revolving lines of credit, term loans and bridge loans; may have varying terms; may be senior or subordinated; may be secured or unsecured; are generally contingent upon representations, warranties and contractual conditions applicable to the borrower; and may be syndicated, traded or hedged. for additional information on event-driven loans, see "institutional securities event-driven loans and lending commitments" herein.
secured lending facilities include loans provided to clients, which are collateralized by various assets, including residential and commercial real estate mortgage loans, investor commitments for capital calls, corporate loans and other assets. these facilities generally provide for overcollateralization. credit risk with respect to these loans and lending commitments arises from the failure of a borrower to perform according to the terms of the loan agreement and/or a decline in the underlying collateral value. the firm monitors collateral levels against the requirements of lending agreements. see note 16 to the financial statements for information about our securitization activities.
commercial real estate loans are primarily senior, secured by underlying real estate and are typically in term loan form. in addition, as part of certain of its trading and securitization activities, institutional securities may also hold residential real estate loans.
securities-based lending and other includes financing extended to sales and trading customers and corporate loans purchased in the secondary market.

the principal wealth management business segment lending activities include securities-based lending and residential real estate loans.
securities-based lending allows clients to borrow money against the value of qualifying securities, generally for any purpose other than purchasing, trading or carrying securities or refinancing margin debt. we establish approved credit lines against qualifying securities and monitor limits daily and,
63                december 2021 form 10-k risk disclosures pursuant to such guidelines, require customers to deposit additional collateral, or reduce debt positions, when necessary. these credit lines are primarily uncommitted loan facilities, as we reserve the right not to make any advances or may terminate these credit lines at any time. factors considered in the review of these loans include, but are not limited to, the loan amount, the client's credit profile, the degree of leverage, collateral diversification, price volatility and liquidity of the collateral.
residential real estate loans consist of first and second lien mortgages, including helocs. our underwriting policy is designed to ensure that all borrowers pass an assessment of capacity and willingness to pay, which includes an analysis utilizing industry standard credit scoring models (e.g., fico scores), debt-to-income ratios and assets of the borrower. ltv ratios are determined based on independent third-party property appraisals and valuations, and security lien positions are established through title and ownership reports. the vast majority of mortgage loans, including helocs, are held for investment in the wealth management business segment's loan portfolio.

the institutional securities and wealth management business segments provide margin lending arrangements that allow customers to borrow against the value of qualifying securities, primarily for the purpose of purchasing additional securities, as well as to collateralize short positions. institutional securities primarily includes margin loans in the equity financing business. wealth management includes margin loans as well as non-purpose securities-based lending on non-bank entities. amounts may fluctuate from period to period as overall client balances change as a result of market levels, client positioning and leverage.
credit exposures arising from margin lending activities are generally mitigated by their short-term nature, the value of collateral held and our right to call for additional margin when collateral values decline. however, we could incur losses in the event that the customer fails to meet margin calls and collateral values decline below the loan amount. this risk is elevated in loans backed by collateral pools with significant concentrations in individual issuers or securities with similar risk characteristics. for a further discussion, see "risk factors-credit risk" herein.

1.counterparty credit ratings are determined internally by the crm.
we are exposed to credit risk as a dealer in otc derivatives. credit risk with respect to derivative instruments arises from the possibility that a counterparty may fail to perform according to the terms of the contract. for a description of our risk mitigation strategies, see "credit risk-risk mitigation" herein.
credit derivatives a credit derivative is a contract between a seller and buyer of protection against the risk of a credit event occurring on one or more debt obligations issued by a specified reference entity. the buyer typically pays a periodic premium over the life of the contract and is protected for the period. if a credit event occurs, the seller is required to make payment to the beneficiary based on the terms of the credit derivative contract. credit events, as defined in the contract, may be one or more of the following defined events: bankruptcy, dissolution or insolvency of the referenced entity, failure to pay, obligation acceleration, repudiation, payment moratorium and restructuring.
we trade in a variety of credit derivatives and may either purchase or write protection on a single name or portfolio of referenced entities. in transactions referencing a portfolio of entities or securities, protection may be limited to a tranche of exposure or a single name within the portfolio. we are an active market maker in the credit derivatives markets. as a market maker, we work to earn a bid-offer spread on client flow business and manage any residual credit or correlation risk on a portfolio basis. further, we use credit derivatives to manage our exposure to residential and commercial mortgage loans and corporate lending exposures. the effectiveness of our cds protection as a hedge of our exposures may vary depending upon a number of factors, including the contractual terms of the cds.
we actively monitor our counterparty credit risk related to credit derivatives. a majority of our counterparties are composed of banks, broker-dealers, insurance and other financial institutions. contracts with these counterparties may include provisions related to counterparty rating downgrades, which may result in the counterparty posting additional collateral to us. as with all derivative contracts, we consider counterparty credit risk in the valuation of our positions and recognize cvas as appropriate within trading revenues in the income statement.
for additional credit exposure information on our credit derivative portfolio, see note 7 to the financial statements.
65                december 2021 form 10-k risk disclosures country risk country risk exposure is the risk that events in, or that affect, a foreign country (any country other than the u.s.) might adversely affect us. we actively manage country risk exposure through a comprehensive risk management framework that combines credit and market fundamentals and allows us to effectively identify, monitor and limit country risk.
our obligor credit evaluation process may also identify indirect exposures, whereby an obligor has vulnerability or exposure to another country or jurisdiction. examples of indirect exposures include mutual funds that invest in a single country, offshore companies whose assets reside in another country to that of the offshore jurisdiction and finance company subsidiaries of corporations. indirect exposures identified through the credit evaluation process may result in a reclassification of country risk.
we conduct periodic stress testing that seeks to measure the impact on our credit and market exposures of shocks stemming from negative economic or political scenarios. when deemed appropriate by our risk managers, the stress test scenarios include possible contagion effects and second order risks. this analysis, and results of the stress tests, may result in the amendment of limits or exposure mitigation.
our sovereign exposures consist of financial contracts and obligations entered into with sovereign and local governments. our non-sovereign exposures consist of financial contracts and obligations entered into primarily with corporations and financial institutions.
index credit derivatives are included in the following country risk exposure table. each reference entity within an index is allocated to that reference entity's country of risk. index exposures are allocated to the underlying reference entities in proportion to the notional weighting of each reference entity in the index, adjusted for any fair value receivable or payable for that reference entity. where credit risk crosses multiple jurisdictions, for example, a cds purchased from an issuer in a specific country that references bonds issued by an entity in a different country, the fair value of the cds is reflected in the net counterparty exposure row based on the country of the cds issuer. further, the notional amount of the cds adjusted for the fair value of the receivable or payable is reflected in the net inventory row based on the country of the underlying reference entity.

item 1a. risk factors the following factors should be considered when reviewing our business. these factors could have a material adverse impact on our business, prospects, financial position, results of operations or cash flows and could cause results to differ materially from those expressed elsewhere in this report.
in august 2021, pseg entered into two agreements to sell pseg power's 6,750 mw fossil generating portfolio to newly formed subsidiaries of arclight energy partners fund vii, l.p., a fund controlled by arclight capital partners, llc. in february 2022, we completed the sale of this fossil generating portfolio. as a result, risks described in this item 1a and otherwise in this document that relate solely to this 6,750 mw fossil generating portfolio, except for those related to certain assets and liabilities excluded from the sale transactions, primarily for obligations under environmental regulations, including possible remediation obligations under the new jersey industrial site recovery act and the connecticut transfer act, are no longer relevant to our business.
general operational and financial risks inability to successfully develop, obtain regulatory approval for, or construct t&d, and solar and wind generation projects could adversely impact our businesses.
our business plan calls for extensive investment in capital improvements and additions, including the construction of t&d facilities, modernizing existing infrastructure pursuant to investment programs that provide for current recovery in rates, and our cef programs, which include providing incentives for customers to install high-efficiency equipment at their premises, constructing ev infrastructure, and implementing our smart meter program. currently, we have several significant projects underway or being contemplated.
the successful construction and development of these projects will depend, in part, on our ability to:
•obtain necessary governmental and regulatory approvals;
•obtain environmental permits and approvals;
•obtain community support for such projects to avoid delays in the receipt of permits and approvals from regulatory authorities;
•obtain customer support for investments made at their premises;
•complete such projects within budgets and on commercially reasonable terms and conditions;
•complete supporting information technology upgrades;
•obtain any necessary debt financing on acceptable terms and/or necessary governmental financial incentives;
•ensure that contracting parties, including suppliers, perform under their contracts in a timely and cost effective manner; and
•recover the related costs through rates.
any delays, cost escalations or otherwise unsuccessful construction and development could materially affect our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.
in addition, the successful operation of new solar or wind or upgraded generation facilities or transmission or distribution projects is subject to risks relating to supply interruptions; labor availability, work stoppages and labor disputes; weather interferences; unforeseen engineering and environmental problems, including those related to climate change; opposition from local communities, and the other risks described herein. further, negative public and political views on natural gas could result in diminishing political support for utility investments in gas infrastructure.
any of these risks could cause our return on these investments to be lower than expected or they could cause these facilities to operate below intended targets, which could adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations through lost revenue and/or increased expenses.
we are subject to physical, financial and transition risks related to climate change, including potentially increased legislative and regulatory burdens and changing customer preferences, and we may be subject to lawsuits, all of which could impact our businesses and results of operations.
climate change may increasingly drive change to existing or additional legislation and regulation that may impact our business and shape our customers' energy preference and sustainability goals. while the cip protects margin variances against changes in customer usage of gas and electricity, customer demand for our gas could decrease as a result of changing customer preferences favoring electrification and advanced technologies that offer energy efficient options. electric usage could also be impacted by greater adoption of evs, installation of distributed energy resources, such as behind the meter solar, installation of more energy efficient equipment, flexible load and/or energy storage, and other advances in technology. further, climate change may adversely impact the economy and reduced economic and consumer activity in our service areas could reduce demand for electricity and gas we deliver. fluctuations in weather can also affect demand for our services. for example, milder than normal weather can reduce demand for electricity and gas distribution services. all of these factors could impact the need to invest in our electric and gas t&d systems and, therefore, the rate of growth of our company.
severe weather or acts of nature, including hurricanes, winter storms, earthquakes, floods and other natural disasters can stress systems, disrupt operation of our facilities and cause service outages, production delays and property damage that require incurring additional expenses. these and other physical changes could result in changes in customer demand, increased costs associated with repairing and maintaining generation facilities and t&d systems, resulting in increased maintenance and capital costs (and potential increased financing needs), increased regulatory oversight, and lower customer satisfaction. where recovery of costs to restore service and repair damaged equipment and facilities is available, any determination by the regulator not to permit timely and full recovery of the costs incurred could have a material adverse effect on our businesses, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.
to the extent financial markets view climate change and ghg emissions as a financial risk, our ability to access capital markets could be negatively affected or cause us to receive less than ideal terms and conditions.
climate change-related political pressure and policy goals, including but not limited to those related to energy efficient targets, solar targets, encouragement of electrification through ev adoption, home heating, and the associated legislative and regulatory responses, may create financial risk as our operations may be subject to additional regulation at either the state or federal level in the future. increased regulation of ghg emissions could impose significant additional costs on our electric and natural gas operations, and our suppliers. developing and implementing plans for compliance with ghg emissions reduction, clean/renewable energy requirements, or for achieving voluntary climate commitments can lead to additional capital, personnel, and operation and maintenance (o&m) expenditures and could significantly affect the economic position of existing operations and proposed projects. if our regulators do not allow us to recover all or a part of the cost of capital investment or the o&m costs incurred to comply increasingly rigorous regulatory mandates, it could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition or cash flows. on the other hand, in the event that the political, policy, regulatory or legislative support for clean energy projects declines, the benefits or feasibility of certain investments we may have made in such projects, including those in the development stage, may be reduced.
we may be subject to climate change lawsuits that may seek injunctive relief, monetary compensation, and punitive damages, including but not limited to, for liabilities for personal injuries and property damage caused by climate change. an adverse outcome could require substantial capital expenditures and possibly require payment of substantial penalties or damages. defense costs associated with such litigation can also be significant and could affect results of operations, financial condition or cash flows if such costs are not recovered through regulated rates.
we may be adversely affected by asset and equipment failures, critical operating technology or business system failures, accidents, natural disasters, severe weather events, acts of war or terrorism, sabotage, cyberattack, or other incidents, including pandemics such as the ongoing coronavirus pandemic, that impact our ability to provide safe and reliable service to our customers and remain competitive and could result in substantial financial losses.
the success of our businesses is dependent on our ability to continue providing safe and reliable service to our customers while minimizing service disruptions. we are exposed to the risk of asset and equipment failures, accidents, natural disasters, severe weather events, acts of war or terrorism, sabotage, cyberattack or other incidents, which could result in damage to or destruction of our facilities or damage to persons or property and to gas supply interruptions. further, a major failure of availability or performance of a critical operating technology or business system, and inadequate preparation or execution of business continuity or disaster recovery plans for the loss of one or several critical systems, could result in extended disruption to operations or business processes, damage to systems and/or loss of data.
we are also exposed to the risk of pandemics, such as the ongoing coronavirus pandemic, which could result in service disruptions and delay or otherwise impair our ability to timely provide service to our customers or complete our investment projects.
these events could result in increased political, economic, financial and insurance market instability and volatility in power and fuel markets, which could materially adversely affect our business and results of operations, including our ability to access capital on terms and conditions acceptable to us.
in addition, climate change will exacerbate the physical risks to our facilities and operations resulting from such climate hazards as more severe weather events (extreme wind, rainfall and flooding), such as experienced from superstorm sandy and tropical storms isaias and ida, sea level rise, and extreme heat. such issues experienced at our facilities, or by others in our industry, could adversely impact our revenues; increase costs to repair and maintain our systems; subject us to potential litigation and/or damage claims, fines or penalties; and increase the level of oversight of our utility and generation operations and infrastructure through investigations or through the imposition of additional regulatory or legislative requirements. such actions could adversely affect our costs, competitiveness and future investments, which could be material to our financial position, results of operations and cash flow. for our t&d business, the cost of storm restoration efforts may not be fully recoverable through the regulatory process. in addition, the inability to restore power to our customers on a timely basis could result in negative publicity and materially damage our reputation.
any inability to recover the carrying amount of our long-lived assets could result in future impairment charges which could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations.
long-lived assets represent approximately 70% and 83% of the total assets of pseg and pse&g, respectively, as of december 31, 2021. management evaluates long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances, such as significant adverse changes in regulation, including a disallowance of certain costs, business climate or market conditions, including prolonged periods of adverse commodity and capacity prices, could potentially indicate an asset's or group of assets' carrying amount may not be recoverable. significant reductions in our expected revenues or cash flows for an extended period of time resulting from such events could result in future asset impairment charges, which could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations.
disruptions or cost increases in our supply chain, including labor shortages, could materially impact our business.
the supply chain of goods and services is currently being negatively impacted by several factors, including manufacturing labor shortages, domestic and international shipping constraints, increases in demand, and shortages of raw materials and specialty components. as a result, we are seeing price increases in some areas and delivery delays of certain goods. these factors have increased our costs and have the potential to impact our operations. we cannot currently estimate the potential impact of continued supply chain disruptions but they could materially impact our business and results of operations.
inability to maintain sufficient liquidity in the amounts and at the times needed or access sufficient capital at reasonable rates or on commercially reasonable terms could adversely impact our business.
funding for our investments in capital improvement and additions, scheduled payments of principal and interest on our existing indebtedness and the extension and refinancing of such indebtedness has been provided primarily by internally-generated cash flow and external debt financings. we have significant capital requirements and depend on our ability to generate cash in the future from our operations and continued access to capital and bank markets to efficiently fund our cash flow needs. our ability to generate cash flow is dependent upon, among other things, industry conditions and general economic, financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory and other factors. the ability to arrange financing and the costs of such financing depend on numerous factors including, among other things.
•general economic and capital market conditions, including but not limited to, prevailing interest rates;
•the availability of credit from banks and other financial institutions;
•tax, regulatory and securities law developments;
•for pse&g, our ability to obtain necessary regulatory approvals for the incurrence of additional indebtedness;
•investor confidence in us and our industry;
•our current level of indebtedness and compliance with covenants in our debt agreements;
•the success of current projects and the quality of new projects;
•our current and future capital structure;
•our financial performance and the continued reliable operation of our business; and
•maintenance of our investment grade credit ratings.
market disruptions, such as economic downturns experienced in the u.s. and abroad, the bankruptcy of an unrelated energy company or a systemically important financial institution, changes in market prices for electricity and gas, and actual or threatened acts of war or terrorist attacks, may increase our cost of borrowing or adversely affect our ability to access capital. as a result, no assurance can be given that we will be successful in obtaining financing for projects and investments, to extend or refinance maturing debt or for our other cash flow needs on acceptable terms or at all, which could materially adversely impact our financial position, results of operations and future growth.
in addition, if pseg power were to lose its investment grade credit rating from s&p or moody's, it would be required under certain agreements to provide a significant amount of additional collateral in the form of letters of credit or cash, which would have a material adverse effect on our liquidity and cash flows.
cybersecurity attacks or intrusions or other disruptions to our information technology, operational or other systems could adversely impact our businesses.
cybersecurity threats to the energy market infrastructure are increasing in sophistication, magnitude and frequency, particularly since covid-19 and the resulting shift to virtual operations began. because of the inherent vulnerability of infrastructure and technology and operational systems to disability or failure due to hacking, viruses, malicious or destructive code, phishing attacks, denial of service attacks, ransomware, acts of war or terrorism, or other cybersecurity incidents, we face increased risk of cyberattack. we rely on information technology systems and network infrastructure to operate our generation and t&d systems. we also store sensitive data, intellectual property and proprietary or personally identifiable information regarding our business, employees, shareholders, customers and vendors on our systems and conduct power marketing and hedging activities. in addition, the operation of our business is dependent upon the information technology systems of third parties, including our vendors, regulators, rtos and isos, among others. our and third-party information technology systems and products may be vulnerable to cybersecurity attacks involving fraud, malice or oversight on the part of our employees, other insiders or third parties, whether domestic or foreign sources. a cybersecurity attack may also leverage such information technology to cause disruptions at a third party. cybersecurity impacts to our operations include:
•disruption of the operation of our assets, the fuel supply chain, the power grid and gas t&d,
•theft of confidential company, employee, shareholder, vendor or customer information, and critical energy infrastructure information, which may cause us to be in breach of certain covenants and contractual or legal obligations,
•general business system and process interruption or compromise, including preventing us from servicing our customers, collecting revenues or the ability to record, process and/or report financial information correctly, and
•breaches of vendors' infrastructures where our confidential information is stored.
we and our third-party vendors have been and will continue to be subject to cybersecurity attacks, including but not limited to ransomware, denial of service, and malware attacks. while there has been no material impact on our business or operations from these attacks to date, we may be unable to prevent all such attacks in the future from having such a material impact as such attacks continue to increase in sophistication and frequency. if a significant cybersecurity event or breach occurs within our company or with one of our material vendors, we could be exposed to significant loss of revenue, material repair costs to intellectual and physical property, significant fines and penalties for non-compliance with existing laws and regulations, significant litigation costs, increased costs to finance our businesses, negative publicity, damage to our reputation and loss of confidence from our customers, regulators, investors, vendors and employees. the misappropriation, corruption or loss of personally identifiable information and other confidential data from us or one of our vendors could lead to significant breach notification expenses, mitigation expenses such as credit monitoring, and legal and regulatory fines and penalties. moreover, new or updated security laws or regulations or unforeseen threat sources could require changes in current measures taken by us and our business operations, which could result in increased costs and adversely affect our financial statements. similarly, a significant cybersecurity event or breach experienced by a competitor, regulatory authority, rto, iso, or vendor could also materially impact our business and results of operations via enhanced legal and regulatory requirements. the amount and scope of insurance we maintain against losses that result from cybersecurity incidents may not be sufficient to cover losses or adequately compensate for resulting business disruptions. for a discussion of state and federal cybersecurity regulatory requirements and information regarding our cybersecurity program, see item 1. business-regulatory issues-cybersecurity.
our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected by the ongoing coronavirus pandemic.
in response to the ongoing global coronavirus pandemic, we have implemented a comprehensive set of actions to help our customers, communities and employees, and will continue to closely monitor developments and adjust as needed to ensure reliable service while protecting the safety and health of our workforce and the communities we serve.
pse&g, pseg power and pseg li are providing essential services during this national emergency related to the coronavirus pandemic. the pandemic's potential impact will depend on a number of factors outside of our control, including the duration and severity of the outbreak as well as third-party actions, including governmental requirements, taken to contain its spread and mitigate its public health effects. we currently cannot estimate the potential impact the ongoing coronavirus pandemic may have on our business, results of operations, financial condition, liquidity and cash flows. however a prolonged outbreak and associated government and regulatory responses, including the long-term impact they may have on the economy, which could extend beyond the duration of the pandemic, could affect, among other things:
•the timing of our planned capital programs, including the ability to obtain necessary permits and approvals for our capital programs;
•pse&g's residential and c&i customer payment patterns, in part as residential customer non-safety related service disconnections for non-payment have been temporarily suspended, resulting in adverse impacts to accounts receivable and bad debt expense;
•the recovery of incremental costs incurred related to the pandemic, including higher bad debts;
•the availability of capital markets and credit from banks and other financial institutions to fund our operations and capital programs and the cost of borrowing and available terms;
•the availability and productivity of skilled workers and contractors to operate our facilities;
•the ability of our counterparties to meet their contractual obligations to us;
•the potential for assessment of impairment of our long-lived assets;
•financial market performance that adversely impacts asset values in our pension and nuclear decommissioning trust (ndt) funds, adversely impacts net income and potentially increases related funding requirements; and
•the availability of materials and supplies due to supply chain interruptions.
any failure or breach of these systems would have a material impact on our business and results of operations.
failure to attract and retain a qualified workforce could have an adverse effect on our business.
certain events such as an aging workforce without adequate workforce plans and replacements, a lack of skill set to complement evolving business needs, a culture that does not foster inclusion, a labor strike and unavailability of resources due to health impacts or protocol mandates related to the covid-19 pandemic may lead to operating challenges and increased costs. the challenges include loss of knowledge and a lengthy time period associated with skill development, increased turnover, costs for contractors to replace employees, and productivity and safety costs. specialized knowledge is required of the technical and support employees for our carbon-free infrastructure investments and generation and t&d operations. there is competition and a tightening market for skilled employees. failure to hire and adequately train and retain employees, including the transfer of significant historical knowledge and expertise to new employees, or future availability and cost of contract labor may adversely affect our results of operations, financial position and cash flows.
increases in the costs of equipment and materials, fuel, services and labor could adversely affect our operating results.
inflation has recently increased across the economy and is impacting portions of our business. higher costs from suppliers of equipment and materials, fuel, services and labor costs to attract and retain our workforce, could lead to increased costs, which could reduce our earnings. also, seeking recovery of higher costs in future rate cases could pressure customer rates, resulting in a potentially adverse outcome of such proceedings, or in other proceedings, including the proposal of certain investment programs or other proceedings that impact customer rates.
covenants in our debt instruments may adversely affect our business.
pseg's and pse&g's fixed income debt instruments contain events of default customary for financings of their type, including cross accelerations to other debt of that entity and, in the case of pseg's, pse&g's and pseg power's bank credit agreements, certain change of control events and certain limitations on the incurrence of liens. pseg power's bank credit agreements also contain limitations on the incurrence of subsidiary debt. our ability to comply with these covenants may be affected by events beyond our control. if we fail to comply with the covenants and are unable to obtain a waiver or amendment, or a default exists and is continuing under such debt, the lenders or the holders or trustee of such debt, as applicable, could give notice and declare outstanding borrowings and other obligations under such debt immediately due and payable. we may not be able to obtain waivers, amendments or alternative financing, or if obtainable, it could be on terms that are not acceptable to us. any of these events could adversely impact our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
financial market performance directly affects the asset values of our nuclear decommissioning trust (ndt) fund and defined benefit plan trust funds. market performance and other factors could decrease the value of trust assets and could result in the need for significant additional funding.
the performance of the financial markets will affect the value of the assets that are held in trust to satisfy our future obligations under our defined benefit plans and to decommission our nuclear generating plants. a decline in the market value of our ndt fund could increase pseg power's funding requirements to decommission its nuclear plants. a decline in the market value of the defined benefit plan trust funds could increase our pension plan funding requirements. the market value of our trusts could be negatively impacted by decreases in the rate of return on trust assets, decreased interest rates used to measure the required minimum funding levels and future government regulation. additional funding requirements for our defined benefit plans could be caused by changes in required or voluntary contributions, an increase in the number of employees becoming eligible to retire and changes in life expectancy assumptions. increased costs could also lead to additional funding requirements for our decommissioning trust. failure to manage adequately our investments in our ndt fund and defined benefit plan trusts could result in the need for us to make significant cash contributions in the future to maintain our funding at sufficient levels, which would negatively impact our results of operations, cash flows and financial position.
risks related to our generation business failure to complete, or delays in completing, our proposed investment in the ocean wind project could adversely impact our businesses and prospects.
in december 2020, pseg entered into a definitive agreement with ørsted north america to acquire a 25% equity interest in ørsted's ocean wind project. on march 31, 2021, the bpu approved pseg's investment in ocean wind and the acquisition was completed in april 2021.
our ability to realize the anticipated strategic and financial benefits of these projects is subject to a number of risks, challenges and uncertainties, including, among others:
•the risk that we or ørsted may determine not to proceed with the project at certain milestones in the development of the project, in accordance with the terms of the transaction documents;
•the fact that, subject to certain investment decision milestones, we will be obligated to fund our proportionate share of future capital expenditures in respect of the project, and such future capital expenditures may be greater than expected as a result of, among other things, potential timing delays, cost overruns, labor disputes or unanticipated liabilities;
•the risk that there may be changes to the tax laws, rules and interpretations applicable to a project, including the risk of any reduction, elimination or expiration of government incentives for wind energy or otherwise that may adversely affect such project's ability to realize certain anticipated tax benefits and, by extension, our ability to realize a satisfactory return on our investment in the project, including in our capacity as a tax equity investor;
•certain limitations on our ability to influence and control strategic decisions related to the project given our status as a minority investor, and the possibility that we and ørsted may have different views and priorities regarding the development, construction and operation of the project, as well as other risks and uncertainties inherent in joint venture arrangements;
•risks inherent in entering into a new line of business, offshore wind, in which we have not historically operated, and which may expose us to business and operational risks and liabilities that are different from those we have experienced historically and that may be more difficult to manage given our limited operational experience and resources in this area;
•the risk that we may fail to obtain or maintain, on acceptable terms or at all, any required licenses, permits and other regulatory or third party approvals, or may encounter other environmental or regulatory compliance issues, in connection with the project; and
•the risk of catastrophic events, including damage to project equipment, caused by earthquakes, tornadoes, hurricanes, floods, fires, severe weather, explosions and other natural disasters.
if any such risks or other anticipated or unanticipated liabilities were to materialize, the anticipated benefits of a project may not be fully realized, if at all, and the future performance of the project and our investment therein, as well as our financial condition and results of operations, may be materially and adversely impacted.
further, as the offshore wind market matures, it may attract more capital and competition and potentially lower the rate of return on any offshore wind projects we are involved in.
fluctuations in the wholesale power and natural gas markets could negatively affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
in the markets where we operate, natural gas prices have a major impact on the price that generators receive for their output. over the past several years, wholesale prices for natural gas have remained well below the peak levels experienced in 2008, in part due to increased shale gas production as extraction technology has improved. lower gas prices have resulted in lower electricity prices, which have reduced our margins as nuclear generation costs have not declined similarly. recently, the natural gas market, and therefore energy markets have become more volatile, which could impact our results of operations and cash flows.
we may be unable to obtain an adequate fuel supply in the future.
we obtain substantially all of our physical natural gas and nuclear fuel supply from third parties pursuant to arrangements that vary in term, pricing structure, firmness and delivery flexibility. our fuel supply arrangements must be coordinated with transportation agreements, balancing agreements, storage services and other contracts to ensure that the natural gas and nuclear fuel are delivered to our power plants at the times, in the quantities and otherwise in a manner that meets the needs of our generation portfolio and our customers. we must also comply with laws and regulations governing the transportation of such fuels.
we are exposed to increases in the price of natural gas and nuclear fuel, and it is possible that sufficient supplies to operate our generating facilities profitably may not continue to be available to us. significant changes in the price of natural gas and nuclear fuel could affect our future results and impact our liquidity needs. in addition, we face risks with regard to the delivery to, and the use of natural gas and nuclear fuel by, our power plants including the following:
•transportation may be unavailable if pipeline infrastructure is damaged or disabled;
•pipeline tariff changes may adversely affect our ability to, or cost to, deliver such fuels;
•creditworthiness of third-party suppliers, defaults by third-party suppliers on supply obligations and our ability to replace supplies currently under contract may delay or prevent timely delivery;
•market liquidity for physical supplies of such fuels or availability of related services (e.g. storage) may be insufficient or available only at prices that are not acceptable to us;
•variation in the quality of such fuels may adversely affect our power plant operations;
•legislative or regulatory actions or requirements, including those related to pipeline integrity inspections, may increase the cost of such fuels;
•fuel supplies diverted to residential heating may limit the availability of such fuels for our power plants; and
•the loss of critical infrastructure, acts of war or terrorist attacks (including cybersecurity breaches) or catastrophic events such as fires, earthquakes, explosions, floods, severe storms or other similar occurrences could impede the delivery of such fuels.
our nuclear units have a diversified portfolio of contracts and inventory that provide a substantial portion of our fuel raw material needs over the next several years. however, each of our nuclear units has contracted with a single fuel fabrication services provider, and transitioning to an alternative provider could take an extended period of time. certain of our other generation facilities also require fuel or other services that may only be available from one or a limited number of suppliers. the availability and price of this fuel may vary due to supplier financial or operational disruptions, transportation disruptions, force majeure and other factors, including market conditions. at times, such fuel may not be available at any price, or we may not be able to transport it to our facilities on a timely basis. in this case, we may not be able to run those facilities even if it would be profitable. if we had sold forward the power from such a facility, we could be required to supply or purchase power from alternate sources, perhaps at a loss. this could have a material adverse impact on our business, the financial results of specific plants and on our results of operations.
although our fuel contract portfolio provides a degree of hedging against these market risks, such hedging may not be effective and future increases in our fuel costs could materially and adversely affect our liquidity, financial condition and results of operations. while our generation runs on a mix of fuels, primarily natural gas and nuclear fuel, an increase in the cost of any particular fuel ultimately used could impact our results of operations.
operation of our generating stations are subject to market risks that are beyond our control.
generation output will either be used to satisfy wholesale contract requirements or other bilateral contracts or be sold into competitive power markets. participants in the competitive power markets are not guaranteed any specified rate of return on their capital investments. generation revenues and results of operations are dependent upon prevailing market prices for energy, capacity, ancillary services and fuel supply in the markets served. changes in prevailing market prices could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.
factors that may cause market price fluctuations include:
•increases and decreases in generation capacity, including the addition of new supplies of power as a result of the development of new power plants, expansion of existing power plants or additional transmission capacity;
•power transmission or fuel transportation capacity constraints or inefficiencies;
•power supply disruptions, including power plant outages and transmission disruptions;
•climate change and weather conditions, particularly unusually mild summers or warm winters in our market areas;
•seasonal fluctuations;
•economic and political conditions that could negatively impact the demand for power;
•changes in the supply of, and demand for, energy commodities;
•development of new fuels or new technologies for the production or storage of power;
•federal and state regulations and actions of the isos; and
•federal and state power, market and environmental regulation and legislation, including financial incentives for new renewable energy generation capacity that could lead to oversupply.
our generation business frequently involves the establishment of forward sale positions in the wholesale energy markets on long-term and short-term bases. to the extent that we have produced or purchased energy in excess of our contracted obligations, a reduction in market prices could reduce profitability. conversely, to the extent that we have contracted obligations in excess of energy we have produced or purchased, an increase in market prices could reduce profitability. if the strategy we utilize to hedge our exposure to these various risks or if our internal policies and procedures designed to monitor the exposure to these various risks are not effective, we could incur material losses. our market positions can also be adversely affected by the level of volatility in the energy markets that, in turn, depends on various factors, including weather in various geographical areas, short-term supply and demand imbalances, customer migration and pricing differentials at various geographic locations. these risks cannot be predicted with certainty.
increases in market prices also affect our ability to hedge generation output and fuel requirements as the obligation to post margin increases with increasing prices.
the introduction or expansion of technologies related to energy generation, distribution and consumption and changes in customer usage patterns could adversely impact us.
the power generation business has seen a substantial change in the technologies used to produce power. newer generation facilities are often more efficient than aging facilities, which may put some of these older facilities at a competitive disadvantage to the extent newer facilities are able to consume the same or less fuel to achieve a higher level of generation output. federal and state incentives for the development and production of renewable sources of power have facilitated the penetration of competing technologies, such as wind, solar, and commercial-sized power storage. additionally, the development of dsm and energy efficiency programs can impact demand requirements for some of our markets at certain times during the year. the continued development of subsidized, competing power generation technologies and significant development of dsm and energy efficiency programs could alter the market and price structure for power generation and could result in a reduction in load requirements, negatively impacting our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. technological advances driven by federal laws mandating new levels of energy efficiency in end-use electric devices or other improvements in, or applications of, technology could also lead to declines in per capita energy consumption.
advances in distributed generation technologies, such as fuel cells, micro turbines, micro grids, windmills and net-metered solar installations, may reduce the cost of alternative methods of producing electricity to a level that is competitive with that of most central station electric production. large customers, such as universities and hospitals, continue to explore potential micro grid installation. certain states, such as massachusetts and california, are also considering mandating the use of power storage resources to replace uneconomic or retiring generation facilities. such developments could (i) affect the price of energy, (ii) reduce energy deliveries as customer-owned generation becomes more cost-effective, (iii) require further improvements to our distribution systems to address changing load demands, and (iv) make portions of our transmission and/or distribution facilities obsolete prior to the end of their useful lives. these technologies could also result in further declines in commodity prices or demand for delivered energy.
some or all of these factors could result in a lack of growth or decline in customer demand for electricity or number of customers, and may cause us to fail to fully realize anticipated benefits from significant capital investments and expenditures, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows. these factors could also materially affect our results of operations, cash flows or financial positions through, among other things, reduced operating revenues, increased o&m expenses, and increased capital expenditures, as well as potential asset impairment charges or accelerated depreciation and decommissioning expenses over shortened remaining asset useful lives.
we are subject to third-party credit risk relating to our sale of generation output and purchase of fuel.
we sell generation output and buy fuel through the execution of bilateral contracts. we also seek to contract in advance for a significant proportion of our anticipated output capacity and fuel needs. these contracts are subject to credit risk, which relates to the ability of our counterparties to meet their contractual obligations to us. any failure of these counterparties to perform could require pseg power to purchase or sell energy or fuel in the wholesale markets at less favorable prices and incur additional losses, which could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations, cash flows and financial position. in the spot markets, we are exposed to the risks of the default sharing mechanisms that exist in those markets, some of which attempt to spread the risk across all participants. therefore, a default by a third party could increase our costs, which could negatively impact our results of operations and cash flows.
there may be periods when pseg power may not be able to meet its commitments under forward sale obligations at a reasonable cost or at all.
a substantial portion of pseg power's base load generation output has been sold forward under fixed price power sales contracts and pseg power also sells forward the output from its intermediate and peaking facilities when it deems it commercially advantageous to do so. our forward sales of energy and capacity assume sustained, acceptable levels of operating performance. this is especially important at our lower-cost facilities. operations at any of our plants could degrade to the point where the plant has to shut down or operate at less than full capacity. some issues that could impact the operation of our facilities are:
•breakdown or failure of equipment, information technology, processes or management effectiveness;
•disruptions in the transmission of electricity;
•labor disputes or work stoppages;
•fuel supply interruptions;
•transportation constraints;
•limitations which may be imposed by environmental or other regulatory requirements; and
•operator error, acts of war or terrorist attacks (including cybersecurity breaches) or catastrophic events such as fires, earthquakes, explosions, floods, severe storms or other similar occurrences.
identifying and correcting any of these issues may require significant time and expense. depending on the materiality of the issue, we may choose to close a plant rather than incur the expense of restarting it or returning it to full capacity.
because the obligations under most of these forward sale agreements are not contingent on a unit being available to generate power, pseg power is generally required to deliver power to the buyer even in the event of a plant outage, fuel supply disruption or a reduction in the available capacity of the unit. to the extent that pseg power does not have sufficient lower cost capacity to meet its commitments under its forward sale obligations, pseg power would be required to pay the difference between the market price at the delivery point and the contract price. the amount of such payments could be substantial and could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
in addition, as market prices for energy and fuel fluctuate, our forward energy sale and forward fuel purchase contracts could require us to post substantial additional collateral, thus requiring us to obtain additional sources of liquidity during periods when our ability to do so may be limited.
certain of our generation facilities rely on transmission facilities that we do not own or control and that may be subject to transmission constraints. transmission facility owners' inability to maintain adequate transmission capacity could restrict our ability to deliver wholesale electric power to our customers and we may either incur additional costs or forgo revenues. conversely, improvements to certain transmission systems could also reduce revenues.
we depend on transmission facilities owned and operated by others to deliver the wholesale power we sell from our generation facilities. if transmission is disrupted or if the transmission capacity infrastructure is inadequate, our ability to sell and deliver wholesale power may be adversely impacted. if a region's power transmission infrastructure is inadequate, our recovery of wholesale costs and profits may be limited. if restrictive transmission price regulation is imposed, the transmission companies may not have sufficient incentive to invest in transmission infrastructure. we also cannot predict whether transmission facilities will invest in specific markets to accommodate competitive access to those markets.
in addition, in certain of the markets in which we operate, energy transmission congestion may occur and we may be deemed responsible for congestion costs if we schedule delivery of power between congestion zones during times when congestion occurs between the zones. if we were liable for such congestion costs, our financial results could be adversely affected.
conversely, a portion of our generation is located in load pockets. investment in transmission systems to reduce or eliminate these load pockets could negatively impact the value or profitability of our existing generation facilities in these areas.
regulatory, legislative and legal risks pse&g's revenues, earnings and results of operations are dependent upon state laws and regulations that affect distribution and related activities.
pse&g is subject to regulation by the bpu. such regulation affects almost every aspect of its businesses, including its retail rates. failure to comply with these regulations could have a material adverse impact on pse&g's ability to operate its business and could result in fines, penalties or sanctions. the retail rates for electric and gas distribution services are established in a base rate proceeding and remain in effect until a new base rate proceeding is filed and concluded. in addition, our utility has received approval for several clause recovery mechanisms, some of which provide for recovery of costs and earn returns on authorized investments. these clause mechanisms require periodic updates to be reviewed and approved by the bpu and are subject to prudency reviews. inability to obtain fair or timely recovery of all our costs, including a return of, or on, our investments in rates, could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and cash flows. in addition, if legislative and regulatory structures were to evolve in such a way that pse&g's exclusive rights to serve its regulated customers were eroded, its future earnings could be negatively impacted.
in september 2020, the bpu ordered the commencement of a comprehensive affiliate and management audit of pse&g. the bpu also conducts periodic combined management/competitive service audits of new jersey utilities related to affiliate standard requirements, competitive services, cross-subsidization, cost allocation and other issues. a finding by the bpu of non-compliance with these requirements could potentially impact our business, results of operations and cash flows. for information regarding pse&g's current affiliate and management audit, see item 8. note 15. commitments and contingent liabilities. in addition, pse&g procures the supply requirements of its default service bgss gas customers through a full-requirements contract with pseg power. government officials, legislators and advocacy groups are aware of the affiliation between pse&g and pseg power. in periods of rising utility rates, those officials and advocacy groups may question or challenge costs and transactions incurred by pse&g with pseg power, irrespective of any previous regulatory processes or approvals underlying those transactions. the occurrence of such challenges may subject pseg power to a level of scrutiny not faced by other unaffiliated competitors in those markets and could adversely affect retail rates received by pse&g in an effort to offset any perceived benefit to pseg power from the affiliation.
pse&g's proposed investment programs may not be fully approved by regulators, which could result in lower than desired service levels to customers, and actual capital investment by pse&g may be lower than planned, which would cause lower than anticipated rate base.
pse&g is a regulated public utility that operates and invests in an electric t&d system and a gas distribution system as well as certain regulated clean energy investments, including solar and energy efficiency within new jersey. pse&g invests in capital projects to maintain and improve its existing t&d system and to address various public policy goals and meet customer expectations. transmission projects are subject to review in the ferc-approved pjm transmission expansion process while distribution and clean energy projects are subject to approval by the bpu. we cannot be certain that any proposed project will be approved as requested or at all. if the programs that pse&g may file from time to time are only approved in part, or not at all, or if the approval fails to allow for the timely recovery of all of pse&g's costs, including a return of, or on, its investment, pse&g will have a lower than anticipated rate base, thus causing its future earnings to be lower than anticipated. if these programs are not approved, that could also adversely affect our service levels for customers. further, the bpu could take positions to exclude or limit utility participation in certain areas, such as renewable generation, energy efficiency, ev infrastructure and energy storage, which would limit our relationship with customers and narrow our future growth prospects.
we are subject to comprehensive federal regulation that affects, or may affect, our businesses.
we are subject to regulation by federal authorities. such regulation affects almost every aspect of our businesses, including management and operations; the terms and rates of transmission services; investment strategies; the financing of our operations and the payment of dividends. failure to comply with these regulations could have a material adverse impact on our ability to operate our business and could result in fines, penalties or sanctions.
recovery of wholesale transmission rates-pse&g's wholesale transmission rates are regulated by ferc and are recovered through a ferc-approved formula rate. the revenue requirements are reset each year through this formula. over the past several years, several companies have negotiated settlements that have resulted in reduced roes.
in october 2021, ferc approved a settlement agreement effective august 1, 2021 that we reached with the bpu and the new jersey rate counsel about the level of pse&g's base transmission roe and other formula rate matters. the settlement reduces pse&g's base roe from 11.18% to 9.9% and makes changes to recovery of certain costs. the agreement provides that the settling parties will not seek changes to our transmission formula rate for three years. we have implemented the terms of the agreement and pjm issued refunds to wholesale customers in january 2022.
in april 2021, ferc issued a supplemental notice of proposed rulemaking to eliminate the incentive for rto membership for transmitting utilities that have already received the incentive for three or more years. pse&g began receiving a 50 basis point adder for rto membership in 2008. elimination of the adder for rto membership could reduce pse&g's annual net income and annual cash inflows by approximately $30 million-$40 million.
transmission policy-ferc order 1000 has generally opened transmission development to competition from independent developers, allowing such developers to compete with incumbent utilities for the construction and operation of transmission facilities in its service territory. while order 1000 retains limited carve-outs for certain projects that will continue to default to incumbents for construction responsibility, including immediately needed reliability projects, upgrades to existing transmission facilities, projects cost-allocated to a single transmission zone, and projects being built on existing rights-of-way, increased competition for transmission projects could decrease the value of new investments that would be subject to recovery by pse&g under its rate base, which could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations.
nerc compliance-nerc, at the direction of ferc, has implemented mandatory nerc operations and planning and critical infrastructure protection standards to ensure the reliability of the north american bulk electric system, which includes electric transmission and generation systems, and to prevent major system blackouts. nerc critical infrastructure protection standards establish cybersecurity and physical security protections for critical systems and facilities. we have been, and will continue to be, periodically audited by nerc for compliance and are subject to penalties for non-compliance with applicable nerc standards. failure to comply with applicable nerc standards could result in penalties or increased costs to bring such facilities into compliance. such penalties and costs could materially adversely impact our business, results of operations and cash flows.
mbr authority and other regulatory approvals-under ferc regulations, public utilities that sell power at market rates must receive mbr authority before making power sales, and the majority of our businesses operate with such authority. failure to maintain mbr authorization, or the effects of any severe mitigation measures that would be required if market power was evaluated differently in the future, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
oversight by the cftc relating to derivative transactions-the cftc has regulatory oversight of the swap and futures markets and options, including energy trading, and licensed futures professionals such as brokers, clearing members and large traders. changes to regulations or adoption of additional regulations by the cftc, including any regulations relating to futures and other derivatives or margin for derivatives and increased investigations by the cftc, could negatively impact pseg power's ability to hedge its portfolio in an efficient, cost-effective manner by, among other things, potentially decreasing liquidity in the forward commodity and derivatives markets or limiting pseg power's ability to utilize non-cash collateral for derivatives transactions.
we may also be required to obtain various other regulatory approvals to, among other things, buy or sell assets, engage in transactions between our public utility and our other subsidiaries, and, in some cases, enter into financing arrangements, issue securities and allow our subsidiaries to pay dividends. failure to obtain these approvals on a timely basis could materially adversely affect our results of operations and cash flows.
our new jersey nuclear plants may not be awarded zecs in future periods, or the current or subsequent zec program periods could be materially adversely modified through legal proceedings, either of which could result in the retirement of all of these nuclear plants.
as further described in item 7. md&a-executive overview of 2021 and future outlook, in april 2019, pseg power's salem 1, salem 2 and hope creek nuclear plants were awarded zecs by the bpu through may 2022. in april 2021, these nuclear plants were awarded zecs for the three-year period starting june 2022. the zec payment may be adjusted by the bpu under certain conditions. for instance, the new jersey rate counsel, in written comments filed with the bpu, has advocated for the bpu to offset market benefits resulting from new jersey's rejoining the rggi from the zec payment. pseg intends to vigorously defend against these arguments. due to its preliminary nature, pseg cannot predict the outcome of this matter.
in may 2021, the new jersey rate counsel filed an appeal with the new jersey appellate division of the bpu's april 2021 decision. pseg cannot predict the outcome of these matters.
in the event that (i) the zec program is overturned or is otherwise materially adversely modified through legal process; or (ii) any of the salem 1, salem 2 and hope creek plants is not sufficiently valued for its environmental, fuel diversity or resilience attributes in future periods and does not otherwise experience a material financial change that would remove the need for such attributes to be sufficiently valued, pseg power will take all necessary steps to cease to operate all of these plants. alternatively, even with sufficient valuation of these attributes, if the financial condition of the plants is materially adversely impacted by changes in commodity prices, ferc's changes to the capacity market construct (absent sufficient capacity revenues provided under a program approved by the bpu in accordance with a ferc-authorized capacity mechanism), or, in the case of the salem nuclear plants, decisions by the epa and state environmental regulators regarding the implementation of section 316(b) of the clean water act (cwa) and related state regulations, or other factors, pseg power will take all necessary steps to cease to operate all of these plants. ceasing operations of these plants would result in a material adverse impact on pseg's results of operations.
we may be adversely affected by changes in energy regulatory policies, including energy and capacity market design rules and developments affecting transmission.
the energy industry continues to be regulated and the rules to which our businesses are subject are always at risk of being changed. our business has been impacted by established rules that create locational capacity markets in each of pjm, iso-ne and nyiso. under these rules, generators located in constrained areas are paid more for their capacity so there is an incentive to locate in those areas where generation capacity is most needed. pjm's capacity market design rules and iso-ne's fcm rules continue to evolve, most recently in response to efforts to integrate public policy initiatives into the wholesale markets. for a discussion of recent changes in energy regulatory policies that may affect our business and results of operations, see item 7. md&a-executive overview of 2021 and future outlook.
further, some of the market-based mechanisms in which we participate are at times the subject of review or discussion by some of the participants in the new jersey and federal arenas. we can provide no assurance that these mechanisms will continue to exist in their current form, nor otherwise be modified.
to the extent that additions to the transmission system relieve or reduce congestion in eastern pjm where most of our plants are located, pseg power's capacity and energy revenues could be adversely affected. moreover, through changes encouraged by ferc to transmission planning processes, or through rto/iso initiatives to change their planning processes, more transmission may ultimately be built to facilitate renewable generation or support other public policy initiatives. any such addition to the transmission system could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations.
our ownership and operation of nuclear power plants involve regulatory risks as well as financial, environmental and health and safety risks.
over half of our total generation output each year is provided by our nuclear fleet. for this reason, we are exposed to risks related to the continued successful operation of our nuclear facilities and issues that may adversely affect the nuclear generation industry. in addition to the risk of retirement discussed below, risks associated with the operation of nuclear facilities include:
storage and disposal of spent nuclear fuel-federal law requires the doe to provide for the permanent storage of spent nuclear fuel. the doe has not yet begun accepting spent nuclear fuel. until a federal site is available, we use on-site storage for spent nuclear fuel, which is reimbursed by the doe. however, future capital expenditures may be required to increase spent fuel storage capacity at our nuclear facilities. once a federal site is available, the doe may impose fees to support a permanent repository. further, the on-site storage for spent nuclear fuel may significantly increase our nuclear unit decommissioning costs.
regulatory and legal risk-we may be required to substantially increase capital expenditures or operating or decommissioning costs at our nuclear facilities if there is a change in the atomic energy act or the applicable regulations, trade controls or the environmental rules and regulations applicable to nuclear facilities; a modification, suspension or revocation of licenses issued by the nrc; the imposition of civil penalties for failure to comply with the atomic energy act, related regulations, trade controls or the terms and conditions of the licenses for nuclear generating facilities; or the shutdown of one of our nuclear facilities. any such event could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations.
operational risk-operations and equipment reliability at any of our nuclear facilities could degrade to the point where an affected unit needs to be shut down or operated at less than full capacity. if this happened, identifying and correcting the causes may require significant time and expense. any significant outages could result in reduced earnings as we would have less electric output to sell.
in addition, if a unit cannot be operated through the end of its current estimated useful life, our results of operations could be adversely affected by increased depreciation rates, impairment charges and accelerated future decommissioning costs.
nuclear incident or accident risk-accidents and other unforeseen problems have occurred at nuclear stations, both in the u.s. and elsewhere. the consequences of an accident can be severe and may include loss of life, significant property damage and/or a change in the regulatory climate. we have nuclear units at two sites. it is possible that an accident or other incident at a nuclear generating unit could adversely affect our ability to continue to operate unaffected units located at the same site, which would further affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. an accident or incident at a nuclear unit not owned by us could lead to increased regulation, which could affect our ability to continue to economically operate our units. any resulting financial impact from a nuclear accident may exceed our resources, including insurance coverages. further, as a licensed nuclear operator subject to the price-anderson act and a member of a nuclear industry mutual insurance company, pseg power is subject to potential retroactive assessments as a result of an industry nuclear incident or retrospective premiums due to adverse industry loss experience and such assessments may be material.
in the event of non-compliance with applicable legislation, regulation and licenses, the nrc may increase oversight, impose fines, and/or shut down a unit, depending on its assessment of the severity of the non-compliance. if a serious nuclear incident were to occur, our business, reputation, financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected. in each case, the amount and types of insurance available to cover losses that might arise in connection with the operation of our nuclear fleet are limited and may be insufficient to cover any costs we may incur.
decommissioning-nrc regulations require that licensees of nuclear generating facilities demonstrate reasonable assurance that funds will be available to decommission a nuclear facility at the end of its useful life. pseg nuclear has established an ndt fund to satisfy these obligations. however, forecasting trust fund investment earnings and costs to decommission nuclear generating stations requires significant judgment, and actual results could differ significantly from current estimates. if we determine that it is necessary to retire one of our nuclear generating stations before the end of its useful life, there is a risk that it will no longer meet the nrc minimum funding requirements due to the earlier commencement of decommissioning activities and a shorter time period over which the ndt investments could appreciate in value. a shortfall could require pseg to post parental guarantees or make additional cash contributions to ensure that the ndt fund continues to satisfy the nrc minimum funding requirements. as a result, our financial position or cash flows could be significantly adversely affected.
we are subject to numerous federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations that may significantly limit or affect our businesses, adversely impact our business plans or expose us to significant environmental fines and liabilities.
we are subject to extensive federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations regarding air quality, water quality, site remediation, land use, waste disposal, climate change impact, natural resource damages and other matters. these laws and regulations affect how we conduct our operations and make capital expenditures. with the change in administration following the 2020 presidential election, there have been various recent changes to existing environmental laws and regulations and this trend may continue. changes in these laws, or violations of laws, could result in significant increases in our compliance costs, capital expenditures to bring facilities into compliance, operating costs for remediation and clean-up actions, civil penalties or damages from actions brought by third parties for alleged health or property damages. any such increase in our costs could have a material impact on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows and could require further economic review to determine whether to continue operations or decommission an affected facility. we may also be unable to successfully recover certain of these cost increases through our existing regulatory rate structures, in the case of pse&g, or our contracts with our customers, in the case of pseg power.
actions by state and federal government agencies could also result in reduced reliance on natural gas and could potentially result in stranding natural gas assets owned and operated by pseg power and pse&g, which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
pse&g recovers certain remediation and legal costs associated with its manufactured gas plant sites through remediation adjustment charge (rac) filings with the bpu. continued future recoveries through the rac are not guaranteed, any failure to make future recoveries could materially impact our financial condition. in addition, pseg power will retain ownership of certain assets and liabilities excluded from the sale of its fossil generation business, primarily related to obligations under environmental regulations, including possible remediation obligations under the new jersey industrial site recovery act and the connecticut transfer act. fulfilling the requirements under these regulations will span multiple years and may require sampling of environmental media to understand the extent of any required remediation. the amounts for any such environmental remediation are not estimable, but may be material.
environmental laws and regulations have generally become more stringent over time, and this trend is likely to continue. for further discussion of environmental laws and regulations impacting our business, results of operations and financial condition, including the impact of federal and state laws and regulations relating to ghg emissions and remediation of environmental contamination, see item 1. environmental matters and item 8. note 15. commitments and contingent liabilities.
we may not receive necessary licenses and permits in a timely manner or at all, which could adversely impact our business and results of operations.
we must periodically apply for licenses and permits from various regulatory authorities, including environmental regulatory authorities, and abide by their respective orders. delay in obtaining, or failure to obtain and maintain, any permits or approvals, including environmental permits or approvals, or delay in or failure to satisfy any applicable regulatory requirements, could:
•prevent construction of new facilities,
•limit or prevent continued operation of existing facilities,
•limit or prevent the sale of energy from these facilities, or
•result in significant additional costs, each of which could materially affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. in addition, the process of obtaining licenses and permits from regulatory authorities may be delayed or defeated by concerted community opposition and such delay or defeat could have a material effect on our business.
changes in tax laws and regulations may adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
a prolonged coronavirus pandemic, further economic stimulus, or future federal and state tax legislation could have a material impact on our effective tax rate and cash tax position.
item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations (md&a)
this combined md&a is separately filed by public service enterprise group incorporated (pseg) and public service electric and gas company (pse&g). information contained herein relating to any individual company is filed by such company on its own behalf.
pseg's business consists of two reportable segments, pse&g and pseg power llc (pseg power), our principal direct wholly owned subsidiaries, which are:
•pse&g-which is a public utility engaged principally in the transmission of electricity and distribution of electricity and natural gas in certain areas of new jersey. pse&g is subject to regulation by the new jersey board of public utilities (bpu) and the federal energy regulatory commission (ferc). pse&g also invests in regulated solar generation projects and energy efficiency and related programs in new jersey, which are regulated by the bpu, and
•pseg power-which is a multi-regional energy supply company that integrates the operations of its merchant nuclear and fossil generating assets with its fuel supply functions through competitive energy sales in well-developed energy markets primarily in the northeast and mid-atlantic united states through its principal direct wholly owned subsidiaries. pseg power's subsidiaries are subject to regulation by ferc, the nuclear regulatory commission (nrc), the environmental protection agency (epa) and the states in which they operate. pseg power is no longer a securities and exchange commission (sec) registrant; however, it continues to be consolidated and reported in pseg's financial statements as a wholly owned subsidiary and operating segment.
in august 2021, pseg entered into two agreements to sell pseg power's 6,750 megawatts (mw) fossil generating portfolio to newly formed subsidiaries of arclight energy partners fund vii, l.p., a fund controlled by arclight capital partners, llc. in february 2022, we completed the sale of this fossil generating portfolio. as a result, disclosures in this item 7 and elsewhere in this document that relate solely to this 6,750 mw fossil generating portfolio, except for those related to certain assets and liabilities excluded from the sale transactions, primarily for obligations under environmental regulations, including possible remediation obligations under the new jersey industrial site recovery act and the connecticut transfer act, are no longer relevant to our business.
pseg's other direct wholly owned subsidiaries are: pseg energy holdings l.l.c. (energy holdings), which holds our investments in offshore wind ventures and legacy portfolio of lease investments; pseg long island llc (pseg li), which operates the long island power authority's (lipa) transmission and distribution (t&d) system under an operations services agreement (osa); and pseg services corporation (services), which provides certain management, administrative and general services to pseg and its subsidiaries at cost.
our business discussion in item 1. business provides a review of the regions and markets where we operate and compete, as well as our strategy for conducting our businesses within these markets, focusing on operational excellence, financial strength and making disciplined investments. our risk factor discussion in item 1a. risk factors provides information about factors that could have a material adverse impact on our businesses. the following discussion provides an overview of the significant events and business developments that have occurred during 2021 and key factors that we expect may drive our future performance. this discussion refers to the consolidated financial statements (statements) and the related notes to the consolidated financial statements (notes). this discussion should be read in conjunction with such statements and notes.
for a discussion of 2020 items and year-over-year comparisons of changes in our financial condition and results of operations as of and for the years ended december 31, 2020 and december 31, 2019, see item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in our annual report on form 10-k for the year ended december 31, 2020 (2020 annual report) as filed with the sec on february 26, 2021.
executive overview of 2021 and future outlook we are progressing on our strategy to become a predominantly regulated electric and gas utility and a contracted carbon-free energy infrastructure company. we are focused on meeting customer expectations and being well aligned with public policy objectives by investing to modernize our energy infrastructure, improve reliability, increase energy efficiency and deliver cleaner energy. our business plan focuses on achieving growth while controlling costs and managing the risks associated with regulatory and policy changes and fluctuating commodity prices. in furtherance of these goals, over the past few years, our investments have altered our business mix to reflect a higher percentage of earnings contribution by pse&g, which improves the sustainability and predictability of our earnings and cash flows. in june 2021, we completed the sale of pseg power's solar portfolio and in august 2021 we entered into two agreements to sell pseg power's 6,750 mw of fossil generation located in new jersey, connecticut, new york and maryland. in february 2022, we completed the sale of this fossil generation portfolio, which represented an important milestone in our strategy and has further altered our business mix, resulting in an even higher percentage of earnings contribution by pse&g going forward and provides more financial flexibility. see item 8. note 4. early plant retirements/asset dispositions and impairments for additional information.
pse&g, pseg power and pseg li are providing essential services during the coronavirus (covid-19) pandemic. we have implemented a comprehensive set of enhanced safety actions to help protect our employees, customers and communities, and we will continue to closely monitor developments and adjust as needed to ensure that we provide reliable service while protecting the safety and health of our workforce and the communities we serve. we continue to be guided by the recommendations of health authorities at the federal, state and local levels.
the covid-19 pandemic and associated government actions and economic effects continue to impact our businesses. we have incurred additional expenses to protect our employees and customers, and pse&g is experiencing significantly higher customer bad debts and lower cash collections, as discussed below. the potential future impact of the pandemic and the associated economic impacts, which could extend beyond the duration of the pandemic, will depend on a number of factors outside of our control. these include the duration and severity of the outbreaks as well as third-party actions taken to contain their spread and mitigate their public health effects, and governmental or regulatory actions regarding customer collections, potential limitations on rate increases, recovery of incremental costs, and other matters. while we currently cannot estimate the potential impact to our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows, this md&a includes a discussion of potential effects of a prolonged outbreak.
pse&g at pse&g, our focus is on enhancing reliability and resiliency of our t&d system, meeting customer expectations and supporting public policy objectives by investing capital in t&d infrastructure and clean energy programs. for the years 2021-2025, pse&g's capital investment program is estimated to be in a range of $14 billion to $16 billion, resulting in an expected compound annual growth in rate base of 6.5% to 8%. the low end of the range assumes an extension of our gas system modernization program (gsmp) and clean energy future (cef)-energy efficiency (ee) program at their average annual investment levels, as these programs are expected to continue at least at those current rates beyond their currently approved timeframe of 2023. the upper end of the range is driven by certain unapproved investment programs, including an infrastructure advancement program (iap) which we filed in november 2021. the iap is a proposed $848 million investment program made over four years to improve the reliability of the "last mile" of our electric distribution system, address aging substations and gas metering and regulating stations and invest in electric vehicle charging infrastructure at our facilities to support the electrification of our fleet over the coming years. the upper end of the range also includes an extension of our energy strong program, which otherwise concludes in 2023, as well as the remaining portion of our cef proposal (portion of electric vehicle (ev) and energy storage (es) programs) and a potentially higher amount of investment for gsmp and cef-ee beyond current levels. during 2022, we expect to file for extensions of our gsmp and cef-ee program, which we expect will conclude in the first half of 2023.
in september 2020, pse&g reached a settlement with parties in the cef-ee proceeding, which the bpu approved. the settlement commits $1 billion over a three-year period, with the majority of the investment occurring over a five-year period. costs will be recovered through annual rate-making, with returns aligned with our most recent base rate case and a ten-year amortization period.
the approval also included a conservation incentive program (cip), a mechanism that provides for recovery of lost electric and gas variable margin revenues relative to a baseline of the test year (july 2017 to june 2018) set in in our last base rate case. the deferral period for this mechanism became effective in june 2021 for electric and october 2021 for gas. pse&g suspended its gas weather normalization charge (wnc) when the gas cip began.
in january 2021, the bpu approved a settlement with pse&g and other parties in the cef-energy cloud (ec) proceeding. the capital cost of the program, which is driven by the implementation of advanced metering infrastructure (ami), is estimated to be $707 million, invested over the next four years.
also in january 2021, the bpu approved a settlement with pse&g and other parties in the cef-ev proceeding for a majority of the components of the program. the approved investment under the program is for approximately $166 million, primarily relating to preparatory work to deliver infrastructure to the charging point for three programs: residential smart charging; level-2 mixed use charging; and direct current fast charging. a remaining component of our program related to medium and heavy duty charging infrastructure was the subject of a stakeholder process at the bpu in 2021. we currently anticipate that this effort will conclude with pse&g submitting a filing in mid-year 2022 targeting infrastructure investments for the medium and heavy duty ev market.
all of the capital costs and expenses of the cef-ec and cef-ev programs are expected to be recovered in pse&g's next base rate case, expected to be filed with the bpu by the end of 2023. from the start of the program until the commencement of new base rates, the return on and of the capital portion of each of these programs, as well as expenses incurred to implement the cef-ev program and operating costs and stranded costs associated with the retirement of existing meters under the cef-ec program, will be included for recovery as part of our next rate case expected to be concluded in the second half of 2024. our cef-es program is being held in abeyance pending future policy guidance from the bpu.
we also continue to invest in transmission infrastructure in order to (i) maintain and enhance system integrity and grid reliability, (ii) ensure system resilience in the face of continued extreme weather conditions and cyber and physical security threats, (iii) address an aging transmission infrastructure, (iv) leverage technology to improve the operation of the system, (v) reduce transmission constraints, (vi) meet changing customer usage patterns and the demand for 24/7 electricity, and (vii) satisfy state public policy goals, including aggressive decarbonization agendas. as part of a solicitation by the bpu, we also proposed two transmission projects to support the development of offshore wind which are being evaluated by the bpu and pjm interconnection, l.l.c. (pjm), with project awards expected in late 2022. as discussed further below, in october 2021, ferc approved pse&g's settlement with the bpu and the new jersey division of rate counsel (new jersey rate counsel) regarding several amendments to our transmission formula rate, including the reduction of its base transmission return on equity (roe) from 11.18% to 9.9%. under current ferc rules, we continue to earn a 50 basis point adder to that base roe for our membership in pjm.
the ongoing coronavirus pandemic and associated impacts could have several negative consequences, including potential delays of our regulatory agencies' review and approval of proposed programs or rate recovery.
the coronavirus has also impacted pse&g's sales, with a reduction in demand from its commercial and industrial (c&i) customers, largely offset by increases in residential sales volumes. as a result, there has been no substantive net margin impact and changes are now largely addressed through the cip mechanism that became effective in 2021. the most substantive impact of the pandemic on our financial position has been adverse changes to residential and c&i payment patterns. the state of new jersey issued an executive order in march 2020 that included a moratorium on non-safety related service disconnections for non-payment. on june 30, 2021, the moratorium imposed by the state of new jersey ended but the state had established a "grace period" prohibiting disconnections for residential customers through december 31, 2021. on january 22, 2022, the state extended the grace period to march 15, 2022. consequently, collections and shut-offs will not be in full effect until mid-march 2022. during the moratorium, pse&g has experienced a significant decrease in cash inflow and higher accounts receivable aging and an associated increase in bad debt expense, which we expect will continue through the grace period and winter moratorium and take the next several years to fully return to normal levels. since the start of the pandemic, pse&g's allowance for credit losses has increased by approximately $265 million. pse&g's electric distribution bad debt expense is recoverable through its societal benefits clause (sbc) mechanism. pse&g has deferred its incremental gas distribution bad debt expense as a result of covid-19 as a regulatory asset and will seek recovery of that cost, as well as other net incremental covid-19 costs, in its next base rate case. collection efforts with c&i customers recommenced in the fourth quarter of 2021 and residential customer collection efforts will recommence in march 2022, with a focus on enrolling customers in payment support programs. any further moratoriums on shut-offs or collection processes could have a material effect on our cash flows, and, to the extent not fully recovered through a rate-making process, on our financial results and condition.
in july 2020, the bpu authorized regulated utilities in new jersey, including pse&g, to create a covid-19-related regulatory asset by deferring on their books and records prudently incurred incremental costs related to covid-19 beginning on march 9, 2020 through september 30, 2021 for recovery in a future rate case. in september 2021, the bpu extended the authorization to defer such costs through december 31, 2022. deferred costs are to be offset by any federal or state assistance that the utility may receive as a direct result of the covid-19 pandemic. as of december 31, 2021, pse&g has recorded a regulatory asset related to covid-19 to defer incremental costs of $116 million, which pseg believes are recoverable under the bpu order.
pseg power in july 2020, we announced that we were exploring strategic alternatives for pseg power's non-nuclear generating fleet with the intention of accelerating the transformation of our business into a predominantly regulated electric and gas utility, with a significantly contracted generation business. see item 8. note 4. early plant retirements/asset dispositions and impairments for additional information.
in may 2021, pseg power ventures llc (power ventures), a direct wholly owned subsidiary of pseg power, entered into a purchase agreement with quattro solar, llc, an affiliate of ls power, relating to the sale by power ventures of 100% of its ownership interest in pseg solar source llc (solar source) including its related assets and liabilities. the transaction closed in june 2021.
in august 2021, pseg entered into two agreements to sell pseg power's 6,750 mw fossil generating portfolio to newly formed subsidiaries of arclight energy partners fund vii, l.p., a fund controlled by arclight capital partners, llc. in february 2022, pseg completed the sale of this fossil generating portfolio. these transformative transactions are expected to reduce overall business risk and earnings volatility, improve pseg's financial flexibility and are consistent with pseg's climate strategy and sustainability efforts, which are to focus on clean energy investments, methane reduction, and the transition to carbon-free generation. see item 8. note 4. early plant retirements/asset dispositions and impairments for additional information.
we have sought to achieve operational excellence and manage costs in order to optimize cash flow generation from our fleet in light of low wholesale power and gas prices, environmental considerations and competitive market forces that reward efficiency and reliability. during 2021, our natural gas and nuclear units generated 22.5 and 31.2 terawatt hours and operated at a capacity factor of 49.1% and 91.9%, respectively. pseg power's hedging practices help to manage some of the volatility of the merchant power business. more than 90% of pseg power's expected gross margin in 2022 from the expected remaining generation assets after the sale of the fossil generation portfolio relates to hedging of our energy margin, our expected revenues from the capacity market mechanisms, zero emission certificate (zec) revenues and, certain gas operations and ancillary service payments such as reactive power. while this limits our exposure to decreasing prices, our ability to realize benefits from rising market prices is also limited. as a result of significantly rising energy prices, as experienced during the second half of 2021, pseg power experienced a substantial increase in net cash collateral postings related to hedge positions that are out-of-the-money. as of december 31, 2021, net cash collateral postings were $844 million.
as discussed further below under "wholesale power market design," in july 2021, pjm submitted to ferc a proposal to replace the current minimum offer price rule (mopr), which applies to both new and existing resources that receive out-of-market payments, with new provisions that accommodate state public policy programs that do not attempt to set the price of capacity. under the pjm proposal, pseg power's new jersey nuclear plants that receive zec payments would not be subject to the mopr. pjm's proposal requested that ferc approve the new provisions for the next reliability pricing model (rpm) auction. in september 2021, ferc issued a notice that it was not able to act on pjm's proposed changes to the mopr because of a split among the commissioners on the lawfulness of the proposal. therefore, pjm's rules became automatically effective as of september 29, 2021 and will apply to the next base residual auction. in february, ferc approved pjm's filing requesting that the auction be held in june 2022.
pseg li following the effects of tropical storm isaias, the new york attorney general (ag) initiated an inquiry into pseg li's preparation and response to the storm. in addition, the department of public service (dps) within the new york state public service commission launched an investigation of the state's electric service providers', including pseg li's, preparation and response to the storm. the dps issued an interim storm investigation report finding that pseg li violated its emergency response plan and dps regulations, and recommended that lipa consider taking various actions, including terminating or renegotiating the osa. lipa also issued a report with recommendations for improvements to pseg li's structure and processes and recommended that lipa either renegotiate or terminate the osa.
in december 2020, lipa filed a complaint against pseg li in new york state court alleging multiple breaches of the osa in connection with pseg li's preparation for and response to tropical storm isaias seeking specific performance and $70 million in damages. in june 2021, lipa and pseg li executed a non-binding term sheet, which includes several changes to the osa, including shifting a portion of our fixed revenues to incentive compensation and subjecting a portion of revenue to the potential imposition of penalties by the dps due to certain performance failures by pseg li, and resolves all of lipa's claims related to tropical storm isaias and the dps investigation. an amended osa based on the term sheet was agreed to by the parties and approved by the lipa board in december 2021. in january 2022, the new york ag approved the amended osa and it has been submitted to the new york comptroller for approval, which approval must occur by april 1, 2022 (such date is subject to amendment by mutual agreement of pseg li and lipa) in order for the amended osa to become binding and effective. such approval would result in retroactive effectiveness to january 1, 2022 for purposes of compensation. the osa contract term will continue through 2025, with a mutual option to extend for five years. no assurances can be given regarding obtaining the new york comptroller approval and the closing of the inquiry by the ag.
in the event that the amended osa is not approved by the new york comptroller by april 1, 2022, pseg li intends to vigorously defend itself with regard to the allegations in lipa's complaint alleging breaches of the osa. a decision in this proceeding requiring specific performance or the payment of damages by pseg li or resulting in the termination of the osa could have a material adverse effect on pseg's results of operations and financial condition.
climate strategy and sustainability efforts for more than a century, our mission has been to provide safe access to an around-the-clock supply of reliable, affordable energy. building on this mission, we are working toward a future where customers universally use less energy, the energy they use is cleaner, and its delivery is safe, more reliable and more resilient. in june 2021, we accelerated and expanded our net zero vision by 20 years, establishing a net zero greenhouse gas (ghg) emissions by 2030 goal that includes direct ghg emissions (scope 1) and indirect ghg emissions from operations (scope 2) at both pseg power and pse&g (covering our electric and natural gas utility operations), assuming advances in technology, public policy and customer behavior. scope 1 emissions include power generation, methane leaks, vehicle fleet emissions, sulfur hexafluoride and refrigerant leaks. scope 2 emissions include both gas and electric purchased energy for our pse&g facilities and line losses. in september 2021, we also committed to the united nations-backed race to zero campaign. we have agreed to develop and submit science-based emission reduction targets following the criteria and recommendations of the science based targets initiative by september 2023. targets will encompass scopes 1, 2, and 3 (which includes downstream/customer use of energy products as well as purchased goods and services for our own operations) and must be in line with 1.5oc emissions scenarios.
pse&g has undertaken a number of initiatives that support the reduction of ghg emissions and the implementation of energy efficiency initiatives. pse&g's recently approved cef-ee, cef-ec and cef-ev programs and the proposed cef-es program are intended to support new jersey's energy master plan through programs designed to help customers increase their energy efficiency, support the expansion of the ev infrastructure in the state, install energy storage capacity to supplement solar generation and enhance grid resiliency, install smart meters and supporting infrastructure to allow for the integration of other clean energy technologies and to more efficiently respond to weather and other outage events.
in addition, pse&g is committed to the safe delivery of natural gas to almost two million customers throughout new jersey and we are equally committed to reducing ghg emissions associated with such operations. the first phase of our gsmp replaced approximately 450 miles of cast-iron and unprotected steel gas main infrastructure, and the second phase of this program is expected to replace an additional 875 miles of gas pipes through 2023. the gsmp is designed to significantly reduce natural gas leaks in our distribution system, which would reduce the release of methane, a potent ghg, into the air. through gsmp ii, from 2018 through 2023 we expect to reduce methane leaks by approximately 22% system wide and assuming a continuation of gsmp, we expect to achieve an overall reduction in methane emissions of approximately 60% over the 2011 through 2030 period. as noted previously, later in 2022 we will file for an extension of gsmp which would continue and accelerate these methane reductions. we also continue to assess physical risks of climate change and adapt our capital investment program to improve the reliability and resiliency of our system in an environment of increasing frequency and severity of weather events, notably through our investments in our energy strong program. these investments have proven effective in recent severe weather events, including tropical storm ida in august 2021, which brought significant flooding to our service territory but did not result in the loss of any of our electric distribution substations.
we also continue to focus on providing cleaner energy for our customers. our priority is to preserve the economic viability of our nuclear units, which provide over 90% of the carbon-free energy in new jersey, by advocating for state and federal policies that recognize the value of emission-free generation and reduce market risk. we also continue to explore investment opportunities in offshore wind, both generation and transmission to support the cost-efficient connection of offshore wind generation projects to the new jersey electric system.
offshore wind in december 2020, pseg entered into a definitive agreement with ørsted north america inc. (ørsted) to acquire a 25% equity interest in ørsted's ocean wind project which is currently in development. ocean wind was selected by new jersey to be the first offshore wind farm as part of the state's intention to add 7,500 mw of offshore wind generating capacity by 2035. the ocean wind project is expected to achieve full commercial operation in 2025. on march 31, 2021, the bpu approved pseg's investment in ocean wind and the acquisition was completed in april 2021.
additionally, pseg and ørsted each owns 50% of garden state offshore energy llc (gsoe) which holds rights to an offshore wind lease area just south of new jersey. in december 2021, the maryland public service commission awarded ørsted's 846 mw skipjack 2 project offshore renewable energy credits under maryland's second round of offshore wind solicitations. skipjack 2 utilizes a portion of the gsoe lease area, and pseg has an option to purchase 50% of skipjack 2 and the previously awarded 120 mw skipjack 1 project, which will be constructed concurrently. pseg expects to determine whether to exercise this option during 2022. pseg and ørsted are also exploring further opportunities to develop the remaining gsoe lease area.
in april 2021, pjm announced the opening of the first public policy order 1000 bid window that would utilize the state agreement approach for transmission projects to support new jersey's planned offshore wind generation. the state agreement approach requires customers in the requesting state - in this case new jersey - to pay for the costs of these public policy transmission projects. in september 2021, pseg and ørsted jointly submitted several proposals in response to the solicitation, including multi-spur options and an offshore network proposal. if awarded, the projects would be developed through a 50/50 joint venture with ørsted. the bpu has announced that it will select the winning proposals in the second half of 2022 with likely in-service dates by 2030.
operational excellence we emphasize excellence in operational performance while developing opportunities in both our regulated and competitive businesses. in 2021, our utility continued its efforts to control costs while maintaining strong operational performance.
financial strength our financial strength is predicated on a solid balance sheet, positive operating cash flow and reasonable risk-adjusted returns on increased investment. our financial position remained strong during 2021 as we
•maintained sufficient liquidity,
•completed the sale of pseg power's solar source units and 6,750 mw of fossil generation assets,
•maintained solid investment grade credit ratings, and
•increased our annual dividend for 2021 to $2.04 per share and our indicative annual dividend per share for 2022 to $2.16.
in late september 2021, we announced a $500 million share repurchase program to be implemented upon the close of the sale of the fossil generating assets. in november 2021, our board of directors authorized senior management to implement a share repurchase program at such time as senior management deemed appropriate in its discretion, whether before or after the closing of the sale of the fossil generating assets. in december 2021, under this authorization, we entered into an open market share repurchase plan for $250 million of our common shares. there were no common share repurchases during the fourth quarter of 2021. during january and through february 16, 2022, we purchased the full $250 million of common shares under the open market share repurchase plan.
we expect to be able to fund our planned capital requirements, as described in liquidity and capital resources without the issuance of new equity. our planned capital requirements, which are driven by growth in our regulated utility, and the sale of our fossil generating fleet enhances our business profile and underpins solid investment grade credit ratings with improved financial flexibility. in conjunction with the announced sale of our fossil business, in october 2021 we redeemed all of pseg power's remaining debt. see item 8. note 16. debt and credit facilities for additional details.
financial results the financial results for pseg, pse&g and pseg power for the years ended december 31, 2021 and 2020 are presented as follows:

our 2021 net loss as compared to our 2020 net income was due to an impairment loss and related charges associated with the sale of pseg power's fossil generation assets. for a more detailed discussion of our financial results, see results of operations.
the greater emphasis on capital spending in recent years for projects at pse&g relative to pseg power, particularly those on which we receive contemporaneous returns at pse&g has yielded strong results, which has allowed us to meet customer needs and address market conditions and investor expectations. we continue our focus on operational excellence, financial strength and disciplined investment. these guiding principles have provided the base from which we have been able to execute our strategic initiatives.
disciplined investment we utilize rigorous criteria and consider a number of external factors, focusing on the value for our stakeholders, as well as other impacts, when determining how and when to efficiently deploy capital. we principally explore opportunities for investment in areas that complement our existing business and provide reasonable risk-adjusted returns and continuously assess and optimize our business mix as appropriate. in 2021, we
•made additional investments in t&d infrastructure projects on time and on budget,
•continued to execute our energy efficiency and other existing bpu-approved utility programs,
•closed on our acquisition of a 25% equity interest in the ocean wind project, and
•continued to evaluate potential additional offshore wind opportunities, including submitting a number of proposals in response to an offshore transmission solicitation.
regulatory, legislative and other developments in our pursuit of operational excellence, financial strength and disciplined investment, we closely monitor and engage with stakeholders on significant regulatory and legislative developments. transmission planning rules and wholesale power market design are of particular importance to our results and we continue to advocate for policies and rules that promote fair and efficient electricity markets. for additional information about regulatory, legislative and other developments that may affect us, see item 1. business-regulatory issues.
transmission rate proceedings and roe in march 2019, ferc issued a notice of inquiry seeking comments on improvements to ferc's electric transmission incentives policy. subsequently, in april 2021, ferc issued a supplemental notice of proposed rulemaking to eliminate the incentive for regional transmission organization (rto) membership for transmitting utilities that have already received the incentive for three or more years. pse&g began receiving a 50 basis point adder for rto membership in 2008. elimination of the adder for rto membership could reduce pse&g's annual net income and annual cash inflows by approximately $30 million-$40 million.
in october 2021, ferc approved a settlement agreement effective august 1, 2021 that we reached with the bpu and the new jersey rate counsel about the level of pse&g's base transmission roe and other formula rate matters. the settlement reduces pse&g's base roe from 11.18% to 9.9% and makes several other changes regarding the recovery of certain costs. the agreement provides that the settling parties will not seek changes to our transmission formula rate for three years. we have implemented the terms of the agreement and pjm issued refunds to customers in january 2022.
wholesale power market design in july 2021, pjm submitted to ferc a proposal to replace the extended mopr with new provisions that accommodate state public policy programs that do not attempt to set the price of capacity. under the pjm proposal, pseg power's new jersey nuclear plants that receive zec payments would not be subject to the mopr. in september 2021, ferc issued a notice that it was not able to act on pjm's proposed changes to the mopr because of a split among the commissioners on the lawfulness of pjm's proposal. therefore, pjm's rules became automatically effective as of september 29, 2021 and will apply to the next base residual auction, which has been delayed. in february, ferc approved pjm's filing requesting that the auction be held in june 2022.
in november 2021, a group of generators challenged the new mopr rules in the court of appeals for the third circuit on the grounds that ferc's inaction was unlawful. pseg has intervened in the proceeding in support of the new mopr rules. we cannot predict the outcome of this proceeding.
in another order related to the auction, ferc found that the current rules related to the market seller offer cap were unjust and unreasonable and ultimately eliminated the default offer cap. in its place, ferc adopted a unit-specific approach to reviewing certain capacity market offers. these new rules could result in lower capacity prices since market offers for many resource types will need to be approved by the independent market monitor and pjm.
in july 2021, the bpu issued a report on its investigation related to whether new jersey can achieve its long-term clean energy and environmental objectives under the current resource adequacy procurement paradigm. the report found that participating in the regional market is the most efficient way for new jersey to achieve its clean energy goals and therefore consideration of leaving the regional market is paused while important market reforms are being considered at the regional and national level. however, the report recommends that new jersey continue to explore a new jersey-only or regional competitive auction design if potential reforms at the regional and national level are not sufficient to allow new jersey to achieve its clean energy goals. we cannot predict whether the bpu will take any measures in the future that will have an impact on the capacity market or our generating stations.
in january 2020, new jersey rejoined the regional greenhouse gas initiative (rggi). as a result, generating plants operating in new jersey, including those owned by pseg power, that emit carbon dioxide emissions will be required to procure credits for each ton they emit. following the close on the sale of the fossil generating assets, we no longer have generation subject to the rggi compliance requirements.
environmental regulation we are subject to liability under environmental laws for the costs and penalties of remediating contamination of property now or formerly owned by us and of property contaminated by hazardous substances that we generated. in particular, the historic operations of pseg companies and the operations of numerous other companies along the passaic and hackensack rivers are alleged by federal and state agencies to have discharged substantial contamination into the passaic river/newark bay complex in violation of various statutes. in addition, pseg power will retain ownership of certain assets and liabilities excluded from the sale of its fossil generation business, primarily related to obligations under certain environmental regulations, including possible remediation obligations under the new jersey industrial site recovery act and the connecticut transfer act. the amounts for any such environmental remediation are not estimable, but may be material. we are also currently involved in a number of proceedings relating to sites where other hazardous substances may have been discharged and may be subject to additional proceedings in the future, and the costs and penalties of any such remediation efforts could be material.
for further information regarding the matters described above, as well as other matters that may impact our financial condition and results of operations, see item 8. note 15. commitments and contingent liabilities.
nuclear in april 2019, pseg power's salem 1, salem 2 and hope creek nuclear plants were awarded zecs by the bpu. pursuant to a process established by the bpu, zecs are purchased from selected nuclear plants and recovered through a non-bypassable distribution charge in the amount of $0.004 per kilowatt-hour used (which is equivalent to approximately $10 per megawatt hour (mwh) generated in payments to selected nuclear plants (zec payment)). each nuclear plant is expected to receive zec revenue for approximately three years, through may 2022.
in april 2021, pseg power's salem 1, salem 2 and hope creek nuclear plants were awarded zecs for the three-year eligibility period starting june 2022 at the same approximate $10 per mwh received during the current zec period through may 2022 referenced above. as a result, each nuclear plant is expected to receive zec revenue for an additional three years starting june 2022. the terms and conditions of this april 2021 zec award are the same as the current zec period as discussed above. while the zec program has preserved these units to date, pseg will simultaneously seek long-term legislative or other solutions for our new jersey nuclear plants that sufficiently values them for their carbon-free, fuel diversity and resilience attributes. no assurances can be given regarding future zec awards or other long-term solutions.
the award of zecs attaches certain obligations, including an obligation to repay the zecs in the event that a plant ceases operations during the period that it was awarded zecs, subject to certain exceptions specified in the zec legislation. pseg power has and will continue to recognize revenue monthly as the nuclear plants generate electricity and satisfy their performance obligations. further, the zec payment may be adjusted by the bpu at any time to offset environmental or fuel diversity payments that a selected nuclear plant may receive from another source. for instance, the new jersey rate counsel, in written comments filed with the bpu, has advocated for the bpu to offset market benefits resulting from new jersey's rejoining the rggi from the zec payment. pseg intends to vigorously defend against these arguments. due to its preliminary nature, pseg cannot predict the outcome of this matter.
in may 2021, the new jersey rate counsel filed an appeal with the new jersey appellate division of the bpu's april 2021 decision. pseg cannot predict the outcome of this matter.
in the event that (i) the zec program is overturned or is otherwise materially adversely modified through legal process; or (ii) any of the salem 1, salem 2 and hope creek plants is not sufficiently valued for its environmental, fuel diversity or resilience attributes in future periods and does not otherwise experience a material financial change that would remove the need for such attributes to be sufficiently valued, pseg power will take all necessary steps to cease to operate all of these plants. alternatively, even with sufficient valuation of these attributes, if the financial condition of the plants is materially adversely impacted by changes in commodity prices, ferc's changes to the capacity market construct (absent sufficient capacity revenues provided under a program approved by the bpu in accordance with a ferc-authorized capacity mechanism), or, in the case of the salem nuclear plants, decisions by the epa and state environmental regulators regarding the implementation of section 316(b) of the clean water act and related state regulations, or other factors, pseg power will take all necessary steps to cease to operate all of these plants. ceasing operations of these plants would result in a material adverse impact on pseg's and pseg power's results of operations.
tax legislation a prolonged coronavirus pandemic, further economic stimulus, or future federal and state tax legislation could have a material impact on our effective tax rate and cash tax position.
the consolidated appropriations act, 2021, enacted in late december 2020, provides a 30% investment tax credit (itc) for offshore wind projects that begin construction before december 31, 2025. in addition, on december 31, 2020, notice 2021-05 was issued. for qualifying offshore wind projects, the notice extends the four year continuity safe harbor to ten calendar years commencing the calendar year after which construction of the project begins. this legislation and notice will impact our offshore wind investment.
in july 2020, the internal revenue service (irs) issued final and proposed regulations addressing the limitation on deductible business interest expense contained in the tax cuts and jobs act. these regulations retroactively allow depreciation to be added back in computing the 30% adjusted taxable income (ati) cap, increasing the amount of interest that can be deducted by unregulated businesses in years before 2022. for 2022 and after, the regulations continue to disallow the addback of depreciation in the computation of ati, effectively lowering the cap on the amount of deductible business interest. the portion of pseg's and pseg power's business interest expense that was disallowed in 2018 and 2019 will now be deductible in those respective years.
in march 2020, the federal coronavirus aid, relief, and economic security act (cares act) was enacted. the cares act allows a five-year carryback of any net operating loss (nol) generated in a taxable year beginning after december 31, 2017 and before january 1, 2021. the cares act allowed us to carry back the 2018 tax nol generated by the final section 163(j) regulations, which will provide a future tax benefit, subject to approval by the irs and the joint committee on taxation.
future outlook our future success will depend on our ability to continue to maintain strong operational and financial performance to capitalize on or otherwise address regulatory and legislative developments that impact our business and to respond to the issues and challenges described below. in order to do this, we will continue to:
•obtain approval of and execute on our utility capital investment program to modernize our infrastructure, improve the reliability of the service we provide to our customers, and align our sustainability and climate goals with new jersey's energy policy,
•focus on controlling costs while maintaining safety, reliability and customer satisfaction and complying with applicable standards and requirements,
•deliver on our human capital management strategy to attract, develop and retain a diverse, high-performing workforce,
•successfully manage our energy obligations and re-contract our open supply positions in response to changes in prices and demand,
•advocate for federal and state programs to properly value new jersey's largest carbon-free generation resource in nuclear and measures that promote fair and efficient electricity markets, including recognition of the cost of emissions,
•engage constructively with our multiple stakeholders, including regulators, government officials, customers, employees, investors, suppliers and the communities in which we do business,
•seek a fair return for our t&d investments through our transmission formula rate, distribution infrastructure and clean energy investment programs and periodic distribution base rate case proceedings,
•successfully operate the lipa t&d system and manage lipa's fuel supply and generation dispatch obligations, and
•manage the risks and opportunities in environmental, social and governance (esg) matters, which is an integral part of our long-term strategy to be a clean energy leader for the benefit of all stakeholders.
in addition to the risks described elsewhere in this form 10-k for 2021 and beyond, the key issues and challenges we expect our business to confront include:
•regulatory and political uncertainty, both with regard to future energy policy, design of energy and capacity markets, transmission policy and environmental regulation, as well as with respect to the outcome of any legal, regulatory or other proceedings,
•the continuing impact of the ongoing coronavirus pandemic and the associated regulations and economic impacts, which could extend beyond the duration of the pandemic,
•future changes in federal and state tax laws or any other associated tax guidance, and
•the impact of changes in demand, natural gas and electricity prices, and expanded efforts to decarbonize several sectors of the economy.
we continually assess a broad range of strategic options to maximize long-term stockholder value and address the interests of our multiple stakeholders. in assessing our options, we consider a wide variety of factors, including the performance and prospects of our businesses; the views of investors, regulators, rating agencies, customers and employees; our existing indebtedness and restrictions it imposes; and tax considerations, among other things. strategic options available to us include:
•investments in pse&g, including t&d facilities to enhance reliability, resiliency and modernize the system to meet the growing needs and increasingly higher expectations of customers, and clean energy investments such as cef-ee, cef-ev, cef-es and solar,
•the further disposition or restructuring of our merchant generation business or portions thereof beyond the aforementioned sale of pseg power's fossil and solar generating assets or other existing businesses or the acquisition or development of new businesses,
•investments in regional offshore wind with long-term contracts or regulated transmission returns that provide revenue predictability and a reasonable risk-adjusted return,
•continued operation of our nuclear generation facilities, to the extent there is sufficient certainty that their operation will render an acceptable risk-adjusted return, and
•acquisitions, dispositions and other transactions involving our common stock, assets or businesses that could provide value to customers and shareholders.
there can be no assurance, however, that we will successfully develop and execute any of the strategic options noted above, or any additional options we may consider in the future. the execution of any such strategic plan may not have the expected benefits or may have unexpected adverse consequences.

(a)pseg power's results in 2021 include an after-tax impairment loss and other associated charges, including debt extinguishment costs, of $2,158 million related to the sale of pseg power's fossil generation assets. pseg power's results in 2020 include an after-tax gain of $86 million related to the sale of its ownership interest in the yards creek generation facility. pseg power's results in 2019 include an after-tax loss of $286 million related to the sale of its ownership interests in the keystone and conemaugh fossil generation plants. see item 8. note 4. early plant retirements/asset dispositions and impairments for additional information.
(b)other includes after-tax activities at the parent company, pseg li and energy holdings as well as intercompany eliminations.
pseg power's results above include the nuclear decommissioning trust (ndt) fund activity and the impacts of non-trading commodity mark-to-market (mtm) activity, which consist of the financial impact from positions with future delivery dates.
the variances in our net income attributable to changes related to the ndt fund and mtm are shown in the following table:

(a)ndt fund income (expense) includes gains and losses on ndt securities which are recorded in net gains (losses) on trust investments. see item 8. note 11. trust investments for additional information. ndt fund income (expense) also includes interest and dividend income and other costs related to the ndt fund recorded in other income (deductions), interest accretion expense on pseg power's nuclear asset retirement obligation (aro) recorded in operation & maintenance (o&m) expense and the depreciation related to the aro asset recorded in depreciation and amortization (d&a) expense.
(b)net of tax (expense) benefit of $(70) million, $(94) million and $(103) million for the years ended december 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.
(c)net of tax (expense) benefit of $174 million, $23 million and $(80) million for the years ended december 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.
the net loss in 2021 as compared to net income in 2020 was driven primarily by
•an impairment loss and related charges taken as a result of the sale of the fossil generation assets at pseg power (see item 8. note 4. early plant retirements/asset dispositions and impairments for additional information),
•higher mtm losses at pseg power due to rising energy prices, and
•a gain on the sale of pseg power's ownership interest in the yards creek generation facility in 2020,
•partially offset by higher earnings due to continued investments in t&d programs at pse&g, and
•higher pension and opeb credits.
our results of operations are primarily comprised of the results of operations of our principal operating segments, pse&g and pseg power, excluding charges related to intercompany transactions, which are eliminated in consolidation. for additional information on intercompany transactions, see item 8. note 26. related-party transactions.

operating revenues increased $514 million due to changes in delivery, clause, commodity and other operating revenues.
delivery revenues increased $221 million.
•transmission revenues increased $113 million due to higher revenue requirements calculated through our transmission formula rate, primarily to recover required investments. the net increase in 2021 includes a reduction to the revenue requirement of approximately $64 million as a result of our roe settlement approved by ferc effective august 1, 2021, partially offset by a $35 million flowback of certain excess deferred income taxes in 2020. the $35 million flowback was offset in income tax expense in 2020.
•gas distribution revenues increased $65 million due to increases of $42 million from collection of the gsmp in base rates, $18 million in cip decoupling revenues, $7 million in collections of green program recovery charges (gprc) and $7 million from higher sales volumes. these increases were partially offset by a decrease of $9 million in wnc revenues.
•electric distribution revenues increased $59 million due primarily to $30 million from cip decoupling revenue, $13 million in higher collections of gprc, $9 million from an energy strong ii rate roll-in and $7 million from higher sales volumes.
•electric distribution and gas distribution revenue requirements were $16 million lower as a result of the flowback of excess deferred income tax liabilities and tax repair-related accumulated deferred income taxes. this decrease is offset in income tax expense.
clause revenues increased $47 million due to $17 million in tax adjustment credits (tac) and gprc deferrals, $28 million in higher societal benefits charges (sbc) and $4 million in margin adjustment clause (mac) revenues. these increases were partially offset by $2 million in lower solar pilot recovery charge (sprc) collections. the changes in tac and gprc deferrals, sbc, mac and sprc collections were entirely offset by the amortization of related costs (regulatory assets) in o&m, d&a and interest and tax expenses. pse&g does not earn margin on tac or gprc deferrals or on sbc, mac or sprc collections.
commodity revenues increased $217 million due to higher gas revenues and electric revenues. the changes in commodity revenues for both gas and electric are entirely offset by changes in energy costs. pse&g earns no margin on the provision of basic gas supply service (bgss) and bgs to retail customers.
•gas revenues increased $143 million due primarily to higher bgss prices of $110 million and higher bgss sales volumes of $33 million.
•electric revenues increased $74 million due to $118 million from higher bgs sales volumes, partially offset by $44 million from lower prices.
other operating revenues increased $29 million due to a $27 million increase primarily in appliance service revenues and a $25 million increase from the sale of transition renewable energy certificates (trec). these increases were partially offset by a $20 million reduction in revenues from solar renewable energy credits (srec) and a $3 million reduction in zec revenues. the changes in trec, srec and zec revenues are entirely offset by changes to energy costs.
operating expenses energy costs increased $219 million. this is entirely offset by changes in commodity revenues and other operating revenues.
operation and maintenance increased $78 million due primarily to increases of $46 million in clause and renewable expenditures, $16 million in appliance service costs, $11 million in transmission maintenance expenditures and $5 million in other operating expenses.
depreciation and amortization increased $41 million due primarily to an increase in depreciation of $55 million due to additional plant placed into service and a $6 million increase from the amortization of software. these increases were partially offset by a $19 million decrease due to lower transmission depreciation rates effective august 1, 2021, which were included in the settlement of the formula rate and other matters.
other income (deductions) decreased $20 million due primarily to a decrease of $16 million in the allowance for funds used during construction (afudc) from lower transmission expenditures and a $4 million net decrease in solar loan interest and miscellaneous other income.
non-operating pension and opeb credits (costs) increased $59 million due primarily to a $44 million decrease in interest cost and a $27 million increase in the expected return on plan assets, partially offset by a $6 million net increase in the amortization of net prior service cost and a $6 million net increase in amortization of the net actuarial loss.
interest expense increased $14 million due primarily to increases of $6 million and $3 million due to net long-term debt issuances in 2021 and 2020, respectively, and a $5 million increase due primarily to lower afudc.
income tax expense increased $84 million due primarily to higher pre-tax income in 2021 and reduced flowback of excess deferred income tax liabilities in 2021, partially offset by the tax benefit from the cef program investments.

year ended december 31, 2021 as compared to 2020
operating revenues decreased $487 million due to changes in generation, gas supply and other operating revenues.
generation revenues decreased $668 million due primarily to
•a net decrease of $606 million due to higher mtm losses in 2021 as compared to 2020. of this amount, there was a $624 million decrease due to changes in forward prices, partially offset by an $18 million increase due to less losses on positions reclassified to realized upon settlement in 2021,
•a net decrease of $288 million due primarily to $201 million from lower volumes of electricity sold under the bgs contracts, coupled with an $87 million impact from the transfer of responsibility for firm transmission services from bgs suppliers to the electric distribution companies (edcs), and
•a net decrease of $29 million in solar revenues due to the sale of the solar plants in june 2021,
•partially offset by a net increase of $188 million due primarily to higher average realized prices and higher volumes sold in the pjm, new england (ne) and new york (ny) regions, and
•a net increase of $64 million in capacity revenues due primarily to increases in auction prices, coupled with decreases in capacity charges due to lower bgs and other load obligations in the pjm region, partially offset by lower capacity prices and the retirement of the bridgeport harbor 3 (bh3) coal plant in the ne region.
gas supply revenues increased $182 million due primarily to
•a net increase of $106 million in sales under the bgss contract due primarily to higher prices of $72 million and higher sales volumes of $34 million, and
•a net increase of $74 million related to sales to third parties, of which $90 million was due to higher average sales prices, partially offset by $16 million due to lower volumes sold.
operating expenses energy costs represent the cost of generation, which includes fuel costs for generation as well as purchased energy in the market, and gas purchases to meet pseg power's obligation under its bgss contract with pse&g. energy costs increased $157 million due to generation costs decreased $13 million due primarily to
•a net decrease of $147 million in transmission costs due primarily to an $87 million impact from the transfer of responsibility for firm transmission services under bgs contracts from bgs suppliers to the edcs, coupled with a $60 million decrease in other transmission costs, mainly from lower volumes of electricity sold under the bgs contracts, and
•a net decrease of $66 million due to higher net mtm gains in 2021. of this amount, there was a $52 million decrease due to changes in forward prices, coupled with a $14 million decrease due to more gains on positions reclassified to realized upon settlement in 2021,
•partially offset by a net increase of $157 million in fuel costs, reflecting higher gas prices and higher volumes in the pjm, ny, and ne regions, and
•a net increase of $42 million in energy purchases due primarily to an increase in purchased volumes in the pjm region to meet physical energy sales. this was partially offset by a decrease in renewable energy credit requirements caused by decreases in load served in the pjm region.
gas costs increased $170 million due primarily to
•a net increase of $103 million in costs related to sales under the bgss contract, of which $74 million was due to the higher average cost of gas and $29 million to higher send out volumes. included in the 2020 average cost of gas were $18 million of interstate gas pipeline refunds due to a settlement on pipeline rates from prior periods, and
•a net increase of $67 million related to sales to third parties, of which $81 million was due to an increase in the average cost of gas, partially offset by a decrease of $14 million due to lower volumes sold.
operation and maintenance increased $19 million due primarily to a refueling outage in 2021 at our 100%-owned hope creek nuclear plant as compared to an outage in 2020 at our 57%-owned salem 2 nuclear plant and severance costs related to the sale of the fossil generating plants, partially offset by lower costs in 2021 due to the sale of our ownership interest in the solar plants in june 2021.
depreciation and amortization decreased $112 million due primarily to ceasing depreciation expense on the fossil generating plants, the sale of the solar plants and the retirement of bh3 in 2021.
(gains) losses on asset dispositions and impairments. the loss in 2021 primarily reflects a $2,691 million impairment due to the sale of the fossil generating plants and other impairments, partially offset by a $63 million gain from the sale of the solar plants. the $122 million gain in 2020 was due to the sale of our ownership interest in the yards creek generation facility. see item 8. note 4. early plant retirements/asset dispositions and impairments.
net gains (losses) on trust investments decreased $54 million due primarily to a $101 million decrease in net unrealized gains on equity investments in the ndt fund, partially offset by a $46 million increase in net realized gains on ndt fund investments.
other income (deductions) increased $17 million due primarily to less purchases of nol tax benefits under the new jersey technology tax benefit transfer program and higher interest and dividend income on ndt fund investments in 2021.
non-operating pension and opeb credits (costs) increased $14 million due to a decrease in interest cost and an increase in the expected return on plan assets, partially offset by an increase in the amortization of net prior service cost.
loss on extinguishment of debt represents a loss incurred in 2021 for a make whole premium that was payable upon early redemption of all outstanding debt obligations and other non-cash debt extinguishment costs.
interest expense decreased $43 million due primarily to the early redemption of all remaining outstanding senior notes in october 2021.
income tax expense decreased $940 million due primarily to lower pre-tax income in 2021, partially offset by the recapture of itcs related to the sale of the solar plants in 2021, the tax benefit in 2020 from changes in uncertain tax positions as a result of the settlement of the 2011-2016 federal income tax audits, and the purchase of less new jersey nol tax benefits in 2021.
year ended december 31, 2020 as compared to 2019
see item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in our 2019 annual report.
liquidity and capital resources the following discussion of our liquidity and capital resources is on a consolidated basis, noting the uses and contributions, where material, of our two direct major operating subsidiaries.
financing methodology we expect our capital requirements to be met through internally generated cash flows and external financings, consisting of short-term debt for working capital needs and long-term debt for capital investments.
pse&g's sources of external liquidity include a $600 million multi-year revolving credit facility. pse&g uses internally generated cash flow and its commercial paper program to meet seasonal, intra-month and temporary working capital needs. pse&g does not engage in any intercompany borrowing or lending arrangements. pse&g maintains back-up facilities in an amount sufficient to cover the commercial paper and letters of credit outstanding. pse&g's dividend payments to/capital contributions from pseg are consistent with its capital structure objectives which have been established to maintain investment grade credit ratings. pse&g's long-term financing plan is designed to replace maturities, fund a portion of its capital program and manage short-term debt balances. generally, pse&g uses either secured medium-term notes or first mortgage bonds to raise long-term capital.
pseg, pseg power, energy holdings, pseg li and services participate in a corporate money pool, an aggregation of daily cash balances designed to efficiently manage their respective short-term liquidity needs, which are accounted for as intercompany loans. servco does not participate in the corporate money pool. servco's short-term liquidity needs are met through an account funded and owned by lipa.
pseg's available sources of external liquidity may include the issuance of long-term debt securities and the incurrence of additional indebtedness under credit facilities. our current sources of external liquidity include multi-year revolving credit facilities totaling $1.5 billion. these facilities are available to back-stop pseg's commercial paper program, issue letters of credit and for general corporate purposes. pseg's credit facilities and the commercial paper program are available to support pseg's working capital needs and are also available to make equity contributions or provide liquidity support to its subsidiaries. additionally, from time to time, pseg enters into short-term loan agreements designed to enhance its liquidity position.
pseg power's sources of external liquidity include $1.9 billion of multi-year revolving credit facilities. credit capacity is primarily used to provide collateral in support of pseg power's forward energy sale and forward fuel purchase contracts as the market prices for energy and fuel fluctuate, and to meet potential collateral postings in the event that pseg power is downgraded to below investment grade by standard & poor's (s&p) or moody's. pseg power's dividend payments to pseg are also designed to be consistent with its capital structure objectives which have been established to maintain investment grade credit ratings and provide sufficient financial flexibility.
operating cash flows we continue to expect our operating cash flows combined with cash on hand and financing activities to be sufficient to fund planned capital expenditures and shareholder dividends.
for the year ended december 31, 2021, our operating cash flow decreased $1,366 million. the net decrease was primarily due to a $780 million reduction related to net cash collateral posting requirements at pseg power and a net change at pse&g, as discussed below. in addition, in 2021, there were higher tax payments at pseg power and lower tax refunds at the parent company, partially offset by lower tax payments at energy holdings.
current economic conditions have adversely impacted residential and c&i customer payment patterns. during the moratorium, as previously discussed, pse&g has experienced a significant decrease in cash inflow and higher accounts receivable aging and an associated increase in bad debt expense, which we expect will extend beyond the duration of the coronavirus pandemic.
pse&g pse&g's operating cash flow decreased $229 million from $1,953 million to $1,724 million for the year ended december 31, 2021, as compared to 2020, due primarily to a net increase in regulatory deferrals, increases in electric energy and vendor payments, and higher tax payments in 2021, partially offset by higher earnings.
short-term liquidity pseg meets its short-term liquidity requirements, as well as those of pseg power, primarily through the issuance of commercial paper and, from time to time, short-term loans. pse&g maintains its own separate commercial paper program to meet its short-term liquidity requirements. each commercial paper program is fully back-stopped by its own separate credit facilities.
we continually monitor our liquidity and seek to add capacity as needed to meet our liquidity requirements. each of our credit facilities is restricted as to availability and use to the specific companies as listed below; however, if necessary, the pseg facilities can also be used to support our subsidiaries' liquidity needs.
as part of the generation business, we hedge generation output to mitigate market price volatility. when prices increase, hedged positions could be out-of-the-money, requiring margin postings. in times of significantly rising market prices, those collateral postings could be substantial. during the second half of 2021, pseg power experienced a substantial increase in net cash collateral postings related to hedge positions that are out-of-the-money due to an increase in energy market prices, from $343 million at the end of june to $844 million at the end of december. pseg issued short-term borrowings, including commercial paper, in order to satisfy the increase in collateral postings and to prepare for the pseg power debt redemption. in october, pseg power borrowed $755 million from its credit facility to support its senior notes redemption and additional cash collateral postings, as needed. in november, pseg issued $1.5 billion of senior notes, using a portion of the funds to provide support to pseg power for paying off the $755 million loan from the credit facility.
in march 2020, pseg entered into a $300 million, 364-day term loan agreement which was prepaid in january 2021. in march and may 2021, pseg entered into two 364-day variable rate term loan agreements for $500 million and $750 million, respectively. in august 2021, pseg entered into a $1.25 billion, 364-day variable rate term loan agreement. these term loans are not included in the credit facility amounts presented in the following table.
our total credit facilities and available liquidity as of december 31, 2021 were as follows:
company/facility                                                                 as of december 31, 2021

for additional information, see item 8. note 16. debt and credit facilities.
as of december 31, 2021, our credit facility capacity was in excess of our projected maximum liquidity requirements over our 12 month planning horizon, including access to external financing to meet redemptions. our maximum liquidity requirements are based on stress scenarios that incorporate changes in commodity prices and the potential impact of pseg power losing its investment grade credit rating from s&p or moody's, which would represent a two level downgrade from its current moody's and s&p ratings. in the event of a deterioration of pseg power's credit rating, certain of pseg power's agreements allow the counterparty to demand further performance assurance. the potential additional collateral that we would be required to post under these agreements if pseg power were to lose its investment grade credit rating was approximately $1,151 million and $840 million as of december 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. see item 8. note 15. commitments and contingent liabilities for additional discussion of pseg power's agreements.
long-term debt financing during the fourth quarter of 2021 pseg:
•issued $750 million of 0.84% senior notes due november 2023,
•issued $750 million of 2.45% senior notes due november 2031, and
•retired $300 million of 2.00% senior notes at maturity.
in october 2021, pseg redeemed all remaining outstanding senior notes of pseg power due to covenants that could trigger a default from the sale of pseg power's fossil generating plants. this included $700 million of 3.85% senior notes due to mature in june 2023, $250 million of 4.30% senior notes due to mature in november 2023, and $404 million of 8.63% senior notes due to mature in april 2031. these senior notes were redeemed at a redemption price that included a "make-whole" premium of approximately $294 million plus any interest accrued and unpaid to the redemption date, in each case, calculated in accordance with the indenture governing the senior notes. the debt redemption and "make-whole" premium were funded with a short-term loan from pseg and borrowings under pseg power's credit facility. in addition, approximately $4 million of other non-cash debt extinguishment costs related to the redemption were recorded in october 2021.
during the next twelve months,
•pseg has $700 million of 2.65% senior notes maturing in november 2022.
for additional information, see item 8. note 16. debt and credit facilities.
debt covenants our credit agreements contain maximum debt to equity ratios and other restrictive covenants and conditions to borrowing. we are currently in compliance with all of our debt covenants. continued compliance with applicable financial covenants will depend upon our future financial position, level of earnings and cash flows, as to which no assurances can be given.
in addition, under its first and refunding mortgage (mortgage), pse&g may issue new first and refunding mortgage bonds against previous additions and improvements, provided that its ratio of earnings to fixed charges calculated in accordance with its mortgage is at least 2 to 1, and/or against retired mortgage bonds. as of december 31, 2021, pse&g's mortgage coverage ratio was 4.7 to 1 and the mortgage would permit up to approximately $8.4 billion aggregate principal amount of new mortgage bonds to be issued against additions and improvements to its property.
default provisions our bank credit agreements and indentures contain various, customary default provisions that could result in the potential acceleration of indebtedness under the defaulting company's agreement.
in particular, pseg's bank credit agreements contain provisions under which certain events, including an acceleration of material indebtedness under pse&g's and pseg power's respective financing agreements, a failure by pse&g or pseg power to satisfy certain final judgments and certain bankruptcy events by pse&g or pseg power, would constitute an event of default under the pseg bank credit agreements. under the pseg bank credit agreements, it would also be an event of default if either pse&g or pseg power ceases to be wholly owned by pseg. the pse&g and pseg power bank credit agreements include similar default provisions; however, such provisions only relate to the respective borrower under such agreement and its subsidiaries and do not contain cross default provisions to each other. the pse&g and pseg power bank credit agreements do not include cross default provisions relating to pseg. pseg power's bank credit agreements also contain limitations on the incurrence of subsidiary debt and liens.
there are no cross-acceleration provisions in pseg's or pse&g's indentures. however, pseg's existing notes include a cross acceleration provision that may be triggered upon the acceleration of more than $75 million of indebtedness incurred by pseg. such provision does not extend to an acceleration of indebtedness by any of pseg's subsidiaries.
in march 2021, each of pseg and pseg power and its subsidiaries received waivers from the lenders and the administrative agent under their existing credit agreements permitting them to divest, in one or more transactions, some or all of its and its subsidiaries' non-nuclear assets without breaching the terms of the agreements.
ratings triggers our debt indentures and credit agreements do not contain any material "ratings triggers" that would cause an acceleration of the required interest and principal payments in the event of a ratings downgrade. however, in the event of a downgrade, any one or more of the affected companies may be subject to increased interest costs on certain bank debt and certain collateral requirements. in the event that we are not able to affirm representations and warranties on credit agreements, lenders would not be required to make loans.
in accordance with bpu requirements under the bgs contracts, pse&g is required to maintain an investment grade credit rating. if pse&g were to lose its investment grade rating, it would be required to file a plan to assure continued payment for the bgs requirements of its customers.
fluctuations in commodity prices or a deterioration of pseg power's credit rating to below investment grade could increase pseg power's required margin postings under various agreements entered into in the normal course of business. pseg power believes it has sufficient liquidity to meet the required posting of collateral which would likely result from a credit rating downgrade to below investment grade by s&p or moody's at today's market prices.

on february 15, 2022, our board of directors approved a $0.54 per share common stock dividend for the first quarter of 2022. this reflects an indicative annual dividend rate of $2.16 per share. we expect to continue to pay cash dividends on our common stock; however, the declaration and payment of future dividends to holders of our common stock will be at the discretion of the board of directors and will depend upon many factors, including our financial condition, earnings, capital requirements of our businesses, alternate investment opportunities, legal requirements, regulatory constraints, industry practice and other factors that the board of directors deems relevant. for additional information related to cash dividends on our common stock, see item 8. note 24. earnings per share (eps) and dividends.
credit ratings if the rating agencies lower or withdraw our credit ratings, such revisions may adversely affect the market price of our securities and serve to materially increase our cost of capital and limit access to capital. credit ratings shown are for securities that we typically issue. outlooks are shown for the credit ratings at each entity and can be stable, negative, or positive. in may 2021, moody's changed pse&g's outlook to negative from stable. in august 2021, moody's changed pseg and pseg power's outlook to negative from stable. in october 2021, moody's downgraded pseg's senior unsecured notes rating to baa2 from baa1, pse&g's mortgage bond rating to a1 from aa3 and commercial paper rating to p2 from p1, and assigned pseg power an issuer credit rating of baa2. moody's outlooks of pseg, pse&g and pseg power were changed to stable from negative. with the redemption of pseg power's senior notes, s&p maintains an issuer credit rating of bbb. there is no assurance that the ratings will continue for any given period of time or that they will not be revised by the rating agencies, if in their respective judgments, circumstances warrant. each rating given by an agency should be evaluated independently of the other agencies' ratings. the ratings should not be construed as an indication to buy, hold or sell any security.

other comprehensive income for the year ended december 31, 2021, we had other comprehensive income of $154 million on a consolidated basis. the other comprehensive income was due primarily to an increase of $190 million related to pension and other postretirement benefits, and $3 million of unrealized gains on derivative contracts accounted for as hedges, partially offset by $39 million of net unrealized losses related to available-for-sale debt securities. see item 8. note 23. accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), net of tax for additional information.
capital requirements we expect that all of our capital requirements over the next three years will come from a combination of internally generated funds and external debt financing. projected capital construction and investment expenditures, excluding nuclear fuel purchases, for the next three years are presented in the following table. these projections include afudc for pse&g and interest capitalized during construction for pseg's other subsidiaries. these amounts are subject to change, based on various factors. amounts shown below for pse&g include currently approved programs. we intend to continue to invest in infrastructure modernization and will seek to extend these and related programs as appropriate.

pse&g pse&g's projections for future capital expenditures include material additions and replacements to its t&d systems to meet expected growth and to manage reliability. as project scope and cost estimates develop, pse&g will modify its current projections to include these required investments. pse&g's projected expenditures for the various items reported above are primarily comprised of the following:
•transmission-investments focused on reliability improvements and replacement of aging infrastructure.
•electric and gas distribution-investments for new business, reliability improvements, flood mitigation, and modernization and replacement of equipment that has reached the end of its useful life.
•clean energy-investments associated with customer energy efficiency programs, infrastructure supporting electric vehicles and grid-connected solar.
in 2021, pse&g made $2,447 million of capital expenditures, primarily for t&d system reliability. this does not include expenditures for cost of removal, net of salvage, of $121 million, which are included in operating cash flows.
other pseg's other projected expenditures are primarily comprised of investments to replace major parts and enhance operational performance at pseg power.
in 2021, pseg's other capital expenditures were $115 million, excluding $157 million for nuclear fuel, primarily related to various nuclear projects at pseg power.
offshore wind the above table does not reflect our expected long-term investments in offshore wind projects. we currently expect to make investments in our 25% equity interest in orsted's ocean wind project to fund construction and operations planning activities. over the course of the project, which is expected to achieve full commercial operation in 2025, our investments are expected to be substantial. we have planned funding of approximately $250 million to support continued project development to its final investment decision. at that time, if we choose not to proceed with the project, orsted has the option to repurchase our 25% equity interest in order to proceed with the project.

critical accounting estimates under accounting guidance generally accepted in the united states (gaap), many accounting standards require the use of estimates, variable inputs and assumptions (collectively referred to as estimates) that are subjective in nature. because of this, differences between the actual measure realized versus the estimate can have a material impact on results of operations, financial position and cash flows. we have determined that the following estimates are considered critical to the application of rules that relate to the respective businesses.
accounting for pensions and other postretirement benefits (opeb)
the market-related value of plan assets held for the qualified pension and opeb plans is equal to the fair value of these assets as of year-end. the plan assets are comprised of investments in both debt and equity securities which are valued using quoted market prices, broker or dealer quotations, or alternative pricing sources with reasonable levels of price transparency. plan assets also include investments in unlisted real estate which is valued via third-party appraisals. we calculate pension and opeb costs using various economic and demographic assumptions.
assumptions and approach used: economic assumptions include the discount rate and the long-term rate of return on trust assets. demographic pension and opeb assumptions include projections of future mortality rates, pay increases and retirement patterns, as well as projected health care costs for opeb.

the discount rate used to calculate pension and opeb obligations is determined as of december 31 each year, our measurement date. the discount rate is determined by developing a spot rate curve based on the yield to maturity of a universe of high quality corporate bonds with similar maturities to the plan obligations. the spot rates are used to discount the estimated plan distributions. the discount rate is the single equivalent rate that produces the same result as the full spot rate curve.
our expected rate of return on plan assets reflects current asset allocations, historical long-term investment performance and an estimate of future long-term returns by asset class, long-term inflation assumptions and a premium for active management.
we utilize a corridor approach that reduces the volatility of reported costs/credits. the corridor requires differences between actuarial assumptions and plan results be deferred and amortized as part of the costs/credits. this occurs only when the accumulated differences exceed 10% of the greater of the benefit obligation or the fair value of plan assets as of each year-end. for the pension plan, the excess would be amortized over the average remaining expected life of inactive participants, which is approximately nineteen years. for pension plan ii, the excess would be amortized over the average remaining service period of active employees, which is approximately fourteen years.
effect if different assumptions used: as part of the business planning process, we have modeled future costs assuming a 7.20% expected rate of return and a 2.94% discount rate for 2022 pension costs/credits and a 2.82% discount rate for 2022 opeb costs/credits. based upon these assumptions, we have estimated a net periodic pension credit in 2022 of approximately $115 million, or $172 million, net of amounts capitalized, and a net periodic opeb credit in 2022 of approximately $124 million, or $127 million, net of amounts capitalized. actual future pension costs/credits and funding levels will depend on future investment performance, changes in discount rates, market conditions, funding levels relative to our projected benefit obligation and accumulated benefit obligation and various other factors related to the populations participating in the pension plans. actual future opeb costs/credits will depend on future investment performance, changes in discount rates, market conditions, and various other factors.
the following chart reflects the sensitivities associated with a change in certain assumptions. the effects of the assumption changes shown below solely reflect the impact of that specific assumption.

see item 7a. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk for additional information.
derivative instruments the operations of pseg, pseg power and pse&g are exposed to market risks from changes in commodity prices, interest rates and equity prices that could affect their results of operations and financial condition. exposure to these risks is managed through normal operating and financing activities and, when appropriate, through executing derivative transactions. derivative instruments are used to create a relationship in which changes to the value of the assets, liabilities or anticipated transactions exposed to market risks are expected to be offset by changes in the value of these derivative instruments.
current accounting guidance requires us to recognize all derivatives on the balance sheet at their fair value, except for derivatives that qualify for and are designated as normal purchases and normal sales contracts.
assumptions and approach used: in general, the fair value of our derivative instruments is determined primarily by end of day clearing market prices from an exchange, such as the new york mercantile exchange, intercontinental exchange and nodal exchange, or auction prices. fair values of other energy contracts may be based on broker quotes.
for a small number of contracts where limited observable inputs or pricing information are available, modeling techniques are employed in determination of their fair value using assumptions reflective of contractual terms, current market rates, forward price curves, discount rates and risk factors, as applicable.
for our wholesale energy business, many of the forward sale, forward purchase, option and other contracts are derivative instruments that hedge commodity price risk, but do not meet the requirements for, or are not designated as, either cash flow or fair value hedge accounting. the changes in value of such derivative contracts are marked to market through earnings as the related commodity prices fluctuate. as a result, our earnings may experience significant fluctuations depending on the volatility of commodity prices.
effect if different assumptions used: any significant changes to the fair market values of our derivatives instruments could result in a material change in the value of the assets or liabilities recorded on our consolidated balance sheets and could result in a material change to the unrealized gains or losses recorded in our consolidated statements of operations.
for additional information regarding derivative financial instruments, see item 8. note 1. organization, basis of presentation and summary of significant accounting policies, note 18. financial risk management activities and note 19. fair value measurements.
long-lived assets management evaluates long-lived assets for impairment and reassesses the reasonableness of their related estimated useful lives whenever events or changes in circumstances warrant assessment. such events or changes in circumstances may be as a result of significant adverse changes in regulation, business climate, counterparty credit worthiness, market conditions, or a determination that it is more-likely-than-not that an asset or asset group will be sold or retired before the end of its estimated useful life.
assumptions and approach used: in the event certain triggers exist indicating an asset/asset group may not be recoverable, an undiscounted cash flow test is performed to determine if an impairment exists. when the carrying value of a long-lived asset/asset group exceeds the undiscounted estimate of future cash flows associated with the asset/asset group, an impairment may exist to the extent that the fair value of the asset/asset group is less than its carrying amount.
for pseg, cash flows for long-lived assets and asset groups are determined at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities. the cash flows from the generation units are evaluated at the iso regional portfolio level and, effective in august 2021 for pjm assets, do not include pseg's fossil generating assets as they are classified as held for sale. in certain cases, generation assets are evaluated on an individual basis where those assets are individually contracted on a long-term basis with a third party and operations are independent of other generation assets such as pseg power's kalaeloa facility. these tests require significant estimates and judgment when developing expected future cash flows. significant inputs include, but are not limited to, forward power prices (including zec payments for the new jersey nuclear assets), fuel costs, dispatch rates, other operating and capital expenditures, the cost of borrowing and asset sale prices and probabilities associated with any potential sale prior to the end of the estimated useful life or the early retirement of assets. the assumptions used by management incorporate inherent uncertainties that are at times difficult to predict and could result in impairment charges or accelerated depreciation in future periods if actual results materially differ from the estimated assumptions utilized in our forecasts.
in addition, long-lived assets are depreciated under the straight-line method based on estimated useful lives. an asset's operating useful life is generally based upon operational experience with similar asset types and other non-operational factors. in the ordinary course, management, together with an asset's co-owners in the case of certain of our jointly-owned assets, makes a number of decisions that impact the operation of our generation assets beyond the current year. these decisions may have a direct impact on the estimated remaining useful lives of our assets and will be influenced by the financial outlook of the assets, including future market conditions such as forward energy and capacity prices, operating and capital investment costs and any state or federal legislation and regulations, among other items.
effect if different assumptions used: the above cash flow tests, and fair value estimates and estimated remaining useful lives may be impacted by a change in the assumptions noted above and could significantly impact the outcome, triggering additional impairment tests, write-offs or accelerated depreciation. for additional information on the potential impacts on our future financial statements that may be caused by a change in the assumptions noted above, see item 8. note 4. early plant retirements/asset dispositions and impairments.
asset retirement obligations (aro)
pse&g, pseg power and services recognize liabilities for the expected cost of retiring long-lived assets for which a legal obligation exists. these aros are recorded at fair value in the period in which they are incurred and are capitalized as part of the carrying amount of the related long-lived assets. pse&g, as a rate-regulated entity, recognizes regulatory assets or liabilities as a result of timing differences between the recording of costs and costs recovered through the rate-making process. we accrete the aro liability to reflect the passage of time with the corresponding expense recorded in o&m expense.
assumptions and approach used: because quoted market prices are not available for aros, we estimate the initial fair value of an aro by calculating discounted cash flows that are dependent upon various assumptions, including:
•estimation of dates for retirement, which can be dependent on environmental and other legislation,
•amounts and timing of future cash expenditures associated with retirement, settlement or remediation activities,
•discount rates,
•cost escalation rates,
•market risk premium,
•inflation rates, and
•if applicable, past experience with government regulators regarding similar obligations.
we obtain updated nuclear decommissioning cost studies triennially unless new information necessitates more frequent updates. the most recent cost study was done in 2021. when we revise any assumptions used to calculate fair values of existing aros, we adjust the aro balance and corresponding long-lived asset which generally impacts the amount of accretion and depreciation expense recognized in future periods.
nuclear decommissioning aros aros related to the future decommissioning of pseg power's nuclear facilities comprised more than 75% or $1,201 million of pseg's total aros as of december 31, 2021. pseg power determines its aros for its nuclear units by assigning probability weighting to various discounted cash flow outcomes for each of its nuclear units that incorporate the assumptions above as well as:
•financial feasibility and impacts on potential early shutdown,
•license renewals,
•safstor alternative, which assumes the nuclear facility can be safely stored and subsequently decommissioned in a period within 60 years after operations,
•decon alternative, which assumes decommissioning activities begin after operations, and
•recovery from the federal government of assumed specific costs incurred for spent nuclear fuel.
effect if different assumptions used: changes in the assumptions could result in a material change in the aro balance sheet obligation and the period over which we accrete to the ultimate liability. as of december 31, 2021, assumed market discount rates were historically low; therefore, changes in assumptions may have a more significant impact on the recorded aro. had the following assumptions been applied, our estimates of the approximate impacts on the nuclear aro as of december 31, 2021 are as follows:
•a decrease of 1% in the discount rate would result in a $130 million increase in the nuclear aro.
•an increase of 1% in the inflation rate would result in a $1,321 million increase in the nuclear aro.
•if the federal government were to discontinue reimbursing us for assumed specific spent fuel costs as prescribed under the nuclear waste policy act, the nuclear aro would increase by $339 million.
•if we would elect or be required to decommission under a decon alternative at salem and hope creek, the nuclear aro would increase by $1,020 million.
•if pseg power were to increase its early shutdown probability to 100% and retire salem 1 and hope creek starting in 2025 and salem 2 in 2026, which is significantly earlier than the end of their current license periods, the nuclear aro would increase by $698 million. for additional information, see item 8. note 4. early plant retirements/asset dispositions and impairments.
accounting for regulated businesses pse&g prepares its financial statements to comply with gaap for rate-regulated enterprises, which differs in some respects from accounting for non-regulated businesses. in general, accounting for rate-regulated enterprises should reflect the economic effects of regulation. as a result, a regulated utility is required to defer the recognition of costs (regulatory asset) or recognize obligations (regulatory liability) if the rates established are designed to recover the costs and if the competitive environment makes it probable that such rates can be charged or collected. this accounting results in the recognition of revenues and expenses in different time periods than that of enterprises that are not regulated.
assumptions and approach used: pse&g recognizes regulatory assets where it is probable that such costs will be recoverable in future rates from customers and regulatory liabilities where it is probable that refunds will be made to customers in future billings. the highest degree of probability is an order from the bpu either approving recovery of the deferred costs over a future period or requiring the refund of a liability over a future period.
virtually all of pse&g's regulatory assets and regulatory liabilities are supported by bpu orders. in the absence of an order, pse&g will consider the following when determining whether to record a regulatory asset or liability:
•past experience regarding similar items with the bpu,
•treatment of a similar item in an order by the bpu for another utility,
•passage of new legislation, and
•recent discussions with the bpu.
all deferred costs are subject to prudence reviews by the bpu. when the recovery of a regulatory asset or payment of a regulatory liability is no longer probable, pse&g charges or credits earnings, as appropriate.
effect if different assumptions used: a change in the above assumptions may result in a material impact on our results of operations or our cash flows. see item 8. note 7. regulatory assets and liabilities for a description of the amounts and nature of regulatory balance sheet amounts.

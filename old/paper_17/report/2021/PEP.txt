item 1a. risk factors.
the following risks, some of which have occurred and any of which may occur in the future, can have a material adverse effect on our business or financial performance, which in turn can affect the price of our publicly traded securities. these are not the only risks we face. there may be other risks we are not currently aware of or that we currently deem not to be material but that may become material in the future.
business risks the impact of covid-19 continues to create considerable uncertainty for our business.
our global operations continue to expose us to risks associated with the covid-19 pandemic. numerous measures have been implemented around the world to try to reduce the spread of the virus and these measures have impacted and continue to impact us, our business partners and consumers.
table of contents we have seen and could continue to see changes in consumer demand as a result of covid-19, including the inability of consumers to purchase our products due to illness, quarantine or other restrictions, store closures, or financial hardship. we also have seen and could continue to see shifts in product and channel preferences, including an increase in demand in the e-commerce channel, which has impacted and could continue to impact our sales and profitability. reduced demand for our products or changes in consumer purchasing patterns, as well as continued economic uncertainty, can adversely affect our customers' financial condition, which can result in bankruptcy filings and/or an inability to pay for our products. in addition, we may also continue to experience business disruptions as a result of covid-19, resulting from temporary closures of our facilities or facilities of our business partners or the inability of a significant portion of our or our business partners' workforce to work because of illness, absenteeism, quarantine, vaccine mandates, or travel or other governmental restrictions. in addition, we and our business partners may also continue to see adverse impacts to our supply chain as a result of covid-19 through raw material, packaging or other supply shortages, labor shortages or reduced availability of air or other commercial transport, port congestion and closures or border restrictions, any of which can impact our business. any sustained interruption in our or our business partners' operations, distribution network or supply chain or any significant continuous shortage of raw materials, packaging or other supplies can negatively impact our business. we have also incurred, and could continue to incur, increased employee and operating costs as a result of covid-19, such as costs related to expanded benefits and frontline incentives, the provision of personal protective equipment and increased sanitation, allowances for credit losses, upfront payment reserves and inventory write-offs, and cost inflation in commodities, packaging, transportation and other input costs, which have negatively impacted and may continue to negatively impact our profitability. in addition, the increase in certain of our employees working remotely has resulted in increased demand on our information technology infrastructure, which can be subject to failure, disruption or unavailability, and increased vulnerability to cyberattacks and other cyber incidents. also, continued economic uncertainty associated with the covid-19 pandemic has resulted in volatility in the global capital and credit markets which can impair our ability to access these markets on terms commercially acceptable to us, or at all.
the impact of covid-19 has heightened, or in some cases manifested, certain of the other risks discussed below. the extent of the impact of the covid-19 pandemic on our business remains uncertain and will continue to depend on numerous evolving factors that we are not able to accurately predict and which will vary by jurisdiction and market, including the duration and scope of the pandemic, the emergence and spread of new variants of the virus, including the omicron and delta variants, the development and availability of effective treatments and vaccines, the speed at which vaccines are administered, the efficacy of vaccines against the virus and evolving strains or variants of the virus, global economic conditions during and after the pandemic, governmental actions that have been taken, or may be taken in the future, in response to the pandemic, and changes in consumer behavior in response to the pandemic, some of which may be more than just temporary.
reduction in future demand for our products would adversely affect our business.
demand for our products depends in part on our ability to innovate and anticipate and effectively respond to shifts in consumer trends and preferences, including the types of products our consumers want and how they browse for, purchase and consume them. consumer preferences continuously evolve due to a variety of factors, including: changes in consumer demographics, consumption patterns and channel preferences (including continued increases in the e-commerce and online-to-offline channels); pricing; product quality; concerns or perceptions regarding packaging and its environmental impact (such as single-use and other plastic packaging); and concerns or perceptions regarding the nutrition profile and health effects of, or location of origin of, ingredients or substances in our products or packaging, including due to the results of third-party studies (whether or not scientifically valid). concerns with any of the foregoing could lead consumers to reduce or publicly boycott the purchase or consumption of our products. consumer table of contents preferences are also influenced by perception of our brand image or the brand images of our products, the success of our advertising and marketing campaigns, our ability to engage with our consumers in the manner they prefer, including through the use of digital media or assets, and the perception of our use, and the use of social media. these and other factors have reduced in the past and could continue to reduce consumers' willingness to purchase certain of our products. any inability on our part to anticipate or react to changes in consumer preferences and trends, or make the right strategic investments to do so, including investments in data analytics to understand consumer trends, can lead to reduced demand for our products, lead to inventory write-offs or erode our competitive and financial position, thereby adversely affecting our business. in addition, our business operations, including our supply chain, are subject to disruption by natural disasters or other events beyond our control that could negatively impact product availability and decrease demand for our products if our crisis management plans do not effectively resolve these issues.
damage to our reputation or brand image can adversely affect our business.
maintaining a positive reputation globally is critical to selling our products. our reputation or brand image has in the past been, and could in the future be, adversely impacted by a variety of factors, including: any failure by us or our business partners to maintain high ethical, business and environmental, social and governance practices, including with respect to human rights, child labor laws, diversity, equity and inclusion, workplace conditions and employee health and safety; any failure to achieve our environmental, social and governance goals, including with respect to the nutrition profile of our products, diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives, packaging, water use and our impact on the environment; any failure to address health concerns about our products, products we distribute, or particular ingredients in our products, including concerns regarding whether certain of our products contribute to obesity or an increase in public health costs; our research and development efforts; any product quality or safety issues, including the recall of any of our products; any failure to comply with laws and regulations; consumer perception of our advertising campaigns, sponsorship arrangements, marketing programs, use of social media and our response to political and social issues or catastrophic events; or any failure to effectively respond to negative or inaccurate comments about us on social media or otherwise regarding any of the foregoing. damage to our reputation or brand image has in the past and could in the future decrease demand for our products, thereby adversely affecting our business.
product recalls or other issues or concerns with respect to product quality and safety can adversely affect our business.
we have and could in the future recall products due to product quality or safety issues, including actual or alleged mislabeling, misbranding, spoilage, undeclared allergens, adulteration or contamination. product recalls have in the past and could in the future adversely affect our business by resulting in losses due to their cost, the destruction of product inventory or lost sales due to any unavailability of the product for a period of time. in addition, product quality or safety issues, whether as a result of failure to comply with food safety laws or otherwise, have in the past and could in the future also reduce consumer confidence and demand for our products, cause production and delivery disruptions, and result in increased costs (including payment of fines and/or judgments) and damage our reputation, particularly as we expand into new categories, such as nuts and meat convenient foods globally and the distribution of alcoholic beverages in the united states, all of which can adversely affect our business. failure to maintain adequate oversight over product quality or safety can result in product recalls, litigation, government investigations or inquiries or civil or criminal proceedings, all of which may result in fines, penalties, damages or criminal liability. our business can also be adversely affected if consumers lose confidence in product quality, safety and integrity generally, even if such loss of confidence is unrelated to products in our portfolio.
table of contents any inability to compete effectively can adversely affect our business.
our products compete against products of international beverage and convenient food companies that, like us, operate in multiple geographies, as well as regional, local and private label and economy brand manufacturers and other competitors, including smaller companies developing and selling micro brands directly to consumers through e-commerce platforms or through retailers focused on locally sourced products. in many countries in which our products are sold, including the united states, the coca-cola company is our primary beverage competitor. our products compete primarily on the basis of brand recognition and loyalty, taste, price, value, quality, product variety, innovation, distribution, advertising, marketing and promotional activity, packaging, convenience, service and the ability to anticipate and effectively respond to consumer preferences and trends. our business can be adversely affected if we are unable to effectively promote or develop our existing products or introduce and effectively market new products, if we are unable to effectively adopt new technologies, including artificial intelligence and data analytics to develop new commercial insights and improve operating efficiencies, if we are unable to continuously strengthen and evolve our capabilities in digital marketing, if our competitors spend more aggressively than we do or if we are otherwise unable to effectively respond to supply disruptions, pricing pressure (including as a result of commodity inflation) or otherwise compete effectively, and we may be unable to grow or maintain sales or category share or we may need to increase capital, marketing or other expenditures.
failure to attract, develop and maintain a highly skilled and diverse workforce can have an adverse effect on our business.
our business requires that we attract, develop and maintain a highly skilled and diverse workforce. our employees are highly sought after by our competitors and other companies and our continued ability to compete effectively depends on our ability to attract, retain, develop and motivate highly skilled personnel for all areas of our organization. any unplanned turnover, sustained labor shortage or unsuccessful implementation of our succession plans to backfill current leadership positions, including the chief executive officer, or failure to attract, develop and maintain a highly skilled and diverse workforce, including with key capabilities such as e-commerce and digital marketing and data analytic skills, can deplete our institutional knowledge base, erode our competitive advantage or result in increased costs due to increased competition for employees, higher employee turnover or increased employee benefit costs. in addition, failure to attract, retain and develop associates from underrepresented communities can damage our business results and our reputation. any of the foregoing can adversely affect our business.
water scarcity can adversely affect our business.
we and our business partners use water in the manufacturing and sourcing of our products. water is also essential to the production of the raw materials needed in our manufacturing process. lack of available water of acceptable quality, increasing focus by governmental and non-governmental organizations, investors, customers and consumers on water scarcity and increasing pressure to conserve and replenish water in areas of scarcity and stress, including due to the effects of climate change, may lead to: supply chain disruption; adverse effects on our operations or the operations of our business partners; higher compliance costs; capital expenditures (including investments in the development of technologies to enhance water efficiency and reduce consumption); higher production costs, including less favorable pricing for water; the interruption or cessation of operations at, or relocation of, our facilities or the facilities of our business partners; failure to achieve our goals relating to water use; perception of our failure to act responsibly with respect to water use or to effectively respond to legal or regulatory requirements concerning water scarcity; or damage to our reputation, any of which can adversely affect our business.
table of contents changes in the retail landscape or in sales to any key customer can adversely affect our business.
the retail landscape continues to evolve, including continued growth in e-commerce channels and hard discounters. our business will be adversely affected if we are unable to maintain and develop successful relationships with e-commerce retailers and hard discounters, while also maintaining relationships with our key customers operating in traditional retail channels (many of whom are also focused on increasing their e-commerce sales). our business can be adversely affected if e-commerce channels and hard discounters take significant additional market share away from traditional retailers or we fail to find ways to create increasingly better digital tools and capabilities for our retail customers to enable them to grow their businesses. in addition, our business can be adversely affected if we are unable to profitably expand our own direct-to-consumer e-commerce capabilities. the retail industry is also impacted by increased consolidation of ownership and purchasing power, particularly in north america, europe and latin america, resulting in large retailers or buying groups with increased purchasing power, impacting our ability to compete in these areas. consolidation also adversely impacts our smaller customers' ability to compete effectively, resulting in an inability on their part to pay for our products or reduced or canceled orders of our products. further, we must maintain mutually beneficial relationships with our key customers, including walmart, to compete effectively. any inability to resolve a significant dispute with any of our key customers, a change in the business condition (financial or otherwise) of any of our key customers, even if unrelated to us, a significant reduction in sales to any key customer, or the loss of any of our key customers can adversely affect our business.
disruption of our manufacturing operations or supply chain, including increased commodity, packaging, transportation, labor and other input costs, can adversely affect our business.
we have experienced and could continue to experience disruption in our manufacturing operations and supply chain. many of the raw materials and supplies used in the production of our products are sourced from countries experiencing civil unrest, political instability or unfavorable economic conditions. some raw materials and supplies, including packaging materials, are available only from a limited number of suppliers or from a sole supplier or are in short supply when seasonal demand is at its peak. there can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain favorable arrangements and relationships with suppliers or that our contingency plans will be effective to prevent disruptions that may arise from shortages or discontinuation of any raw materials and other supplies that we use in the manufacture, production and distribution of our products. any sustained or significant disruption to the manufacturing or sourcing of products or materials could increase our costs and interrupt product supply, which can adversely impact our business.
the raw materials and other supplies, including agricultural commodities, fuel and packaging materials, such as recycled pet, transportation, labor and other supply chain inputs that we use for the manufacturing, production and distribution of our products are subject to price volatility and fluctuations in availability caused by many factors, including changes in supply and demand, supplier capacity constraints, inflation, weather conditions (including potential effects of climate change), fire, natural disasters, disease or pests (including the impact of greening disease on the citrus industry), agricultural uncertainty, health epidemics or pandemics or other contagious outbreaks (including covid-19), labor shortages (including the lack of availability of truck drivers or as a result of covid-19), strikes or work stoppages, governmental incentives and controls (including import/export restrictions, such as new or increased tariffs, sanctions, quotas or trade barriers), port congestions or delays, transport capacity constraints, cybersecurity incidents or other disruptions, loss or impairment of key manufacturing sites, political uncertainties, acts of terrorism, governmental instability or currency exchange rates. many of our raw materials and supplies are purchased in the open market and the prices we pay for such items are subject to fluctuation. we experienced higher than anticipated commodity, packaging and transportation costs during 2021, which may continue. when input prices increase unexpectedly or significantly, we may table of contents be unwilling or unable to increase our product prices or unable to effectively hedge against price increases to offset these increased costs without suffering reduced volume, revenue, margins and operating results.
political and social conditions can adversely affect our business.
political and social conditions in the markets in which our products are sold have been and could continue to be difficult to predict, resulting in adverse effects on our business. the results of elections, referendums or other political conditions (including government shutdowns or hostilities between countries) in these markets have in the past and could continue to impact how existing laws, regulations and government programs or policies are implemented or result in uncertainty as to how such laws, regulations, programs or policies may change, including with respect to tariffs, sanctions, environmental and climate change regulations, taxes, benefit programs, the movement of goods, services and people between countries, relationships between countries, customer or consumer perception of a particular country or its government and other matters, and has resulted in and could continue to result in exchange rate fluctuation, volatility in global stock markets and global economic uncertainty or adversely affect demand for our products, any of which can adversely affect our business. in addition, political and social conditions in certain cities throughout the u.s. as well as globally have resulted in demonstrations and protests, including in connection with political elections and civil rights and liberties. our operations, including the distribution of our products and the ingredients or other raw materials used in the production of our products, may be disrupted if such events persist for a prolonged period of time, including due to actions taken by governmental authorities in affected cities and regions, which can adversely affect our business.
our business can be adversely affected if we are unable to grow in developing and emerging markets.
our success depends in part on our ability to grow our business in developing and emerging markets, including mexico, russia, the middle east, china, south africa, brazil and india. there can be no assurance that our products will be accepted or be successful in any particular developing or emerging market, due to competition, price, cultural differences, consumer preferences, method of distribution or otherwise. our business in these markets has been and could continue in the future to be impacted by economic, political and social conditions; acts of war, terrorist acts, and civil unrest, including demonstrations and protests; competition; tariffs, sanctions or other regulations restricting contact with certain countries in these markets; foreign ownership restrictions; nationalization of our assets or the assets of our business partners; government-mandated closure, or threatened closure, of our operations or the operations of our business partners; restrictions on the import or export of our products or ingredients or substances used in our products; highly inflationary economies; devaluation or fluctuation or demonetization of currency; regulations on the transfer of funds to and from foreign countries, currency controls or other currency exchange restrictions, which result in significant cash balances in foreign countries, from time to time, or can significantly affect our ability to effectively manage our operations in certain of these markets and can result in the deconsolidation of such businesses; the lack of well-established or reliable legal systems; increased costs of doing business due to compliance with complex foreign and u.s. laws and regulations that apply to our international operations, including the foreign corrupt practices act, the u.k. bribery act and the trade sanctions reform and export enhancement act; and adverse consequences, such as the assessment of fines or penalties, for any failure to comply with laws and regulations. our business can be adversely affected if we are unable to expand our business in developing and emerging markets, effectively operate, or manage the risks associated with operating, in these markets, or achieve the return on capital we expect from our investments in these markets.
changes in economic conditions can adversely impact our business.
many of the jurisdictions in which our products are sold have experienced and could continue to experience uncertain or unfavorable economic conditions, such as recessions or economic slowdowns, table of contents which have and could continue to result in adverse changes in interest rates, tax laws or tax rates; inflation; volatile commodity markets; labor shortages; highly inflationary economies, devaluation, fluctuation or demonetization of currency; contraction in the availability of credit; austerity or stimulus measures; the effects of any default by or deterioration in the creditworthiness of the countries in which our products are sold; or a decrease in the fair value of pension or post-retirement assets that could increase future employee benefit costs and/or funding requirements of our pension or post-retirement plans. in addition, we cannot predict how current or future economic conditions will affect our business partners, including financial institutions with whom we do business, and any negative impact on any of the foregoing may also have an adverse impact on our business.
future cyber incidents and other disruptions to our information systems can adversely affect our business.
we depend on information systems and technology, including public websites and cloud-based services, for many activities important to our business, including communications within our company, interfacing with customers and consumers; ordering and managing inventory; managing and operating our facilities; protecting confidential information, including personal data we collect; maintaining accurate financial records and complying with regulatory, financial reporting, legal and tax requirements. our business has in the past and could in the future be negatively affected by system shutdowns, degraded systems performance, systems disruptions or security incidents. these disruptions or incidents may be caused by cyberattacks and other cyber incidents, network or power outages, software, equipment or telecommunications failures, the unintentional or malicious actions of employees or contractors, natural disasters, fires or other catastrophic events. cyberattacks and other cyber incidents are occurring more frequently, the techniques used to gain access to information technology systems and data, disable or degrade service or sabotage systems are constantly evolving and becoming more sophisticated in nature and are being carried out by groups and individuals with a wide range of expertise and motives. cyberattacks and cyber incidents may be difficult to detect for periods of time and take many forms including cyber extortion, denial of service, social engineering, introduction of viruses or malware (such as ransomware), exploiting vulnerabilities in hardware, software or other infrastructure, hacking, website defacement or theft of passwords and other credentials, unauthorized use of computing resources for digital currency mining and business email compromise. as with other global companies, we are regularly subject to cyberattacks and other cyber incidents, including the types of attacks and incidents described above. if we do not allocate and effectively manage the resources necessary to continue building and maintaining our information technology infrastructure, or if we fail to timely identify or appropriately respond to cyberattacks or other cyber incidents, our business has been and can continue to be adversely affected, which has resulted in and can continue to result in some or all of the following: transaction errors, processing inefficiencies, inability to access our data or systems, lost revenues or other costs resulting from disruptions or shutdowns of offices, plants, warehouses, distribution centers or other facilities, intellectual property or other data loss, litigation, claims, legal or regulatory proceedings, inquiries or investigations, fines or penalties, remediation costs, damage to our reputation or a negative impact on employee morale and the loss of current or potential customers.
similar risks exist with respect to third-party providers, including suppliers, software and cloud-based service providers, that we rely upon for aspects of our information technology support services and administrative functions, including payroll processing, health and benefit plan administration and certain finance and accounting functions, and the systems managed, hosted, provided and/or used by such third parties and their vendors. for example, malicious actors have employed and could continue to employ the information technology supply chain to introduce malware through software updates or compromised supplier accounts or hardware. the need to coordinate with various third-party service providers, including with respect to timely notification and access to personnel and information concerning an incident, may complicate our efforts to resolve issues that arise. as a result, we are subject to the risk that table of contents the activities associated with our third-party service providers can adversely affect our business even if the attack or breach does not directly impact our systems or information.
although the cyber incidents and other systems disruptions that we have experienced to date have not had a material effect on our business, such incidents or disruptions could have a material adverse effect on us in the future. while we devote significant resources to network security, disaster recovery, employee training and other measures to secure our information technology systems and prevent unauthorized access to or loss of data, there are no guarantees that they will be adequate to safeguard against all cyber incidents, systems disruptions, system compromises or misuses of data. in addition, while we currently maintain insurance coverage that, subject to its terms and conditions, is intended to address costs associated with certain aspects of cyber incidents and information systems failures, this insurance coverage may not, depending on the specific facts and circumstances surrounding an incident, cover all losses or all types of claims that arise from an incident, or the damage to our reputation or brands that may result from an incident.
failure to successfully complete or manage strategic transactions can adversely affect our business.
we regularly review our portfolio of businesses and evaluate potential acquisitions, joint ventures, distribution agreements, divestitures, refranchisings and other strategic transactions. the success of these transactions, including the recent completion of the juice transaction, is dependent upon, among other things, our ability to realize the full extent of the expected returns, benefits, cost savings or synergies as a result of a transaction, within the anticipated time frame, or at all; and receipt of necessary consents, clearances and approvals. risks associated with strategic transactions include integrating manufacturing, distribution, sales, accounting, financial reporting and administrative support activities and information technology systems with our company or difficulties separating such personnel, activities and systems in connection with divestitures; operating through new business models or in new categories or territories; motivating, recruiting and retaining executives and key employees; conforming controls (including internal control over financial reporting and disclosure controls and procedures) and policies (including with respect to environmental compliance, health and safety compliance and compliance with anti-bribery laws); retaining existing customers and consumers and attracting new customers and consumers; managing tax costs or inefficiencies; maintaining good relations with divested or refranchised businesses in our supply or sales chain; inability to offset loss of revenue associated with divested brands or businesses; managing the impact of business decisions or other actions or omissions of our joint venture partners that may have different interests than we do; and other unanticipated problems or liabilities, such as contingent liabilities and litigation. strategic transactions that are not successfully completed or managed effectively, or our failure to effectively manage the risks associated with such transactions, have in the past and could continue to result in adverse effects on our business.
our reliance on third-party service providers and enterprise-wide systems can have an adverse effect on our business.
we rely on third-party service providers, including cloud data service providers, for certain areas of our business, including payroll processing, health and benefit plan administration and certain finance and accounting functions. failure by these third parties to meet their contractual, regulatory and other obligations to us, or our failure to adequately monitor their performance, has in the past and could continue to result in our inability to achieve the expected cost savings or efficiencies and result in additional costs to correct errors made by such service providers. depending on the function involved, such errors can also lead to business disruption, systems performance degradation, processing inefficiencies or other systems disruptions, the loss of or damage to intellectual property or sensitive data through security breaches or otherwise, incorrect or adverse effects on financial reporting, litigation, claims, legal or regulatory proceedings, inquiries or investigations, fines or penalties, remediation costs, table of contents damage to our reputation or have a negative impact on employee morale, all of which can adversely affect our business.
in addition, we continue on our multi-year phased business transformation initiative to migrate certain of our systems, including our financial processing systems, to enterprise-wide systems solutions and have begun to roll out these systems in certain countries and divisions. we have experienced and could continue to experience systems outages and operating inefficiencies following these planned implementations. in addition, if we do not continue to allocate and effectively manage the resources necessary to build and sustain the proper information technology infrastructure, or if we fail to achieve the expected benefits from this initiative, our business could be adversely affected.
climate change or measures to address climate change can negatively affect our business or damage our reputation.
climate change may have a negative effect on agricultural productivity which may result in decreased availability or less favorable pricing for certain commodities that are necessary for our products, such as potatoes, sugar cane, corn, wheat, rice, oats, oranges and other fruits (and fruit-derived oils). in addition, climate change may also increase the frequency or severity of natural disasters and other extreme weather conditions (including rising temperatures and drought), which could pose physical risks to our facilities, impair our production capabilities, disrupt our supply chain or impact demand for our products. also, there is an increased focus in many jurisdictions in which our products are made, manufactured, distributed or sold regarding environmental policies relating to climate change, regulating greenhouse gas emissions, energy policies and sustainability, including single-use plastics. this increased focus may result in new or increased legal and regulatory requirements, such as potential carbon pricing programs, which could result in significant increased costs and require additional investments in facilities and equipment. as a result, the effects of climate change can negatively affect our business and operations. in addition, any failure to achieve our goals with respect to reducing our impact on the environment or perception of a failure to act responsibly with respect to the environment or to effectively respond to regulatory requirements concerning climate change can lead to adverse publicity, which could adversely affect demand for our products or damage our reputation. any of the foregoing can adversely affect our business.
strikes or work stoppages can cause our business to suffer.
many of our employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements, and other employees may seek to be covered by collective bargaining agreements. strikes or work stoppages or other business interruptions have occurred and may occur in the future if we are unable to renew, or enter into new, collective bargaining agreements on satisfactory terms and can impair manufacturing and distribution of our products, lead to a loss of sales, increase our costs or otherwise affect our ability to fully implement future operational changes to enhance our efficiency or to adapt to changing business needs or strategy, all of which can adversely affect our business.
financial risks failure to realize benefits from our productivity initiatives can adversely affect our financial performance.
our future growth depends, in part, on our ability to continue to reduce costs and improve efficiencies, including our multi-year phased implementation of shared business service organizational models. we continue to identify and implement productivity initiatives that we believe will position our business for long-term sustainable growth by allowing us to achieve a lower cost structure, improve decision-making and operate more efficiently. some of these measures result in unintended consequences, such as business disruptions, distraction of management and employees, reduced morale and productivity, unexpected table of contents employee attrition, an inability to attract or retain key personnel and negative publicity. if we are unable to successfully implement our productivity initiatives as planned or do not achieve expected savings as a result of these initiatives, we may not realize all or any of the anticipated benefits, resulting in adverse effects on our financial performance.
a deterioration in our estimates and underlying assumptions regarding the future performance of our business can result in an impairment charge that can adversely affect our results of operations.
we conduct impairment tests on our goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets annually or more frequently if circumstances indicate that impairment may have occurred. in addition, amortizable intangible assets, property, plant and equipment and other long-lived assets are evaluated for impairment upon a significant change in the operating or macroeconomic environment. a deterioration in our underlying assumptions regarding the impact of competitive operating conditions, macroeconomic conditions or other factors used to estimate the future performance of any of our reporting units or assets, including any deterioration in the weighted-average cost of capital based on market data available at the time, can result in an impairment charge, which can adversely affect our results of operations.
fluctuations in exchange rates impact our financial performance.
because our consolidated financial statements are presented in u.s. dollars, the financial statements of our subsidiaries outside the united states, where the functional currency is other than the u.s. dollar, are translated into u.s. dollars. given our global operations, we also pay for the ingredients, raw materials and commodities used in our business in numerous currencies. fluctuations in exchange rates, including as a result of inflation, central bank monetary policies, currency controls or other currency exchange restrictions have had, and could continue to have, an adverse impact on our financial performance.
our borrowing costs and access to capital and credit markets can be adversely affected by a downgrade or potential downgrade of our credit ratings.
rating agencies routinely evaluate us and their ratings are based on a number of factors, including our cash generating capability, levels of indebtedness, policies with respect to shareholder distributions and our financial strength generally, as well as factors beyond our control, such as the state of the economy and our industry. we expect to maintain tier 1 commercial paper access, which we believe will facilitate appropriate financial flexibility and ready access to global credit markets at favorable interest rates. any downgrade or announcement that we are under review for a potential downgrade of our credit ratings, especially any downgrade to below investment grade, can increase our future borrowing costs, impair our ability to access capital and credit markets on terms commercially acceptable to us or at all, result in a reduction in our liquidity, or impair our ability to access the commercial paper market with the same flexibility that we have experienced historically (and therefore require us to rely more heavily on more expensive types of debt financing), all of which can adversely affect our financial performance.
legal, tax and regulatory risks taxes aimed at our products can adversely affect our business or financial performance.
certain jurisdictions in which our products are sold have either imposed, or are considering imposing, new or increased taxes on the manufacture, distribution or sale of certain of our products, particularly our beverages, as a result of the ingredients or substances contained in our products. these taxes vary in scope and form: some apply to all beverages, including non-caloric beverages, while others apply only to beverages with a caloric sweetener (e.g., sugar). similarly, some measures apply a single tax rate per ounce/liter on beverages containing over a certain amount of added sugar (or other sweetener), some apply a graduated tax rate depending upon the amount of added sugar (or other sweetener) in the beverage and others apply a flat tax rate on beverages containing any amount of added sugar (or other sweetener). for example, certain provinces in canada enacted a flat tax on all sugar-sweetened beverages, effective table of contents september 1, 2022, at a rate of 0.20 canadian dollars (0.16 u.s. dollars) per liter. these tax measures, whatever their scope or form, have in the past and could continue to increase the cost of certain of our products, reduce overall consumption of our products or lead to negative publicity, resulting in an adverse effect on our business and financial performance.
limitations on the marketing or sale of our products can adversely affect our business and financial performance.
certain jurisdictions in which our products are sold have either imposed, or are considering imposing, limitations on the marketing or sale of our products as a result of ingredients or substances in our products. these limitations require that we highlight perceived concerns about a product, warn consumers to avoid consumption of certain ingredients or substances present in our products, restrict the age of consumers to whom products are marketed or sold or limit the location in which our products may be available. for example, argentina and colombia enacted warning labeling requirements in 2021 to indicate whether a particular pre-packaged food or beverage product is considered to be high in sugar, sodium or saturated fat. certain jurisdictions have imposed or are considering imposing color-coded labeling requirements where colors such as red, yellow and green are used to indicate various levels of a particular ingredient, such as sugar, sodium or saturated fat, in products. the imposition or proposed imposition of additional limitations on the marketing or sale of our products has in the past and could continue to reduce overall consumption of our products, lead to negative publicity or leave consumers with the perception that our products do not meet their health and wellness needs, resulting in an adverse effect on our business and financial performance.
laws and regulations related to the use or disposal of plastics or other packaging materials can adversely affect our business and financial performance.
we rely on diverse packaging solutions to safely deliver products to our customers and consumers. certain of our products are sold in packaging designed to be recyclable or commercially compostable. however, not all packaging is recycled, whether due to lack of infrastructure or otherwise, and certain of our packaging is not currently recyclable. packaging waste not properly disposed of that displays one or more of our brands has in the past resulted in and could continue to result in negative publicity, litigation or reduced consumer demand for our products, adversely affecting our financial performance. many jurisdictions in which our products are sold have imposed or are considering imposing regulations or policies intended to encourage the use of sustainable packaging, waste reduction or increased recycling rates or to restrict the sale of products utilizing certain packaging. these regulations vary in form and scope and include extended producer responsibility policies, plastic or packaging taxes, restrictions on certain products and materials, requirements for bottle caps to be tethered to bottles, bans on the use of single-use plastics and requirements to charge deposit fees. for example, the european union, peru and certain states in the united states, among other jurisdictions, have imposed a minimum recycled content requirement for beverage bottle packaging and similar legislation is under consideration in other jurisdictions. these laws and regulations have in the past and could continue to increase the cost of our products, impact demand for our products, result in negative publicity and require us and our business partners, including our independent bottlers, to increase capital expenditures to invest in minimizing the amount of plastic or other materials used in our packaging or to develop alternative packaging, all of which can adversely affect our business and financial performance.
failure to comply with personal data protection and privacy laws can adversely affect our business.
we are subject to a variety of continuously evolving and developing laws and regulations in numerous jurisdictions regarding personal data protection and privacy laws. these laws and regulations may be interpreted and applied differently from country to country or, within the united states, from state to state, and can create inconsistent or conflicting requirements. our efforts to comply with these laws and table of contents regulations, including with respect to data from residents of the european union who are covered by the general data protection regulation or residents of the state of california who are covered by the california consumer privacy act (as modified by the california privacy rights act), impose significant costs and challenges that are likely to continue to increase over time, particularly as additional jurisdictions adopt similar regulations. failure to comply with these laws and regulations or to otherwise protect personal data from unauthorized access, use or other processing, have in the past and could in the future result in litigation, claims, legal or regulatory proceedings, inquiries or investigations, damage to our reputation, fines or penalties, all of which can adversely affect our business.
increases in income tax rates, changes in income tax laws or disagreements with tax authorities can adversely affect our financial performance.
increases in income tax rates or other changes in tax laws, including changes in how existing tax laws are interpreted or enforced, can adversely affect our financial performance. for example, economic and political conditions in countries where we are subject to taxes, including the united states, have in the past and could continue to result in significant changes in tax legislation or regulation, including those proposed and under consideration by the united states congress and the organization for economic co-operation and development. for example, numerous countries have recently agreed to a statement in support of a global minimum tax rate of 15% as well as global profit reallocation. there can be no assurance that these changes will be adopted by individual countries, or that once adopted by individual countries, that they will not have adverse effects on our financial performance. this increasingly complex global tax environment has in the past and could continue to increase tax uncertainty, resulting in higher compliance costs and adverse effects on our financial performance. we are also subject to regular reviews, examinations and audits by numerous taxing authorities with respect to income and non-income based taxes. economic and political pressures to increase tax revenues in jurisdictions in which we operate, or the adoption of new or reformed tax legislation or regulation, has made and could continue to make resolving tax disputes more difficult and the final resolution of tax audits and any related litigation can differ from our historical provisions and accruals, resulting in an adverse effect on our financial performance.
if we are unable to adequately protect our intellectual property rights, or if we are found to infringe on the intellectual property rights of others, our business can be adversely affected.
we possess intellectual property rights that are important to our business, including ingredient formulas, trademarks, copyrights, patents, business processes and other trade secrets. the laws of various jurisdictions in which we operate have differing levels of protection of intellectual property. our competitive position and the value of our products and brands can be reduced and our business adversely affected if we fail to obtain or adequately protect our intellectual property, including our ingredient formulas, or if there is a change in law that limits or removes the current legal protections afforded our intellectual property. also, in the course of developing new products or improving the quality of existing products, we have in the past infringed or been alleged to have infringed, and could in the future infringe or be alleged to infringe, on the intellectual property rights of others. such infringement or allegations of infringement could result in expensive litigation and damages, damage to our reputation, disruption to our operations, injunctions against development, manufacturing, use and/or sale of certain products, inventory write-offs or other limitations on our ability to introduce new products or improve the quality of existing products, resulting in an adverse effect on our business.
failure to comply with laws and regulations applicable to our business can adversely affect our business.
the conduct of our business is subject to numerous laws and regulations relating to the production, storage, distribution, sale, display, advertising, marketing, labeling, content (including whether a product table of contents contains genetically engineered ingredients), quality, safety, transportation, traceability, sourcing (including pesticide use), packaging, disposal, recycling and use of our products or raw materials, employment and occupational health and safety, environmental, social and governance matters (including climate change) and data privacy and protection. in addition, in many jurisdictions, compliance with competition laws is of special importance to us due to our competitive position, as is compliance with anti-corruption laws. the imposition of new laws, changes in laws or regulatory requirements or changing interpretations thereof, and differing or competing regulations and standards across the markets where our products or raw materials are made, manufactured, distributed or sold, have in the past and could continue to result in higher compliance costs, capital expenditures and higher production costs, resulting in adverse effects on our business. for example, increasing governmental and societal attention to environmental, social and governance matters has resulted and could continue to result in new laws or regulatory requirements. in addition, the entry into new markets or categories, including our planned entry into the alcoholic beverage industry as a distributor in the united states and expansion into the nuts and meat convenient foods categories globally, has resulted in and could continue to result in our business being subject to additional regulations resulting in higher compliance costs. if one jurisdiction imposes or proposes to impose new laws or regulations that impact the manufacture, distribution or sale of our products, other jurisdictions may follow. failure to comply with such laws or regulations can subject us to criminal or civil enforcement actions, including fines, injunctions, product recalls, penalties, disgorgement of profits or activity restrictions, all of which can adversely affect our business. in addition, the results of third-party studies (whether or not scientifically valid) purporting to assess the health implications of consumption of certain ingredients or substances present in certain of our products or packaging materials have resulted in and could continue to result in our being subject to new taxes and regulations or lawsuits that can adversely affect our business.
potential liabilities and costs from litigation, claims, legal or regulatory proceedings, inquiries or investigations can have an adverse impact on our business.
we and our subsidiaries are party to a variety of litigation, claims, legal or regulatory proceedings, inquiries and investigations, including but not limited to matters related to our advertising, marketing or commercial practices, product labels, claims and ingredients, personal injury and property damage, intellectual property rights, privacy, employment, tax and insurance matters, environmental, social and governance matters and matters relating to our compliance with applicable laws and regulations. these matters are inherently uncertain and there is no guarantee that we will be successful in defending ourselves or that our assessment of the materiality of these matters and the likely outcome or potential losses and established reserves will be consistent with the ultimate outcome of such matters. responding to these matters, even those that are ultimately non-meritorious, requires us to incur significant expense and devote significant resources, and may generate adverse publicity that damages our reputation or brand image. any of the foregoing can adversely affect our business.

our business executive overview pepsico is a leading global beverage and convenient food company with a complementary portfolio of brands, including lays, doritos, cheetos, gatorade, pepsi-cola, mountain dew, quaker and sodastream. through our operations, authorized bottlers, contract manufacturers and other third parties, we make, market, distribute and sell a wide variety of beverages and convenient foods, serving customers and consumers in more than 200 countries and territories.
as a global company with deep local ties, we faced many of the same challenges in 2021 as our consumers, customers, and competitors across the world, including the second year of the covid-19 pandemic; a worsening climate crisis; supply chain disruptions; inflationary pressures; shifting consumer preferences and behaviors; a highly competitive operating environment; a rapidly changing retail landscape, including the growth in e-commerce; continued macroeconomic and political volatility; and an evolving regulatory landscape.
to meet the challenges of today - and those of tomorrow - we are driven by an approach called pepsico positive (pep+). pep+ is a strategic end-to-end transformation of our business, with sustainability at the center of how the company will strive to create growth and value by operating within planetary boundaries and inspiring positive change for the planet and people. pep+ will guide how we will work to transform our business operations, from sourcing ingredients and making and selling products in a more sustainable way, to leveraging our more than one billion connections with consumers each day to take sustainability mainstream and engage people to make choices that are better for themselves and the planet.
pep+ drives action and progress across three key pillars, bringing together a number of industry-leading 2030 sustainability goals under a comprehensive framework:
•positive agriculture: we are working to spread regenerative practices to restore the earth across land equal to the company's entire agricultural footprint (approximately 7 million acres), sustainably source key crops and ingredients, and improve the livelihoods of more people in our agricultural supply chain.
•positive value chain: we are working to build a circular and inclusive value chain through actions to: achieve net-zero emissions by 2040; become net water positive by 2030; and introduce more sustainable packaging into the value chain. our packaging goals include cutting virgin plastic per serving, using recycled content in our plastic packaging, and scaling our sodastream business globally, an innovative platform that almost entirely eliminates the need for beverage packaging, among other levers. additionally, we are making progress on our diversity, equity and inclusion journey. and we have introduced a new global workforce volunteering program, one smile at a table of contents time, to encourage, support and empower each one of our approximately 309,000 employees to make positive impacts in their local communities.
•positive choices: we continue working to evolve our portfolio of beverage and convenient food products so that they are better for the planet and people, including by incorporating more diverse ingredients in both new and existing food products that are better for the planet and/or deliver nutritional benefits, prioritizing chickpeas, plant-based proteins and whole grains; expanding our position in the nuts & seeds category, where pepsico is already the global branded leader, including leadership positions in mexico, china and several western european markets; and accelerating our reduction of added sugars and sodium through the use of science-based targets across our portfolio and cooking our food offerings with healthier oils. we are also continuing to scale new business models that require little or no single-use packaging, including sodastream - an icon of a positive choice and the largest sparkling water brand in the world by volume. sodastream, already sold in more than 40 countries, and its new sodastream professional platform is expected to expand into functional beverages and reach additional markets by the end of 2022, part of the brand's effort to help consumers avoid plastic bottles.
we believe these priorities will position our company for long-term sustainable growth.
see also "item 1a. risk factors" for further information about risks and uncertainties that the company faces.
our operations see "item 1. business" for information on our divisions and a description of our distribution network, ingredients and other supplies, brands and intellectual property rights, seasonality, customers, competition and human capital. in addition, see note 1 to our consolidated financial statements for financial information about our divisions and geographic areas.
other relationships certain members of our board of directors also serve on the boards of certain vendors and customers. these board members do not participate in our vendor selection and negotiations nor in our customer negotiations. our transactions with these vendors and customers are in the normal course of business and are consistent with terms negotiated with other vendors and customers. in addition, certain of our employees serve on the boards of pepsi bottling ventures llc and other affiliated companies of pepsico and do not receive incremental compensation for such services.
our business risks covid-19
our global operations continue to expose us to risks associated with the covid-19 pandemic, which continues to result in challenging operating environments and has affected almost all of the more than 200 countries and territories in which our products are made, manufactured, distributed or sold. numerous measures have been implemented around the world to try to reduce the spread of the virus, including travel bans and restrictions, quarantines, curfews, restrictions on public gatherings, shelter in place and safer-at-home orders, business shutdowns and closures. these measures have impacted and will continue to impact us, our customers (including foodservice customers), consumers, employees, bottlers, contract manufacturers, distributors, joint venture partners, suppliers and other third parties with whom we do business, which may continue to result in changes in demand for our products, increases in operating costs (whether as a result of changes to our supply chain or increases in employee costs, including expanded benefits and frontline incentives, costs associated with the provision of personal protective equipment and increased sanitation, or otherwise), or adverse impacts to our supply chain through labor shortages, raw table of contents material shortages or reduced availability of air or other commercial transport, port closures or border restrictions, any of which can impact our ability to make, manufacture, distribute and sell our products. in addition, measures that impact our ability to access our offices, plants, warehouses, distribution centers or other facilities, or that impact the ability of our business partners to do the same or the inability of a significant portion of our or our business partners' workforce to work because of illness, absenteeism, quarantine, vaccine mandates, or travel or other governmental restrictions, may continue to impact the availability or productivity of our and their employees, many of whom are not able to perform their job functions remotely.
public concern regarding the risk of contracting covid-19 has impacted and may continue to impact demand from consumers, including due to consumers not leaving their homes or leaving their homes less often than they did prior to the start of the pandemic or otherwise shopping for and consuming food and beverage products in a different manner than they historically have or because some of our consumers have lower discretionary income due to unemployment or reduced or limited work as a result of measures taken in response to the pandemic. even as governmental restrictions are relaxed and economies gradually, partially, or fully reopen in certain of these jurisdictions and markets, the ongoing economic impacts and health concerns associated with the pandemic may continue to affect consumer behavior, spending levels and shopping and consumption preferences. changes in consumer purchasing and consumption patterns may increase demand for our products in one quarter, resulting in decreased demand for our products in subsequent quarters, or in a lower-margin sales channel resulting in potentially reduced profit from sales of our products. we continue to see shifts in product and channel preferences as markets move through varying stages of restrictions and re-opening at different times, including changes in at-home consumption, in immediate consumption and away-from-home channels, such as convenience and gas and foodservice. in addition, we continue to see an increase in demand in the e-commerce and online-to-offline channels and any failure to capitalize on this demand could adversely affect our ability to maintain and grow sales or category share and erode our competitive position.
any reduced demand for our products or change in consumer purchasing and consumption patterns, as well as continued economic uncertainty (including supply chain disruptions and labor shortages), can adversely affect our customers' and business partners' financial condition, which can result in bankruptcy filings and/or an inability to pay for our products, reduced or canceled orders of our products, continued or additional closing of restaurants, stores, entertainment or sports complexes, schools or other venues in which our products are sold, or reduced capacity at any of the foregoing, or our business partners' inability to supply us with ingredients or other items necessary for us to make, manufacture, distribute or sell our products. such adverse changes in our customers' or business partners' financial condition have also resulted and may continue to result in our recording additional charges for our inability to recover or collect any accounts receivable, owned or leased assets, including certain foodservice and vending and other equipment, or prepaid expenses. in addition, continued economic uncertainty associated with the covid-19 pandemic has resulted in volatility in the global capital and credit markets which can impair our ability to access these markets on terms commercially acceptable to us, or at all.
while we have developed and implemented and continue to develop and implement health and safety protocols, business continuity plans and crisis management protocols in an effort to mitigate the negative impact of covid-19 to our employees and our business, the extent of the impact of the pandemic on our business and financial results will continue to depend on numerous evolving factors that we are not able to accurately predict and which will vary by jurisdiction and market, including the duration and scope of the pandemic, the emergence and spread of new variants of the virus, including the omicron and delta variants, the development and availability of effective treatments and vaccines, the speed at which vaccines are administered, the efficacy of vaccines against the virus and evolving strains or variants of the virus, global economic conditions during and after the pandemic, governmental actions that have been table of contents taken, or may be taken in the future, in response to the pandemic and changes in consumer behavior in response to the pandemic, some of which may be more than just temporary.
risks associated with commodities and our supply chain many of the commodities used in the production and transportation of our products are purchased in the open market. the prices we pay for such items are subject to fluctuation, and we manage this risk through the use of fixed-price contracts and purchase orders, pricing agreements and derivative instruments, including swaps and futures. during 2021, we experienced higher than anticipated transportation and commodity costs, which we expect to continue in 2022. a number of external factors, including the covid-19 pandemic, adverse weather conditions, supply chain disruptions (including raw material shortages) and labor shortages, have impacted and may continue to impact transportation and commodity availability and costs. when prices increase, we may or may not pass on such increases to our customers without suffering reduced volume, revenue, margins and operating results.
see note 9 to our consolidated financial statements for further information on how we manage our exposure to commodity prices.
risks associated with climate change certain jurisdictions in which our products are made, manufactured, distributed or sold have either imposed, or are considering imposing, new or increased legal and regulatory requirements to reduce or mitigate the potential effects of climate change, including regulation of greenhouse gas emissions and potential carbon pricing programs. these new or increased legal or regulatory requirements could result in significant increased costs of compliance and additional investments in facilities and equipment. however, we are unable to predict the scope, nature and timing of any new or increased environmental laws and regulations and therefore cannot predict the ultimate impact of such laws and regulations on our business or financial results. we continue to monitor existing and proposed laws and regulations in the jurisdictions in which our products are made, manufactured, distributed and sold and to consider actions we may take to potentially mitigate the unfavorable impact, if any, of such laws or regulations.
risks associated with international operations we are subject to risks in the normal course of business that are inherent to international operations. during the periods presented in this report, certain jurisdictions in which our products are made, manufactured, distributed or sold, including in certain developing and emerging markets, operated in a challenging environment, experiencing unstable economic, political and social conditions, civil unrest, natural disasters, debt and credit issues and currency controls or fluctuations. we continue to monitor the economic, operating and political environment in these markets closely and to identify actions to potentially mitigate any unfavorable impacts on our future results.
imposition of taxes and regulations on our products certain jurisdictions in which our products are made, manufactured, distributed or sold have either imposed, or are considering imposing, new or increased taxes or regulations on the manufacture, distribution or sale of our products or their packaging, ingredients or substances contained in, or attributes of, our products or their packaging, commodities used in the production of our products or their packaging or the recyclability or recoverability of our packaging. these taxes and regulations vary in scope and form. for example, some taxes apply to all beverages, including non-caloric beverages, while others apply only to beverages with a caloric sweetener (e.g., sugar). in addition, covid-19 has resulted in increased regulatory focus on labeling in certain jurisdictions, including in mexico which enacted product labeling requirements and limitations on the marketing of certain of our products as a result of ingredients or substances contained in such products. further, some regulations apply to all products using certain types of packaging (e.g., plastic), while others are designed to increase the sustainability of packaging, table of contents encourage waste reduction and increased recycling rates or facilitate the waste management process or restrict the sale of products in certain packaging.
we sell a wide variety of beverages and convenient foods in more than 200 countries and territories and the profile of the products we sell, the amount of revenue attributable to such products and the type of packaging used vary by jurisdiction. because of this, we cannot predict the scope or form potential taxes, regulations or other limitations on our products or their packaging may take, and therefore cannot predict the impact of such taxes, regulations or limitations on our financial results. in addition, taxes, regulations and limitations may impact us and our competitors differently. we continue to monitor existing and proposed taxes and regulations in the jurisdictions in which our products are made, manufactured, distributed and sold and to consider actions we may take to potentially mitigate the unfavorable impact, if any, of such taxes, regulations or limitations, including advocating alternative measures with respect to the imposition, form and scope of any such taxes, regulations or limitations.
retail landscape our industry continues to be affected by disruption of the retail landscape, including the rapid growth in sales through e-commerce websites and mobile commerce applications, including through subscription services, the integration of physical and digital operations among retailers and the international expansion of hard discounters. we have seen and expect to continue to see a further shift to e-commerce, online-to-offline and other online purchasing by consumers, including as a result of the covid-19 pandemic. we continue to monitor changes in the retail landscape and seek to identify actions we may take to build our global e-commerce and digital capabilities, such as expanding our direct-to-consumer business, and distribute our products effectively through all existing and emerging channels of trade and potentially mitigate any unfavorable impacts on our future results.
see also "item 1a. risk factors," "executive overview" above and "market risks" below for more information about these risks and the actions we have taken to address key challenges.
risk management framework the achievement of our strategic and operating objectives involves taking risks and that those risks may evolve over time. to identify, assess, prioritize, address, manage, monitor and communicate these risks across the company's operations, we leverage an integrated risk management framework. this framework includes the following:
•pepsico's board of directors has oversight responsibility for pepsico's integrated risk management framework. one of the board's primary responsibilities is overseeing and interacting with senior management with respect to key aspects of the company's business, including risk assessment and risk mitigation of the company's top risks. the board receives updates on key risks throughout the year, including risks related to food safety and cybersecurity. during 2021, in addition to covid-19 discussions as part of risk updates to the board and the relevant committees, the board was provided with updates on covid-19's impact to our business, financial condition and operations through memos, teleconferences or other appropriate means of communication. in addition, the board has tasked designated committees of the board with oversight of certain categories of risk management, and the committees report to the board regularly on these matters.
◦the audit committee of the board reviews and assesses the guidelines and policies governing pepsico's risk management and oversight processes, and assists the board's oversight of financial, compliance and employee safety risks facing pepsico;

◦the compensation committee of the board reviews pepsico's employee compensation policies and practices to assess whether such policies and practices could lead to unnecessary risk-taking behavior;
◦the nominating and corporate governance committee assists the board in its oversight of the company's governance structure and other corporate governance matters, including succession planning; and
◦the sustainability, diversity and public policy committee of the board assists the board in its oversight of pepsico's policies, programs and related risks that concern key sustainability (including climate change), diversity, equity and inclusion, and public policy matters.
•the pepsico risk committee (prc), which is comprised of a cross-functional, geographically diverse, senior management group, including pepsico's chairman of the board of directors and chief executive officer, meets regularly to identify, assess, prioritize and address top strategic, financial, operating, compliance, safety, reputational and other risks. the prc is also responsible for reporting progress on our risk mitigation efforts to the board;
•division and key market risk committees, comprised of cross-functional senior management teams, meet regularly to identify, assess, prioritize and address division and country-specific business risks;
•pepsico's risk management office, which manages the overall risk management process, provides ongoing guidance, tools and analytical support to the prc and the division and key country risk committees, identifies and assesses potential risks and facilitates ongoing communication between the parties, as well as with pepsico's board of directors, the audit committee of the board and other committees of the board;
•pepsico's corporate audit department evaluates the ongoing effectiveness of our key internal controls through periodic audit and review procedures; and
•pepsico's compliance & ethics and law departments lead and coordinate our compliance policies and practices.
market risks we are exposed to market risks arising from adverse changes in:
•commodity prices, affecting the cost of our raw materials and energy;
•foreign exchange rates and currency restrictions; and
•interest rates.
in the normal course of business, we manage commodity price, foreign exchange and interest rate risks through a variety of strategies, including productivity initiatives, global purchasing programs and hedging. ongoing productivity initiatives involve the identification and effective implementation of meaningful cost-saving opportunities or efficiencies, including the use of derivatives. our global purchasing programs include fixed-price contracts and purchase orders and pricing agreements. see "item 1a. risk factors" for further discussion of our market risks.
the fair value of our derivatives fluctuates based on market rates and prices. the sensitivity of our derivatives to these market fluctuations is discussed below. see note 9 to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion of these derivatives and our hedging policies. see "our critical accounting policies and estimates" for a discussion of the exposure of our pension and retiree medical plan assets and liabilities to risks related to market fluctuations.
table of contents inflationary, deflationary and recessionary conditions impacting these market risks also impact the demand for and pricing of our products. see "item 1a. risk factors" for further discussion.
commodity prices our commodity derivatives had a total notional value of $1.6 billion as of december 25, 2021 and $1.1 billion as of december 26, 2020. at the end of 2021, the potential change in fair value of commodity derivative instruments, assuming a 10% decrease in the underlying commodity price, would have decreased our net unrealized gains in 2021 by $177 million, which would generally be offset by a reduction in the cost of the underlying commodity purchases.
foreign exchange our operations outside of the united states generated 44% of our consolidated net revenue in 2021, with mexico, russia, canada, china, the united kingdom and south africa, collectively, comprising approximately 23% of our consolidated net revenue in 2021. as a result, we are exposed to foreign exchange risks in the international markets in which our products are made, manufactured, distributed or sold. additionally, we are exposed to foreign exchange risk from net investments in foreign subsidiaries, foreign currency purchases, foreign currency assets and liabilities created in the normal course of business. during 2021, favorable foreign exchange contributed 1 percentage point to net revenue growth, primarily due to appreciation in the mexican peso, canadian dollar and south african rand. currency declines against the u.s. dollar which are not offset could adversely impact our future financial results.
in addition, volatile economic, political and social conditions and civil unrest in certain markets in which our products are made, manufactured, distributed or sold, including in argentina, brazil, china, mexico, the middle east, russia and turkey, and currency controls or fluctuations in certain of these international markets, continue to, and the threat or imposition of new or increased tariffs or sanctions or other impositions in or related to these international markets may, result in challenging operating environments.
our foreign currency derivatives had a total notional value of $2.8 billion as of december 25, 2021 and $1.9 billion as of december 26, 2020. at the end of 2021, we estimate that an unfavorable 10% change in the underlying exchange rates would have decreased our net unrealized gains in 2021 by $278 million, which would be significantly offset by an inverse change in the fair value of the underlying exposure.
the total notional amount of our debt instruments designated as net investment hedges was $2.1 billion as of december 25, 2021 and $2.7 billion as of december 26, 2020.
interest rates our interest rate derivatives had a total notional value of $2.1 billion as of december 25, 2021 and $3.0 billion as of december 26, 2020. assuming year-end 2021 investment levels and variable rate debt, a 1-percentage-point increase in interest rates would have decreased our net interest expense in 2021 by $47 million due to higher cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments levels, as compared with our variable rate debt.
our financial results results of operations - consolidated review volume physical or unit volume is one of the key metrics management uses internally to make operating and strategic decisions, including the preparation of our annual operating plan and the evaluation of our business performance. we believe volume provides additional information to facilitate the comparison of our historical operating performance and underlying trends, and provides additional transparency on how we evaluate our business because it measures demand for our products at the consumer level.
table of contents beverage volume includes volume of concentrate sold to independent bottlers and volume of finished products bearing company-owned or licensed trademarks and allied brand products and joint venture trademarks sold by company-owned bottling operations. beverage volume also includes volume of finished products bearing company-owned or licensed trademarks sold by our noncontrolled affiliates. concentrate volume sold to independent bottlers is reported in concentrate shipments and equivalents (cse), whereas finished beverage product volume is reported in bottler case sales (bcs). both cse and bcs convert all beverage volume to an 8-ounce-case metric. typically, cse and bcs are not equal in any given period due to seasonality, timing of product launches, product mix, bottler inventory practices and other factors. while our net revenue is not entirely based on bcs volume due to the independent bottlers in our supply chain, we believe that bcs is a better measure of the consumption of our beverage products. pbna, latam, europe, amesa and apac, either independently or in conjunction with third parties, make, market, distribute and sell ready-to-drink tea products through a joint venture with unilever (under the lipton brand name), and pbna, either independently or in conjunction with third parties, makes, markets, distributes and sells ready-to-drink coffee products through a joint venture with starbucks. in addition, apac licenses the tropicana brand for use in china on co-branded juice products in connection with a strategic alliance with tingyi.
convenient food volume includes volume sold by our subsidiaries and noncontrolled affiliates of convenient food products bearing company-owned or licensed trademarks. internationally, we measure convenient food product volume in kilograms, while in north america we measure convenient food product volume in pounds. flna makes, markets, distributes and sells sabra refrigerated dips and spreads through a joint venture with strauss group.

see "results of operations - division review" for a tabular presentation and discussion of key drivers of net revenue.
operating profit grew 11% and operating margin declined 0.3 percentage points. operating profit growth was primarily driven by net revenue growth and productivity savings, partially offset by certain operating cost increases, a 14-percentage-point impact of higher commodity costs, and higher advertising and marketing expenses. the operating margin decline primarily reflects higher commodity costs.
lower charges taken as a result of the covid-19 pandemic compared to the prior year contributed 6 percentage points to operating profit growth. additionally, lower acquisition and divestiture-related charges included in "items affecting comparability" contributed 3 percentage points to operating profit growth.
juice transaction in the first quarter of 2022, we sold our tropicana, naked and other select juice brands to pai partners, while retaining a 39% noncontrolling interest in a newly formed joint venture that will operate across north america and europe. these juice businesses delivered approximately $3 billion in net revenue in 2021. in the u.s., pepsico acts as the exclusive distributor for the new joint venture's portfolio of brands for small-format and foodservice customers with chilled direct-store-delivery. see note 13 to our consolidated financial statements for further information.

(a)in 2021, lower charges taken as a result of the covid-19 pandemic contributed 7 percentage points to both net income attributable to pepsico growth and net income attributable to pepsico per common share growth. see note 1 to our consolidated financial statements for further information.
other pension and retiree medical benefits income increased $405 million, primarily reflecting lower settlement charges in 2021, the recognition of fixed income gains on plan assets, the impact of plan changes approved in 2020, as discussed in note 7 to our consolidated financial statements, and the impact of discretionary plan contributions, partially offset by a decrease in the expected rate of return on plan assets.
net interest expense and other increased $735 million, reflecting a charge of $842 million in connection with our cash tender offers. see note 8 to our consolidated financial statements for further information. this impact was partially offset by lower interest rates on average debt balances.
the reported tax rate increased 0.9 percentage points, primarily reflecting the net tax impact of adjustments to uncertain tax positions related to the final assessment from the internal revenue service (irs) audit for the tax years 2014 through 2016.
non-gaap measures certain financial measures contained in this form 10-k adjust for the impact of specified items and are not in accordance with u.s. gaap. we use non-gaap financial measures internally to make operating and strategic decisions, including the preparation of our annual operating plan, evaluation of our overall business performance and as a factor in determining compensation for certain employees. we believe presenting non-gaap financial measures in this form 10-k provides additional information to facilitate comparison of our historical operating results and trends in our underlying operating results and provides additional transparency on how we evaluate our business. we also believe presenting these measures in this form 10-k allows investors to view our performance using the same measures that we use in evaluating our financial and business performance and trends.
we consider quantitative and qualitative factors in assessing whether to adjust for the impact of items that may be significant or that could affect an understanding of our ongoing financial and business performance or trends. examples of items for which we may make adjustments include: amounts related to mark-to-market gains or losses (non-cash); charges related to restructuring plans; costs associated with mergers, acquisitions, divestitures and other structural changes; gains associated with divestitures; pension and retiree medical-related amounts (including all settlement and curtailment gains and losses); charges or table of contents adjustments related to the enactment of new laws, rules or regulations, such as tax law changes; amounts related to the resolution of tax positions; tax benefits related to reorganizations of our operations; debt redemptions, cash tender or exchange offers; asset impairments (non-cash); and remeasurements of net monetary assets. previously, certain immaterial pension and retiree medical-related settlement and curtailment gains and losses were not considered items affecting comparability. pension and retiree medical-related service cost, interest cost, expected return on plan assets, and other net periodic pension costs will continue to be reflected in our core results. see below and "items affecting comparability" for a description of adjustments to our u.s. gaap financial measures in this form 10-k.
non-gaap information should be considered as supplemental in nature and is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the related financial information prepared in accordance with u.s. gaap. in addition, our non-gaap financial measures may not be the same as or comparable to similar non-gaap measures presented by other companies.
the following non-gaap financial measures contained in this form 10-k are discussed below:
cost of sales, gross profit, selling, general and administrative expenses, other pension and retiree medical benefits income, net interest expense and other, provision for income taxes, net income attributable to noncontrolling interests and net income attributable to pepsico, each adjusted for items affecting comparability, operating profit and net income attributable to pepsico per common share - diluted, each adjusted for items affecting comparability, and the corresponding constant currency growth rates these measures exclude the net impact of mark-to-market gains and losses on centrally managed commodity derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting, restructuring and impairment charges related to our 2019 multi-year productivity plan (2019 productivity plan), costs associated with our acquisitions and divestitures, the impact of settlement and curtailment gains and losses related to pension and retiree medical plans, a charge related to cash tender offers and tax expense related to the tax cuts and jobs act (tcj act) (see "items affecting comparability" for a detailed description of each of these items). we also evaluate performance on operating profit and net income attributable to pepsico per common share - diluted, each adjusted for items affecting comparability, on a constant currency basis, which measure our financial results assuming constant foreign currency exchange rates used for translation based on the rates in effect for the comparable prior-year period. in order to compute our constant currency results, we multiply or divide, as appropriate, our current-year u.s. dollar results by the current-year average foreign exchange rates and then multiply or divide, as appropriate, those amounts by the prior-year average foreign exchange rates. we believe these measures provide useful information in evaluating the results of our business because they exclude items that we believe are not indicative of our ongoing performance or that we believe impact comparability with the prior year.
organic revenue growth we define organic revenue growth as a measure that adjusts for the impacts of foreign exchange translation, acquisitions and divestitures, and where applicable, the impact of an additional week of results every five or six years (53rd reporting week), including in our 2022 financial results. adjusting for acquisitions and divestitures reflects mergers and acquisitions activity, including the impact in 2021 of an extra month of net revenue for our acquisitions of pioneer foods in our amesa division and be & cheery in our apac division as we aligned the reporting calendars of these acquisitions with those of our divisions, as well as divestitures and other structural changes, including changes in ownership or control in consolidated subsidiaries and nonconsolidated equity investees. we believe organic revenue growth provides useful information in evaluating the results of our business because it excludes items that we believe are not indicative of ongoing performance or that we believe impact comparability with the prior year.
see "net revenue and organic revenue growth" in "results of operations - division review" for further information.
table of contents free cash flow we define free cash flow as net cash provided by operating activities less capital spending, plus sales of property, plant and equipment. since net capital spending is essential to our product innovation initiatives and maintaining our operational capabilities, we believe that it is a recurring and necessary use of cash. as such, we believe investors should also consider net capital spending when evaluating our cash from operating activities. free cash flow is used by us primarily for acquisitions and financing activities, including debt repayments, dividends and share repurchases. free cash flow is not a measure of cash available for discretionary expenditures since we have certain non-discretionary obligations such as debt service that are not deducted from the measure.
see "free cash flow" in "our liquidity and capital resources" for further information.
return on invested capital (roic) and net roic, excluding items affecting comparability we define roic as net income attributable to pepsico plus interest expense after-tax divided by the sum of quarterly average debt obligations and quarterly average common shareholders' equity. although roic is a common financial metric, numerous methods exist for calculating roic. accordingly, the method used by management to calculate roic may differ from the methods other companies use to calculate their roic.
we believe this metric serves as a measure of how well we use our capital to generate returns. in addition, we use net roic, excluding items affecting comparability, to compare our performance over various reporting periods on a consistent basis because it removes from our operating results the impact of items that we believe are not indicative of our ongoing performance and reflects how management evaluates our operating results and trends. we define net roic, excluding items affecting comparability, as roic, adjusted for quarterly average cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments, after-tax interest income and items affecting comparability. we believe the calculation of roic and net roic, excluding items affecting comparability, provides useful information to investors and is an additional relevant comparison of our performance to consider when evaluating our capital allocation efficiency.

table of contents mark-to-market net impact we centrally manage commodity derivatives on behalf of our divisions. these commodity derivatives include agricultural products, energy and metals. commodity derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment are marked to market each period with the resulting gains and losses recorded in corporate unallocated expenses as either cost of sales or selling, general and administrative expenses, depending on the underlying commodity. these gains and losses are subsequently reflected in division results when the divisions recognize the cost of the underlying commodity in operating profit. therefore, the divisions realize the economic effects of the derivative without experiencing any resulting mark-to-market volatility, which remains in corporate unallocated expenses.

2019 multi-year productivity plan the 2019 productivity plan, publicly announced on february 15, 2019, will leverage new technology and business models to further simplify, harmonize and automate processes; re-engineer our go-to-market and information systems, including deploying the right automation for each market; and simplify our organization and optimize our manufacturing and supply chain footprint. to build on the successful implementation of the 2019 productivity plan to date, we expanded and extended the program through the end of 2026 to take advantage of additional opportunities within the initiatives of the 2019 productivity plan. we now expect to incur pre-tax charges of approximately $3.15 billion, including cash expenditures of approximately $2.4 billion, as compared to our previous estimate of pre-tax charges of approximately $2.5 billion, which included cash expenditures of approximately $1.6 billion. plan to date through december 25, 2021, we have incurred pre-tax charges of $1.0 billion, including cash expenditures of $776 million. in our 2022 financial results, we expect to incur pre-tax charges of approximately $350 million, including cash expenditures of approximately $300 million. these charges will be funded primarily through cash from operations. we expect to incur the majority of the remaining pre-tax charges and cash expenditures in our 2022 and 2023 financial results, with the balance to be incurred through 2026.
see note 3 to our consolidated financial statements for further information related to our 2019 productivity plan. we regularly evaluate productivity initiatives beyond the productivity plan and other initiatives discussed above and in note 3 to our consolidated financial statements.
acquisition and divestiture-related charges acquisition and divestiture-related charges primarily include fair value adjustments to the acquired inventory included in the acquisition-date balance sheets, merger and integration charges and costs associated with divestitures. merger and integration charges include liabilities to support socioeconomic programs in south africa, closing costs, employee-related costs, gains associated with contingent consideration, contract termination costs and other integration costs.
see note 13 to our consolidated financial statements for further information.
pension and retiree medical-related impact pension and retiree medical-related impact primarily includes settlement charges related to lump sum distributions exceeding the total of annual service and interest costs, as well as curtailment gains related to plan changes.
see note 7 to our consolidated financial statements for further information.
table of contents charge related to cash tender offers as a result of the cash tender offers for some of our long-term debt, we recorded a charge primarily representing the tender price paid over the carrying value of the tendered notes and loss on treasury rate locks used to mitigate the interest rate risk on the cash tender offers.
see note 8 to our consolidated financial statements for further information.
tax expense related to the tcj act tax expense related to the tcj act reflects adjustments to the mandatory transition tax liability under the tcj act.

table of contents our liquidity and capital resources we believe that our cash generating capability and financial condition, together with our revolving credit facilities, working capital lines and other available methods of debt financing, such as commercial paper borrowings and long-term debt financing, will be adequate to meet our operating, investing and financing needs, including with respect to our net capital spending plans. our primary sources of liquidity include cash from operations, pre-tax cash proceeds of approximately $3.5 billion from the juice transaction, proceeds obtained from issuances of commercial paper and long-term debt, and cash and cash equivalents. these sources of cash are available to fund cash outflows that have both a short- and long-term component, including debt repayments and related interest payments; payments for acquisitions, including support for socioeconomic programs in south africa related to our acquisition of pioneer foods; operating leases; purchase, marketing, and other contractual commitments, including capital expenditures and the transition tax liability under the tcj act. in addition, these sources of cash fund other cash outflows including anticipated dividend payments and share repurchases. we do not have guarantees or off-balance sheet financing arrangements, including variable interest entities, that we believe could have a material impact on our liquidity. see "item 1a. risk factors," "our business risks" and note 8 to our consolidated financial statements for further information.
our sources and uses of cash were not materially adversely impacted by covid-19 and, to date, we have not identified any material liquidity deficiencies as a result of the covid-19 pandemic. based on the information currently available to us, we do not expect the impact of the covid-19 pandemic to have a material impact on our future liquidity. we will continue to monitor and assess the impact the covid-19 pandemic may have on our business and financial results. see "item 1a. risk factors," "our business risks" and note 1 to our consolidated financial statements for further information related to the impact of the covid-19 pandemic on our business and financial results.
as of december 25, 2021, cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments in our consolidated subsidiaries subject to currency controls or currency exchange restrictions were not material.
the tcj act imposed a one-time mandatory transition tax on undistributed international earnings, including $18.9 billion held in our consolidated subsidiaries outside the united states as of december 30, 2017. as of december 25, 2021, our mandatory transition tax liability was $2.9 billion, which must be paid through 2026 under the provisions of the tcj act; we currently expect to pay approximately $309 million of this liability in 2022. any additional guidance issued by the irs may impact our recorded amounts for this transition tax liability. see note 5 to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion of the tcj act.
as part of our evolving market practices, we work with our suppliers to optimize our terms and conditions, which include the extension of payment terms. our current payment terms with a majority of our suppliers generally range from 60 to 90 days, which we deem to be commercially reasonable. we will continue to monitor economic conditions and market practice working with our suppliers to adjust as necessary. we also maintain voluntary supply chain finance agreements with several participating global financial institutions. under these agreements, our suppliers, at their sole discretion, may elect to sell their accounts receivable with pepsico to these participating global financial institutions. supplier participation in these financing arrangements is voluntary. our suppliers negotiate their financing agreements directly with the respective global financial institutions and we are not a party to these agreements. these financing arrangements allow participating suppliers to leverage pepsico's creditworthiness in establishing credit spreads and associated costs, which generally provides our suppliers with more favorable terms than they would be able to secure on their own. neither pepsico nor any of its subsidiaries provide any guarantees to any third party in connection with these financing arrangements. we have no economic interest in our suppliers' decision to participate in these agreements. our obligations to our suppliers, including amounts due and scheduled payment terms, are not impacted. all table of contents outstanding amounts related to suppliers participating in such financing arrangements are recorded within accounts payable and other current liabilities in our consolidated balance sheet. we were informed by the participating financial institutions that as of december 25, 2021 and december 26, 2020, $1.5 billion and $1.2 billion, respectively, of our accounts payable to suppliers who participate in these financing arrangements are outstanding. these supply chain finance arrangements did not have a material impact on our liquidity or capital resources in the periods presented and we do not expect such arrangements to have a material impact on our liquidity or capital resources for the foreseeable future.
furthermore, our cash provided from operating activities is somewhat impacted by seasonality. working capital needs are impacted by weekly sales, which are generally highest in the third quarter due to seasonal and holiday-related sales patterns and generally lowest in the first quarter. on a continuing basis, we consider various transactions to increase shareholder value and enhance our business results, including acquisitions, divestitures, joint ventures, dividends, share repurchases, productivity and other efficiency initiatives and other structural changes. these transactions may result in future cash proceeds or payments.
the table below summarizes our cash activity:
2021                                                                         2020

net cash used for investing activities                      $(3,269)                    $(11,619)
net cash (used for)/provided by financing activities        $(10,780)                      $3,819
operating activities in 2021, net cash provided by operating activities was $11.6 billion, compared to $10.6 billion in the prior year. the increase in operating cash flow primarily reflects favorable working capital comparisons and operating profit performance, partially offset by higher pre-tax pension and retiree medical plan contributions and higher net cash tax payments in the current year.
investing activities in 2021, net cash used for investing activities was $3.3 billion, primarily reflecting net capital spending of $4.5 billion, partially offset by maturities of short-term investments with maturities greater than three months of $1.1 billion.
in 2020, net cash used for investing activities was $11.6 billion, primarily reflecting net cash paid in connection with our acquisitions of rockstar of $3.85 billion, pioneer foods of $1.2 billion and be & cheery of $0.7 billion, net capital spending of $4.2 billion, as well as purchases of short-term investments with maturities greater than three months of $1.1 billion.
see note 1 to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion of capital spending by division; see note 9 to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion of our investments in debt securities; and see note 13 to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion of our acquisitions.
we regularly review our plans with respect to net capital spending, including in light of the ongoing uncertainty caused by the covid-19 pandemic on our business, and believe that we have sufficient liquidity to meet our net capital spending needs.
financing activities in 2021, net cash used for financing activities was $10.8 billion, primarily reflecting the return of operating cash flow to our shareholders largely through dividend payments of $5.8 billion, cash tender offers/debt redemption of $4.8 billion, payments of long-term debt borrowings of $3.5 billion and table of contents payments of acquisition-related contingent consideration of $0.8 billion, partially offset by proceeds from issuances of long-term debt of $4.1 billion.
in 2020, net cash provided by financing activities was $3.8 billion, primarily reflecting proceeds from issuances of long-term debt of $13.8 billion, partially offset by the return of operating cash flow to our shareholders through dividend payments and share repurchases of $7.5 billion, payments of long-term debt borrowings of $1.8 billion and debt redemptions of $1.1 billion.
see note 8 to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion of debt obligations.
we annually review our capital structure with our board of directors, including our dividend policy and share repurchase activity. on february 13, 2018, we announced the 2018 share repurchase program providing for the repurchase of up to $15.0 billion of pepsico common stock which commenced on july 1, 2018 and expired on june 30, 2021. on february 10, 2022, we announced the 2022 share repurchase program. see "item 5. market for registrant's common equity, related stockholder matters and issuer purchases of equity securities" for further information. in addition, on february 10, 2022, we announced a 7% increase in our annualized dividend to $4.60 per share from $4.30 per share, effective with the dividend expected to be paid in june 2022. we expect to return a total of approximately $7.7 billion to shareholders in 2022, comprising dividends of approximately $6.2 billion and share repurchases of approximately $1.5 billion.

we use free cash flow primarily for acquisitions and financing activities, including debt repayments, dividends and share repurchases. we expect to continue to return free cash flow to our shareholders primarily through dividends and share repurchases while maintaining tier 1 commercial paper access, which we believe will facilitate appropriate financial flexibility and ready access to global capital and credit markets at favorable interest rates. however, see "item 1a. risk factors" and "our business risks" for certain factors that may impact our credit ratings or our operating cash flows.
any downgrade of our credit ratings by a credit rating agency, especially any downgrade to below investment grade, whether or not as a result of our actions or factors which are beyond our control, could increase our future borrowing costs and impair our ability to access capital and credit markets on terms commercially acceptable to us, or at all. in addition, any downgrade of our current short-term credit ratings could impair our ability to access the commercial paper market with the same flexibility that we have experienced historically, and therefore require us to rely more heavily on more expensive types of debt financing. see "item 1a. risk factors," "our business risks" and note 8 to our consolidated financial statements for further information.

our critical accounting policies and estimates an appreciation of our critical accounting policies and estimates is necessary to understand our financial results. these policies may require management to make difficult and subjective judgments regarding uncertainties, including those related to the covid-19 pandemic, and as a result, such estimates may significantly impact our financial results. the precision of these estimates and the likelihood of future changes depend on a number of underlying variables and a range of possible outcomes. we applied our critical accounting policies and estimation methods consistently in all material respects and for all periods presented. we have discussed our critical accounting policies and estimates with our audit committee.
our critical accounting policies and estimates are:
•revenue recognition;
•goodwill and other intangible assets;
•income tax expense and accruals; and
•pension and retiree medical plans.
revenue recognition we recognize revenue when our performance obligation is satisfied. our primary performance obligation (the distribution and sales of beverage and convenient food products) is satisfied upon the shipment or delivery of products to our customers, which is also when control is transferred. the transfer of control of products to our customers is typically based on written sales terms that do not allow for a right of return. however, our policy for dsd, including certain chilled products, is to remove and replace damaged and out-of-date products from store shelves to ensure that consumers receive the product quality and freshness they expect. similarly, our policy for certain warehouse-distributed products is to replace damaged and out-of-date products. as a result, we record reserves, based on estimates, for anticipated damaged and out-of-date products.
our products are sold for cash or on credit terms. our credit terms, which are established in accordance with local and industry practices, typically require payment within 30 days of delivery in the united states, and generally within 30 to 90 days internationally, and may allow discounts for early payment.
we estimate and reserve for our expected credit loss exposure based on our experience with past due accounts and collectibility, write-off history, the aging of accounts receivable, our analysis of customer data, and forward-looking information (including the expected impact of the global economic uncertainty table of contents related to the covid-19 pandemic), leveraging estimates of creditworthiness and projections of default and recovery rates for certain of our customers.
our policy is to provide customers with product when needed. in fact, our commitment to freshness and product dating serves to regulate the quantity of product shipped or delivered. in addition, dsd products are placed on the shelf by our employees with customer shelf space and storerooms limiting the quantity of product. for product delivered through other distribution networks, we monitor customer inventory levels.
as discussed in "our customers" in "item 1. business," we offer sales incentives and discounts through various programs to customers and consumers. total marketplace spending includes sales incentives, discounts, advertising and other marketing activities. sales incentives and discounts are primarily accounted for as a reduction of revenue and include payments to customers for performing activities on our behalf, such as payments for in-store displays, payments to gain distribution of new products, payments for shelf space and discounts to promote lower retail prices. sales incentives and discounts also include support provided to our independent bottlers through funding of advertising and other marketing activities.
a number of our sales incentives, such as bottler funding to independent bottlers and customer volume rebates, are based on annual targets, and accruals are established during the year, as products are delivered, for the expected payout, which may occur after year end once reconciled and settled. these accruals are based on contract terms and our historical experience with similar programs and require management judgment with respect to estimating customer and consumer participation and performance levels. differences between estimated expense and actual incentive costs are normally insignificant and are recognized in earnings in the period such differences are determined. in addition, certain advertising and marketing costs are also based on annual targets and recognized during the year as incurred.
see note 2 to our consolidated financial statements for further information on our revenue recognition and related policies, including total marketplace spending.
goodwill and other intangible assets we sell products under a number of brand names, many of which were developed by us. brand development costs are expensed as incurred. we also purchase brands and other intangible assets in acquisitions. in a business combination, the consideration is first assigned to identifiable assets and liabilities, including brands and other intangible assets, based on estimated fair values, with any excess recorded as goodwill. determining fair value requires significant estimates and assumptions, including those related to the covid-19 pandemic, based on an evaluation of a number of factors, such as marketplace participants, product life cycles, market share, consumer awareness, brand history and future expansion expectations, amount and timing of future cash flows and the discount rate applied to the cash flows.
we believe that a brand has an indefinite life if it has a history of strong revenue and cash flow performance and we have the intent and ability to support the brand with marketplace spending for the foreseeable future. if these indefinite-lived brand criteria are not met, brands are amortized over their expected useful lives, which generally range from 20 to 40 years. determining the expected life of a brand requires management judgment and is based on an evaluation of a number of factors, including market share, consumer awareness, brand history, future expansion expectations and regulatory restrictions, as well as the macroeconomic environment of the countries in which the brand is sold.
in connection with previous acquisitions, we reacquired certain franchise rights which provided the exclusive and perpetual rights to manufacture and/or distribute beverages for sale in specified territories. in determining the useful life of these franchise rights, many factors were considered, including the pre-
table of contents existing perpetual bottling arrangements, the indefinite period expected for these franchise rights to contribute to our future cash flows, as well as the lack of any factors that would limit the useful life of these franchise rights to us, including legal, regulatory, contractual, competitive, economic or other factors. therefore, certain of these franchise rights are considered as indefinite-lived. franchise rights that are not considered indefinite-lived are amortized over the remaining contractual period of the contract in which the right was granted.
indefinite-lived intangible assets and goodwill are not amortized and, as a result, are assessed for impairment at least annually, using either a qualitative or quantitative approach. we perform this annual assessment during our third quarter, or more frequently if circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. where we use the qualitative assessment, first we determine if, based on qualitative factors, it is more likely than not that an impairment exists. factors considered include macroeconomic (including those related to the covid-19 pandemic), industry and competitive conditions, legal and regulatory environment, historical financial performance and significant changes in the brand or reporting unit. if the qualitative assessment indicates that it is more likely than not that an impairment exists, then a quantitative assessment is performed.
in the quantitative assessment for indefinite-lived intangible assets and goodwill, an assessment is performed to determine the fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible asset and the reporting unit, respectively. estimated fair value is determined using discounted cash flows and requires an analysis of several estimates including future cash flows or income consistent with management's strategic business plans, annual sales growth rates, perpetuity growth assumptions and the selection of assumptions underlying a discount rate (weighted-average cost of capital) based on market data available at the time. significant management judgment is necessary to estimate the impact of competitive operating, macroeconomic and other factors (including those related to the covid-19 pandemic) to estimate future levels of sales, operating profit or cash flows. all assumptions used in our impairment evaluations for indefinite-lived intangible assets and goodwill, such as forecasted growth rates (including perpetuity growth assumptions) and weighted-average cost of capital, are based on the best available market information and are consistent with our internal forecasts and operating plans. a deterioration in these assumptions could adversely impact our results. these assumptions could be adversely impacted by certain of the risks described in "item 1a. risk factors" and "our business risks."
amortizable intangible assets are only evaluated for impairment upon a significant change in the operating or macroeconomic environment. if an evaluation of the undiscounted future cash flows indicates impairment, the asset is written down to its estimated fair value, which is based on its discounted future cash flows.
see note 2 and note 4 to our consolidated financial statements for further information.
income tax expense and accruals our annual tax rate is based on our income, statutory tax rates and tax structure and transactions, including transfer pricing arrangements, available to us in the various jurisdictions in which we operate. significant judgment is required in determining our annual tax rate and in evaluating our tax positions. we establish reserves when, despite our belief that our tax return positions are fully supportable, we believe that certain positions are subject to challenge and that we likely will not succeed. we adjust these reserves, as well as the related interest, in light of changing facts and circumstances, such as the progress of a tax audit, new tax laws, relevant court cases or tax authority settlements. see "item 1a. risk factors" for further discussion.
an estimated annual effective tax rate is applied to our quarterly operating results. in the event there is a significant or unusual item recognized in our quarterly operating results, the tax attributable to that item is table of contents separately calculated and recorded at the same time as that item. we consider the tax adjustments from the resolution of prior-year tax matters to be among such items.
tax law requires items to be included in our tax returns at different times than the items are reflected in our consolidated financial statements. as a result, our annual tax rate reflected in our consolidated financial statements is different than that reported in our tax returns (our cash tax rate). some of these differences are permanent, such as expenses that are not deductible in our tax return, and some differences reverse over time, such as depreciation expense. these temporary differences create deferred tax assets and liabilities. deferred tax assets generally represent items that can be used as a tax deduction or credit in our tax returns in future years for which we have already recorded the tax benefit on our consolidated financial statements. we establish valuation allowances for our deferred tax assets if, based on the available evidence, it is not more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will be realized. deferred tax liabilities generally represent tax expense recognized in our consolidated financial statements for which payment has been deferred, or expense for which we have already taken a deduction in our tax return but have not yet recognized as expense in our consolidated financial statements.
in 2021, our annual tax rate was 21.8% compared to 20.9% in 2020. see "other consolidated results" for further information.
see note 5 to our consolidated financial statements for further information.
pension and retiree medical plans our pension plans cover certain employees in the united states and certain international employees. benefits are determined based on either years of service or a combination of years of service and earnings. certain u.s. and canada retirees are also eligible for medical and life insurance benefits (retiree medical) if they meet age and service requirements. generally, our share of retiree medical costs is capped at specified dollar amounts, which vary based upon years of service, with retirees contributing the remainder of the cost. in addition, we have been phasing out certain subsidies of retiree medical benefits.
see "items affecting comparability" and note 7 to our consolidated financial statements for information about changes and settlements within our pension plans.
our assumptions the determination of pension and retiree medical expenses and obligations requires the use of assumptions to estimate the amount of benefits that employees earn while working, as well as the present value of those benefits. annual pension and retiree medical expense amounts are principally based on four components: (1) the value of benefits earned by employees for working during the year (service cost), (2) the increase in the projected benefit obligation due to the passage of time (interest cost), and (3) other gains and losses as discussed in note 7 to our consolidated financial statements, reduced by (4) the expected return on assets for our funded plans.
significant assumptions used to measure our annual pension and retiree medical expenses include:
•certain employee-related demographic factors, such as turnover, retirement age and mortality;
•the expected rate of return on assets in our funded plans;
•the spot rates along the yield curve used to determine service and interest costs and the present value of liabilities;
•for pension expense, the rate of salary increases for plans where benefits are based on earnings; and
•for retiree medical expense, health care cost trend rates.
table of contents certain assumptions reflect our historical experience and management's best judgment regarding future expectations. all actuarial assumptions are reviewed annually, except in the case of an interim remeasurement due to a significant event such as a curtailment or settlement. due to the significant management judgment involved, these assumptions could have a material impact on the measurement of our pension and retiree medical expenses and obligations.
at each measurement date, the discount rates are based on interest rates for high-quality, long-term corporate debt securities with maturities comparable to those of our liabilities. our u.s. obligation and pension and retiree medical expense is based on the discount rates determined using the mercer above mean curve. this curve includes bonds that closely match the timing and amount of our expected benefit payments and reflects the portfolio of investments we would consider to settle our liabilities.
see note 7 to our consolidated financial statements for information about the expected rate of return on plan assets and our plans' investment strategy. although we review our expected long-term rates of return on an annual basis, our asset returns in a given year do not significantly influence our evaluation of long-term rates of return.
the health care trend rate used to determine our retiree medical plans' obligation and expense is reviewed annually. our review is based on our claims experience, information provided by our health plans and actuaries, and our knowledge of the health care industry. our review of the trend rate considers factors such as demographics, plan design, new medical technologies and changes in medical carriers.
weighted-average assumptions for pension and retiree medical expense are as follows:
2022                                                                 2021               2020
pension service cost discount rate                     3.1   %            2.6   %            3.4   %
interest cost discount rate                    2.4   %            1.9   %            2.8   %
expected rate of return on plan assets         6.1   %            6.2   %            6.6   %
expected rate of salary increases              3.1   %            3.1   %            3.2   %
retiree medical service cost discount rate                     2.8   %            2.3   %            3.2   %
interest cost discount rate                    2.1   %            1.6   %            2.6   %
expected rate of return on plan assets         5.7   %            5.4   %            5.8   %
current health care cost trend rate            5.8   %            5.5   %            5.6   %
based on our assumptions, we expect our total pension and retiree medical expense to decrease in 2022 primarily reflecting plan changes and related impacts, and higher discount rates.
sensitivity of assumptions a decrease in each of the collective discount rates or in the expected rate of return assumptions would increase expense for our benefit plans. a 25-basis-point decrease in each of the above discount rates and expected rate of return assumptions would individually increase 2022 pre-tax pension and retiree medical expense as follows:
assumption                                                     amount discount rates used in the calculation of expense            $37
expected rate of return                                      $49
table of contents funding we make contributions to pension trusts that provide plan benefits for certain pension plans. these contributions are made in accordance with applicable tax regulations that provide for current tax deductions for our contributions and taxation to the employee only upon receipt of plan benefits. generally, we do not fund our pension plans when our contributions would not be currently tax deductible. as our retiree medical plans are not subject to regulatory funding requirements, we generally fund these plans on a pay-as-you-go basis, although we periodically review available options to make additional contributions toward these benefits.
we made discretionary contributions to our u.s. qualified defined benefit plans of $75 million in january 2022 and expect to make an additional $75 million contribution in the third quarter of 2022.
our pension and retiree medical plan contributions are subject to change as a result of many factors, such as changes in interest rates, deviations between actual and expected asset returns and changes in tax or other benefit laws. we continue to monitor the impact of the covid-19 pandemic and related global economic conditions and uncertainty on the net unfunded status of our pension and retiree medical plans. we regularly evaluate different opportunities to reduce risk and volatility associated with our pension and retiree medical plans. see note 7 to our consolidated financial statements for our past and expected contributions and estimated future benefit payments.

see accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements.
table of contents notes to consolidated financial statements note 1 - basis of presentation and our divisions basis of presentation the accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with u.s. gaap and include the consolidated accounts of pepsico, inc. and the affiliates that we control. in addition, we include our share of the results of certain other affiliates using the equity method based on our economic ownership interest, our ability to exercise significant influence over the operating or financial decisions of these affiliates or our ability to direct their economic resources. we do not control these other affiliates, as our ownership in these other affiliates is generally 50% or less. intercompany balances and transactions are eliminated. as a result of exchange restrictions and other operating restrictions, we do not have control over our venezuelan subsidiaries. as such, our venezuelan subsidiaries are not included within our consolidated financial results for any period presented.
raw materials, direct labor and plant overhead, as well as purchasing and receiving costs, costs directly related to production planning, inspection costs and raw materials handling facilities, are included in cost of sales. the costs of moving, storing and delivering finished product, including merchandising activities, are included in selling, general and administrative expenses.
the preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, expenses and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. estimates are used in determining, among other items, sales incentives accruals, tax reserves, share-based compensation, pension and retiree medical accruals, amounts and useful lives for intangible assets and future cash flows associated with impairment testing for indefinite-lived intangible assets, goodwill and other long-lived assets. we evaluate our estimates on an ongoing basis using our historical experience, as well as other factors we believe appropriate under the circumstances, such as current economic conditions, and adjust or revise our estimates as circumstances change. additionally, the business and economic uncertainty resulting from the covid-19 pandemic has made such estimates and assumptions more difficult to calculate. as future events and their effect cannot be determined with precision, actual results could differ significantly from those estimates.
our fiscal year ends on the last saturday of each december, resulting in a 53rd reporting week every five or six years, including in our 2022 financial results. while our north america results are reported on a weekly calendar basis, substantially all of our international operations reported on a monthly calendar basis prior to the fourth quarter of 2021, and beginning in the fourth quarter of 2021, all of our international operations report on a monthly calendar basis. this change did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. the following chart details our quarterly reporting schedule for the three years presented:

table of contents our divisions we are organized into seven reportable segments (also referred to as divisions), as follows:
1)flna, which includes our branded convenient food businesses in the united states and canada;
2)qfna, which includes our branded convenient food businesses, such as cereal, rice, pasta and other branded food, in the united states and canada;
3)pbna, which includes our beverage businesses in the united states and canada;
4)latam, which includes all of our beverage and convenient food businesses in latin america;
5)europe, which includes all of our beverage and convenient food businesses in europe;
6)amesa, which includes all of our beverage and convenient food businesses in africa, the middle east and south asia; and
7)apac, which includes all of our beverage and convenient food businesses in asia pacific, australia and new zealand, and china region.
through our operations, authorized bottlers, contract manufacturers and other third parties, we make, market, distribute and sell a wide variety of beverages and convenient foods, serving customers and consumers in more than 200 countries and territories with our largest operations in the united states, mexico, russia, canada, china, the united kingdom and south africa.
the accounting policies for the divisions are the same as those described in note 2, except for the following allocation methodologies:
•share-based compensation expense;
•pension and retiree medical expense; and
•derivatives.
share-based compensation expense our divisions are held accountable for share-based compensation expense and, therefore, this expense is allocated to our divisions as an incremental employee compensation cost.
the allocation of share-based compensation expense of each division is as follows:
2021                                                           2020               2019

corporate unallocated expenses            41   %             38   %             37   %
the expense allocated to our divisions excludes any impact of changes in our assumptions during the year which reflect market conditions over which division management has no control. therefore, any variances between allocated expense and our actual expense are recognized in corporate unallocated expenses.
pension and retiree medical expense pension and retiree medical service costs measured at fixed discount rates are reflected in division results. the variance between the fixed discount rate used to determine the service cost reflected in division results and the discount rate as disclosed in note 7 is reflected in corporate unallocated expenses.
66
table of contents derivatives we centrally manage commodity derivatives on behalf of our divisions. these commodity derivatives include agricultural products, energy and metals. commodity derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment are marked to market each period with the resulting gains and losses recorded in corporate unallocated expenses as either cost of sales or selling, general and administrative expenses, depending on the underlying commodity. these gains and losses are subsequently reflected in division results when the divisions recognize the cost of the underlying commodity in operating profit. therefore, the divisions realize the economic effects of the derivative without experiencing any resulting mark-to-market volatility, which remains in corporate unallocated expenses. these derivatives hedge underlying commodity price risk and were not entered into for trading or speculative purposes.
net revenue and operating profit net revenue and operating profit of each division are as follows:

(a)beverage revenue from company-owned bottlers, which primarily includes our consolidated bottling operations in our pbna and europe segments, is approximately 40% of our consolidated net revenue. generally, our finished goods beverage operations produce higher net revenue, but lower operating margins as compared to concentrate sold to authorized bottling partners for the manufacture of finished goods beverages.
(b)the increase in the approximate percentage of net revenue generated by our convenient food business in 2020 primarily reflects our acquisition of pioneer foods. see note 13 for further information.

note 2 - our significant accounting policies revenue recognition we recognize revenue when our performance obligation is satisfied. our primary performance obligation (the distribution and sales of beverage and convenient food products) is satisfied upon the shipment or delivery of products to our customers, which is also when control is transferred. merchandising activities are performed after a customer obtains control of the product, are accounted for as fulfillment of our performance obligation to ship or deliver product to our customers and are recorded in selling, general and administrative expenses. merchandising activities are immaterial in the context of our contracts. in addition, we exclude from net revenue all sales, use, value-added and certain excise taxes assessed by government authorities on revenue producing transactions.
the transfer of control of products to our customers is typically based on written sales terms that do not allow for a right of return. however, our policy for dsd, including certain chilled products, is to remove and replace damaged and out-of-date products from store shelves to ensure that consumers receive the product quality and freshness they expect. similarly, our policy for certain warehouse-distributed products is to replace damaged and out-of-date products. as a result, we record reserves, based on estimates, for anticipated damaged and out-of-date products.
our products are sold for cash or on credit terms. our credit terms, which are established in accordance with local and industry practices, typically require payment within 30 days of delivery in the united states, and generally within 30 to 90 days internationally, and may allow discounts for early payment.
we estimate and reserve for our expected credit loss exposure based on our experience with past due accounts and collectibility, write-off history, the aging of accounts receivable, our analysis of customer data, and forward-looking information (including the expected impact of the global economic uncertainty related to the covid-19 pandemic), leveraging estimates of creditworthiness and projections of default and recovery rates for certain of our customers.
we are exposed to concentration of credit risk from our major customers, including walmart. we have not experienced credit issues with these customers. in 2021, sales to walmart and its affiliates (including sam's) represented approximately 13% of our consolidated net revenue, including concentrate sales to our independent bottlers, which were used in finished goods sold by them to walmart.
total marketplace spending we offer sales incentives and discounts through various programs to customers and consumers. total marketplace spending includes sales incentives, discounts, advertising and other marketing activities. sales incentives and discounts are primarily accounted for as a reduction of revenue and include payments to customers for performing activities on our behalf, such as payments for in-store displays, payments to gain distribution of new products, payments for shelf space and discounts to promote lower retail prices. sales incentives and discounts also include support provided to our independent bottlers through funding of advertising and other marketing activities.
a number of our sales incentives, such as bottler funding to independent bottlers and customer volume rebates, are based on annual targets, and accruals are established during the year, as products are delivered, for the expected payout, which may occur after year end once reconciled and settled. these accruals are based on contract terms and our historical experience with similar programs and require management judgment with respect to estimating customer and consumer participation and performance table of contents levels. differences between estimated expense and actual incentive costs are normally insignificant and are recognized in earnings in the period such differences are determined. in addition, certain advertising and marketing costs are also based on annual targets and recognized during the year as incurred.
the terms of most of our incentive arrangements do not exceed one year and, therefore, do not require highly uncertain long-term estimates. certain arrangements, such as fountain pouring rights, may extend beyond one year. upfront payments to customers under these arrangements are recognized over the shorter of the economic or contractual life, primarily as a reduction of revenue, and the remaining balances of $262 million as of december 25, 2021 and $299 million as of december 26, 2020 are included in prepaid expenses and other current assets and other assets on our balance sheet.
for interim reporting, our policy is to allocate our forecasted full-year sales incentives for most of our programs to each of our interim reporting periods in the same year that benefits from the programs. the allocation methodology is based on our forecasted sales incentives for the full year and the proportion of each interim period's actual gross revenue or volume, as applicable, to our forecasted annual gross revenue or volume, as applicable. based on our review of the forecasts at each interim period, any changes in estimates and the related allocation of sales incentives are recognized beginning in the interim period that they are identified. in addition, we apply a similar allocation methodology for interim reporting purposes for certain advertising and other marketing activities. our annual consolidated financial statements are not impacted by this interim allocation methodology.
advertising and other marketing activities, reported as selling, general and administrative expenses, totaled $5.1 billion in 2021, $4.6 billion in 2020 and $4.7 billion in 2019, including advertising expenses of $3.5 billion in 2021 and $3.0 billion in both 2020 and 2019. deferred advertising costs are not expensed until the year first used and consist of:
•media and personal service prepayments;
•promotional materials in inventory; and
•production costs of future media advertising.
deferred advertising costs of $53 million and $48 million as of december 25, 2021 and december 26, 2020, respectively, are classified as prepaid expenses and other current assets on our balance sheet.
distribution costs distribution costs, including the costs of shipping and handling activities, which include certain merchandising activities, are reported as selling, general and administrative expenses. shipping and handling expenses were $13.7 billion in 2021, $11.9 billion in 2020 and $10.9 billion in 2019.
software costs we capitalize certain computer software and software development costs incurred in connection with developing or obtaining computer software for internal use when both the preliminary project stage is completed and it is probable that the software will be used as intended. capitalized software costs include (1) external direct costs of materials and services utilized in developing or obtaining computer software, (2) compensation and related benefits for employees who are directly associated with the software projects and (3) interest costs incurred while developing internal-use computer software. capitalized software costs are included in property, plant and equipment on our balance sheet and amortized on a straight-line basis when placed into service over the estimated useful lives of the software, which approximate five to 10 years. software amortization totaled $135 million in 2021, $152 million in 2020 and $166 million in 2019. net capitalized software and development costs were $809 million and $664 million as of december 25, 2021 and december 26, 2020, respectively.
table of contents commitments and contingencies we are subject to various claims and contingencies related to lawsuits, certain taxes and environmental matters, as well as commitments under contractual and other commercial obligations. we recognize liabilities for contingencies and commitments when a loss is probable and estimable.
research and development we engage in a variety of research and development activities and continue to invest to accelerate growth and to drive innovation globally. consumer research is excluded from research and development costs and included in other marketing costs. research and development costs were $752 million, $719 million and $711 million in 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively, and are reported within selling, general and administrative expenses.
goodwill and other intangible assets indefinite-lived intangible assets and goodwill are not amortized and, as a result, are assessed for impairment at least annually, using either a qualitative or quantitative approach. we perform this annual assessment during our third quarter, or more frequently if circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. where we use the qualitative assessment, first we determine if, based on qualitative factors, it is more likely than not that an impairment exists. factors considered include macroeconomic (including those related to the covid-19 pandemic), industry and competitive conditions, legal and regulatory environment, historical financial performance and significant changes in the brand or reporting unit. if the qualitative assessment indicates that it is more likely than not that an impairment exists, then a quantitative assessment is performed.
in the quantitative assessment for indefinite-lived intangible assets and goodwill, an assessment is performed to determine the fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible asset and the reporting unit, respectively. estimated fair value is determined using discounted cash flows and requires an analysis of several estimates including future cash flows or income consistent with management's strategic business plans, annual sales growth rates, perpetuity growth assumptions and the selection of assumptions underlying a discount rate (weighted-average cost of capital) based on market data available at the time. significant management judgment is necessary to estimate the impact of competitive operating, macroeconomic and other factors (including those related to the covid-19 pandemic) to estimate future levels of sales, operating profit or cash flows. all assumptions used in our impairment evaluations for indefinite-lived intangible assets and goodwill, such as forecasted growth rates (including perpetuity growth assumptions) and weighted-average cost of capital, are based on the best available market information and are consistent with our internal forecasts and operating plans. a deterioration in these assumptions could adversely impact our results.
amortizable intangible assets are only evaluated for impairment upon a significant change in the operating or macroeconomic environment. if an evaluation of the undiscounted future cash flows indicates impairment, the asset is written down to its estimated fair value, which is based on its discounted future cash flows.

•property, plant and equipment - note 14. property, plant and equipment is recorded at historical cost. depreciation is recognized on a straight-line basis over an asset's estimated useful life. construction in progress is not depreciated until ready for service.
•translation of financial statements of foreign subsidiaries - financial statements of foreign subsidiaries are translated into u.s. dollars using period-end exchange rates for assets and liabilities and average exchange rates for revenues and expenses. adjustments resulting from translating net assets are reported as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive loss within common shareholders' equity as currency translation adjustment.
recently issued accounting pronouncements - adopted in 2019, the financial accounting standards board (fasb) issued guidance to simplify the accounting for income taxes. the guidance primarily addresses how to (1) recognize a deferred tax liability after we transition to or from the equity method of accounting, (2) evaluate if a step-up in the tax basis of goodwill is related to a business combination or is a separate transaction, (3) recognize all of the effects of a change in tax law in the period of enactment, including adjusting the estimated annual tax rate, and (4) include the amount of tax based on income in the income tax provision and any incremental amount as a tax not based on income for hybrid tax regimes. we adopted the guidance in the first quarter of 2021. the adoption did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements or related disclosures.
note 3 - restructuring and impairment charges
2019 multi-year productivity plan the 2019 productivity plan, publicly announced on february 15, 2019, will leverage new technology and business models to further simplify, harmonize and automate processes; re-engineer our go-to-market and information systems, including deploying the right automation for each market; and simplify our organization and optimize our manufacturing and supply chain footprint. to build on the successful implementation of the 2019 productivity plan to date, we expanded and extended the plan through the end of 2026 to take advantage of additional opportunities within the initiatives described above. we now expect to incur pre-tax charges of approximately $3.15 billion, including cash expenditures of approximately $2.4 billion, as compared to our previous estimate of pre-tax charges of approximately $2.5 billion, which included cash expenditures of approximately $1.6 billion. these pre-tax charges are expected to consist of approximately 55% of severance and other employee-related costs, 10% for asset impairments (all non-cash) resulting from plant closures and related actions and 35% for other costs associated with the implementation of our initiatives.
the total expected plan pre-tax charges are expected to be incurred by division approximately as follows:

(b)the change primarily reflects assets reclassified as held for sale in connection with our juice transaction. see note 13 for further information.
table of contents amortization is recognized on a straight-line basis over an intangible asset's estimated useful life. amortization of intangible assets for each of the next five years, based on existing intangible assets as of december 25, 2021 and using average 2021 foreign exchange rates, is expected to be as follows:
2022                                              2023                2024                2025                2026
five-year projected amortization         $84                 $84                 $83                 $81                 $72
depreciable and amortizable assets are evaluated for impairment upon a significant change in the operating or macroeconomic environment. in these circumstances, if an evaluation of the undiscounted cash flows indicates impairment, the asset is written down to its estimated fair value, which is based on discounted future cash flows. useful lives are periodically evaluated to determine whether events or circumstances have occurred which indicate the need for revision.
indefinite-lived intangible assets we did not recognize any impairment charges for goodwill in each of the years ended december 25, 2021, december 26, 2020 and december 28, 2019. we did not recognize any impairment charges for indefinite-lived intangible assets in the year ended december 25, 2021. in 2020, we recognized a pre-tax impairment charge of $41 million related to a coconut water brand in pbna. we did not recognize any material impairment charges for indefinite-lived intangible assets in the year ended december 28, 2019. as of december 25, 2021, the estimated fair values of our indefinite-lived reacquired and acquired franchise rights recorded at pbna exceeded their carrying values. however, there could be an impairment of the carrying value of pbna's reacquired and acquired franchise rights if future revenues and their contribution to the operating results of pbna's csd business do not achieve our expected future cash flows or if macroeconomic conditions result in a future increase in the weighted-average cost of capital used to estimate fair value.
we have also analyzed the impact of the macroeconomic conditions in russia on the estimated fair value of our indefinite-lived intangible assets in russia and have concluded that there are no impairments for the year ended december 25, 2021. the estimated fair value of indefinite-lived intangible assets is dependent on macroeconomic conditions (including a resulting increase in the weighted-average cost of capital used to estimate fair value), future revenues and their contributions to operating results and expected future cash flows (including perpetuity growth assumptions), and significant changes in the decisions regarding assets that do not perform consistent with our expectations. subsequent to december 25, 2021, we discontinued or repositioned certain juice and dairy brands in russia in our europe segment. as a result, we will recognize pre-tax impairment charges of approximately $0.2 billion in the first quarter of 2022 in selling, general and administrative expenses.

tax cuts and jobs act in 2021, we recorded $190 million ($0.14 per share) of net tax expense related to the tcj act as a result of adjustments related to the final assessment of the 2014 through 2016 irs audit. there were no tax amounts recognized in 2020 related to the tcj act. in 2019, we recognized a net tax benefit totaling $8 million ($0.01 per share) related to the tcj act.
as of december 25, 2021, our mandatory transition tax liability was $2.9 billion, which must be paid through 2026 under the provisions of the tcj act. we reduced our liability through cash payments and application of tax overpayments by $309 million in 2021, $78 million in 2020 and $663 million in 2019. we currently expect to pay approximately $309 million of this liability in 2022.
the tcj act also created a requirement that certain income earned by foreign subsidiaries, known as global intangible low-tax income (gilti), must be included in the gross income of their u.s. shareholder. the fasb allows an accounting policy election of either recognizing deferred taxes for temporary

table of contents differences expected to reverse as gilti in future years or recognizing such taxes as a current-period expense when incurred. we elected to treat the tax effect of gilti as a current-period expense when incurred.
other tax matters in 2021, we received a final assessment from the irs audit for the tax years 2014 through 2016. the assessment included both agreed and unagreed issues. on october 29, 2021, we filed a formal written protest of the assessment and requested an appeals conference. as a result of the analysis of the 2014 through 2016 final assessment, we remeasured all applicable reserves for uncertain tax positions for all years open under the statute of limitations, including any correlating adjustments impacting the mandatory transition tax liability under the tcj act, resulting in a net non-cash tax expense of $112 million in 2021.
on may 19, 2019, a public referendum held in switzerland passed the federal act on tax reform and ahv financing (traf), effective january 1, 2020. the enactment of certain provisions of the traf resulted in adjustments to our deferred taxes. during 2021, no income tax adjustments related to the traf were recorded. during 2020, we recorded a net tax benefit of $72 million related to the adoption of the traf in the swiss canton of bern. during 2019, we recorded a net tax expense of $24 million related to the impact of the traf. while the accounting for the impacts of the traf are deemed to be complete, further adjustments to our financial statements and related disclosures could be made in future quarters, including in connection with final tax return filings.

as of december 25, 2021, the total gross amount of reserves for income taxes, reported in other liabilities, was $1.9 billion. we accrue interest related to reserves for income taxes in our provision for income taxes and any associated penalties are recorded in selling, general and administrative expenses. the gross amount of interest accrued, reported in other liabilities, was $326 million as of december 25, 2021, of which $3 million of tax benefit was recognized in 2021. the gross amount of interest accrued, reported in other liabilities, was $338 million as of december 26, 2020, of which $93 million of tax expense was recognized in 2020.

carryforwards and allowances operating loss carryforwards totaling $30.0 billion as of december 25, 2021 are being carried forward in a number of foreign and state jurisdictions where we are permitted to use tax operating losses from prior periods to reduce future taxable income. these operating losses will expire as follows: $0.3 billion in 2022, $26.8 billion between 2023 and 2041 and $2.9 billion may be carried forward indefinitely. we establish valuation allowances for our deferred tax assets if, based on the available evidence, it is not more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will be realized.
undistributed international earnings as of december 25, 2021, we had approximately $7 billion of undistributed international earnings. we intend to continue to reinvest $7 billion of earnings outside the united states for the foreseeable future and while future distribution of these earnings would not be subject to u.s. federal tax expense, no deferred tax liabilities with respect to items such as certain foreign exchange gains or losses, foreign withholding taxes or state taxes have been recognized. it is not practicable for us to determine the amount of unrecognized tax expense on these reinvested international earnings.
note 6 - share-based compensation our share-based compensation program is designed to attract and retain employees while also aligning employees' interests with the interests of our shareholders. pepsico has granted stock options, rsus, psus and long-term cash awards to employees under the shareholder-approved pepsico, inc. long-term incentive plan (ltip). executives who are awarded long-term incentives based on their performance may generally elect to receive their grant in the form of stock options or rsus, or a combination thereof. executives who elect stock options receive four stock options for every one rsu that would have otherwise been granted. certain executive officers and other senior executives do not have a choice and are granted 66% psus and 34% long-term cash, each of which are subject to pre-established performance targets.
the company may use authorized and unissued shares to meet share requirements resulting from the exercise of stock options and the vesting of rsus and psus.
as of december 25, 2021, 44 million shares were available for future share-based compensation grants under the ltip.

as of december 25, 2021, there was $372 million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to nonvested share-based compensation grants. this unrecognized compensation cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of two years.
method of accounting and our assumptions the fair value of share-based award grants is amortized to expense over the vesting period, primarily three years. awards to employees eligible for retirement prior to the award becoming fully vested are amortized to expense over the period through the date that the employee first becomes eligible to retire and is no longer required to provide service to earn the award. in addition, we use historical data to estimate forfeiture rates and record share-based compensation expense only for those awards that are expected to vest.
we do not backdate, reprice or grant share-based compensation awards retroactively. repricing of awards would require shareholder approval under the ltip.
stock options a stock option permits the holder to purchase shares of pepsico common stock at a specified price. we account for our employee stock options under the fair value method of accounting using a black-scholes valuation model to measure stock option expense at the date of grant. all stock option grants have an exercise price equal to the fair market value of our common stock on the date of grant and generally have a 10-year term.
our weighted-average black-scholes fair value assumptions are as follows:
2021                                                          2020                    2019

the expected life is the period over which our employee groups are expected to hold their options. it is based on our historical experience with similar grants. the risk-free interest rate is based on the expected u.s. treasury rate over the expected life. volatility reflects movements in our stock price over the most recent historical period equivalent to the expected life. dividend yield is estimated over the expected life based on our stated dividend policy and forecasts of net income, share repurchases and stock price.

restricted stock units and performance stock units each rsu represents our obligation to deliver to the holder one share of pepsico common stock when the award vests at the end of the service period. psus are awards pursuant to which a number of shares are delivered to the holder upon vesting at the end of the service period based on pepsico's performance against specified financial performance metrics. the number of shares may be increased to the maximum or reduced to the minimum threshold based on the results of these performance metrics in accordance with the terms established at the time of the award. during the vesting period, rsus and psus accrue dividend equivalents that pay out in cash (without interest) if and when the applicable rsu or psu vests and becomes payable.
the fair value of rsus and psus are measured at the market price of the company's stock on the date of grant.

as of december 25, 2021 and december 26, 2020, there were approximately 299,000 and 287,000 outstanding awards, respectively, consisting primarily of phantom stock units that were granted under the pepsico director deferral program and will be settled in shares of pepsico common stock pursuant to the ltip at the end of the applicable deferral period, not included in the tables above.
table of contents note 7 - pension, retiree medical and savings plans in connection with our juice transaction subsequent to december 25, 2021, we transferred pension and retiree medical obligations of approximately $150 million and related assets to the newly formed joint venture.
in 2021, we adopted a change to the canadian defined benefit plans to freeze pension accruals for salaried participants, effective january 1, 2024, and to close the hourly plan to new non-union employees hired on or after january 1, 2022. after the effective date, all salaried participants will receive an employer contribution to the defined contribution plan based on age and years of service regardless of employee contribution and will have the opportunity to receive employer contributions to match employee contributions up to defined limits. we also adopted a change to the u.k. defined benefit plan to freeze pension accruals for all participants effective march 31, 2022. after the effective date, participants will have the opportunity to receive employer contributions to match employee contributions up to defined limits. pre-tax pension benefits expense will decrease after the effective dates, partially offset by contributions to defined contribution plans.
in 2021, we adopted a change to the u.s. qualified defined benefit plans to transfer certain participants from pepsico employees retirement plan a (plan a) to pepsico employees retirement plan i (plan i), effective january 1, 2022. the benefits offered to the plans' participants were unchanged. there is no material impact to pre-tax pension benefits expense from this transaction.
in 2020, lump sum distributions exceeded the total of annual service and interest cost and triggered a pre-tax settlement charge in plan a of $205 million ($158 million after-tax or $0.11 per share).
in 2020, we adopted an amendment to the u.s. defined benefit pension plans to freeze benefit accruals for salaried participants, effective december 31, 2025. since 2011, salaried new hires are not eligible to participate in the defined benefit plan. after the effective date, all salaried participants will receive an employer contribution to the 401(k) savings plan based on age and years of service regardless of employee contribution and will have the opportunity to receive employer contributions to match employee contributions up to defined limits. as a result of this amendment, pre-tax pension benefits expense decreased $70 million in 2021, primarily impacting corporate unallocated expenses.
in 2020, we approved an amendment to reorganize the u.s. qualified defined benefit pension plans that resulted in the transfer of certain participants from plan a to plan i and to a newly created plan, pepsico employees retirement hourly plan (plan h), effective january 1, 2021. the benefits offered to the plans' participants were unchanged. the reorganization facilitated a more targeted investment strategy and provided additional flexibility in evaluating opportunities to reduce risk and volatility. there was no material impact to pre-tax pension benefits expense as a result of this reorganization.
in 2020, we adopted an amendment, effective january 1, 2021, to enhance the pay credit benefits of certain participants in plan h. as a result of this amendment, pre-tax pension benefits expense increased $45 million in 2021, primarily impacting service cost expense.
in 2019, plan a purchased a group annuity contract whereby a third-party insurance company assumed the obligation to pay and administer future annuity payments for certain retirees. this transaction triggered a pre-tax settlement charge in 2019 of $220 million ($170 million after-tax or $0.12 per share).
also in 2019, certain former employees who had vested benefits in our u.s. defined benefit pension plans were offered the option of receiving a one-time lump sum payment equal to the present value of the participant's pension benefit. this transaction triggered a pre-tax settlement charge in 2019 of $53 million ($41 million after-tax or $0.03 per share). collectively, the group annuity contract and one-time lump sum payments to certain former employees who had vested benefits resulted in settlement charges in 2019 of $273 million ($211 million after-tax or $0.15 per share).
table of contents gains and losses resulting from actual experience differing from our assumptions, including the difference between the actual return on plan assets and the expected return on plan assets, as well as changes in our assumptions, are determined at each measurement date. these differences are recognized as a component of net gain or loss in accumulated other comprehensive loss. if this net accumulated gain or loss exceeds 10% of the greater of the market-related value of plan assets or plan obligations, a portion of the net gain or loss is included in other pension and retiree medical benefits (expense)/income for the following year based upon the average remaining service life for participants in plan a (approximately 9 years), plan h (approximately 11 years) and retiree medical (approximately 9 years), and the remaining life expectancy for participants in plan i (approximately 27 years).
the cost or benefit of plan changes that increase or decrease benefits for prior employee service (prior service cost/(credit)) is included in other pension and retiree medical benefits (expense)/income on a straight-line basis over the average remaining service life for participants in both plan a and plan h, except that prior service cost/(credit) for salaried participants subject to the freeze is amortized on a straight-line basis over the period up to the effective date of the freeze, or the remaining life expectancy for participants in plan i.

the net gain arising in the current year is primarily attributable to the increase in discount rate offset by actual experience differing from demographic assumptions.
the amount we report in operating profit as pension and retiree medical cost is service cost, which is the value of benefits earned by employees for working during the year.

table of contents the amounts we report below operating profit as pension and retiree medical cost consist of the following components:
•interest cost is the accrued interest on the projected benefit obligation due to the passage of time.
•expected return on plan assets is the long-term return we expect to earn on plan investments for our funded plans that will be used to settle future benefit obligations.
•amortization of prior service cost/(credit) represents the recognition in the income statement of benefit changes resulting from plan amendments.
•amortization of net loss/(gain) represents the recognition in the income statement of changes in the amount of plan assets and the projected benefit obligation based on changes in assumptions and actual experience.
•settlement/curtailment loss/(gain) represents the result of actions that effectively eliminate all or a portion of related projected benefit obligations. settlements are triggered when payouts to settle the projected benefit obligation of a plan due to lump sums or other events exceed the annual service and interest cost. settlements are recognized when actions are irrevocable and we are relieved of the primary responsibility and risk for projected benefit obligations. lump sum payouts are generally higher when interest rates are lower. curtailments are recognized when events such as plant closures, the sale of a business, or plan changes result in a significant reduction of future service or benefits. curtailment losses are recognized when an event is probable and estimable, while curtailment gains are recognized when an event has occurred (when the related employees terminate or an amendment is adopted).
•special termination benefits are the additional benefits offered to employees upon departure due to actions such as restructuring.

(a)expected future benefit payments for our retiree medical plans do not reflect any estimated subsidies expected to be received under the 2003 medicare act. subsidies are expected to be approximately $1 million for each of the years from 2022 through 2026 and approximately $4 million in total for 2027 through 2031.
these future benefit payments to beneficiaries include payments from both funded and unfunded plans.

(a)includes $500 million contribution in 2021, $325 million contribution in 2020 and $400 million contribution in 2019 to fund our qualified defined benefit plans in the united states.
we made a discretionary contribution of $75 million to our u.s. qualified defined benefit plans in january 2022 and expect to make an additional $75 million contribution in the third quarter of 2022. in addition, in 2022, we expect to make non-discretionary contributions of approximately $135 million to our u.s. and international pension benefit plans and approximately $55 million for retiree medical benefits.
we continue to monitor the impact of the covid-19 pandemic and related global economic conditions and uncertainty on the net unfunded status of our pension and retiree medical plans. we also regularly evaluate opportunities to reduce risk and volatility associated with our pension and retiree medical plans.
plan assets our pension plan investment strategy includes the use of actively managed accounts and is reviewed periodically in conjunction with plan obligations, an evaluation of market conditions, tolerance for risk and cash requirements for benefit payments. this strategy is also applicable to funds held for the retiree medical plans. our investment objective includes ensuring that funds are available to meet the plans' benefit obligations when they become due. assets contributed to our pension plans are no longer controlled by us, but become the property of our individual pension plans. however, we are indirectly impacted by changes in these plan assets as compared to changes in our projected obligations. our overall investment policy is to prudently invest plan assets in a well-diversified portfolio of equity and high-quality debt securities and real estate to achieve our long-term return expectations. our investment policy also permits the use of derivative instruments, such as futures and forward contracts, to reduce interest rate and foreign currency risks. futures contracts represent commitments to purchase or sell securities at a future date and at a specified price. forward contracts consist of currency forwards.
for 2022 and 2021, our expected long-term rate of return on u.s. plan assets is 6.3% and 6.4%, respectively. our target investment allocations for u.s. plan assets are as follows:
2022                                               2021
fixed income                  56   %             51   %
u.s. equity                   22   %             24   %
international equity          18   %             21   %
real estate                    4   %              4   %
actual investment allocations may vary from our target investment allocations due to prevailing market conditions. we regularly review our actual investment allocations and periodically rebalance our investments.
the expected return on plan assets is based on our investment strategy and our expectations for long-term rates of return by asset class, taking into account volatility and correlation among asset classes and our historical experience. we also review current levels of interest rates and inflation to assess the reasonableness of the long-term rates. we evaluate our expected return assumptions annually to ensure that they are reasonable. to calculate the expected return on plan assets, our market-related value of assets

table of contents for fixed income is the actual fair value. for all other asset categories, such as equity securities, we use a method that recognizes investment gains or losses (the difference between the expected and actual return based on the market-related value of assets) over a five-year period. this has the effect of reducing year-to-year volatility.
plan assets measured at fair value as of year-end 2021 and 2020 are categorized consistently by level 1 (quoted prices in active markets for identical assets), level 2 (significant other observable inputs) and level 3 (significant unobservable inputs) in both years and are as follows:

savings plan certain u.s. employees are eligible to participate in a 401(k) savings plan, which is a voluntary defined contribution plan. the plan is designed to help employees accumulate savings for retirement and we make company matching contributions for certain employees on a portion of employee contributions based on years of service.
certain u.s. salaried employees, who are not eligible to participate in a defined benefit pension plan, are also eligible to receive an employer contribution based on age and years of service regardless of employee contribution.

in 2021, we entered into a new five-year unsecured revolving credit agreement (five-year credit agreement), which expires on may 28, 2026. the five-year credit agreement enables us and our borrowing subsidiaries to borrow up to $3.75 billion in u.s. dollars and/or euros, including a $0.75 billion swing line subfacility for euro-denominated borrowings permitted to be borrowed on a same-day basis, subject to customary terms and conditions. we may request that commitments under this agreement be increased up to $4.5 billion (or the equivalent amount in euros). additionally, we may, once a year, table of contents request renewal of the agreement for an additional one-year period. the five-year credit agreement replaced our $3.75 billion five year credit agreement, dated as of june 3, 2019.
also in 2021, we entered into a new 364-day unsecured revolving credit agreement (364-day credit agreement), which expires on may 27, 2022. the 364-day credit agreement enables us and our borrowing subsidiaries to borrow up to $3.75 billion in u.s. dollars and/or euros, subject to customary terms and conditions. we may request that commitments under this agreement be increased up to $4.5 billion (or the equivalent amount in euros). we may request renewal of this facility for an additional 364-day period or convert any amounts outstanding into a term loan for a period of up to one year, which term loan would mature no later than the anniversary of the then effective termination date. the 364-day credit agreement replaced our $3.75 billion 364-day credit agreement, dated as of june 1, 2020.
funds borrowed under the five-year credit agreement and the 364-day credit agreement may be used for general corporate purposes. subject to certain conditions, we may borrow, prepay and reborrow amounts under these agreements. as of december 25, 2021, there were no outstanding borrowings under the five-year credit agreement or the 364-day credit agreement.

note 9 - financial instruments derivatives and hedging we are exposed to market risks arising from adverse changes in:
•commodity prices, affecting the cost of our raw materials and energy;
•foreign exchange rates and currency restrictions; and
•interest rates.
in the normal course of business, we manage commodity price, foreign exchange and interest rate risks through a variety of strategies, including productivity initiatives, global purchasing programs and hedging. ongoing productivity initiatives involve the identification and effective implementation of meaningful cost-saving opportunities or efficiencies, including the use of derivatives. we do not use derivative instruments for trading or speculative purposes. our global purchasing programs include fixed-price contracts and purchase orders and pricing agreements.
our hedging strategies include the use of derivatives and, in the case of our net investment hedges, debt instruments. certain derivatives are designated as either cash flow or fair value hedges and qualify for hedge accounting treatment, while others do not qualify and are marked to market through earnings. the accounting for qualifying hedges allows changes in a hedging instrument's fair value to offset corresponding changes in the hedged item in the same reporting period that the hedged item impacts earnings. gains or losses on derivatives designated as cash flow hedges are recorded in accumulated other table of contents comprehensive loss and reclassified to our income statement when the hedged transaction affects earnings. if it becomes probable that the hedged transaction will not occur, we immediately recognize the related hedging gains or losses in earnings; such gains or losses reclassified during the year ended december 25, 2021 were not material.
cash flows from derivatives used to manage commodity price, foreign exchange or interest rate risks are classified as operating activities in the cash flow statement. we classify both the earnings and cash flow impact from these derivatives consistent with the underlying hedged item.
credit risk we perform assessments of our counterparty credit risk regularly, including reviewing netting agreements, if any, and a review of credit ratings, credit default swap rates and potential nonperformance of the counterparty. based on our most recent assessment of our counterparty credit risk, we consider this risk to be low. in addition, we enter into derivative contracts with a variety of financial institutions that we believe are creditworthy in order to reduce our concentration of credit risk.
certain of our agreements with our counterparties require us to post full collateral on derivative instruments in a net liability position if our credit rating is at a2 (moody's investors service, inc.) or a (s&p global ratings) and we have been placed on credit watch for possible downgrade or if our credit rating falls below either of these levels. the fair value of all derivative instruments with credit-risk-related contingent features that were in a net liability position as of december 25, 2021 was $247 million. we have posted no collateral under these contracts and no credit-risk-related contingent features were triggered as of december 25, 2021.
commodity prices we are subject to commodity price risk because our ability to recover increased costs through higher pricing may be limited in the competitive environment in which we operate. this risk is managed through the use of fixed-price contracts and purchase orders, pricing agreements and derivative instruments, which primarily include swaps and futures. in addition, risk to our supply of certain raw materials is mitigated through purchases from multiple geographies and suppliers. we use derivatives, with terms of no more than three years, to hedge price fluctuations related to a portion of our anticipated commodity purchases, primarily for agricultural products, energy and metals. derivatives used to hedge commodity price risk that do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment are marked to market each period with the resulting gains and losses recorded in corporate unallocated expenses as either cost of sales or selling, general and administrative expenses, depending on the underlying commodity. these gains and losses are subsequently reflected in division results when the divisions recognize the cost of the underlying commodity in operating profit.
our commodity derivatives had a total notional value of $1.6 billion as of december 25, 2021 and $1.1 billion as of december 26, 2020.
foreign exchange we are exposed to foreign exchange risks in the international markets in which our products are made, manufactured, distributed or sold. additionally, we are exposed to foreign exchange risk from net investments in foreign subsidiaries, foreign currency purchases and foreign currency assets and liabilities created in the normal course of business. we manage this risk through sourcing purchases from local suppliers, negotiating contracts in local currencies with foreign suppliers and through the use of derivatives, primarily forward contracts with terms of no more than two years. exchange rate gains or losses related to foreign currency transactions are recognized as transaction gains or losses on our income statement as incurred. we also use net investment hedges to partially offset the effects of foreign currency on our investments in certain of our foreign subsidiaries.
table of contents our foreign currency derivatives had a total notional value of $2.8 billion as of december 25, 2021 and $1.9 billion as of december 26, 2020. the total notional amount of our debt instruments designated as net investment hedges was $2.1 billion as of december 25, 2021 and $2.7 billion as of december 26, 2020. for foreign currency derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment, gains and losses were offset by changes in the underlying hedged items, resulting in no material net impact on earnings.
interest rates we centrally manage our debt and investment portfolios considering investment opportunities and risks, tax consequences and overall financing strategies. we use various interest rate derivative instruments including, but not limited to, interest rate swaps, cross-currency interest rate swaps, treasury locks and swap locks to manage our overall interest expense and foreign exchange risk. these instruments effectively change the interest rate and currency of specific debt issuances. certain of our fixed rate indebtedness have been swapped to floating rates. the notional amount, interest payment and maturity date of the interest rate and cross-currency interest rate swaps match the principal, interest payment and maturity date of the related debt. our cross-currency interest rate swaps have terms of no more than twelve years. our treasury locks and swap locks are entered into to protect against unfavorable interest rate changes relating to forecasted debt transactions.
our interest rate derivatives had a total notional value of $2.1 billion as of december 25, 2021 and $3.0 billion as of december 26, 2020.
as of december 25, 2021, approximately 2% of total debt was subject to variable rates, compared to approximately 3%, after the impact of the related interest rate derivative instruments, as of december 26, 2020.
held-to-maturity debt securities investments in debt securities that we have the positive intent and ability to hold until maturity are classified as held-to-maturity. highly liquid debt securities with original maturities of three months or less are recorded as cash equivalents. our held-to-maturity debt securities consist of u.s. treasury securities and commercial paper. as of december 25, 2021, we had no investments in u.s. treasury securities. as of december 26, 2020, we had $2.1 billion of investments in u.s. treasury securities with $2.0 billion recorded in cash and cash equivalents and $0.1 billion in short-term investments. as of december 25, 2021, we had $130 million of investments in commercial paper recorded in cash and cash equivalents. as of december 26, 2020, we had $260 million of investments in commercial paper with $75 million recorded in cash and cash equivalents and $185 million in short-term investments. held-to-maturity debt securities are recorded at amortized cost, which approximates fair value, and realized gains or losses are reported in earnings. our investments mature in less than one year. as of december 25, 2021 and december 26, 2020, gross unrecognized gains and losses and the allowance for expected credit losses were not material.

note 12 - leases lessee we determine whether an arrangement is a lease at inception. we have operating leases for plants, warehouses, distribution centers, storage facilities, offices and other facilities, as well as machinery and equipment, including fleet. our leases generally have remaining lease terms of up to 20 years, some of which include options to extend the lease term for up to five years and some of which include options to terminate the lease within one year. we consider these options in determining the lease term used to establish our right-of-use assets and lease liabilities. our lease agreements do not contain any material residual value guarantees or material restrictive covenants.
as most of our leases do not provide an implicit rate, we use our incremental borrowing rate based on the information available at commencement date in determining the present value of lease payments.
we have lease agreements that contain both lease and non-lease components. for real estate leases, we account for lease components together with non-lease components (e.g., common-area maintenance).

table of contents note 13 - acquisitions and divestitures
2020 acquisitions on march 23, 2020, we acquired all of the outstanding shares of pioneer foods, a food and beverage company in south africa with exports to countries across the globe, for 110.00 south african rand per share in cash. the total consideration transferred was approximately $1.2 billion and was funded by two unsecured bridge loan facilities entered into by one of our international consolidated subsidiaries, which were fully repaid in april 2020.
in connection with our acquisition of pioneer foods, we have made certain commitments to the south africa competition commission, including a commitment to provide the equivalent of 8.8 billion south african rand, or approximately $0.5 billion as of the acquisition date, in value for the benefit of our employees, agricultural development, education, developing pioneer foods' operations and enterprise development programs in south africa. included in this commitment is 2.3 billion south african rand, or approximately $0.1 billion, relating to the implementation of an employee ownership plan and an agricultural, entrepreneurship and educational development fund, which is an irrevocable condition of the acquisition. this commitment was recorded in selling, general and administrative expenses primarily in the year ended december 26, 2020 and was primarily settled in the fourth quarter of 2021. the remaining commitment of 6.5 billion south african rand, or approximately $0.4 billion as of the acquisition date, relates to capital expenditures and/or business-related costs which will be incurred and recorded over a five-year period from the acquisition date.

juice transaction in the first quarter of 2022, we sold our tropicana, naked and other select juice brands to pai partners for approximately $3.5 billion in cash and a 39% noncontrolling interest in a newly formed joint venture that will operate across north america and europe. the north america portion of the transaction was completed on january 24, 2022 and the europe portion of the transaction was completed on february 1, 2022. in the u.s., pepsico acts as the exclusive distributor for the new joint venture's portfolio of brands for small-format and foodservice customers with chilled direct-store-delivery. in connection with the sale, we entered into a transition services agreement with pai partners, under which we will provide certain services to the joint venture to help facilitate an orderly transition of the business following the sale. in return for these services, the new joint venture is required to pay certain agreed upon fees to reimburse us for our actual costs without markup. subsequent to the transaction close date, the purchase price will be adjusted for net working capital and net debt amounts as of the transaction close date compared to targeted amounts set forth in the purchase agreement. we expect to record a pre-tax gain of approximately $3 billion in our pbna and europe segments in the first quarter of 2022 as a result of this transaction.
we have reclassified $1.8 billion of assets, primarily accounts receivable, net, and inventories of $0.5 billion, goodwill and other intangible assets of $0.6 billion and property, plant and equipment of

table of contents report of independent registered public accounting firm to the shareholders and board of directors pepsico, inc.:
opinions on the consolidated financial statements and internal control over financial reporting we have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheet of pepsico, inc. and subsidiaries (the company) as of december 25, 2021 and december 26, 2020, the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, cash flows, and equity for each of the fiscal years in the three-year period ended december 25, 2021, and the related notes (collectively, the consolidated financial statements). we also have audited the company's internal control over financial reporting as of december 25, 2021, based on criteria established in internal control - integrated framework (2013) issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission.
in our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the company as of december 25, 2021 and december 26, 2020, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the fiscal years in the three-year period ended december 25, 2021, in conformity with u.s. generally accepted accounting principles. also in our opinion, the company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of december 25, 2021 based on criteria established in internal control - integrated framework (2013) issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission.
basis for opinions the company's management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying management's annual report on internal control over financial reporting. our responsibility is to express an opinion on the company's consolidated financial statements and an opinion on the company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. we are a public accounting firm registered with the public company accounting oversight board (united states) (pcaob) and are required to be independent with respect to the company in accordance with the u.s. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the securities and exchange commission and the pcaob.
we conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the pcaob. those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.
our audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. we believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.
table of contents definition and limitations of internal control over financial reporting a company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. a company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
critical audit matters the critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. the communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.
sales incentive accruals as discussed in note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, the company offers sales incentives and discounts through various programs to customers and consumers. a number of the sales incentives are based on annual targets, resulting in the need to accrue for the expected liability. these incentives are accrued for in the "accounts payable and other current liabilities" line on the balance sheet. these accruals are based on sales incentive agreements, expectations regarding customer and consumer participation and performance levels, and historical experience and trends.
we identified the evaluation of certain of the company's sales incentive accruals as a critical audit matter. subjective and complex auditor judgment is required in evaluating these sales incentive accruals as a result of the timing difference between when the product is delivered and when the incentive is settled. this specifically related to (1) forecasted customer and consumer participation and performance level assumptions underlying the accrual, and (2) the impact of historical experience and trends.
the following are the primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter. we evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of certain internal controls related to the sales incentive process, including controls related to (1) the accrual methodology, (2) assumptions around forecasted customer and consumer participation, (3) performance levels, and (4) monitoring of actual sales incentives incurred compared to estimated sales incentives in respect of historical periods. to evaluate the timing and amount of certain accrued sales incentives we (1) analyzed the accrual by sales incentive type as compared to historical trends to identify specific sales incentives that may require additional testing, (2) recalculated expenses and closing accruals on a sample basis, table of contents based on volumes sold and terms of the sales incentives, (3) assessed the company's ability to accurately estimate its sales incentive accrual by comparing previously established accruals to actual settlements, and (4) tested a sample of settlements or claims that occurred after period end, and compared them to the recorded sales incentive accrual.
carrying value of certain reacquired and acquired franchise rights and certain juice and dairy brands as discussed in notes 2 and 4 to the consolidated financial statements, the company performs impairment testing of its indefinite-lived intangible assets on an annual basis during the third quarter of each fiscal year and whenever events and changes in circumstances indicate that there is a greater than 50% likelihood that the asset is impaired. the carrying value of indefinite-lived intangible assets as of december 25, 2021 was $35.5 billion which represents 38% of total assets, and includes pepsico beverages north america's (pbna) reacquired and acquired franchise rights which had a carrying value of $8.6 billion as of december 25, 2021.
we identified the assessment of the carrying value of pbna's reacquired and acquired franchise rights and certain of europe's juice and dairy brands in russia as a critical audit matter. significant auditor judgment is necessary to assess the impact of competitive operating and macroeconomic factors on future levels of sales, operating profit and cash flows. the impairment analysis of these indefinite-lived intangible assets requires significant auditor judgment to evaluate the company's forecasted revenue and profitability levels, including the expected long-term growth rates and the selection of the discount rates to be applied to the projected cash flows.
the following are the primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter. we evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of certain internal controls related to the indefinite-lived assets impairment process, including controls related to the development of forecasted revenue, profitability levels, and expected long-term growth rates and select the discount rates to be applied to the projected cash flows. we also evaluated the sensitivity of the company's conclusion to changes in assumptions, including the assessment of changes in assumptions from prior periods. to assess the company's ability to accurately forecast, we compared the company's historical forecasted results to actual results. we compared the cash flow projections used in the impairment tests with available external industry data and other internal information. we involved valuation professionals with specialized skills and knowledge who assisted in evaluating (1) the long-term growth rates used in the impairment tests by comparing against economic data and information specific to the respective assets, including projected long-term nominal gross domestic product growth in the respective local countries, and (2) the discount rates used in the impairment tests by comparing them against discount rates that were independently developed using publicly available market data, including that of comparable companies.
unrecognized tax benefits as discussed in note 5 to the consolidated financial statements, the company's global operating model gives rise to income tax obligations in the united states and in certain foreign jurisdictions in which it operates. as of december 25, 2021, the company recorded reserves for unrecognized tax benefits of $1.9 billion. the company establishes reserves if it believes that certain positions taken in its tax returns are subject to challenge and the company likely will not succeed, even though the company believes the tax return position is supportable under the tax law. the company adjusts these reserves, as well as the related interest, in light of new information, such as the progress of a tax examination, new tax law, relevant court rulings or tax authority settlements.
we identified the evaluation of certain of the company's unrecognized tax benefits as a critical audit matter because the application of tax law and interpretation of a tax authority's settlement history is table of contents complex and involves subjective judgment. such judgments impact both the timing and amount of the reserves that are recognized, including judgments about re-measuring liabilities for positions taken in prior years' tax returns in light of new information.
the following are the primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter. we evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of certain internal controls related to the unrecognized tax benefits process, including controls to (1) identify uncertain income tax positions, (2) evaluate the tax law and tax authority's settlement history used to estimate the unrecognized tax benefits, and (3) monitor for new information that may give rise to changes to the existing unrecognized tax benefits, such as progress of a tax examination, new tax law or tax authority settlements. we involved tax and valuation professionals with specialized skills and knowledge, who assisted in assessing the unrecognized tax benefits by (1) evaluating the company's tax structure and transactions, including transfer pricing arrangements, and (2) assessing the company's interpretation of existing tax law as well as new and amended tax laws, tax positions taken, associated external counsel opinions, information from tax examinations, relevant court rulings and tax authority settlements.
